11115,this study evaluated a comprehensive plant water stress indicator that integrates the leaf temperature and the environmental conditions that can provide feedback on the plant response to irrigation scheduling this quantity comprehensive stress indicator csi is based on the reformulation of the leaf energy balance equation specifically csi is the ratio of the temperature difference between a dry leaf i e a leaf with a broken stem and a live leaf on the same tree i e tdry tleaf and the difference between the vapor pressure inside the stomatal cavity at saturation and the vapor pressure of the air at ambient temperature i e es tl e ta the required measurements to compute csi include dry leaf temperature live leaf temperature relative humidity and air temperature at the tree being monitored in this study all measurements were obtained using a sensor suite called the leaf monitor leaf monitors were connected to a wireless mesh network to communicate the data to a website the leaf monitor included two thermal infrared sensors one for the dry leaf and one for the live leaf both of which were housed in the same unit with almost identical environmental conditions due to a diffusing hemispherical dome that enclosed these sensors the csi is a dynamic indicator with a value for every data sample collected for a single indicator representing each day the csi was evaluated in two ways first the csi was integrated with respect to time from 10 a m to 6 p m to obtain the integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi second the csi was averaged from 1 p m to 3 p m to obtain the average comprehensive stress indicator acsi both icsi and acsi were compared to other stress indicators including the existing crop water stress index cwsi and integrated degrees above non stressed idans results show that icsi and acsi are satisfactorily correlated with midday stem water potential swp the icsi and acsi indicators may be more convenient than other stress indicators because they require measurements only at the tree being monitored keywords infrared thermometry deficit irrigation stem water potential crop water stress index integrated degrees above non stressed 1 introduction limited water resources and increasing food demands from a growing population has led farmers to seek improved precision irrigation practices irrigation in california used an average of 60 7 of total water withdrawals or approximately 87 billion liters of water per day in 2010 united states geological survey 2017 california is the top producer in the world of one of the most water thirsty specialty crops almonds california produces 80 of the world s almonds almond board of california 2017 almonds were california s third most valuable agricultural commodity worth 5 16 billion in 2016 california department of food and agriculture 2018 the combination of high value and large water requirements has motivated researchers to develop improved techniques for sustainable irrigation management of almond orchards the emergence of inexpensive sensors and wireless communication systems in the last few decades have made it possible for farmers to implement improved precision irrigation techniques using feedback from real time data about the plant although soil moisture sensors may be an obvious choice for monitoring water availability even several soil moisture sensors at a few different depths cannot provide the total amount of water available to the plant dhillon et al 2014 alternatively monitoring the physiological water status of the plant through leaf temperature sensing can provide an integrated amount of water available to the plant over the whole root zone thermal infrared sensing to measure leaf temperature is one of the most convenient inexpensive and accurate options available on the market for quantifying the physiological water status of the plant jones 2004 when the plant is not under stress the stomata open and transpiration occurs transpiration leads to cooling of the leaf when the plant is under stress the stomata close and no cooling due to transpiration occurs so the leaf temperature is approximately the same as the ambient air temperature hsiao 1973 monitoring the difference between the leaf temperature and the air temperature can be used as an indicator of the physiological water status of the plant idso et al 1977 jackson et al 1977 the leaf temperature can be converted into a stress indicator that can provide feedback on the plant response to irrigation scheduling several stress indicators utilizing leaf temperature have been developed a conventional method for assessing plant water status pws is by computing the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 the empirical form of cwsi requires the difference between the air temperature and the leaf temperature as well as the lower baseline saturated leaf condition and the upper baseline dry leaf condition leaf air temperature differentials as shown in eq 1 1 c w s i t m t a i r t s a t t a i r t d r y t a i r t s a t t a i r where tair is the ambient air temperature tm is the temperature of the leaf being monitored for stress tsat is the temperature of a saturated or non water stressed leaf and tdry is the temperature of a non transpiring or dry leaf another leaf temperature based indicator is degrees above non stressed dans as shown in eq 2 taghvaeian et al 2014 the dans indicator is simpler than the empirical form of cwsi because it only requires temperatures of stressed and non stressed leaves and not air temperature dans is the difference between the temperature of a stressed leaf ts and the temperature of a non stressed leaf tns 2 d a n s t s t n s the dans is a dynamic indicator with a value for each observation measured during the day dans can be integrated over the day to evaluate a daily stress indicator called integrated degrees above non stressed idans as shown in eq 3 dejonge et al 2015 3 i d a n s t 1 0 h r t 2 24 h r t s t n s d t although these daily stress indicators idans and cwsi provide useful insight into the physiological water status of the plant they require the leaf temperature of multiple leaves a saturated leaf and a leaf being monitored for stress to describe the water status of the leaf of being monitored for stress this requirement introduces sources of uncertainty and constrains that might limit adoption first saturating a portion of the field to achieve a lower baseline i e the saturated leaf condition may be inconvenient for farmers farmers may not want to invest in additional plumbing to design a section of their orchard so that it receives considerably more water than any other part of the field second the lower baseline introduces the problem of using a different leaf the saturated leaf to describe the plant water status of another leaf the monitored leaf creating uncertainty all leaves have slightly different characteristics such as the number of stomata per unit area which affects the plant s ability to transpire through that leaf willmer and fricker 1996 stress indicators that require the temperature of different leaves e g the stressed leaf the non stressed leaf do not account for the differences in the number of stomata per unit area of the leaves stress indicators that avoid the leaf temperature from multiple leaves with varying transpiration rates and or incident radiation may be a superior option for quantifying the physiological water status of a particular leaf an example of such as a stress indicator is the time temperature threshold ttt proposed by upchurch et al 1996 the ttt stress indicator is used to trigger irrigation when the leaf temperature exceeds a threshold temperature for a specified time duration this stress indicator has been used to successfully schedule irrigation in field crops o shaughnessy et al 2012 o shaughnessy and evett 2010 peters and evett 2008 nevertheless its ability to successfully schedule irrigation in tree crops with more complex canopies has not been documented while the ttt indicator is simple and does not require monitoring of the saturated or non transpiring baselines it has several drawbacks including requiring prior knowledge of the critical temperature for optimum growth of a given crop and the length of time above the critical temperature that would trigger water stress and it does not account for severity above the threshold dejonge et al 2015 there is still a need to develop water stress indicators that do not require monitoring the leaf temperature of the non stressed baseline it is acceptable to use a different leaf for the upper baseline because we can assume that all stomata are closed on a non transpiring leaf the goal of this study was to develop an alternative plant water stress indicator to cwsi idans and dans that does not require any data from the lower baseline saturated condition but satisfactorily indicates the plant water status in response to irrigation an important aim for this study was to include both the leaf temperature and the environmental conditions i e relative humidity and air temperature for a more comprehensive stress indicator than an indicator that relies on only leaf temperature or leaf air temperature differential specific objectives of this study were to 1 develop comprehensive stress indicators that integrate the leaf temperature and the environmental conditions e g relative humidity and air temperature and avoid the use of the leaf air temperature differential from the non stressed baseline eliminating the uncertainty introduced by using leaves with varying numbers of stomata per unit area in the same indicator 2 compare the stress indicators from 1 to midday stem water potential and other stress indicators including cwsi dans and idans 2 materials and methods 2 1 deriving the comprehensive stress indicator csi in this study a comprehensive stress indicator csi was derived from the steady state energy balance of a leaf the resulting stress indicator csi compares the difference between the temperature of a monitored leaf and a dry leaf and the difference between the vapor pressure in the stomatal cavity at saturation of the monitored leaf and the water vapor pressure in the surrounding air at ambient temperature the derivation of csi will be described in the next sections beginning with the energy balance of a leaf table 1 defines the variables in the derivation of csi in developing csi the leaf was assumed to be at steady state because the leaf temperature does not change very much during small periods of time in this study a data point i e an average of four sampled data points was collected every fifteen minutes during which minimal changes in the leaf temperature were observed the changes in leaf temperature within the fifteen minutes between measurements were typically less than the accuracy of the infrared thermal sensor 0 5 since the leaf temperature differences were small in between measurements the energy balance can be simplified to the steady state equation the steady state leaf energy balance is expressed in eq 4 4 0 r n h λ e s the steady state leaf energy balance can also be expressed in the terms shown in eq 5 dhillon et al 2014 5 0 r n ρ c p r h t l t a ρ c p γ e s t l e t a r a r s the saturation vapor pressure in the stomatal cavity i e es tl and in the air i e es ta can be described by eqs 6 and 7 respectively and the non saturation water vapor pressure in the air can be found by adjusting es ta by the local relative humidity as shown in eq 8 6 e s t l 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t l t l 237 3 7 e s t a 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t a t a 237 3 8 e t a e s t a r h 100 the terms were rearranged to obtain an equation for the temperature difference between the leaf and the air eq 9 9 t l t a r h ρ c p r n r h γ e s t l e t a r a r s in the following two eqs 10 and 11 some of the terms were re defined to simplify the equation 10 α r h ρ c p 11 t l t a α r n r h γ r a e s t l e t a 1 r s r a one physiological condition should be considered in this energy balance equation the upper baseline or dry leaf condition for the case of the dry leaf condition the following two assumptions were made r s r a t l t d since the leaf is dead the cooling effect due to transpiration would be zero resulting in the following reduced version of eq 11 12 t d t a α r n the temperature difference between the dry leaf and the air is directly related to the net heat gain due to radiation the net heat gain due to radiation is approximately the same for both a dry leaf and a live leaf because they are co located within the leaf monitor fig 1 therefore the left side of eq 12 td ta can be substituted for the α r n term in eq 11 this transforms eq 11 to eq 13 13 t l t a t d t a r h γ r a e s t l e t a 1 r s r a eq 13 can be simplified to 14 t l t d β e s t l e t a 1 r s r a where β r h γ r a is a constant rearranging eq 14 leads to the comprehensive stress indicator csi kpa 15 c s i t d t l e s t l e t a β 1 r s r a according to eq 15 the csi is related to the stomatal resistance i e the inverse of the stomatal conductance the csi also depends on the number of stomata per unit area on the leaf 2 2 deriving the integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi in this study the csi was computed every fifteen minutes resulting in a dynamic stress indicator to obtain a daily stress indicator the csi was modified in two ways the first daily stress indicator is the integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi h kpa and was defined as in eq 16 16 i c s i t 1 10 a m t 2 6 p m t d t l e s t l e t a d t the period from 10 a m to 6 p m was selected because that is when leaves photosynthesize the most during the day before 10 a m condensation on the leaf can cause the leaf temperature to be above the air temperature this would result in a negative ta tl which can be confusing to interpret especially when integrating over time 2 3 deriving the average comprehensive stress indicator acsi the second daily stress indicator is the average comprehensive stress indicator acsi kpa and was defined as in eq 17 17 a c s i 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 1 p m t 2 3 p m t d t l e s t l e t a d t the period from 1 p m to 3 p m was selected because that is around solar noon when midday stem water potential measurements are typically obtained 2 4 study area and irrigation treatments sixteen nonpareil almond trees were each monitored with a leaf monitor during the 2017 growing season at nickels soil lab in arbuckle ca usa this study used a 1 6 hectare plot consisting of five rows of nonpareil almond trees bordered on either side by aldrich and butte almond trees which served as pollinators one tree received extra water to simulate the saturated condition a leaf monitor was installed on this well watered tree to obtain a lower baseline to compute cwsi dans and idans the development of csi was part of a larger study on regulated deficit irrigation in almond trees the plot was separated into two management zones delineated by soil and plant characteristics kizer et al 2017 within each management zone there were both grower and regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatments the grower managed irrigation based on watermark sensors and applied the same amount of water to both management zones csi swp and crop evapotranspiration etc were considered in companion to schedule irrigation in the rdi treatments as described by kizer 2018 the rdi treatments were irrigated at percentages of the total etc since the last irrigation etc was calculated as the reference et from a weather station in williams ca multiplied by a crop coefficient 1 05 at the end of the season irrigation was applied approximately once every four days the rdi amount began at 85 etc and 90 etc for management zones 1 and 2 respectively the goal was to maintain the swp within the target range 1 8 to 1 4 mpa during hull split and 1 4 to 1 2 mpa before and after hull split by adjusting the percent etc treatment in response to changes in swp and csi different amounts of irrigation were applied to each management zone in the rdi treatments although the data used in this paper were collected from a regulated deficit irrigation study the purpose of this paper was primarily to assess the sensitivity of csi acsi and icsi to plant water status rather than to implement specific irrigation treatments this paper does not discuss the irrigation management for this study in detail that information can be found in kizer 2018 2 5 leaf temperature and environmental measurements using leaf monitors data for this study were collected with a patented sensor suite called the leaf monitor shown in fig 1 that continuously and proximally measures air temperature shaded leaf temperature relative humidity wind speed and incident radiation in the visible wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum dhillon et al 2014 dhillon 2015 upadhyaya et al 2016 the leaf monitor included an inexpensive thermal infrared ir sensor mlx90614 melexis technologies nv to measure the shaded leaf temperature a second thermal ir sensor of the same model measured the dry leaf temperature in one integrated unit a band gap temperature sensor measured the air temperature and a capacitive type relative humidity sensor measured the relative humidity mod 1018 sht25 embedded adventures london uk incident radiation and wind speed were also measured but not used in calculating the stress indicators a lux sensor measured the incident light in the visible spectrum which is closely related to the photosynthetically active radiation tsl2561 texas advanced optoelectronic solutions plano tx a wind speed sensor measured wind speed above the canopy rev p wind sensor modern device providence ri sixteen leaf monitors were connected to a wireless mesh network to provide continuous real time data the leaf monitors reported samples from all sensors once every fifteen minutes in 2015 and 2016 the leaf monitors and wireless communication system were tested in almonds and grapes to assist in implementing regulated deficit irrigation rdi through the use of cwsi with promising results kizer et al 2017 ko madden et al 2017 rojo et al 2016 in 2017 the leaf monitor was updated to include a second thermal infrared sensor to measure the temperature of a dry leaf i e a leaf with a broken stem under the same environmental conditions as the live leaf in the leaf monitor kizer 2018 in this study the updated leaf monitors kizer 2018 were used to measure the dry leaf temperature and the live leaf temperature under the same environmental condition in each leaf monitor one leaf still attached to the stem i e the live leaf was placed directly underneath the infrared temperature sensor within a wind barrier and underneath a light diffuser dome as shown in fig 1 this leaf was selected from the lowest part of the canopy shaded green and not damaged or blemished kizer 2018 selecting shaded leaves minimized variations in incident radiation additionally dhillon et al 2014 found that multiple linear regression models showed a better relationship between plant water status as a function of stem water potential relative humidity and air temperature and leaf temperature for shaded leaves more than sunlit leaves in almond trees the light diffuser dome helped maintain the leaves as shaded by preventing sun flecks a mixture of direct sun and shade as a result of non uniform solar radiation the purpose of the wind barrier was to prevent direct wind to the leaf without completely sealing the live leaf inside the leaf monitor dhillon 2015 2 6 data processing and calibration the computation of csi involved calibrating and processing the data all thermal infrared sensors were adjusted for an offset in the early morning at night the stomata are closed because no transpiration occurs in the dark without the cooling effect of transpiration the leaf temperature should be approximately the same as the air temperature the average ta tl during the 1 a m to 4 a m period was computed and this number was assumed to be the offset due to instrumentation error in the infrared thermal sensors the average ta tl during this period should be approximately equal to zero so any offset from that was added to all leaf temperature measurements on that calendar day a new leaf temperature offset was computed each day to avoid the accumulation of error in case the thermal ir sensor was unintentionally measuring something other than the leaf at some point in time the relative humidity sensor was also adjusted for an offset during the early morning from 4 to 7 a m a standard relative humidity sensor was selected from the group of leaf monitors and all other relative humidity sensors were calibrated using this standard sensor the average of the difference between the relative humidity of the standard sensor and the sensor to be calibrated during the 4 a m to 7 a m period was added to all relative humidity measurements for the entire growing season therefore all relative humidity sensors were at approximately the same relative humidity in the early morning and any differences in relative humidity would be seen at times of the day of lower relative humidity i e the afternoon when the plant water status would normally differ from tree to tree a moving average technique was applied to the leaf temperature dry leaf temperature air temperature and relative humidity data to smooth the data the sample rate was four data points per hour and five data points were averaged at a time for each iteration of the moving average 2 7 control of data quality leaf temperature data were omitted on days when the monitored leaf was showing signs of senescence i e yellowing or broken stem and was no longer representative of the entire tree on a few occasions the leaf was found to have moved from the view of the thermal ir sensor or to be completely missing from the leaf monitor both cases were most likely due to wind or tension from the connecting branch leaf temperature data from these occasions were omitted because the thermal ir sensor was most likely monitoring the underlying soil prior to june 21 a piece of paper was used as a substitute for a dead leaf for measuring the dry leaf temperature the piece of paper was shown to perform similarly to a dry leaf except when it rained on two precipitation events the piece of paper in each leaf monitor got wet so the data for these days had to be omitted because the paper did not properly simulate a dry leaf which has a waxy surface to prevent saturation from rain 2 8 midday stem water potential measurements midday stem water potential swp measurements were taken at each tree with a pressure chamber two or three times a week during the 2017 growing season one swp measurement was collected per tree and was assumed to represent the plant water status of the entire tree at that time before taking swp measurements a leaf was placed inside an aluminum foil bag for 15 min to ensure equilibrium of the stem water potential and the leaf water potential 3 results 3 1 comprehensive stress indicator a dynamic csi was computed every fifteen minutes for each leaf time series plots of csi were produced for each monitored leaf daily during the growing season in 2017 a software program was developed in matlab that produced daily csi time series plots each plot included daily csi curves from a user defined number of previous days in the same graph an example of a time series plot is shown in fig 2 which features seven consecutive days of csi for one leaf each day is marked in a different color and symbol these time series plots were used to evaluate relative changes in plant water stress from day to day based on eq 15 the value of the dynamic csi should increase when the stomatal conductance increases i e when the stomatal resistance decreases so there is less resistance to transpiration during the 2017 growing season the plant water stress was evaluated daily by observing increases or decreases in the dynamic csi in relation to when irrigation events happened when the csi time series curves consecutively lowered over several days or dramatically dropped in the afternoon hours this indicated that the stomata were closing to prevent further water loss since the csi depends on the number of stomata per unit area on the leaf it would be difficult to establish an amount of increase or decrease in csi to use as a threshold for triggering an irrigation event that works for any almond tree therefore the csi was evaluated separately for each monitored tree because of the dependence of csi on the number of stomata per unit area on the leaf the example csi time series plot in fig 2 show high csi values on july 22 followed by decreasing csi values on july 23 to reach relatively steady low csi values on july 24 25 the declining csi values indicate a period of increasing stress levels due to depleting water availability the csi did not immediately respond to the irrigation applied on july 26 but did increase the next day on july 27 and even more on july 28 3 2 comparing comprehensive stress indicator to degrees above non stressed the csi time series plots were compared to degrees above non stressed dans time series plots as dans increases the temperature difference between the saturated leaf and the monitored leaf increases when dans approaches zero the monitored leaf temperature is closer to the saturated leaf temperature indicating that the monitored leaf is fully transpiring an example of the dans time series plot demonstrates the behavior of the monitored leaf in relation to the saturated leaf fig 3 from july 22 to july 23 the temperature of the monitored leaf departs from the temperature of the saturated leaf until reaching a relatively steady dans on july 24 and july 25 when the monitored leaf was irrigated on july 26 the temperature already started approaching the temperature of the saturated leaf on july 27 and july 28 the dans reached a relatively steady low indicating that the monitored leaf was transpiring but still not as much as the saturated leaf the csi and dans time series plots indicate similar physiological responses of the monitored leaf in response to irrigation events like dans the csi time series plots can provide feedback on the plant s response to irrigation although the dynamic csi is useful a single daily stress indicator would be more comparable to midday stem water potential as well as existing stress indicators cwsi and idans 3 3 correlation of daily stress indicators with stem water potential the stem water potential was compared to icsi acsi idans and cwsi for individual trees using simple linear regression data were analyzed using the statistics and machine learning toolbox in matlab version 2018b out of the sixteen trees that were monitored in this study senescence of the monitored leaf occurred in seven of them the results of only the nine leaves that were consistently monitored for the duration of the study are included in the following results for each subplot in figs 4 through 7 the same leaf was used for all observations of the stress indicators to avoid uncertainty associated with different numbers of stomata per unit area of different leaves stem water potential was measured on a leaf from the same tree as the monitored leaf due to the destruction of the leaf in measuring stem water potential it was impossible to measure stem water potential and the stress indicators on the same leaf table 2 shows statistics for the linear regression models the correlations varied from tree to tree in each of the following figures fig 4 through 7 the bottom middle plot was the saturated tree lm16 since the cwsi and idans of the saturated leaf are 0 by default the subplots involving cwsi and idans of the saturated leaf are not meaningful so they were not included for the comparison of swp with acsi the coefficient of determination ranged from as low as 0 2 to as high as 0 72 fig 4 for swp versus icsi the coefficient of determination fell between 0 26 and 0 7 fig 5 for the swp versus cwsi comparison the coefficient of determination ranged from 0 04 to 0 8 fig 6 for swp versus idans the coefficient of determination ranged from 0 1 to 0 69 fig 7 in most cases the correlation coefficient was low for the same trees for all stress indicators this suggests that a problem with the data is common to all stress indicators evaluated in this study regardless of whether the saturated leaf temperature was factored into the stress indicator the trees that had poor correlation between acsi icsi and swp had small range in data indicating that more data should be collected to understand the relationship between swp and acsi and icsi the high variability in the coefficient of determinations also points to the strong influence of local environmental conditions e g incident radiation soil differences in the trees on tree water status for most trees there was a good agreement between acsi icsi and swp 3 4 comparison of daily stress indicators the icsi acsi cwsi and idans were compared with each other for individual trees acsi and icsi were both strongly correlated with cwsi for most trees one tree lm37 had a low correlation between cwsi and acsi r2 0 13 table 3 and between cwsi and icsi r2 0 14 table 3 all other trees had stronger correlations between cwsi and acsi from 0 53 to 0 86 and between cwsi and icsi from 0 46 to 0 82 in terms of the coefficient of determinations the correlations between idans and acsi and between idans and icsi varied from tree to tree as shown in table 3 the results show that acsi and icsi are generally more closely correlated with cwsi than with idans perhaps because cwsi includes the air temperature whereas idans does not the comprehensive stress indicators icsi and acsi were closely correlated as expected because their derivations are closely related 4 discussion the use of csi time series plots icsi and acsi can be insightful for assessing plant water status of almond trees in relation to irrigation events csi time series plots icsi and acsi can be used as scheduling tools for regulated deficit irrigation these stress indicators can be monitored over several days of increasing stress before applying an irrigation rather than irrigating at regular intervals that may not reflect the physiological tolerances of the plant to soil water deficit csi icsi and acsi may be useful in conjunction with et and swp to implement site specific irrigation as described by kizer 2018 scientific questions involving the influence of leaf characteristics on csi icsi and acsi merit further research 1 how does the number of stomata on the leaf affect csi icsi and acsi 2 do leaf characteristics change under deficit irrigation and how would this affect the behavior of csi icsi and acsi unfortunately the number of stomata on a leaf is not easily quantified in a field setting theoretically under fully transpiring conditions the csi would reach a maximum value however since the csi depends on number of stomata on the leaf per unit area this maximum csi would be different from leaf to leaf discrepancies in leaf characteristics between leaves introduces a problem in the event of leaf senescence leaf changes complicate the interpretation of the csi time series plots fig 2 if a leaf was changed during the period plotted in the time series because the maximum potential csi i e the csi of the fully transpiring condition for that leaf would be different for different days in the period also discrepancies in leaf characteristics from leaf to leaf complexifies generalizability of csi icsi acsi into an absolute threshold value for the purpose of irrigation management however csi icsi and acsi have the advantage of not requiring a measurement of the saturated leaf temperature unlike cwsi and idans the saturated leaf temperature can be difficult to measure in a field setting making cwsi and idans less attractive for assessing plant water status additionally leaf characteristics may change throughout the growing season especially under drought conditions which also may influence the behavior of csi icsi and acsi the leaves may acclimatize to increasing stress under deficit irrigation conditions via osmotic adjustment as suggested by kizer 2018 further research should aim at validating the influence of acclimatization on the relationship between the stem water potential and the different stress indicators understanding how acclimatization of the plant to drought conditions affects the value of csi icsi and acsi could help in developing a method for using the stress indicators in irrigation scheduling although the influence of leaf characteristics on the magnitude of csi icsi and acsi may sound discouraging these stress indicators can still be monitored on a relative basis to evaluate changes in plant water stress in response to irrigations without the need to measure the saturated leaf temperature good relationships between icsi acsi and swp could be valuable in developing a continuously and remotely sensing alternative to the laborious use of the pressure chamber in measuring the plant water status in almond trees without requiring a measurement of the saturated leaf temperature on top of studying the influence of leaf characteristics further research should collect more data covering a wider range of plant water stress and environmental conditions to shed light on the relationships between acsi icsi and swp 5 conclusions a one year study evaluated the use of the dynamic comprehensive stress indicator csi the daily integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi and the daily average comprehensive stress indicator acsi for quantifying plant water status in almond trees csi icsi and acsi have the advantage of not requiring a lower baseline leaf temperature measurement which can be difficult to maintain in a field setting icsi and acsi were compared to existing daily stress indicators cwsi and idans which do require a lower baseline temperature measurement and were found to be correlated with each other icsi and acsi were also found to be correlated with midday stem water potential at similar levels to cwsi and idans low correlations with midday stem water potential were found in the same leaves for all stress indicators and vice versa further research should investigate the cause of low correlations between these stress indicators and swp for certain leaves and not others although the number of stomata per unit area may influence the magnitude of csi icsi and acsi these stress indicators can be used on a relative basis for assessing the plant water stress in response to irrigation events further studies are recommended to obtain a wider range of stress indicator values and environmental conditions to fully understand the relationships between icsi acsi and swp additionally further research should focus on developing methodologies for using csi icsi and acsi in irrigation scheduling declaration of interest none acknowledgments many thanks to erin kizer channing ko madden julie meyers chunxia jiang

11115,this study evaluated a comprehensive plant water stress indicator that integrates the leaf temperature and the environmental conditions that can provide feedback on the plant response to irrigation scheduling this quantity comprehensive stress indicator csi is based on the reformulation of the leaf energy balance equation specifically csi is the ratio of the temperature difference between a dry leaf i e a leaf with a broken stem and a live leaf on the same tree i e tdry tleaf and the difference between the vapor pressure inside the stomatal cavity at saturation and the vapor pressure of the air at ambient temperature i e es tl e ta the required measurements to compute csi include dry leaf temperature live leaf temperature relative humidity and air temperature at the tree being monitored in this study all measurements were obtained using a sensor suite called the leaf monitor leaf monitors were connected to a wireless mesh network to communicate the data to a website the leaf monitor included two thermal infrared sensors one for the dry leaf and one for the live leaf both of which were housed in the same unit with almost identical environmental conditions due to a diffusing hemispherical dome that enclosed these sensors the csi is a dynamic indicator with a value for every data sample collected for a single indicator representing each day the csi was evaluated in two ways first the csi was integrated with respect to time from 10 a m to 6 p m to obtain the integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi second the csi was averaged from 1 p m to 3 p m to obtain the average comprehensive stress indicator acsi both icsi and acsi were compared to other stress indicators including the existing crop water stress index cwsi and integrated degrees above non stressed idans results show that icsi and acsi are satisfactorily correlated with midday stem water potential swp the icsi and acsi indicators may be more convenient than other stress indicators because they require measurements only at the tree being monitored keywords infrared thermometry deficit irrigation stem water potential crop water stress index integrated degrees above non stressed 1 introduction limited water resources and increasing food demands from a growing population has led farmers to seek improved precision irrigation practices irrigation in california used an average of 60 7 of total water withdrawals or approximately 87 billion liters of water per day in 2010 united states geological survey 2017 california is the top producer in the world of one of the most water thirsty specialty crops almonds california produces 80 of the world s almonds almond board of california 2017 almonds were california s third most valuable agricultural commodity worth 5 16 billion in 2016 california department of food and agriculture 2018 the combination of high value and large water requirements has motivated researchers to develop improved techniques for sustainable irrigation management of almond orchards the emergence of inexpensive sensors and wireless communication systems in the last few decades have made it possible for farmers to implement improved precision irrigation techniques using feedback from real time data about the plant although soil moisture sensors may be an obvious choice for monitoring water availability even several soil moisture sensors at a few different depths cannot provide the total amount of water available to the plant dhillon et al 2014 alternatively monitoring the physiological water status of the plant through leaf temperature sensing can provide an integrated amount of water available to the plant over the whole root zone thermal infrared sensing to measure leaf temperature is one of the most convenient inexpensive and accurate options available on the market for quantifying the physiological water status of the plant jones 2004 when the plant is not under stress the stomata open and transpiration occurs transpiration leads to cooling of the leaf when the plant is under stress the stomata close and no cooling due to transpiration occurs so the leaf temperature is approximately the same as the ambient air temperature hsiao 1973 monitoring the difference between the leaf temperature and the air temperature can be used as an indicator of the physiological water status of the plant idso et al 1977 jackson et al 1977 the leaf temperature can be converted into a stress indicator that can provide feedback on the plant response to irrigation scheduling several stress indicators utilizing leaf temperature have been developed a conventional method for assessing plant water status pws is by computing the crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 the empirical form of cwsi requires the difference between the air temperature and the leaf temperature as well as the lower baseline saturated leaf condition and the upper baseline dry leaf condition leaf air temperature differentials as shown in eq 1 1 c w s i t m t a i r t s a t t a i r t d r y t a i r t s a t t a i r where tair is the ambient air temperature tm is the temperature of the leaf being monitored for stress tsat is the temperature of a saturated or non water stressed leaf and tdry is the temperature of a non transpiring or dry leaf another leaf temperature based indicator is degrees above non stressed dans as shown in eq 2 taghvaeian et al 2014 the dans indicator is simpler than the empirical form of cwsi because it only requires temperatures of stressed and non stressed leaves and not air temperature dans is the difference between the temperature of a stressed leaf ts and the temperature of a non stressed leaf tns 2 d a n s t s t n s the dans is a dynamic indicator with a value for each observation measured during the day dans can be integrated over the day to evaluate a daily stress indicator called integrated degrees above non stressed idans as shown in eq 3 dejonge et al 2015 3 i d a n s t 1 0 h r t 2 24 h r t s t n s d t although these daily stress indicators idans and cwsi provide useful insight into the physiological water status of the plant they require the leaf temperature of multiple leaves a saturated leaf and a leaf being monitored for stress to describe the water status of the leaf of being monitored for stress this requirement introduces sources of uncertainty and constrains that might limit adoption first saturating a portion of the field to achieve a lower baseline i e the saturated leaf condition may be inconvenient for farmers farmers may not want to invest in additional plumbing to design a section of their orchard so that it receives considerably more water than any other part of the field second the lower baseline introduces the problem of using a different leaf the saturated leaf to describe the plant water status of another leaf the monitored leaf creating uncertainty all leaves have slightly different characteristics such as the number of stomata per unit area which affects the plant s ability to transpire through that leaf willmer and fricker 1996 stress indicators that require the temperature of different leaves e g the stressed leaf the non stressed leaf do not account for the differences in the number of stomata per unit area of the leaves stress indicators that avoid the leaf temperature from multiple leaves with varying transpiration rates and or incident radiation may be a superior option for quantifying the physiological water status of a particular leaf an example of such as a stress indicator is the time temperature threshold ttt proposed by upchurch et al 1996 the ttt stress indicator is used to trigger irrigation when the leaf temperature exceeds a threshold temperature for a specified time duration this stress indicator has been used to successfully schedule irrigation in field crops o shaughnessy et al 2012 o shaughnessy and evett 2010 peters and evett 2008 nevertheless its ability to successfully schedule irrigation in tree crops with more complex canopies has not been documented while the ttt indicator is simple and does not require monitoring of the saturated or non transpiring baselines it has several drawbacks including requiring prior knowledge of the critical temperature for optimum growth of a given crop and the length of time above the critical temperature that would trigger water stress and it does not account for severity above the threshold dejonge et al 2015 there is still a need to develop water stress indicators that do not require monitoring the leaf temperature of the non stressed baseline it is acceptable to use a different leaf for the upper baseline because we can assume that all stomata are closed on a non transpiring leaf the goal of this study was to develop an alternative plant water stress indicator to cwsi idans and dans that does not require any data from the lower baseline saturated condition but satisfactorily indicates the plant water status in response to irrigation an important aim for this study was to include both the leaf temperature and the environmental conditions i e relative humidity and air temperature for a more comprehensive stress indicator than an indicator that relies on only leaf temperature or leaf air temperature differential specific objectives of this study were to 1 develop comprehensive stress indicators that integrate the leaf temperature and the environmental conditions e g relative humidity and air temperature and avoid the use of the leaf air temperature differential from the non stressed baseline eliminating the uncertainty introduced by using leaves with varying numbers of stomata per unit area in the same indicator 2 compare the stress indicators from 1 to midday stem water potential and other stress indicators including cwsi dans and idans 2 materials and methods 2 1 deriving the comprehensive stress indicator csi in this study a comprehensive stress indicator csi was derived from the steady state energy balance of a leaf the resulting stress indicator csi compares the difference between the temperature of a monitored leaf and a dry leaf and the difference between the vapor pressure in the stomatal cavity at saturation of the monitored leaf and the water vapor pressure in the surrounding air at ambient temperature the derivation of csi will be described in the next sections beginning with the energy balance of a leaf table 1 defines the variables in the derivation of csi in developing csi the leaf was assumed to be at steady state because the leaf temperature does not change very much during small periods of time in this study a data point i e an average of four sampled data points was collected every fifteen minutes during which minimal changes in the leaf temperature were observed the changes in leaf temperature within the fifteen minutes between measurements were typically less than the accuracy of the infrared thermal sensor 0 5 since the leaf temperature differences were small in between measurements the energy balance can be simplified to the steady state equation the steady state leaf energy balance is expressed in eq 4 4 0 r n h λ e s the steady state leaf energy balance can also be expressed in the terms shown in eq 5 dhillon et al 2014 5 0 r n ρ c p r h t l t a ρ c p γ e s t l e t a r a r s the saturation vapor pressure in the stomatal cavity i e es tl and in the air i e es ta can be described by eqs 6 and 7 respectively and the non saturation water vapor pressure in the air can be found by adjusting es ta by the local relative humidity as shown in eq 8 6 e s t l 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t l t l 237 3 7 e s t a 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t a t a 237 3 8 e t a e s t a r h 100 the terms were rearranged to obtain an equation for the temperature difference between the leaf and the air eq 9 9 t l t a r h ρ c p r n r h γ e s t l e t a r a r s in the following two eqs 10 and 11 some of the terms were re defined to simplify the equation 10 α r h ρ c p 11 t l t a α r n r h γ r a e s t l e t a 1 r s r a one physiological condition should be considered in this energy balance equation the upper baseline or dry leaf condition for the case of the dry leaf condition the following two assumptions were made r s r a t l t d since the leaf is dead the cooling effect due to transpiration would be zero resulting in the following reduced version of eq 11 12 t d t a α r n the temperature difference between the dry leaf and the air is directly related to the net heat gain due to radiation the net heat gain due to radiation is approximately the same for both a dry leaf and a live leaf because they are co located within the leaf monitor fig 1 therefore the left side of eq 12 td ta can be substituted for the α r n term in eq 11 this transforms eq 11 to eq 13 13 t l t a t d t a r h γ r a e s t l e t a 1 r s r a eq 13 can be simplified to 14 t l t d β e s t l e t a 1 r s r a where β r h γ r a is a constant rearranging eq 14 leads to the comprehensive stress indicator csi kpa 15 c s i t d t l e s t l e t a β 1 r s r a according to eq 15 the csi is related to the stomatal resistance i e the inverse of the stomatal conductance the csi also depends on the number of stomata per unit area on the leaf 2 2 deriving the integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi in this study the csi was computed every fifteen minutes resulting in a dynamic stress indicator to obtain a daily stress indicator the csi was modified in two ways the first daily stress indicator is the integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi h kpa and was defined as in eq 16 16 i c s i t 1 10 a m t 2 6 p m t d t l e s t l e t a d t the period from 10 a m to 6 p m was selected because that is when leaves photosynthesize the most during the day before 10 a m condensation on the leaf can cause the leaf temperature to be above the air temperature this would result in a negative ta tl which can be confusing to interpret especially when integrating over time 2 3 deriving the average comprehensive stress indicator acsi the second daily stress indicator is the average comprehensive stress indicator acsi kpa and was defined as in eq 17 17 a c s i 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 1 p m t 2 3 p m t d t l e s t l e t a d t the period from 1 p m to 3 p m was selected because that is around solar noon when midday stem water potential measurements are typically obtained 2 4 study area and irrigation treatments sixteen nonpareil almond trees were each monitored with a leaf monitor during the 2017 growing season at nickels soil lab in arbuckle ca usa this study used a 1 6 hectare plot consisting of five rows of nonpareil almond trees bordered on either side by aldrich and butte almond trees which served as pollinators one tree received extra water to simulate the saturated condition a leaf monitor was installed on this well watered tree to obtain a lower baseline to compute cwsi dans and idans the development of csi was part of a larger study on regulated deficit irrigation in almond trees the plot was separated into two management zones delineated by soil and plant characteristics kizer et al 2017 within each management zone there were both grower and regulated deficit irrigation rdi treatments the grower managed irrigation based on watermark sensors and applied the same amount of water to both management zones csi swp and crop evapotranspiration etc were considered in companion to schedule irrigation in the rdi treatments as described by kizer 2018 the rdi treatments were irrigated at percentages of the total etc since the last irrigation etc was calculated as the reference et from a weather station in williams ca multiplied by a crop coefficient 1 05 at the end of the season irrigation was applied approximately once every four days the rdi amount began at 85 etc and 90 etc for management zones 1 and 2 respectively the goal was to maintain the swp within the target range 1 8 to 1 4 mpa during hull split and 1 4 to 1 2 mpa before and after hull split by adjusting the percent etc treatment in response to changes in swp and csi different amounts of irrigation were applied to each management zone in the rdi treatments although the data used in this paper were collected from a regulated deficit irrigation study the purpose of this paper was primarily to assess the sensitivity of csi acsi and icsi to plant water status rather than to implement specific irrigation treatments this paper does not discuss the irrigation management for this study in detail that information can be found in kizer 2018 2 5 leaf temperature and environmental measurements using leaf monitors data for this study were collected with a patented sensor suite called the leaf monitor shown in fig 1 that continuously and proximally measures air temperature shaded leaf temperature relative humidity wind speed and incident radiation in the visible wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum dhillon et al 2014 dhillon 2015 upadhyaya et al 2016 the leaf monitor included an inexpensive thermal infrared ir sensor mlx90614 melexis technologies nv to measure the shaded leaf temperature a second thermal ir sensor of the same model measured the dry leaf temperature in one integrated unit a band gap temperature sensor measured the air temperature and a capacitive type relative humidity sensor measured the relative humidity mod 1018 sht25 embedded adventures london uk incident radiation and wind speed were also measured but not used in calculating the stress indicators a lux sensor measured the incident light in the visible spectrum which is closely related to the photosynthetically active radiation tsl2561 texas advanced optoelectronic solutions plano tx a wind speed sensor measured wind speed above the canopy rev p wind sensor modern device providence ri sixteen leaf monitors were connected to a wireless mesh network to provide continuous real time data the leaf monitors reported samples from all sensors once every fifteen minutes in 2015 and 2016 the leaf monitors and wireless communication system were tested in almonds and grapes to assist in implementing regulated deficit irrigation rdi through the use of cwsi with promising results kizer et al 2017 ko madden et al 2017 rojo et al 2016 in 2017 the leaf monitor was updated to include a second thermal infrared sensor to measure the temperature of a dry leaf i e a leaf with a broken stem under the same environmental conditions as the live leaf in the leaf monitor kizer 2018 in this study the updated leaf monitors kizer 2018 were used to measure the dry leaf temperature and the live leaf temperature under the same environmental condition in each leaf monitor one leaf still attached to the stem i e the live leaf was placed directly underneath the infrared temperature sensor within a wind barrier and underneath a light diffuser dome as shown in fig 1 this leaf was selected from the lowest part of the canopy shaded green and not damaged or blemished kizer 2018 selecting shaded leaves minimized variations in incident radiation additionally dhillon et al 2014 found that multiple linear regression models showed a better relationship between plant water status as a function of stem water potential relative humidity and air temperature and leaf temperature for shaded leaves more than sunlit leaves in almond trees the light diffuser dome helped maintain the leaves as shaded by preventing sun flecks a mixture of direct sun and shade as a result of non uniform solar radiation the purpose of the wind barrier was to prevent direct wind to the leaf without completely sealing the live leaf inside the leaf monitor dhillon 2015 2 6 data processing and calibration the computation of csi involved calibrating and processing the data all thermal infrared sensors were adjusted for an offset in the early morning at night the stomata are closed because no transpiration occurs in the dark without the cooling effect of transpiration the leaf temperature should be approximately the same as the air temperature the average ta tl during the 1 a m to 4 a m period was computed and this number was assumed to be the offset due to instrumentation error in the infrared thermal sensors the average ta tl during this period should be approximately equal to zero so any offset from that was added to all leaf temperature measurements on that calendar day a new leaf temperature offset was computed each day to avoid the accumulation of error in case the thermal ir sensor was unintentionally measuring something other than the leaf at some point in time the relative humidity sensor was also adjusted for an offset during the early morning from 4 to 7 a m a standard relative humidity sensor was selected from the group of leaf monitors and all other relative humidity sensors were calibrated using this standard sensor the average of the difference between the relative humidity of the standard sensor and the sensor to be calibrated during the 4 a m to 7 a m period was added to all relative humidity measurements for the entire growing season therefore all relative humidity sensors were at approximately the same relative humidity in the early morning and any differences in relative humidity would be seen at times of the day of lower relative humidity i e the afternoon when the plant water status would normally differ from tree to tree a moving average technique was applied to the leaf temperature dry leaf temperature air temperature and relative humidity data to smooth the data the sample rate was four data points per hour and five data points were averaged at a time for each iteration of the moving average 2 7 control of data quality leaf temperature data were omitted on days when the monitored leaf was showing signs of senescence i e yellowing or broken stem and was no longer representative of the entire tree on a few occasions the leaf was found to have moved from the view of the thermal ir sensor or to be completely missing from the leaf monitor both cases were most likely due to wind or tension from the connecting branch leaf temperature data from these occasions were omitted because the thermal ir sensor was most likely monitoring the underlying soil prior to june 21 a piece of paper was used as a substitute for a dead leaf for measuring the dry leaf temperature the piece of paper was shown to perform similarly to a dry leaf except when it rained on two precipitation events the piece of paper in each leaf monitor got wet so the data for these days had to be omitted because the paper did not properly simulate a dry leaf which has a waxy surface to prevent saturation from rain 2 8 midday stem water potential measurements midday stem water potential swp measurements were taken at each tree with a pressure chamber two or three times a week during the 2017 growing season one swp measurement was collected per tree and was assumed to represent the plant water status of the entire tree at that time before taking swp measurements a leaf was placed inside an aluminum foil bag for 15 min to ensure equilibrium of the stem water potential and the leaf water potential 3 results 3 1 comprehensive stress indicator a dynamic csi was computed every fifteen minutes for each leaf time series plots of csi were produced for each monitored leaf daily during the growing season in 2017 a software program was developed in matlab that produced daily csi time series plots each plot included daily csi curves from a user defined number of previous days in the same graph an example of a time series plot is shown in fig 2 which features seven consecutive days of csi for one leaf each day is marked in a different color and symbol these time series plots were used to evaluate relative changes in plant water stress from day to day based on eq 15 the value of the dynamic csi should increase when the stomatal conductance increases i e when the stomatal resistance decreases so there is less resistance to transpiration during the 2017 growing season the plant water stress was evaluated daily by observing increases or decreases in the dynamic csi in relation to when irrigation events happened when the csi time series curves consecutively lowered over several days or dramatically dropped in the afternoon hours this indicated that the stomata were closing to prevent further water loss since the csi depends on the number of stomata per unit area on the leaf it would be difficult to establish an amount of increase or decrease in csi to use as a threshold for triggering an irrigation event that works for any almond tree therefore the csi was evaluated separately for each monitored tree because of the dependence of csi on the number of stomata per unit area on the leaf the example csi time series plot in fig 2 show high csi values on july 22 followed by decreasing csi values on july 23 to reach relatively steady low csi values on july 24 25 the declining csi values indicate a period of increasing stress levels due to depleting water availability the csi did not immediately respond to the irrigation applied on july 26 but did increase the next day on july 27 and even more on july 28 3 2 comparing comprehensive stress indicator to degrees above non stressed the csi time series plots were compared to degrees above non stressed dans time series plots as dans increases the temperature difference between the saturated leaf and the monitored leaf increases when dans approaches zero the monitored leaf temperature is closer to the saturated leaf temperature indicating that the monitored leaf is fully transpiring an example of the dans time series plot demonstrates the behavior of the monitored leaf in relation to the saturated leaf fig 3 from july 22 to july 23 the temperature of the monitored leaf departs from the temperature of the saturated leaf until reaching a relatively steady dans on july 24 and july 25 when the monitored leaf was irrigated on july 26 the temperature already started approaching the temperature of the saturated leaf on july 27 and july 28 the dans reached a relatively steady low indicating that the monitored leaf was transpiring but still not as much as the saturated leaf the csi and dans time series plots indicate similar physiological responses of the monitored leaf in response to irrigation events like dans the csi time series plots can provide feedback on the plant s response to irrigation although the dynamic csi is useful a single daily stress indicator would be more comparable to midday stem water potential as well as existing stress indicators cwsi and idans 3 3 correlation of daily stress indicators with stem water potential the stem water potential was compared to icsi acsi idans and cwsi for individual trees using simple linear regression data were analyzed using the statistics and machine learning toolbox in matlab version 2018b out of the sixteen trees that were monitored in this study senescence of the monitored leaf occurred in seven of them the results of only the nine leaves that were consistently monitored for the duration of the study are included in the following results for each subplot in figs 4 through 7 the same leaf was used for all observations of the stress indicators to avoid uncertainty associated with different numbers of stomata per unit area of different leaves stem water potential was measured on a leaf from the same tree as the monitored leaf due to the destruction of the leaf in measuring stem water potential it was impossible to measure stem water potential and the stress indicators on the same leaf table 2 shows statistics for the linear regression models the correlations varied from tree to tree in each of the following figures fig 4 through 7 the bottom middle plot was the saturated tree lm16 since the cwsi and idans of the saturated leaf are 0 by default the subplots involving cwsi and idans of the saturated leaf are not meaningful so they were not included for the comparison of swp with acsi the coefficient of determination ranged from as low as 0 2 to as high as 0 72 fig 4 for swp versus icsi the coefficient of determination fell between 0 26 and 0 7 fig 5 for the swp versus cwsi comparison the coefficient of determination ranged from 0 04 to 0 8 fig 6 for swp versus idans the coefficient of determination ranged from 0 1 to 0 69 fig 7 in most cases the correlation coefficient was low for the same trees for all stress indicators this suggests that a problem with the data is common to all stress indicators evaluated in this study regardless of whether the saturated leaf temperature was factored into the stress indicator the trees that had poor correlation between acsi icsi and swp had small range in data indicating that more data should be collected to understand the relationship between swp and acsi and icsi the high variability in the coefficient of determinations also points to the strong influence of local environmental conditions e g incident radiation soil differences in the trees on tree water status for most trees there was a good agreement between acsi icsi and swp 3 4 comparison of daily stress indicators the icsi acsi cwsi and idans were compared with each other for individual trees acsi and icsi were both strongly correlated with cwsi for most trees one tree lm37 had a low correlation between cwsi and acsi r2 0 13 table 3 and between cwsi and icsi r2 0 14 table 3 all other trees had stronger correlations between cwsi and acsi from 0 53 to 0 86 and between cwsi and icsi from 0 46 to 0 82 in terms of the coefficient of determinations the correlations between idans and acsi and between idans and icsi varied from tree to tree as shown in table 3 the results show that acsi and icsi are generally more closely correlated with cwsi than with idans perhaps because cwsi includes the air temperature whereas idans does not the comprehensive stress indicators icsi and acsi were closely correlated as expected because their derivations are closely related 4 discussion the use of csi time series plots icsi and acsi can be insightful for assessing plant water status of almond trees in relation to irrigation events csi time series plots icsi and acsi can be used as scheduling tools for regulated deficit irrigation these stress indicators can be monitored over several days of increasing stress before applying an irrigation rather than irrigating at regular intervals that may not reflect the physiological tolerances of the plant to soil water deficit csi icsi and acsi may be useful in conjunction with et and swp to implement site specific irrigation as described by kizer 2018 scientific questions involving the influence of leaf characteristics on csi icsi and acsi merit further research 1 how does the number of stomata on the leaf affect csi icsi and acsi 2 do leaf characteristics change under deficit irrigation and how would this affect the behavior of csi icsi and acsi unfortunately the number of stomata on a leaf is not easily quantified in a field setting theoretically under fully transpiring conditions the csi would reach a maximum value however since the csi depends on number of stomata on the leaf per unit area this maximum csi would be different from leaf to leaf discrepancies in leaf characteristics between leaves introduces a problem in the event of leaf senescence leaf changes complicate the interpretation of the csi time series plots fig 2 if a leaf was changed during the period plotted in the time series because the maximum potential csi i e the csi of the fully transpiring condition for that leaf would be different for different days in the period also discrepancies in leaf characteristics from leaf to leaf complexifies generalizability of csi icsi acsi into an absolute threshold value for the purpose of irrigation management however csi icsi and acsi have the advantage of not requiring a measurement of the saturated leaf temperature unlike cwsi and idans the saturated leaf temperature can be difficult to measure in a field setting making cwsi and idans less attractive for assessing plant water status additionally leaf characteristics may change throughout the growing season especially under drought conditions which also may influence the behavior of csi icsi and acsi the leaves may acclimatize to increasing stress under deficit irrigation conditions via osmotic adjustment as suggested by kizer 2018 further research should aim at validating the influence of acclimatization on the relationship between the stem water potential and the different stress indicators understanding how acclimatization of the plant to drought conditions affects the value of csi icsi and acsi could help in developing a method for using the stress indicators in irrigation scheduling although the influence of leaf characteristics on the magnitude of csi icsi and acsi may sound discouraging these stress indicators can still be monitored on a relative basis to evaluate changes in plant water stress in response to irrigations without the need to measure the saturated leaf temperature good relationships between icsi acsi and swp could be valuable in developing a continuously and remotely sensing alternative to the laborious use of the pressure chamber in measuring the plant water status in almond trees without requiring a measurement of the saturated leaf temperature on top of studying the influence of leaf characteristics further research should collect more data covering a wider range of plant water stress and environmental conditions to shed light on the relationships between acsi icsi and swp 5 conclusions a one year study evaluated the use of the dynamic comprehensive stress indicator csi the daily integrated comprehensive stress indicator icsi and the daily average comprehensive stress indicator acsi for quantifying plant water status in almond trees csi icsi and acsi have the advantage of not requiring a lower baseline leaf temperature measurement which can be difficult to maintain in a field setting icsi and acsi were compared to existing daily stress indicators cwsi and idans which do require a lower baseline temperature measurement and were found to be correlated with each other icsi and acsi were also found to be correlated with midday stem water potential at similar levels to cwsi and idans low correlations with midday stem water potential were found in the same leaves for all stress indicators and vice versa further research should investigate the cause of low correlations between these stress indicators and swp for certain leaves and not others although the number of stomata per unit area may influence the magnitude of csi icsi and acsi these stress indicators can be used on a relative basis for assessing the plant water stress in response to irrigation events further studies are recommended to obtain a wider range of stress indicator values and environmental conditions to fully understand the relationships between icsi acsi and swp additionally further research should focus on developing methodologies for using csi icsi and acsi in irrigation scheduling declaration of interest none acknowledgments many thanks to erin kizer channing ko madden julie meyers chunxia jiang

the soil the loss in crop yields also depends on the various factors like exposure time the concentration of salts crop sensitivity crop water intake along with the characteristics of soil and quality of irrigation water foth 1990 sodium chloride and boron accumulated in the leaves and in other parts of plants through soil causes toxicity to plants these toxic ions can influence the crops individually or simultaneously the toxic ions can be absorbed by plants through leaves also during sprinkler irrigation in the hot dry summer season it further increases the toxic ions in plants thus evaluation of irrigation water quality is essential to assess the yields of the crop suarez 2012a sodic soil effect to the yields of the crop can be assessed by using salinity and sodium absorption

sws model suarez 2012b central ground water board cgwb 2016 reported that in india 89 of the total water required for irrigation fulfilled by the groundwater approximately 66 of the study area is under intensive agricultural activities which causes stress over groundwater due to overexploitation and low recharge cgwb 2013 further excess utilization of chemical fertilizer may cause salinity

cacl2 and mgcl2 moderate gypsum and mgso4 small moderate kcl k2so4 nahco3 and caco3 small na2co3 borate nitrate small to none subba rao 2008 it is essential that soluble salts available in the soil must reach the crop roots for better productivity high salt concentrations can lead to the physiological drought condition causes the death of the plants mass et al 1975 bauder et al 2011 srivastava and ramanathan 2018b the saline soils possess ph 8 5 while sodic soils possess ph in between 8 5 10 every year worldwide large area of the agricultural land converted into non fertile due to higher salinity hazard and sodium hazard the interactions between minerals in the groundwater aquifer have a substantial impact on hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater ehya and saeedi 2018 srivastava and ramanathan 2018a ehya and mosleh 2018 further the additional contribution of contaminants through various points and non point sources influences the quality of groundwater significantly cederstrom

hydrogeochemical data indicates significant spatial variability in few hydro geochemical parameters the box plots of geochemical parameters have shown in fig 3 around 96 of water samples were colorless and odorless with high do value while very few samples show color change after some time the oxidation of iron available in groundwater samples can cause the color change in water samples it is possible that groundwater after pumping out through the bore well it gets oxidized along with o2 available in the atmosphere and precipitated as ferric hydroxide appelo and postma 2005 high do has been observed in almost all samples with an average value of 10 44 mg l 2016 17 and 10 74 mg l 2017 18 do of water samples increase in post monsoon due to the addition of do with rainwater the higher

analysis frequently uses in understanding the hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater these methods are correlation matrix and factor analysis balasubramanian et al 1985 lawrence and upchurch 1982 the statistical analysis generally suggests the better conclusion than graphical since in statistical analysis we can study the number of variables and numerous relationships can be deduced in comparison to the graphical the correlation matrix and factor analysis used in this study to interpret the various relationships between the analyzed parameters davis 1986 voudouris et al 2000 5 2 1 correlation matrix the correlation matrix plots among the geochemical parameters have shown in fig 4 the strong correlations observed among tds and major ions cl 0 93 so4 2 0 85 ca2 0 83 and hardness 0 85 it indicates high tds observed in groundwater due these ions ec shows good correlations with mg2 0 67 na 0 61 no3 0 60 and k 0 50 it indicates conductivity observed in water due to presence of these ions nitrate indicates good correlations along with k 0 63 ca2 0 63 and the average correlations with the mg2 0 47 and po4 3 0 48 supports the similar source of origin groundwater may be contaminated by

calculated by utilizing correspondence analysis yang et al 2016 legendre and legendre 1998 angers et al 1999 factor analysis offers the molar relationships to explain the various factors controlling the hydrogeochemical reactions occurring in the groundwater aquifer mahlknecht 2003 it is one of the most preferable statistical methods used for understanding the hydro geochemistry of groundwater subba rao 2002 in this statistical calculation the large number of chemical data converted into few factors principal component analyses convert the load of the total variance into one factor and these factors extracted by the principal extraction method mahlknecht et al 2004 it represents the complete variances of the geochemical data and structure which articulate in the form of the variance and covariance among geochemical species and deduce relation among them davis 1986 according to stevens 1986 the accuracy of the eigenvalues for 30 variables can be taken 0 70 in place minimum 1 0 as suggested in kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 in this study 19 variable used and eigenvalues considered 0 72 table 2 a scree test performed for observed eigenvalues which gives an ideal break for the

factor 2 of the pca matrix indicates the loading of the hco3 mg2 and ca2 which accounts for 11 3 of total variances and eigenvalues 2 15 table 2 the high loading of the ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater indicates chemical weathering is prevalent in hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater this has also justified by the gibbs diagram 1970 and piper diagram 1944 of groundwater factor 3 of the pca matrix characterized by the loading of f pb2 and fe2 which accounts for 7 8 of the total variance table 2 loading of groundwater with f in the study area also justified as susceptibility reported by cgwb 2013 few groundwater samples show high concentration pb2 and fe2 mainly due to local input factors 4 of pca matrix shows the loading of the k and dissolves silica accounts for 7 3 of the total variances it indicates chemical weathering dominating in groundwater of the study area factor 5 of pca matrix characterized by loading of k and po4 3 which accounts for 6 5 of total variances it indicates contamination of groundwater at few sampling locations through chemical fertilizer used on agriculture land factor 6 of pca matrix has characterized by orp while factor 7 characterized by

area 5 3 1 x y plot major ions are those ions possess molar concentration 10 of the total ions molar concentration the x y plots between major ions used in this study for understanding the water chemistry of groundwater as well as for the identification of various factors responsible for the dissolution of these ions in groundwater the graph between hco3 co3 2 vs ca2 mg2 shows most of the samples falls above the equiline 1 1 indicates the significant contribution of alkaline earth metals in alkalinity and hardness of water fig 5 a the natural chemical weathering is mainly responsible for the release of the major ions mg2 ca2 hco3 and co3 2 in groundwater drever 1997 the gibbs diagram 1970 also justifies that chemical weathering is controlling the geochemistry of groundwater fig 7 the graph for tz vs ca2 mg2 shows all groundwater samples fall under equiline 1 1 indicates the increase in the contribution of alkali metals to the total cations fig 5b subba rao et al 2012 the graph between tz vs na k shows all groundwater samples fall under equiline 1 1 fig 5c the most of the samples fall below the line 1 0 5 or very close to 1 0 5 line indicates the dissolution of rock minerals chemical weathering is the major source of these ions subba rao et al 2012 there are few groundwater samples falls above the theoretical line 1 0 5 indicating human activities contribution in a few groundwater samples fig 5c in the graph na k vs cl so4 2 most of the groundwater samples are showing the continuous growth indicates the geogenic origin of these ions fig 5d few groundwater samples

along with the increase of cl so4 2 ions without any divergence sarin et al 1989 subba rao 2008 datta and tyagi 1996 the graph between na vs cl shows most of the samples fall under equiline 1 1 indicate release of na by chemical weathering of rock minerals meyback 1987 fig 5e there are few exceptions indicating the possibility of contamination from fertilizer industry and agriculture field the graph for na vs hco3 co3 2 is showing most of the water samples falls above equiline 1 1 indicate natural weathering while few samples fall below the theoretical line indicate the contribution through anthropogenic sources in the few locations fig 5f the graph between na vs ca2 indicate a large area of groundwater enriched by these ions by natural weathering and while few locations groundwater contaminated fig 5g subba rao et al 2012 the graph between ec vs na cl shows most of the samples fall in the same position indicate na cl ratio does not change with the change of ec with few exceptions fig 5h these indicate that the increase in conductivity due to the evaporation process by the semi arid climate conditions of the guna district hence it is concluded that the ion exchange process is mainly responsible for the rise of the concentration of na ion while na and cl increases due to evaporation hem 1991 jankowski and acworth 1997 prasad et al 2006 the various x y

groundwater aquifer it also explained the significance of different geochemical processes taking place in the aquifer of the study area through chemical weathering evaporation and atmospheric precipitation process almost all groundwater samples fall in the chemical weathering zone of the gibbs diagram 1970 indicates the dominance of chemical weathering in the geochemistry of groundwater fig 7 it has suggested that rock water interactions prevalent in the aquifer which controls the geochemistry of the groundwater the rock mineral water mixing causes dissolution ion exchange and chemical weathering etc few samples migrated towards evaporation zone indicating high dissolved solids due to water contamination caused by fertilizer used for farming and poor sanitary condition subba rao et al 2012 srivastava and ramanathan 2018b the scattered diagram indicates the influence of anthropogenic sources in few samples 5 3 4 chloro alkaline indices ca the chloro alkaline indices ca are commonly using to understand the rock water interaction ion exchange chemistry between groundwater and geology of the study area schoeller 1955 1967 few groundwater samples show significant proportions of na ions in groundwater may be due to the prevalence of the ion exchange process in the aquifer the ca2 and mg2 ions available in groundwater undergo the ion exchange process with na

defined as the amount of water required to remove the salts from the root zone of plants salinity problems can be minimized by flushing excess quantity of water for the calculated period of times various crops show tolerance level against salinity it can be calculated and further assessment suggests specific types of crops on the basis of salinity of the soil the graph between ec and depth of water table indicate high salinity observed in shallow aquifer than deep aquifers fig 11 it indicates leaching of salts from the surface to the subsurface along with irrigation water these salinity problems in the study can be improved by proper salinity hazard management 8 1 water quality influence on crop yields irrigation water containing high concentrations of na and cl ions cause an adverse effect on the growth of plants few plants suffer to foliar injury due to exposer of leaves through water containing high concentrations of na and cl ions the tolerance limit of plants calculated in the form of exchangeable sodium percentage esp various crops show low acceptance towards salinity at the early stage of seed germination but tolerance limits increases in the later stage of their growth e g zea mays hordeum vulgare triticum aestivum etc few crops show the different level of tolerance at the different phase of their growth e g glycine max etc other crops varieties are showing high tolerance in the early stage of their growth e g beta vulgaris carthamus tinctorius etc crops can be classified into four categories on the basis of the salinity tolerance level these are i tolerant hordeum vulgare asparagus officinalis etc ii moderately tolerant triticum aestivum thinopyrum intermedium cucurbita pepo beta vulgari etc iii moderately sensitive solanum lycopersicum cucumis sativus medicago sativa trifolium hybridum etc and iv sensitive crops allium cepa daucus carota subsp sativus phaseolus vulgaris etc ayers and westcot 1976 the salinity tolerance levels of study area indicate groundwater used for irrigation are influencing the yield of crops like field crops wheat bean broad bean corn cowpea flex groundnut rice safflower sesbania sorghum soybean etc and vegetable crops bean beet broccoli etc the yields of barley cotton and sugar beet do not affect by irrigation with groundwater since salinity tolerance of these crops is high in comparison to the salinity of the irrigated water the statistics of yield potential of few selected crops on the basis of salinity tolerance limit of crops through irrigation water has given in table 4 it indicates salinity of irrigation water do not affect the yield potential of hordeum vulgare barley gossy pium cotton beta vulgaris sugar beet cynodon dactylon bermuda grass thinopyrum ponticum tall wheat grass thinopyrum intermedium wheat grass etc fig 12 the yield potential partially affected in the few crops like arachis hypogaea groundnut 95 30 oryza sativa rice 93 29 carthamus tintorius safflower 97 32 sorghum bicolor sorghum 95 97 glycine max soybean 97 32 triticum aestivum wheat 99 33 beta vulgaris beet 95 97 brassica oleracea var italica broccoli 92 62 cucumis sativus cucumber 90 60 solanum lycopersicum

to salinity hazard indicates low yield potential while few of them studied in this research work listed as phaseolus vulgaris bean 36 91 daucus carota carrot 36 91 fragaria ananassa strawberry 36 91 etc table 4 ayers and westcot 1976 hence this groundwater is most suitable for the irrigation of crop like barley cotton sugar beet wheat wheatgrass bermuda grass etc but this can be effectively utilized after salinity management for crops like groundnut rice soybean beet broccoli cucumber tomato harding grass tall fescue trefoil small date palm fig olive and pomegranate 8 2 comparisons between ayers and westcot model and soil water salinity sws model the yields of crops in the study area have been calculated by considering the ayers and westcot model 1976 and sws model suarez et al 2010 crop yields calculated by considering the salinity tolerance limit of the crops for 100 yields and salinity of the study area fig 12 reduction in crop yield observed almost similar range in both ayers and westcot model and sws model up to the salinity of irrigation water 1 5 ms cm suarez et al 2010 suarez 2012a b according to the ayers and westcot model sharp decline in the yields of crop observed after 1 5 ms cm salinity of irrigation water and reaches up to 10 of crop yields while as per sws model moderate decline observed suarez 2012a b 9 conclusion the hydrogeochemical assessment of the groundwater quality has performed with the objectives to determine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation crop yield and drinking purpose through graphical multivariate statistics and geochemical modeling this study indicates the dominance of chemical weathering in the aquifer of the study area with few exceptions indicating anthropogenic input through agricultural land and industries most of the groundwater samples indicate high salinity hazard problems and poor sodium hazard problems the salinity hazard preferably observed in the shallow aquifer the high salinity in shallow aquifer makes difficult for salinity management because water consumed by plants released in the atmosphere by evaporation and dissolved salts left in soil further increases its salinity statistical assessment of salinity hazard indicates the yield few crops unaffected if irrigated by this groundwater these crops are barley cotton sugar beet bermuda grass tall wheat grass etc while few shows a partial decrease in yield percentage if irrigated by this groundwater these crops are groundnut rice soya bean beet broccoli cucumber tomato harding grass tall fescue trefoil small date palm fig olive and pomegranate hence this groundwater is most suitable for irrigation of crop like barley cotton sugar beet wheat wheat grass and bermuda grass etc but this can be effectively utilized after salinity management for crops like groundnut rice soya bean beet broccoli cucumber tomato harding grass tall fescue trefoil small date palm fig olive and pomegranate this groundwater is unsuitable for the irrigation of the crops like bean carrot and strawberry since these crops are very sensitive to salinity hazard the assessment of statistics of the hydro geochemical data for two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 indicate some significant spatial and temporal variation in a few geochemical parameters good charge balance observed in most of the groundwater samples with the error within 5 0 it concluded geogenic process contributing significantly in the geochemistry of the groundwater with few exceptions due to contamination of groundwater from agriculture fields and known industrial effluents almost all groundwater samples were colorless and odorless with high do with exceptions at few sampling locations gibbs diagram indicates chemical weathering is mainly responsible for the enrichment of cations and anions in groundwater samples collected from extensive agriculture field zone show contamination of groundwater in comparison to another zone the geochemical modeling of groundwater indicates the dominance of ca2 and mg2 over k and na in hydro geochemical facies indicate natural weathering is dominating the piper diagram indicates most of the groundwater samples are ca mg hco3 water types the chloro alkaline indices indicate 70 groundwater show ion exchange of na and k from rock minerals to ca2 and mg2 ions available in groundwater while 30 of groundwater indicate ca2 and mg2 ions released into groundwater from rock minerals the geochemical modeling indicates 44 0 groundwater under proactive dissolution mixing zone 24 groundwater in the disco ordinate

groundwater contaminated through caso4 2h2o the hydrogeochemistry of this part of india is primarily depending on the geogenic process chemical weathering ion exchange adsorption and absorption precipitation and evaporation occurring in the aquifer system while few samples show contamination from the agricultural field the water samples collected from the extensive cultivated area more contaminated in comparison to the other regions of the study area water quality index wqi is changing with the change of water tables depth the statistics indicate that 22 33 groundwater suitable for drinking 71 53 groundwater considered poor 5 40 groundwater very poor water category and 0 74 groundwater unsuitable for drinking purpose the similar range of the crop yields observed in both ayers and westcot model and sws model if the salinity of the irrigation water is low 1 5 ms cm while higher crop yields observed according to sws model in comparisons to ayers and westcot model if the salinity of the irrigation water is high 1 5 ms cm the major reduction in crop yields observed in ayers and westcot model while a moderate decline in crop yields observed in sws model at higher salinity crop yield in the study area can be improved by implementing proper irrigation water management agriculture water management can reduce the basic problems of the low yield of crops in this

sws model at higher salinity crop yield in the study area can be improved by implementing proper irrigation water management keywords geochemical modeling sodium absorption ratio sar salinity hazard sodium hazard crop yield 1 introduction the yield of field and vegetable crops depends on the quality of soil and water uses in irrigation soil quality affected by the various factors like soil type slope drainage patterns types of irrigation fertilizer and water uses for irrigation of the crops bauder et al 2011 assessment of irrigation water quality is essential for the planning of long term management of the crop yields since high electrical conductivity of water ecw causes the inability of the plant to compete with ions in the soil solution bauder et al 2011 surface water river lake and pond and subsurface water groundwater extensively use for irrigation worldwide subsurface water is preferably using worldwide for irrigation purpose due to its easy availabilities in comparison to surface water the yields of crop significantly affect the quality of irrigation water maas and hoffman 1977 bauder et al 2011 straten van et al 2018 maas hoffman model maas and hoffman 1977 is one of the most accepted models describing crop potential for salt tolerance by setting a threshold limit of salinity parameter it concluded crop yield does not affect below threshold limit while above threshold limit crop yield decreases as per slope of the model curve the plant growth affected in various proportions at various stages of growth due to salinity maas and hoffman 1977 the growth of crops under saline condition studied by various researchers worldwide these researchers studied the influence of salinity on the growth of crops suresh and nagesh 2015 straten van et al 2018 rice

kaddah and fakhry 1961 meiri and poljakoff mayber 1970 salinity becomes severe for the plant if the quality of irrigation water is poor salts accumulated in the soil after evaporation evapotranspiration causes the reduction in crop yield the salinity of soil is non uniform usually increases with depth due to accumulation salt for the long interval of time mass et al 1975 salinity affects plant growth in various ways normally plants look normal but stunted appear darker green or thicker or succulent while in woody species high salt can cause leaf burn necrosis and defoliation in herbaceous plants no such effect observed fruit crops are more sensitive to the toxic effect of high na and cl ion concentration in soil mass et al 1975 relative yields of the crop for salinity rich soil can be calculated by applying the following formulae mass et al 1975 relative yield 100 r ecs ecth where r is the rate of yield loss above the threshold salinity ecth ecs is the salinity of the soil the loss in crop yields also depends on the various factors like exposure time the concentration of salts crop sensitivity crop water intake along with the characteristics of soil and quality of irrigation water foth 1990 sodium chloride and boron accumulated in the leaves and in other parts of plants through soil causes toxicity to plants these toxic ions can influence the crops individually or simultaneously the toxic ions can be absorbed by plants through leaves also during sprinkler irrigation in the hot dry summer season it further increases the toxic ions in plants thus evaluation of irrigation water quality is essential to assess the yields of the crop suarez 2012a sodic soil effect to the yields of the crop can be assessed by using salinity and sodium absorption

hydrogeochemical data indicates significant spatial variability in few hydro geochemical parameters the box plots of geochemical parameters have shown in fig 3 around 96 of water samples were colorless and odorless with high do value while very few samples show color change after some time the oxidation of iron available in groundwater samples can cause the color change in water samples it is possible that groundwater after pumping out through the bore well it gets oxidized along with o2 available in the atmosphere and precipitated as ferric hydroxide appelo and postma 2005 high do has been observed in almost all samples with an average value of 10 44 mg l 2016 17 and 10 74 mg l 2017 18 do of water samples increase in post monsoon due to the addition of do with rainwater the higher value of orp also indicates oxidizing environment in the groundwater aquifer table 1 the ph of water samples is ranging between 6 7 8 78 and all these under the permissible limit of who 2004 2012 and bis 1991 table 1 the spatial distribution shows few sampling locations observed with high salinity but most of the samples indicate low to moderate salinity in normal ec of the groundwater observed in

analysis frequently uses in understanding the hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater these methods are correlation matrix and factor analysis balasubramanian et al 1985 lawrence and upchurch 1982 the statistical analysis generally suggests the better conclusion than graphical since in statistical analysis we can study the number of variables and numerous relationships can be deduced in comparison to the graphical the correlation matrix and factor analysis used in this study to interpret the various relationships between the analyzed parameters davis 1986 voudouris et al 2000 5 2 1 correlation

of multivariate statistical analysis in this study correspondence analysis also performed for understanding the hydrogeochemistry prevalent in the groundwater in this analysis the set factor score calculated by utilizing correspondence analysis yang et al 2016 legendre and legendre 1998 angers et al 1999 factor analysis offers the molar relationships to explain the various factors controlling the hydrogeochemical reactions occurring in the groundwater aquifer mahlknecht 2003 it is one of the most preferable statistical methods used for understanding the hydro geochemistry of groundwater subba rao 2002 in this statistical calculation the large number of chemical data converted into few factors principal component analyses convert the load of the total variance into one factor and these factors extracted by the principal extraction method mahlknecht et al 2004 it represents the complete variances of the geochemical data and structure which articulate in the form of the variance and covariance among geochemical species and deduce relation among them davis 1986 according to stevens 1986 the accuracy of the eigenvalues for 30 variables can be taken 0 70 in place minimum 1 0 as suggested in kaiser criterion kaiser 1960 in this study 19 variable used and eigenvalues considered 0 72 table 2 a scree test performed for observed eigenvalues which gives an ideal break for the meaningful and trivial variances cattell 1966 in this study principal component analysis pca matrix factor value 0 40 considered significant stevens 1986 factor 1 of the pca matrix characterized with the strong loading of ec tds cl na and its accounts 25 0 of the total variances with eigenvalues 4 74 it indicates ec and tds of groundwater mainly influenced by the presence of na and cl ions table 2 factor 2 of the pca matrix indicates the loading of the hco3 mg2 and ca2 which accounts for 11 3 of total variances and eigenvalues 2 15 table 2 the high loading of the ca2 mg2 and hco3 in groundwater indicates chemical weathering is prevalent in hydrogeochemistry of the groundwater this has also justified by the gibbs diagram 1970 and piper diagram 1944 of groundwater factor 3 of the pca matrix characterized by the loading of f pb2 and fe2 which accounts for 7 8 of the total variance table 2 loading of groundwater with f in the study area also justified as susceptibility reported by cgwb 2013 few groundwater samples show high concentration pb2 and fe2 mainly due to local input factors 4 of pca matrix shows the loading of the k and dissolves silica accounts for 7 3 of the total variances it indicates chemical weathering dominating in groundwater of the study area factor 5 of pca matrix characterized by loading of k and po4 3 which accounts for 6 5 of total variances it indicates contamination of groundwater at few sampling locations through chemical fertilizer used on agriculture land factor 6 of pca matrix has characterized by orp while factor 7 characterized by the loading of cu2 and no3 it indicates contamination of groundwater factor 8 9 10 and 11 characterized by loading of cu2 fe2 do and k ions respectively table 2 5 3 hydrogeochemical assessment the x y plots of various ions used by hydrologist to understand the geochemistry prevalent in the groundwater aquifer system since hydrogeochemical variations in the hard rock aquifer depend on chemical reactions occurring between these ions guler et al 2002 there are various hydrogeochemical processes oxidation reduction ion exchange evaporation adsorption etc prevalent in the aquifer of the study area 5 3 1 x y plot major ions are those ions possess molar concentration 10 of the total ions molar concentration the x y plots between major ions used in this study for understanding the water chemistry of groundwater as well as for the identification of various factors responsible for the dissolution of these ions in groundwater the graph between hco3 co3 2 vs ca2 mg2 shows most of the samples falls above the equiline 1 1 indicates the significant contribution of alkaline earth metals in alkalinity and hardness of water fig 5 a the natural chemical weathering is mainly responsible for the release of the major ions mg2 ca2 hco3 and co3 2 in groundwater drever 1997 the gibbs diagram 1970 also justifies that chemical weathering is controlling the geochemistry of groundwater fig 7 the graph for tz vs ca2 mg2 shows all groundwater samples fall under equiline 1 1 indicates the increase in the contribution of alkali metals to the total cations fig 5b subba rao et al 2012 the graph between tz vs na k shows all groundwater samples fall under equiline 1 1 fig 5c the most of the samples fall below the line 1 0 5 or very close to 1 0 5 line indicates the dissolution of rock minerals chemical weathering is the major source of these ions subba rao et al 2012 there are few groundwater samples falls above the theoretical line 1 0 5 indicating human activities contribution in a few groundwater samples fig 5c in the graph na k vs cl so4 2 most of the groundwater samples are showing the continuous growth indicates the geogenic origin of these ions fig 5d few groundwater samples scattered indicate human activities contribution may be due to leaching of fertilizer from the agricultural fields fig 5d in the similar source of origin the alkali metals na k increases continuously along with the increase of cl so4 2 ions without any divergence sarin et al 1989 subba rao 2008 datta and tyagi 1996 the graph between na vs cl shows most of the samples fall under equiline 1 1 indicate release of na by chemical weathering of rock minerals meyback 1987 fig 5e there are few exceptions indicating the possibility of contamination from fertilizer industry and agriculture field the graph for na vs hco3 co3 2 is showing most of the water samples falls above equiline 1 1 indicate natural weathering while few samples fall below the theoretical line indicate the contribution through anthropogenic sources in the few locations fig 5f the graph between na vs ca2 indicate a large area of groundwater enriched by these ions by natural weathering and while few locations groundwater contaminated fig 5g subba rao et al 2012 the graph between ec vs na cl shows most of the samples fall in the same position indicate na cl ratio does not change with the change of ec with few exceptions fig 5h these indicate that the increase in conductivity due to the evaporation process by the semi arid climate conditions of the guna district hence it is concluded that the ion exchange process is mainly responsible for the rise of the concentration of na ion while na and cl increases due to evaporation hem 1991 jankowski and acworth 1997 prasad et al 2006 the various x y plots concluded that few groundwater samples contaminated by the agriculture activities and industrial effluent 5 3 2 piper diagram in this study geochemistry of the study area was evaluated by using tri liner piper diagram 1944 fig 6 in this diagram major cations and anions equivalent per million epm percentage values had plotted on the triangular field separately while central diamond field shows complete characteristics of the groundwater guler et al 2002 these cations anions triangles and central diamond field divided into the number of sub areas which represents specific geochemistry of groundwater samples the diagram helped on to classify the groundwater and assessment of geochemistry governing in the groundwater hydrogeochemical facies of the groundwater are defined by arranging major ions in the order of highest to lowest composition with cations listed first followed by the anions piper diagram indicates the dominance of hco3 cl ca2 na and mg2 ion in the groundwater fig 6 the hydrogeochemical facies assessment indicates natural chemical weathering observed in the aquifer of the guna district while few exceptions observed due contamination of groundwater subba rao et al

na and on the basis of anion hydrogeochemical facies it s classified as hco3 cl so4 2 5 3 3 gibbs diagram gibbs diagram 1970 helped in understanding the hydro geochemical process occurring in the groundwater aquifer it also explained the significance of different geochemical processes taking place in the aquifer of the study area through chemical weathering evaporation and atmospheric precipitation process almost all groundwater samples fall in the chemical weathering zone of the gibbs diagram 1970 indicates the dominance of chemical weathering in the geochemistry of groundwater fig 7 it has suggested that rock water interactions prevalent in the aquifer which controls the geochemistry of the groundwater the rock mineral water mixing causes dissolution ion exchange and chemical weathering etc few samples migrated towards evaporation zone indicating high dissolved solids due to water contamination caused by fertilizer used for farming and poor sanitary condition subba rao et al 2012 srivastava and ramanathan 2018b the scattered diagram indicates the influence of anthropogenic sources in few samples 5 3 4 chloro alkaline indices ca the chloro alkaline indices ca are commonly using to understand the rock water interaction ion exchange chemistry between groundwater and geology of the study area schoeller 1955 1967 few groundwater samples show significant proportions of na ions in groundwater may be due to the prevalence of the ion exchange process in the aquifer the ca2 and mg2 ions available in groundwater undergo the ion exchange process with na available in clay minerals are one of the possible reasons for the dominance of the na ion in the aquifer ca calculated by applying the following formulae subba rao et al 2012 schoeller 1955 1967 c a

ca2 mg2 in the groundwater while negative ca indicates the exchange of alkaline earth metals from rock minerals to alkali metals available in the groundwater approximately 70 of groundwater samples show ion exchange of na and k ions from rock minerals to ca2 and mg2 ions available in groundwater ca1 value ranges from 0 01 to 0 82 subba rao et al 2012 pisciotta et al 2018 while 30 of groundwater samples show ca2 and mg2 ions released into groundwater from rock minerals ca1 ranges from 4 20 to 0 01 the variation of ca1 and ca2 for each sampling site has shown in fig 8 5 4 water quality index wqi wqi helped in understanding the total joint impact of the analyzed parameters on the quality of the groundwater all analyzed data have utilized to generate a unitless sub index value the summation of all these sub index values gives wqi of the groundwater it can be calculated by applying the simple formulae as recommended by various researchers horton 1965 batabyal and chakraborty 2015 w q i i

sodium hazard expressed usually in terms of the sodium adsorption ratio sar the continuous uses of groundwater possessing high sar for the irrigation can cause the breakdown in the physical structure of the soil subba rao 2008 karanth 1987 the na ions adsorbed over the soil particles makes it hard compact in dry and difficult for water to percolate in it fine textured soil contains high clay are more susceptible to physical structure breakdown due to high sar sar calculated by following formulae karanth 1987 where all ions in meq l s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 the sar of groundwater collected from the study area indicates 98 of groundwater is good for irrigation considering sodium hazard whose sar value observed 10 around 1 35 of groundwater samples under the permissible limit whose sar value

the sodium hazard on the basis of ssp indicate 38 26 groundwater is excellent for irrigation 44 97 groundwater is good for irrigation 5 37 groundwater is doubtful indicate the sodium hazard can create problems while 1 34 groundwater is unsuitable for the irrigation along with sodium chloride boron is the most concerned for agriculture it also accumulates in the soils like na ion the disproportion between ca2 and mg2 ions in the soils causes problems in the growth of plants few crops are very sensitive towards so4 2 concentration causes the increase in adsorption of na and k ions in the plants and hamper the intake of ca2 and mg2 ions overall it disturbs the equilibrium among cations within plants high concentration of k ions in the few samples causes mg2 ions shortage and iron chlorosis this imbalance can be compensated by high ca2 ion 5 5 2 exchangeable sodium percentage esp the esp value of soil calculated with the help of nomogram which is used for determining the sar value of

defined as the amount of water required to remove the salts from the root zone of plants salinity problems can be minimized by flushing excess quantity of water for the calculated period of times various crops show tolerance level against salinity it can be calculated and further assessment suggests specific types of crops on the basis of salinity of the soil the graph between ec and depth of water table indicate high salinity observed in shallow aquifer than deep aquifers fig 11 it indicates leaching of salts from the surface to the subsurface along with irrigation water these salinity problems in the study can be improved by proper salinity hazard management 8 1 water quality influence on crop yields irrigation water containing high concentrations of na and cl ions cause an adverse effect on the growth of plants few plants suffer to foliar injury due to exposer of leaves through water containing high concentrations of na and cl ions the tolerance limit of plants calculated in the form of exchangeable sodium percentage esp various crops show low acceptance towards salinity at the early stage of seed germination but tolerance limits increases in the later stage of their growth e g zea mays hordeum vulgare triticum aestivum etc few crops show the different level of tolerance at the different phase of their growth e g glycine max etc other crops varieties are showing high tolerance in the early stage of their growth e g beta vulgaris carthamus tinctorius etc crops can be classified into four categories on the basis of the salinity tolerance level these are i tolerant hordeum vulgare asparagus officinalis etc ii moderately tolerant triticum aestivum thinopyrum intermedium cucurbita pepo beta vulgari etc iii moderately sensitive solanum lycopersicum cucumis sativus medicago sativa trifolium hybridum etc and iv sensitive crops allium cepa daucus carota subsp sativus phaseolus vulgaris etc ayers and westcot 1976 the salinity tolerance levels of study area indicate groundwater used for irrigation are influencing the yield of crops like field crops wheat bean broad bean corn cowpea flex groundnut rice safflower sesbania sorghum soybean etc and vegetable crops bean beet broccoli etc the yields of barley cotton and sugar beet do not affect by irrigation with groundwater since salinity tolerance of these crops is high in comparison to the salinity of the irrigated water the statistics of yield potential of few selected crops on the basis of salinity tolerance limit of crops through irrigation water has given in table 4 it indicates salinity of irrigation water do not affect the yield potential of hordeum vulgare barley gossy pium cotton beta vulgaris sugar beet cynodon dactylon bermuda grass thinopyrum ponticum tall wheat grass thinopyrum intermedium wheat grass etc fig 12 the yield potential partially affected in the few crops like arachis hypogaea groundnut 95 30 oryza sativa rice 93 29 carthamus tintorius safflower 97 32 sorghum bicolor sorghum 95 97 glycine max soybean 97 32 triticum aestivum wheat 99 33 beta vulgaris beet 95 97 brassica oleracea var italica broccoli 92 62 cucumis sativus cucumber 90 60 solanum lycopersicum tomato 90 60 hordeum vulgare barley hay 99 32 phalaris aquatic harding grass 97 96 lolium perenne perennial ray grass 97 99 sorghum drummondii sudan grass 92 62 festuca arundinacea tall fescue 95 30 lotus corniculatus trefoil small 97 32 phoenix dactylifera date palm 95 97 ficus carica fig 95 97 olea europaea olive 95 97 punica granatum pomegranate 91 28 etc table 4 few crops are very sensitive

etc table 4 ayers and westcot 1976 hence this groundwater is most suitable for the irrigation of crop like barley cotton sugar beet wheat wheatgrass bermuda grass etc but this can be effectively utilized after salinity management for crops like groundnut rice soybean beet broccoli cucumber tomato harding grass tall fescue trefoil small date palm fig olive and pomegranate 8 2 comparisons between ayers and westcot model and soil water salinity sws model the yields of crops in the study area have been calculated by considering the ayers and westcot model 1976 and sws model suarez et al 2010 crop yields calculated by considering the salinity tolerance limit of the crops for 100 yields and salinity of the study area fig 12 reduction in crop yield observed almost similar range in both ayers and westcot model and sws model up to the salinity of irrigation water 1 5 ms cm suarez et al 2010 suarez 2012a b according to the ayers and westcot model sharp decline in the yields of crop observed after 1 5 ms cm salinity of irrigation water and reaches up to 10 of crop yields while as per sws model moderate decline observed suarez 2012a b 9 conclusion the hydrogeochemical assessment of the groundwater quality has performed with the objectives to determine the suitability of groundwater for irrigation crop yield and drinking purpose through graphical multivariate statistics and geochemical modeling this study indicates the dominance of chemical weathering in the aquifer of the study area with few exceptions indicating anthropogenic input through agricultural land and industries most of the groundwater samples indicate high salinity hazard problems and poor sodium hazard problems the salinity hazard preferably observed in the shallow aquifer the high salinity in shallow aquifer makes difficult for salinity management because water consumed by plants released in the atmosphere by evaporation and dissolved salts left in soil further increases its salinity statistical assessment of salinity hazard indicates the yield few crops unaffected if irrigated by this groundwater these crops are barley cotton sugar beet bermuda grass tall wheat grass etc while few shows a partial decrease in yield percentage if irrigated by this groundwater these crops are groundnut rice soya bean beet broccoli cucumber tomato harding grass tall fescue trefoil small date palm fig olive and pomegranate hence this groundwater is most suitable for irrigation of crop like barley cotton sugar beet wheat wheat grass and bermuda grass etc but this can be effectively utilized after salinity management for crops like groundnut rice soya bean beet broccoli cucumber tomato harding grass tall fescue trefoil small date palm fig olive and pomegranate this groundwater is unsuitable for the irrigation of the crops like bean carrot and strawberry since these crops are very sensitive to salinity hazard the assessment of statistics of the hydro geochemical data for two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 indicate some significant spatial and temporal variation in a few geochemical parameters good charge balance observed in most of the groundwater samples with the error within 5 0 it concluded geogenic process contributing significantly in the geochemistry of the groundwater with few exceptions due to contamination of groundwater from agriculture fields and known industrial effluents almost all groundwater samples were colorless and odorless with high do with exceptions at few sampling locations gibbs diagram indicates chemical weathering is mainly responsible for the enrichment of cations and anions in groundwater samples collected from extensive agriculture field zone show contamination of groundwater in comparison to another zone the geochemical modeling of groundwater indicates the dominance of ca2 and mg2 over k and na in hydro geochemical facies indicate natural weathering is dominating the piper diagram indicates most of the groundwater samples are ca mg hco3 water types the chloro alkaline indices indicate 70 groundwater show ion exchange of na and k from rock minerals to ca2 and mg2 ions available in groundwater while 30 of groundwater

groundwater contaminated through caso4 2h2o the hydrogeochemistry of this part of india is primarily depending on the geogenic process chemical weathering ion exchange adsorption and absorption precipitation and evaporation occurring in the aquifer system while few samples show contamination from the agricultural field the water samples collected from the extensive cultivated area more contaminated in comparison to the other regions of the study area water quality index wqi is changing with the change of water tables depth the statistics indicate that 22 33 groundwater suitable for drinking 71 53 groundwater considered poor 5 40 groundwater very poor water category and 0 74 groundwater unsuitable for drinking purpose the similar range of the crop yields observed in both ayers and westcot model and sws model if the salinity of the irrigation water is low 1 5 ms cm while higher crop yields observed according to sws model in comparisons to ayers and westcot model if the salinity of the irrigation water is high 1 5 ms cm the major reduction in crop yields observed in ayers and westcot model while a moderate decline in crop yields observed in sws model at higher salinity crop yield in the study area can be improved by implementing proper irrigation water management agriculture water management can reduce the basic problems of the low yield of crops in this

measures based on aquatic macroinvertebrates were utilized at two flow contrasting periods compared to reference sites intensive and semi intensive practices produced low to moderate impact regarding to oxygen saturation conductivity and nutrient levels but strong alteration of the riparian ecosystem and of the in stream habitat condition were detected e coli counting resulted in declining of water quality at both intensive and semi intensive management and exceeded the recommended critical value for recreational purposes plecoptera and trichoptera richness significantly diminished at most impacted sites during low water period in addition several macroinvertebrate metrics displayed negative and significant responses to ammonia level increases evidencing a possible toxicity effect our findings suggest that these emergent practices which are rapidly expanding in a relatively undeveloped area might have negative impacts mitigation measures for stream protection should be recommended

an important role in the economy of the country historically beef production has been sustained mostly on natural forages in extensive modalities but in the last decades and for several reasons increased demand profitability climatic constrains etc the technology of production has significantly changed with the consequent movement and intensification of the cattle activity towards marginal zones and confined systems oesterheld 2008 rizzo et al 2012 this situation has extended to extrapampean areas including territories not traditionally dedicated to the beef industry as patagonia although a low percentage of argentine beef production 2 beef cattle of the national inventory occurs in the patagonia ecoregion arelovich et al 2011 there is a strong concern of how this increasing

pervasive effects on water quality biodiversity and ecological conditions of the streams in which operation are conducted malan et al 2018 at present it is crucial to generate a background of knowledge about possible impact of livestock breeding including more emergent land use practices confined on the aquatic environment and the biota in order to design mitigation measures for agroecosystems in patagonia herrero and gil 2008 the present study was conducted to determine the effect of periodically confined animal production systems intensive semi intensive on water quality including physicochemical and bacteriological conditions riparian health in stream habitat and aquatic macroinvertebrates at three piedmont streams in patagonia the specific objectives were 1 to examine changes in nutrient levels and macroinvertebrate metrics by contrasting effects on reference and disturbed situations 2 to assess integrity of the riparian corridor and habitat conditions in the aquatic systems employing adapted indexes for patagonian streams and 3 to identify possible measures of water protection and management that can ameliorate negative effects patagonia is one of the more remote biomes under increasing threat from agriculture at same time their features of rural and wilderness make a target of ecotourism destination there is need of understanding for water management and conservation issues and this work attempts to provide an important baseline for future research 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we selected three small tributaries that drain into the corintos river percy futaleufú system in the norwest of chubut province argentina the studied sub basins are ruca enna and ingram from a transitional area in the mountains and piedmont close to trevelin city and la aldea village fig 1 streams are located in the andean humid biozone del valle et al 1998 which is characterized by a high rainfall west east decreasing gradient 3000 to 800 mm y 1 and mean annual air temperature that ranges from 6 to 11 c vegetation corresponds to the subantarctic forest characterized by perennial austrocedrus chilensis nothofagus dombeyi and maytenus boaria and deciduous tree species nothofagus pumilio and nothofagus antarctica whereas the shrub and herbaceous strata are composed mainly of chusquea culeou berberis buxifolia fuchsia magellanica aristotelia chilensis oenothera odorata fragaria chiloensis and geranium sp the dominant soils in the area are molisols and inceptisols which have a good permeability and drainage panigatti 2010 most streams and rivers display a bimodal regime discharge coincidently with the rainfall period winter and the snowmelt spring coronato and del valle 1988 in terms of rainfall 994 mm y 1 the studied period was quite regular and very close to the historical mean annual value for the area fig 2 besides studied streams presented a wide thermal range with water temperature ranging between 2 5 e4 winter and 20 c e4 summer table 2 2 2 land use practices intensive confined fattening an emerging modality beef cattle is produced in all of continental argentina latitudes 21 48 to 50 01 s arelovich et al 2011 in chubut province most landowners dedicated to livestock production 76 2 have 100 cows or less whereas the rest 23 8 own between 101 and 500 head of livestock the stock in the province had displayed a 140 increase in the last decade guitart 2017 the major part of livestock breeding is carried out on valleys wetlands mallines and piedmont areas with potential for foraging including lands at forested areas suggested rotational practices for livestock are achieved by most landowners this includes moving animals for breeding and fattening to better forage areas in the valleys during spring nakamatsu 2006 nevertheless the tendency at present is to complete all steps at places that traditionally were assigned for breeding thus keeping the animals in a parcel the entire year or a large part of it livestock fattening is achieved in confined areas some systems are sustained also by combining natural pastures and supplementing with hay bales but others farms are using grains small silos and soft silos with low rotational practices guitart 2017 the modalities of livestock breeding in the region depend on the animal load per unit area and offer of natural forage and can be defined to our study area as follows extensive 1 semi intensive 1 10 and intensive 10 animals per hectare iglesias et al 2015 related with the livestock number in operations two main confined animal production modalities can be found one is the confined breeding medium to large farms in which beef production is based on grains transported from the pampean region formulated feeds corn barley etc and occasionally complemented with pasture bales of local production in addition silo bales are being used for corn and sorghum stocking the other modality mostly employed by small family farms is mixed with livestock breeding on pastures and fattening 4 months being finished at confined areas iglesias et al 2015 as early explained the regulation framework was approved during 2016 after the present study was conducted 2015 2016 for this reason there were not any kind of storage and disposal of wastes in the soils in particular at these systems the use of chemical fertilizers or herbicides is not a disseminated practice horticulture productions are conducted in a very small scale familiar and pasture production mostly for self supply 2 3 sampling sites selection the study attempted to analyze different situations at three small sub basins for this reason our design was not limited to reference vs disturbed paired sites and then additional sampling sites were placed in the longitudinal dimension of each stream usda 2003 stream sampling sites were located as follows three sites at ruca s r1 r2 and r3 four at enna s e1 e2 e3 and e4 and four at ingram s i1 i2 i3 and i4 the selected streams have no tributaries in the studied segments i e r1 r3 e1 e4 and i1 i4 fig 1 there is a hydrological intervention bypass through a concrete channel 1 m width that transfers water natural slope gradient from the percy river between i2 and i3 sites the channel was constructed for irrigation purposes and is active mostly during summer months the management of this water channel is not supervised and each landowner obtains water mostly in summer dry season in all cases sites numbered as 1 r1 e1 and i1 were stated as reference sites thus they were chosen for their best conditions and without the disturbance intensive semi intensive practice being tested since extensive livestock is one of the more disseminated activities in the region it is difficult to find pristine or intact sites nevertheless reference sites chosen presented 0 5 cow per hectare at ruca stream r2 was located near a small pork farming facility having mitigation measures and excluding animal access to the stream site r3 correspond to a confined animal production system a cow calf operation with silo bales and grains at the site higher stocking rates 51 100 cows ha occurred from july to october whereas a lower number of animals 11 50 cows ha was present from october to november the confined system included a stream segment 200 m where animals have free access to the stream all the year table 1 at enna stream e1 reference site was placed in a relatively low developed area 0 5 cows per hectare e2 and e3 were located in an area of extensive cattle management and some farms with small horticulture production site e4 corresponded to a wetland area connected with the stream which supports livestock in a semi intensive modality non confined that feed on natural grassland and are supplemented with pasture bales at ingram stream i2 and i3 were mostly associated to extensive cattle site i4 corresponded to a confined animal facility silo bale and grains the highest cow load occur mostly from july to november 51 100 cows ha whereas a lower number of animals are breeding from december to april 11 50 cows ha table 1 2 4 environmental characterization the study was conducted between july 2015 and april 2016 stream sampling sites were visited bimonthly july august winter october november december spring 2015 february summer and april autumn 2016 daily records of rainfall and mean air temperature were obtained from instituto nacional de tecnología agropecuaria campo anexo trevelin inta since farming operation occurred from july to november the design attempted to examine conditions previous during and after the operations and also to include hydrological periods at streams that are highly dependent on rain fig 1 the design looked for to examine condition avoiding rainstorms because some effect can be maximized for runoff in addition the chosen temporal sequence had the aim to be concurrent with the macroinvertebrate survey at two contrasting periods low and high water period substratum composition on the stream bottom at each site was estimated using a 1 m2 grid and recorded as percentages of boulders cobbles gravel pebbles and sand current speed was measured in mid channel on three occasions by timing a float average of three trials as it moved over a distance of 10 m gordon et al 1994 average depth was estimated from five measurements along one transect across the channel with a calibrated stick wet and dry widths of the channel were also determined there are not stream gauging stations at studied streams and then discharge was obtained by combining depth wet width and current velocity at each sampling date as in gordon et al 1994 on each sampling occasion water temperature c electrical conductivity μs20 cm 1 ph dissolved oxygen mg o2 l 1 and oxygen saturation o2 were obtained with a multi parameter probe hach sension 156 water samples 2 l were collected below the water surface and kept at 4 c until further analyses in the laboratory nutrients analyzed include ammonia nh4 nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen no3 no2 and soluble reactive phosphorus srp all determinations were made with a dr6000 spectrophotometer and based on usepa approved or accepted methods outlined in hach water analysis handbook hach co 2007 total suspended solids tss 0 1 mg l 1 were estimated by filtering a known volume of water with pre weighted fiberglass filters dried 110 c 4 h and re weighted awwa 1998 for microbiological studies august and november water samples were collected under sterile conditions and placed in sterile screw capped glass bottles taking into consideration the standard methods of handling water samples bacteriological analysis of water samples was done within 24 h of collection the bacteriological examination of water samples included the colony forming units cfu of presumptive total coliforms thermotolerant coliforms and escherichia coli cfu 100 ml water the culture medium used to detect total coliforms was the lauril triptosa broth of double and simple concentration in the presumptive stage and brilliant green bile lactose broth bgbl in the confirmatory stage following american water works association methods awwa 1998 pigment analysis was performed in order to estimate periphyton biomass measurement were conducted in august november 2015 and april 2016 three periphyton samples were collected from riffles at each site each sample consisted of the scraped material from three randomly selected rocks 20 cm2 the content was preserved in water from the site and cooled while transported in dark containers to the laboratory where they were filtered on gf ff filters all samples were frozen until analysis chlorophyll a was extracted from filters in 90 acetone and measured spectrophotometrically with correction by phaeopigments according to standard methods awwa 1998 wetzel and likens 1991 2 5 macroinvertebrate sampling and assessment macroinvertebrates were assessed on two contrasting flow conditions low october november 2015 and high august 2015 water period samples were taken with a surber sampler 0 09 m2 250 μm pore size from riffles n 3 and pools n 3 at each visit and sites e3 and e4 were excluded for their hydrological conditions connected wetland making not possible to use the surber device samples were fixed in situ with 4 formaldehyde and sorted in the laboratory under at least 5x magnification macroinvertebrate species were identified using available keys fernández and domínguez 2001 we tested a variety of single benthic macroinvertebrate metrics selected from previous studies conducted in the region miserendino et al 2011 epele and miserendino 2015 which are mostly based on qualitative data total richness ephemeroptera e richness plecoptera p richness trichoptera t richness coleoptera c richness number of ept taxa number of eptc taxa number of insect families number of chironomidae taxa and number of orthocladiinae taxa the predicted response of each metric to disturbance is presented in table 5 in addition two regionally defined biotic indexes the iap andean patagonian index and the bmps biotic monitoring patagonian stream index were employed and water quality judgements were obtained miserendino and pizzolón 1999 the iap works with genus family level and computes known responses of taxa to organic enrichment the potential range of the iap is 1 most disturbed to 10 best class condition the bmps is computed by adding pollution sensitivity scores 1 10 for all invertebrate families present at a site for a potential range of 0 most disturbed to 150 least disturbed 2 6 habitat conditions and riparian ecosystem integrity for evaluation of possible disturbance produced by livestock on in stream conditions and on the riparian corridors two indexes commonly used for streams in the patagonia mountain area were utilized at each sampling site the ha habitat condition index was applied to evaluate habitat quality using the assessment procedure for high gradient streams of barbour et al 1999 this method ranks 10 river channel features e g epifaunal substrate availability embeddedness sediment deposition frequency of riffles bank stability etc from 0 to 20 a score of 200 points indicates that the river is natural and pristine and in its best possible condition range 150 200 this index evaluates the ability of the stream s physical habitat to support a given fauna and then is a measure of the spatial heterogeneity of the stream castela et al 2008 the complexity and the attributes of the riparian vegetation in a 100 m reach were also analysed using an adaptation of the qbr index riparian corridor quality index munné et al 1998 for patagonian streams the qbrp kutschker et al 2009 this index combines information from four additive metrics total cover proportion of the riparian area covered by trees and shrubs structure proportion of riparian vegetation composed by trees and shrubs separately complexity and naturalness of vegetation number of trees or shrub species and absence of introduced species and other human impacts in riparian vegetation and the degree of channel naturalness e g bank modifications dredging etc it also takes into account differences in the geomorphology of the river from its headwaters to the lower reaches the total qbrp score ranges from 0 extreme degradation to 100 points excellent quality natural riparian forest most intensive and semi intensive developments occupying stream reaches are not employing actions to ameliorate possible disturbance from livestock nevertheless some mitigation practices detected at sampling points e g shorelines filled with gravel livestock exclusion with fences etc were itemized and described in addition all other types of land use practices present in the reach were listed and mitigation if present was recorded 2 7 statistical analysis spatial trends in water quality were graphically examined using the qgis software 2 14 15 version essen non parametric kruskal wallis and paired mann whitney test p 0 05 were run to assess differences in environmental conditions between reference and impaired sites sokal and rohlf 1995 a pearson correlations matrix was performed to identify redundant environmental variables an r critical value r 0 70 p 0 001 was used as evidence of which variables provide the same information after the procedure variables excluded were air temperature oxygen saturation bacteria and dry channel width a principal component analysis pca was then conducted on log x 1 transformed remaining environmental variables to interpret this analysis we used the loadings of each variable on the components of the pca and examined the location of sites according the main gradient captured by two first axes ludwing and reynolds 1988 a spearman s rank correlations matrix was calculated to assess macroinvertebrate metric responses to environmental variables at sampling sites the procedure was carried out using the corrplot package wei and simko 2016 in the statistical software r version 3 2 3 r development core team 2016 a significance level of 0 05 was used for all tests 3 results 3 1 physicochemical features and water quality status at most sites the substrate particle size was mainly cobble and pebble however a higher proportion of sand sedimentation symptoms was found at semi lentic sites e3 and e4 mean depth and mean wet channel width varied considerably among sites table 2 although sites i1 and i2 were dry mostly in summer i1 starting november and i2 starting january they displayed high discharge during winter and spring as the diversion channel was active during summer months some water was sporadically derived to ingram lowland sites i3 and i4 from november 2015 to april 2016 therefore these sites had enough water even in the driest period 0 21 m3 s 1 mean electrical conductivity values ranged from 56 5 to 108 3 μs cm 1 i1 to i4 and 53 3 to 109 2 μs cm 1 e1 to e4 table 2 observed differences were significant when comparing references vs disturbed table 3 oxygen depletion was significant within ingram stream sites i2 i3 and when contrasting all reference and disturbed sites at the three streams r d table 3 there were no significant differences in the mean values of nitrite plus nitrate among sites a significant increase in srp values was observed at enna system when comparing e2 and e4 table 3 spatial variation of mean values of ammonia nh4 electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen o2 total of suspended solids tss chlorophyll a and bacteria escherichia coli are presented in fig 3 at ingram stream conductivity chlorophyll a and e coli increased downstream whereas dissolved oxygen decreased from i1 to i4 instead ammonia and tss levels did not display a particular pattern enna system showed a downstream increment in the mean values of ammonia conductivity and tss and an opposite response for dissolved oxygen although ruca system does not show changes in ammonia concentration and conductivity a stepped increase in chlorophyll a bacteria and tss was observed and also a decrease in dissolved oxygen similar to those seen in the other systems fig 3 e coli count ranged from 7 7 cfu at i2 august to 700 cfu at i3 i4 august i3 e3 r3 october and i4 in november ranges of mean values per site are shown in fig 3f the principal component analyses pca revealed that chemical physical and biological data provided a clear distinction between streams according to a disturbance gradient but also revealed the seasonal variability fig 4 table 4 the first two factors accounted for most of the variation in the data set 63 8 the pca1 44 8 highlighted the gradient of disturbance i e high positive loadings by tss nh4 and conductivity and also the changes on flow attributes according to season i e negative loadings by wet channel width discharge depth and velocity table 4 then most reference sites having better water quality conditions were positioned on the left side of pca1 and more degraded sites on the right of same axis the pca2 19 underlined a gradient in nutrient enrichment and eutrophy i e positive loadings by srp and chlorophyll a 3 2 habitat condition and riparian quality index habitat condition index values ranged between 83 marginal and 180 optimal all upstream sites i1 e1 and r1 presented an optimal score for habitat condition 150 points with the best situation for i1 180 fig 5 a nevertheless e1 and r1 had low scores in the item channel alteration bank stability and riparian vegetative zone width the worst situations were observed in i4 and r3 where the main alterations detected were margin erosion due to vegetation removal higher embeddedness caused by sedimentation and loss of epifaunal substrate availability since ha is an index to be applicable at streams it was not calculated for e3 and e4 sites connected wetland the qbrp scores showed that upstream sites with little agricultural use had a good quality of the riparian ecosystem while the sites i2 i3 e2 e4 and r2 displayed some alteration on the river corridor most degraded sites were i4 e3 and r3 strong alteration of the riparian corridor among others by loss of the complexity and naturalness of the vegetation due to cows foraging in the riparian area fig 5b 3 3 aquatic macroinvertebrates responses metrics and biotic indexes the range average standard deviation and expected response to disturbance of calculated metrics is presented in table 5 macroinvertebrate total richness ranged from 16 i1 to 50 r2 taxa per site during the study appendix 1 of the set of invertebrate metrics we tested the richness of plecoptera trichoptera ept and eptc groups showed a marked decreasing pattern along ruca system particularly during the low water period moreover from i3 to i4 plecoptera and coleoptera taxa were totally dislodged in the same period regarding biotic indexes only bmps displayed low scores at i1 and i2 probably in responses to natural causes flow intermittency several expected and significant relationships were obtained when correlated metrics with environmental variables linked with water quality e g ammonia conductivity bacteria etc fig 6 a higher number of significant correlations were identified between richness measures and ammonia suggesting toxicity effects 4 discussion 4 1 livestock and water quality confined production animal in both intensive and semi intensive modalities resulted in low to moderate impact regarding to oxygen saturation conductivity shilla and shilla 2011 and nutrient levels mckergow et al 2012 the most affected reaches were i4 and e4 which displayed increases in conductivity twofold increase and in soluble reactive phosphorus at e4 twofold increase nevertheless at ruca the animal operation r3 did not result in substantial changes in most variables although a marked increase in tss six fold increase was observed during summer davies colley et al 2004 declerck et al 2006 niyogi et al 2007 on the other hand our analysis integrating all sites at studied basins pca ordination highlighted a gradient of disturbance being the set of environmental variables retained strongly linked with water quality parameters tss ammonia conductivity shilla and shilla 2011 scanes 2018 nutrient levels here observed were markedly high compared with those reported for extensive livestock management at piedmont streams in the region miserendino et al 2011 but similar to documented at intensively grazed flooded wetland areas kutschker et al 2014 epele and miserendino 2015 regarding ammonia levels extreme values occurred concurrently with livestock presence on the shoreline or at months with the highest stocking rates riley et al 2003 garcía et al 2015 livestock can affect significantly nutrient distribution as animals tend to deposit more excreta in lounging areas near shade and water miller et al 2011 and as observed here when cattle access to the streams is unrestricted vidon et al 2008 our design attempted to assess the effect of different modalities of localized livestock production however other sources of disturbances e g runoff are likely to contribute in part to explain observed patterns as expected at cold temperate streams in the area brand and miserendino 2015 most sites were well oxygenated although oxygen depletion was evident at lower sites at ingram 30 to 50 and at enna 60 in summer probably in response to an increase in organic matter and bacteria sánchez et al 2007 scanes 2018 livestock activity at the ruca stream significantly affected e coli count at both high and low water periods in addition e coli counting resulted in water quality declining at both semi intensive management i3 e3 and confined animal operation r3 i4 line 2003 miller et al 2010a regarding the framework directives for surface water protection the confined operation sites exceeded the recommended critical value for e coli 320 cfu dpn 2006 pcia de chubut 2016 epa 2012 besides this value was surpassed even at fenced sites with livestock exclusion i3 probably associated with runoff from surrounding areas collins and rutherford 2004 nevertheless fencing appears as a useful mitigation option to reduce faecal contamination of stream bed sediments bragina et al 2017 epilithic production chlorophyll a increased at confined animal production areas in which nutrient enrichment from urine and fecal excretes combined with a higher solar exposition open canopy sites resulted in augment of primary producers miserendino et al 2016 nevertheless this parameter chlorophyll a is not always useful to discriminate the effects of grazing on watercourses scrimgeour and kendall 2003 masi and miserendino 2009 4 2 livestock and aquatic ecosystem integrity it was evident that this new confined animal operation modalities are producing significant impact on the riparian corridors and in the in stream habitat conditions scrimgeour and kendall 2003 ranganath et al 2009 rosso and fernández cirelli 2013 most judgment classes from qbrp index applied at confined operations indicated strong riparian ecosystem alteration as expected best condition were found at reference sites kutschker et al 2009 however some alterations were identified even at intermediate sampling points evidencing other types of disturbances derived from extensive livestock breeding vidon et al 2008 kaucner et al 2013 seemingly even in low stocking rates livestock keep foraging on grasses and herbaceous strata in the riparian corridor ranganath et al 2009 as here documented the use of drinking supplies or off stream watering systems not appear as a common practice neither the exclusion of livestock from streams malan et al 2018 miller et al 2018 the existence of fences at r2 and at i3 was effective enhancing the riparian ecosystem conditions in which judgment criteria resulted in higher scores better quality than at unfenced sites as expected maximum scores for ha index corresponded to reference sites although some of them displayed incipient degradation which is similar to observed in a study conducted in a nearby basin miserendino et al 2016 nevertheless the worst situations were identified at the stream reaches having confined animal operations a high negative incidence on the in stream habitat quality was linked with pasture land uses miserendino et al 2011 most common habitat disturbances were related to erosion processes and livestock trampling that in turn resulted in higher embeddedness fine sediments deposition and loss of channel sinuosity magner et al 2008 scanes 2018 at most impacted sites the availability of epifaunal substrate was strongly reduced by the homogenization of the channel the alteration in the riffle pond sequence and the monopolization of the substrate one macrophytes species among other things sutherland et al 2012 brand and miserendino 2015 a good habitat condition is essential for the survival of aquatic organisms endemic invertebrates fish etc and even in modified landscapes strong relationships between the biota attributes and habitat quality can be found d ambrosio et al 2014 for this reason we consider this index as a useful tool for early awareness in extensive and intensive livestock development in the area and convenient to transfer information about conservation issues to landowners 4 3 effect on aquatic communities our results demonstrated that macroinvertebrates were affected by livestock confined operation with some sensitive or intolerant species being locally eliminated during the low water period at ruca and ingram disturbed sites this pattern was particularly marked at ruca because from r2 to r3 the ept group was reduced up to 50 several works found that species of plecoptera ephemeroptera and trichoptera resulted useful to detect impairment derived from extensive livestock practices sutherland et al 2012 brand and miserendino 2015 and pastoral impact niyogi et al 2007 shilla and shilla 2011 goss et al 2014 a study on streams affected by feedlots at vaal river catchment south africa revealed differences on number of invertebrate families and diversity respect to reference sites jonker et al 2009 nevertheless ranganath et al 2009 reported that macroinvertebrates responses appeared weak when contrasting assemblages with and without livestock exclusion at virginia streams usa additional macroinvertebrate measurements density structure functional attributes etc should be considered in future approaches in order to visualize other effects that could have missed with qualitative metrics goss et al 2014 4 4 management practices to reduce livestock impact even though most studied sites lacked mitigation practices for stream protection we identified some specific actions in the riverbanks at confined animal operation sites that probably help to diminish damage the intentional deposition of cobble gravel substrates in specifics riverbank areas e g muddy areas with the purpose of avoiding livestock injuries could diminish turbidity and sediment deposition schueler and brown 2004 this action can limit the potential of soil detachment and subsequent transport into the channel bed magner et al 2008 garcía et al 2015 there were not specific measures for effluent control at intensive livestock operation one inexpensive and environmentally sustainable strategy to remove pollutants is the phytoremediation using aquatic plants rizzo et al 2012 that could be an alternative to reduce eutrophication and toxicity effect from wastes which altered sensitive aquatic biota it was evident that riparian integrity was better in those sites in which the livestock was excluded and then their qbrp scores were higher suggesting a good level of conservation miller et al 2010a miller et al 2010b documented strong recovery of the river corridor in areas with cattle exclusion in addition these beneficial management practices prevented water quality degradation 5 conclusion due to economical perspectives and scarce margin for incomes from agricultural activities in argentina often landowners are not aware of the environmental impacts of their productions garcía et al 2015 conservation action in modified rural and agricultural landscapes at patagonia streams should include among others off stream watering facilities for livestock exclusion of cattle or livestock from the main channel stream by fences or electrical artifacts and reinforcement of riverbanks with cobble gravel at crossing areas to prevent water pollution with animal wastes macrophyte treatments pond farms could be an alternative new questions about the impact of confined animal production systems on water quality and aquatic communities inhabiting streams should be addressed in future studies wilderness of the landscape and pristine conditions of water resources are essential to develop several economic activities in

11117,breeding of livestock in confined areas has recently become an alternative of production for farmers in northwest patagonia strong concern about how these practices can alter health and integrity of streams exists and mitigation measures from livestock impact have been recently incorporated to the legislation we examined changes in water quality riparian integrity habitat conditions and macroinvertebrates community at three low order streams having different modalities of animal production management the general design included visits at 11 sites comprising references sites in a bimonthly scheme we assessed hydrological and physicochemical features including oxygen conductivity nutrients and total suspended solids epilithic chlorophyll and bacteria total coliforms and e coli were also measured integrity of each site was assessed by two adapted indexes for patagonian streams riparian ecosystem quality qbrp and habitat condition ha a suite of 12 qualitative bioindicator measures based on aquatic macroinvertebrates were utilized at two flow contrasting periods compared to reference sites intensive and semi intensive practices produced low to moderate impact regarding to oxygen saturation conductivity and nutrient levels but strong alteration of the riparian ecosystem and of the in stream habitat condition were detected e coli counting resulted in declining of water quality at both intensive and semi intensive management and exceeded the recommended critical value for recreational purposes plecoptera and trichoptera richness significantly diminished at most impacted sites during low water period in addition several macroinvertebrate metrics displayed negative and significant responses to ammonia level increases evidencing a possible toxicity effect our findings suggest that these emergent practices which are rapidly expanding in a relatively undeveloped area might have negative impacts mitigation measures for stream protection should be recommended to landowners through conservation programs keywords physicochemical quality livestock bioindicators patagonia 1 introduction cattle rearing and export is one of argentina s key industries and plays an important role in the economy of the country historically beef production has been sustained mostly on natural forages in extensive modalities but in the last decades and for several reasons increased demand profitability climatic constrains etc the technology of production has significantly changed with the consequent movement and intensification of the cattle activity towards marginal zones and confined systems oesterheld 2008 rizzo et al 2012 this situation has extended to extrapampean areas including territories not traditionally dedicated to the beef industry as patagonia although a low percentage of argentine beef production 2 beef cattle of the national inventory occurs in the patagonia ecoregion arelovich et al 2011 there is a strong concern of how this increasing activity could affect the ecosystem sustainability the variety of wastes or residues produced could have negative consequences especially on aquatic resources herrero and gil 2008 garcía et al 2015 in the patagonian mountain valleys livestock breeding is settled at areas in which the water accessibility is assured then these activities which are conducted under different modalities depending on forage offer and animal load capacity extensive semi intensive and intensive are frequently associated to free flowing watercourses including springs streams and rivers among them piedmont permanent streams can be vulnerable to the presence of cattle because they are usually small sized and the cattle cannot always be excluded especially at farms in certain areas in which the necessary investment on fences and infrastructure e g mechanical troughs for livestock watering is high epele and miserendino 2015 or complex to achieve bossio et al 2010 miller et al 2018 inadequate practices resulting from livestock farming have pervasive effects on water quality and on the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems dodds and oakes 2006 hughes et al 2016 scanes 2018 there are several pathways in which cattle modify the physical chemical and microbiological quality of streams and produce damage on riparian areas adverse physical environmental effects derived from trampling are the increases of erosion risk malan et al 2018 soil damage magner et al 2008 changes in stream channel morphology substrate composition bank stability hydrology scrimgeour and kendall 2003 and degradation of water quality for suspended sediments hughes et al 2016 the introduction of excretes fecal and urine into the stream increases nutrient levels in the water the forms of nitrogen nitrates ammonia and phosphorus phosphates can lead to eutrophication processes generating concern in areas that are naturally low in nutrients scanes 2018 besides possible toxicity effects from organic pollution can be attributable to the ammonia forms in some cases having consequences on the biota aquatic invertebrates fish miserendino et al 2016 in addition substances related with animal health drugs of veterinary use that contact surface waters through livestock wastes can result in ecotoxicological impacts mesa et al 2018 the presence of pathogens in the water also has been associated to farms activities poma et al 2012 and high levels of fecal bacteria are recorded downstream animal production systems collins and rutherford 2004 bacteria from livestock can enter streams in runoff or are deposited directly when animals have access to streams vondracek et al 2005 xue et al 2018 other additional consequences of increased fecal coliform counts and organic matter are the declining in dissolved oxygen concentrations rizzo et al 2012 livestock can significantly impact riparian zones by trampling and foraging cattle can alter the biomass of riparian vegetation and modify the in stream vegetation cover muenz et al 2006 also livestock trampling can result in both degradation and reduction of suitable in stream habitats which is important to aquatic organism survival declerck et al 2006 besides the above listed detectable effects on water physicochemical conditions it is important to assess the impact on the resident biota which are natural monitors of environmental quality and can reveal the effects of episodic as well as cumulative pollution and habitat alteration barbour et al 1999 2006 macrobenthic organisms have been the most commonly used as indicators of running water quality worldwide in patagonia most detected responses to stream degradation derived from anthropogenic intervention have been the elimination or diminution of sensitive invertebrate aquatic biota e g ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera and the increase of tolerant species oligochaete chironomidae miserendino et al 2008 2011 2016 different modalities of livestock feeding are currently implemented in the area extensive cow calf operations finishing production systems as the demand and profitability has increased landowners have invested in infrastructure for food stocking grain small silos soft silos hay bales etc and confined beef production systems are undoubtedly growing up iglesias et al 2015 as same time governmental policies about stream protective measures has been generated at different regions of the country but to implement that regulation has been difficult garcía et al 2015 at developed regions e g buenos aires province regulatory guidelines were setting out but experts have noticed that some adjustment and expansion of existing regulations is required garcía et al 2016 in the chubut province a legislation regarding waste management of agricultural production systems was recently approved dpn 2006 pcia de chubut 2016 in that waste and manure disposal effluent treatments and residual water reuse was delineated however the regulation do not consider among other the implementation of devices as off stream watering systems and the restrictions of livestock access to the watercourses e g electrical devices becerra et al 2017 agricultural practices can have pervasive effects on water quality biodiversity and ecological conditions of the streams in which operation are conducted malan et al 2018 at present it is crucial to generate a background of knowledge about possible impact of livestock breeding including more emergent land use practices confined on the aquatic environment and the biota in order to design mitigation measures for agroecosystems in patagonia herrero and gil 2008 the present study was conducted to determine the effect of periodically confined animal production systems intensive semi intensive on water quality including physicochemical and bacteriological conditions riparian health in stream habitat and aquatic macroinvertebrates at three piedmont streams in patagonia the specific objectives were 1 to examine changes in nutrient levels and macroinvertebrate metrics by contrasting effects on reference and disturbed situations 2 to assess integrity of the riparian corridor and habitat conditions in the aquatic systems employing adapted indexes for patagonian streams and 3 to identify possible measures of water protection and management that can ameliorate negative effects patagonia is one of the more remote biomes under increasing threat from agriculture at same time their features of rural and wilderness make a target of ecotourism destination there is need of understanding for water management and conservation issues and this work attempts to provide an important baseline for future research 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area we selected three small tributaries that drain into the corintos river percy futaleufú system in the norwest of chubut province argentina the studied sub basins are ruca enna and ingram from a transitional area in the mountains and piedmont close to trevelin city and la aldea village fig 1 streams are located in the andean humid biozone del valle et al 1998 which is characterized by a high rainfall west east decreasing gradient 3000 to 800 mm y 1 and mean annual air temperature that ranges from 6 to 11 c vegetation corresponds to the subantarctic forest characterized by perennial austrocedrus chilensis nothofagus dombeyi and maytenus boaria and deciduous tree species nothofagus pumilio and nothofagus antarctica whereas the shrub and herbaceous strata are composed mainly of chusquea culeou berberis buxifolia fuchsia magellanica aristotelia chilensis oenothera odorata fragaria chiloensis and geranium sp the dominant soils in the area are molisols and inceptisols which have a good permeability and drainage panigatti 2010 most streams and rivers display a bimodal regime discharge coincidently with the rainfall period winter and the snowmelt spring coronato and del valle 1988 in terms of rainfall 994 mm y 1 the studied period was quite regular and very close to the historical mean annual value for the area fig 2 besides studied streams presented a wide thermal range with water temperature ranging between 2 5 e4 winter and 20 c e4 summer table 2 2 2 land use practices intensive confined fattening an emerging modality beef cattle is produced in all of continental argentina latitudes 21 48 to 50 01 s arelovich et al 2011 in chubut province most landowners dedicated to livestock production 76 2 have 100 cows or less whereas the rest 23 8 own between 101 and 500 head of livestock the stock in the province had displayed a 140 increase in the last decade guitart 2017 the major part of livestock breeding is carried out on valleys wetlands mallines and piedmont areas with potential for foraging including lands at forested areas suggested rotational practices for livestock are achieved by most landowners this includes moving animals for breeding and fattening to better forage areas in the valleys during spring nakamatsu 2006 nevertheless the tendency at present is to complete all steps at places that traditionally were assigned for breeding thus keeping the animals in a parcel the entire year or a large part of it livestock fattening is achieved in confined areas some systems are sustained also by combining natural pastures and supplementing with hay bales but others farms are using grains small silos and soft silos with low rotational practices guitart 2017 the modalities of livestock breeding in the region depend on the animal load per unit area and offer of natural forage and can be defined to our study area as follows extensive 1 semi intensive 1 10 and intensive 10 animals per hectare iglesias et al 2015 related with the livestock number in operations two main confined animal production modalities can be found one is the confined breeding medium to large farms in which beef production is based on grains transported from the pampean region formulated feeds corn barley etc and occasionally complemented with pasture bales of local production in addition silo bales are being used for corn and sorghum stocking the other modality mostly employed by small family farms is mixed with livestock breeding on pastures and fattening 4 months being finished at confined areas iglesias et al 2015 as early explained the regulation framework was approved during 2016 after the present study was conducted 2015 2016 for this reason there were not any kind of storage and disposal of wastes in the soils in particular at these systems the use of chemical fertilizers or herbicides is not a disseminated practice horticulture productions are conducted in a very small scale familiar and pasture production mostly for self supply 2 3 sampling sites selection the study attempted to analyze different situations at three small sub basins for this reason our design was not limited to reference vs disturbed paired sites and then additional sampling sites were placed in the longitudinal dimension of each stream usda 2003 stream sampling sites were located as follows three sites at ruca s r1 r2 and r3 four at enna s e1 e2 e3 and e4 and four at ingram s i1 i2 i3 and i4 the selected streams have no tributaries in the studied segments i e r1 r3 e1 e4 and i1 i4 fig 1 there is a hydrological intervention bypass through a concrete channel 1 m width that transfers water natural slope gradient from the percy river between i2 and i3 sites the channel was constructed for irrigation purposes and is active mostly during summer months the management of this water channel is not supervised and each landowner obtains water mostly in summer dry season in all cases sites numbered as 1 r1 e1 and i1 were stated as reference sites thus they were chosen for their best conditions and without the disturbance intensive semi intensive practice being tested since extensive livestock is one of the more disseminated activities in the region it is difficult to find pristine or intact sites nevertheless reference sites chosen presented 0 5 cow per hectare at ruca stream r2 was located near a small pork farming facility having mitigation measures and excluding animal access to the stream site r3 correspond to a confined animal production system a cow calf operation with silo bales and grains at the site higher stocking rates 51 100 cows ha occurred from july to october whereas a lower number of animals 11 50 cows ha was present from october to november the confined system included a stream segment 200 m where animals have free access to the stream all the year table 1 at enna stream e1 reference site was placed in a relatively low developed area 0 5 cows per hectare e2 and e3 were located in an area of extensive cattle management and some farms with small horticulture production site e4 corresponded to a wetland area connected with the stream which supports livestock in a semi intensive modality non confined that feed on natural grassland and are supplemented with pasture bales at ingram stream i2 and i3 were mostly associated to extensive cattle site i4 corresponded to a confined animal facility silo bale and grains the highest cow load occur mostly from july to november 51 100 cows ha whereas a lower number of animals are breeding from december to april 11 50 cows ha table 1 2 4 environmental characterization the study was conducted between july 2015 and april 2016 stream sampling sites were visited bimonthly july august winter october november december spring 2015 february summer and april autumn 2016 daily records of rainfall and mean air temperature were obtained from instituto nacional de tecnología agropecuaria campo anexo trevelin inta since farming operation occurred from july to november the design attempted to examine conditions previous during and after the operations and also to include hydrological periods at streams that are highly dependent on rain fig 1 the design looked for to examine condition avoiding rainstorms because some effect can be maximized for runoff in addition the chosen temporal sequence had the aim to be concurrent with the macroinvertebrate survey at two contrasting periods low and high water period substratum composition on the stream bottom at each site was estimated using a 1 m2 grid and recorded as percentages of boulders cobbles gravel pebbles and sand current speed was measured in mid channel on three occasions by timing a float average of three trials as it moved over a distance of 10 m gordon et al 1994 average depth was estimated from five measurements along one transect across the channel with a calibrated stick wet and dry widths of the channel were also determined there are not stream gauging stations at studied streams and then discharge was obtained by combining depth wet width and current velocity at each sampling date as in gordon et al 1994 on each sampling occasion water temperature c electrical conductivity μs20 cm 1 ph dissolved oxygen mg o2 l 1 and oxygen saturation o2 were obtained with a multi parameter probe hach sension 156 water samples 2 l were collected below the water surface and kept at 4 c until further analyses in the laboratory nutrients analyzed include ammonia nh4 nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen no3 no2 and soluble reactive phosphorus srp all determinations were made with a dr6000 spectrophotometer and based on usepa approved or accepted methods outlined in hach water analysis handbook hach co 2007 total suspended solids tss 0 1 mg l 1 were estimated by filtering a known volume of water with pre weighted fiberglass filters dried 110 c 4 h and re weighted awwa 1998 for microbiological studies august and november water samples were collected under sterile conditions and placed in sterile screw capped glass bottles taking into consideration the standard methods of handling water samples bacteriological analysis of water samples was done within 24 h of collection the bacteriological examination of water samples included the colony forming units cfu of presumptive total coliforms thermotolerant coliforms and escherichia coli cfu 100 ml water the culture medium used to detect total coliforms was the lauril triptosa broth of double and simple concentration in the presumptive stage and brilliant green bile lactose broth bgbl in the confirmatory stage following american water works association methods awwa 1998 pigment analysis was performed in order to estimate periphyton biomass measurement were conducted in august november 2015 and april 2016 three periphyton samples were collected from riffles at each site each sample consisted of the scraped material from three randomly selected rocks 20 cm2 the content was preserved in water from the site and cooled while transported in dark containers to the laboratory where they were filtered on gf ff filters all samples were frozen until analysis chlorophyll a was extracted from filters in 90 acetone and measured spectrophotometrically with correction by phaeopigments according to standard methods awwa 1998 wetzel and likens 1991 2 5 macroinvertebrate sampling and assessment macroinvertebrates were assessed on two contrasting flow conditions low october november 2015 and high august 2015 water period samples were taken with a surber sampler 0 09 m2 250 μm pore size from riffles n 3 and pools n 3 at each visit and sites e3 and e4 were excluded for their hydrological conditions connected wetland making not possible to use the surber device samples were fixed in situ with 4 formaldehyde and sorted in the laboratory under at least 5x magnification macroinvertebrate species were identified using available keys fernández and domínguez 2001 we tested a variety of single benthic macroinvertebrate metrics selected from previous studies conducted in the region miserendino et al 2011 epele and miserendino 2015 which are mostly based on qualitative data total richness ephemeroptera e richness plecoptera p richness trichoptera t richness coleoptera c richness number of ept taxa number of eptc taxa number of insect families number of chironomidae taxa and number of orthocladiinae taxa the predicted response of each metric to disturbance is presented in table 5 in addition two regionally defined biotic indexes the iap andean patagonian index and the bmps biotic monitoring patagonian stream index were employed and water quality judgements were obtained miserendino and pizzolón 1999 the iap works with genus family level and computes known responses of taxa to organic enrichment the potential range of the iap is 1 most disturbed to 10 best class condition the bmps is computed by adding pollution sensitivity scores 1 10 for all invertebrate families present at a site for a potential range of 0 most disturbed to 150 least disturbed 2 6 habitat conditions and riparian ecosystem integrity for evaluation of possible disturbance produced by livestock on in stream conditions and on the riparian corridors two indexes commonly used for streams in the patagonia mountain area were utilized at each sampling site the ha habitat condition index was applied to evaluate habitat quality using the assessment procedure for high gradient streams of barbour et al 1999 this method ranks 10 river channel features e g epifaunal substrate availability embeddedness sediment deposition frequency of riffles bank stability etc from 0 to 20 a score of 200 points indicates that the river is natural and pristine and in its best possible condition range 150 200 this index evaluates the ability of the stream s physical habitat to support a given fauna and then is a measure of the spatial heterogeneity of the stream castela et al 2008 the complexity and the attributes of the riparian vegetation in a 100 m reach were also analysed using an adaptation of the qbr index riparian corridor quality index munné et al 1998 for patagonian streams the qbrp kutschker et al 2009 this index combines information from four additive metrics total cover proportion of the riparian area covered by trees and shrubs structure proportion of riparian vegetation composed by trees and shrubs separately complexity and naturalness of vegetation number of trees or shrub species and absence of introduced species and other human impacts in riparian vegetation and the degree of channel naturalness e g bank modifications dredging etc it also takes into account differences in the geomorphology of the river from its headwaters to the lower reaches the total qbrp score ranges from 0 extreme degradation to 100 points excellent quality natural riparian forest most intensive and semi intensive developments occupying stream reaches are not employing actions to ameliorate possible disturbance from livestock nevertheless some mitigation practices detected at sampling points e g shorelines filled with gravel livestock exclusion with fences etc were itemized and described in addition all other types of land use practices present in the reach were listed and mitigation if present was recorded 2 7 statistical analysis spatial trends in water quality were graphically examined using the qgis software 2 14 15 version essen non parametric kruskal wallis and paired mann whitney test p 0 05 were run to assess differences in environmental conditions between reference and impaired sites sokal and rohlf 1995 a pearson correlations matrix was performed to identify redundant environmental variables an r critical value r 0 70 p 0 001 was used as evidence of which variables provide the same information after the procedure variables excluded were air temperature oxygen saturation bacteria and dry channel width a principal component analysis pca was then conducted on log x 1 transformed remaining environmental variables to interpret this analysis we used the loadings of each variable on the components of the pca and examined the location of sites according the main gradient captured by two first axes ludwing and reynolds 1988 a spearman s rank correlations matrix was calculated to assess macroinvertebrate metric responses to environmental variables at sampling sites the procedure was carried out using the corrplot package wei and simko 2016 in the statistical software r version 3 2 3 r development core team 2016 a significance level of 0 05 was used for all tests 3 results 3 1 physicochemical features and water quality status at most sites the substrate particle size was mainly cobble and pebble however a higher proportion of sand sedimentation symptoms was found at semi lentic sites e3 and e4 mean depth and mean wet channel width varied considerably among sites table 2 although sites i1 and i2 were dry mostly in summer i1 starting november and i2 starting january they displayed high discharge during winter and spring as the diversion channel was active during summer months some water was sporadically derived to ingram lowland sites i3 and i4 from november 2015 to april 2016 therefore these sites had enough water even in the driest period 0 21 m3 s 1 mean electrical conductivity values ranged from 56 5 to 108 3 μs cm 1 i1 to i4 and 53 3 to 109 2 μs cm 1 e1 to e4 table 2 observed differences were significant when comparing references vs disturbed table 3 oxygen depletion was significant within ingram stream sites i2 i3 and when contrasting all reference and disturbed sites at the three streams r d table 3 there were no significant differences in the mean values of nitrite plus nitrate among sites a significant increase in srp values was observed at enna system when comparing e2 and e4 table 3 spatial variation of mean values of ammonia nh4 electrical conductivity dissolved oxygen o2 total of suspended solids tss chlorophyll a and bacteria escherichia coli are presented in fig 3 at ingram stream conductivity chlorophyll a and e coli increased downstream whereas dissolved oxygen decreased from i1 to i4 instead ammonia and tss levels did not display a particular pattern enna system showed a downstream increment in the mean values of ammonia conductivity and tss and an opposite response for dissolved oxygen although ruca system does not show changes in ammonia concentration and conductivity a stepped increase in chlorophyll a bacteria and tss was observed and also a decrease in dissolved oxygen similar to those seen in the other systems fig 3 e coli count ranged from 7 7 cfu at i2 august to 700 cfu at i3 i4 august i3 e3 r3 october and i4 in november ranges of mean values per site are shown in fig 3f the principal component analyses pca revealed that chemical physical and biological data provided a clear distinction between streams according to a disturbance gradient but also revealed the seasonal variability fig 4 table 4 the first two factors accounted for most of the variation in the data set 63 8 the pca1 44 8 highlighted the gradient of disturbance i e high positive loadings by tss nh4 and conductivity and also the changes on flow attributes according to season i e negative loadings by wet channel width discharge depth and velocity table 4 then most reference sites having better water quality conditions were positioned on the left side of pca1 and more degraded sites on the right of same axis the pca2 19 underlined a gradient in nutrient enrichment and eutrophy i e positive loadings by srp and chlorophyll a 3 2 habitat condition and riparian quality index habitat condition index values ranged between 83 marginal and 180 optimal all upstream sites i1 e1 and r1 presented an optimal score for habitat condition 150 points with the best situation for i1 180 fig 5 a nevertheless e1 and r1 had low scores in the item channel alteration bank stability and riparian vegetative zone width the worst situations were observed in i4 and r3 where the main alterations detected were margin erosion due to vegetation removal higher embeddedness caused by sedimentation and loss of epifaunal substrate availability since ha is an index to be applicable at streams it was not calculated for e3 and e4 sites connected wetland the qbrp scores showed that upstream sites with little agricultural use had a good quality of the riparian ecosystem while the sites i2 i3 e2 e4 and r2 displayed some alteration on the river corridor most degraded sites were i4 e3 and r3 strong alteration of the riparian corridor among others by loss of the complexity and naturalness of the vegetation due to cows foraging in the riparian area fig 5b 3 3 aquatic macroinvertebrates responses metrics and biotic indexes the range average standard deviation and expected response to disturbance of calculated metrics is presented in table 5 macroinvertebrate total richness ranged from 16 i1 to 50 r2 taxa per site during the study appendix 1 of the set of invertebrate metrics we tested the richness of plecoptera trichoptera ept and eptc groups showed a marked decreasing pattern along ruca system particularly during the low water period moreover from i3 to i4 plecoptera and coleoptera taxa were totally dislodged in the same period regarding biotic indexes only bmps displayed low scores at i1 and i2 probably in responses to natural causes flow intermittency several expected and significant relationships were obtained when correlated metrics with environmental variables linked with water quality e g ammonia conductivity bacteria etc fig 6 a higher number of significant correlations were identified between richness measures and ammonia suggesting toxicity effects 4 discussion 4 1 livestock and water quality confined production animal in both intensive and semi intensive modalities resulted in low to moderate impact regarding to oxygen saturation conductivity shilla and shilla 2011 and nutrient levels mckergow et al 2012 the most affected reaches were i4 and e4 which displayed increases in conductivity twofold increase and in soluble reactive phosphorus at e4 twofold increase nevertheless at ruca the animal operation r3 did not result in substantial changes in most variables although a marked increase in tss six fold increase was observed during summer davies colley et al 2004 declerck et al 2006 niyogi et al 2007 on the other hand our analysis integrating all sites at studied basins pca ordination highlighted a gradient of disturbance being the set of environmental variables retained strongly linked with water quality parameters tss ammonia conductivity shilla and shilla 2011 scanes 2018 nutrient levels here observed were markedly high compared with those reported for extensive livestock management at piedmont streams in the region miserendino et al 2011 but similar to documented at intensively grazed flooded wetland areas kutschker et al 2014 epele and miserendino 2015 regarding ammonia levels extreme values occurred concurrently with livestock presence on the shoreline or at months with the highest stocking rates riley et al 2003 garcía et al 2015 livestock can affect significantly nutrient distribution as animals tend to deposit more excreta in lounging areas near shade and water miller et al 2011 and as observed here when cattle access to the streams is unrestricted vidon et al 2008 our design attempted to assess the effect of different modalities of localized livestock production however other sources of disturbances e g runoff are likely to contribute in part to explain observed patterns as expected at cold temperate streams in the area brand and miserendino 2015 most sites were well oxygenated although oxygen depletion was evident at lower sites at ingram 30 to 50 and at enna 60 in summer probably in response to an increase in organic matter and bacteria sánchez et al 2007 scanes 2018 livestock activity at the ruca stream significantly affected e coli count at both high and low water periods in addition e coli counting resulted in water quality declining at both semi intensive management i3 e3 and confined animal operation r3 i4 line 2003 miller et al 2010a regarding the framework directives for surface water protection the confined operation sites exceeded the recommended critical value for e coli 320 cfu dpn 2006 pcia de chubut 2016 epa 2012 besides this value was surpassed even at fenced sites with livestock exclusion i3 probably associated with runoff from surrounding areas collins and rutherford 2004 nevertheless fencing appears as a useful mitigation option to reduce faecal contamination of stream bed sediments bragina et al 2017 epilithic production chlorophyll a increased at confined animal production areas in which nutrient enrichment from urine and fecal excretes combined with a higher solar exposition open canopy sites resulted in augment of primary producers miserendino et al 2016 nevertheless this parameter chlorophyll a is not always useful to discriminate the effects of grazing on watercourses scrimgeour and kendall 2003 masi and miserendino 2009 4 2 livestock and aquatic ecosystem integrity it was evident that this new confined animal operation modalities are producing significant impact on the riparian corridors and in the in stream habitat conditions scrimgeour and kendall 2003 ranganath et al 2009 rosso and fernández cirelli 2013 most judgment classes from qbrp index applied at confined operations indicated strong riparian ecosystem alteration as expected best condition were found at reference sites kutschker et al 2009 however some alterations were identified even at intermediate sampling points evidencing other types of disturbances derived from extensive livestock breeding vidon et al 2008 kaucner et al 2013 seemingly even in low stocking rates livestock keep foraging on grasses and herbaceous strata in the riparian corridor ranganath et al 2009 as here documented the use of drinking supplies or off stream watering systems not appear as a common practice neither the exclusion of livestock from streams malan et al 2018 miller et al 2018 the existence of fences at r2 and at i3 was effective enhancing the riparian ecosystem conditions in which judgment criteria resulted in higher scores better quality than at unfenced sites as expected maximum scores for ha index corresponded to reference sites although some of them displayed incipient degradation which is similar to observed in a study conducted in a nearby basin miserendino et al 2016 nevertheless the worst situations were identified at the stream reaches having confined animal operations a high negative incidence on the in stream habitat quality was linked with pasture land uses miserendino et al 2011 most common habitat disturbances were related to erosion processes and livestock trampling that in turn resulted in higher embeddedness fine sediments deposition and loss of channel sinuosity magner et al 2008 scanes 2018 at most impacted sites the availability of epifaunal substrate was strongly reduced by the homogenization of the channel the alteration in the riffle pond sequence and the monopolization of the substrate one macrophytes species among other things sutherland et al 2012 brand and miserendino 2015 a good habitat condition is essential for the survival of aquatic organisms endemic invertebrates fish etc and even in modified landscapes strong relationships between the biota attributes and habitat quality can be found d ambrosio et al 2014 for this reason we consider this index as a useful tool for early awareness in extensive and intensive livestock development in the area and convenient to transfer information about conservation issues to landowners 4 3 effect on aquatic communities our results demonstrated that macroinvertebrates were affected by livestock confined operation with some sensitive or intolerant species being locally eliminated during the low water period at ruca and ingram disturbed sites this pattern was particularly marked at ruca because from r2 to r3 the ept group was reduced up to 50 several works found that species of plecoptera ephemeroptera and trichoptera resulted useful to detect impairment derived from extensive livestock practices sutherland et al 2012 brand and miserendino 2015 and pastoral impact niyogi et al 2007 shilla and shilla 2011 goss et al 2014 a study on streams affected by feedlots at vaal river catchment south africa revealed differences on number of invertebrate families and diversity respect to reference sites jonker et al 2009 nevertheless ranganath et al 2009 reported that macroinvertebrates responses appeared weak when contrasting assemblages with and without livestock exclusion at virginia streams usa additional macroinvertebrate measurements density structure functional attributes etc should be considered in future approaches in order to visualize other effects that could have missed with qualitative metrics goss et al 2014 4 4 management practices to reduce livestock impact even though most studied sites lacked mitigation practices for stream protection we identified some specific actions in the riverbanks at confined animal operation sites that probably help to diminish damage the intentional deposition of cobble gravel substrates in specifics riverbank areas e g muddy areas with the purpose of avoiding livestock injuries could diminish turbidity and sediment deposition schueler and brown 2004 this action can limit the potential of soil detachment and subsequent transport into the channel bed magner et al 2008 garcía et al 2015 there were not specific measures for effluent control at intensive livestock operation one inexpensive and environmentally sustainable strategy to remove pollutants is the phytoremediation using aquatic plants rizzo et al 2012 that could be an alternative to reduce eutrophication and toxicity effect from wastes which altered sensitive aquatic biota it was evident that riparian integrity was better in those sites in which the livestock was excluded and then their qbrp scores were higher suggesting a good level of conservation miller et al 2010a miller et al 2010b documented strong recovery of the river corridor in areas with cattle exclusion in addition these beneficial management practices prevented water quality degradation 5 conclusion due to economical perspectives and scarce margin for incomes from agricultural activities in argentina often landowners are not aware of the environmental impacts of their productions garcía et al 2015 conservation action in modified rural and agricultural landscapes at patagonia streams should include among others off stream watering facilities for livestock exclusion of cattle or livestock from the main channel stream by fences or electrical artifacts and reinforcement of riverbanks with cobble gravel at crossing areas to prevent water pollution with animal wastes macrophyte treatments pond farms could be an alternative new questions about the impact of confined animal production systems on water quality and aquatic communities inhabiting streams should be addressed in future studies wilderness of the landscape and pristine conditions of water resources are essential to develop several economic activities in

11118,evapotranspiration et is the main water loss in water balance particularly in arid and semiarid regions in the last decades remote sensing technology has been providing valuable information to monitor et at large scale in this study a modification of the relative evapotranspiration f parameter introduced by venturini et al 2008 is presented the surface actual water vapor pressure es is estimated incorporating surface texture information and the soil moisture sm content as proposed by deardorff 1978 the introduction of sm content in es estimation led to a physically meaningful estimation of the traditional f formulation as a result the original venturini et al s et application is simpler more flexible and robust the results presented here were calculated from the soil moisture active passive smap products with two different spatial resolutions 36 and 3 km to compute regional et the proposed et model was validated using ground observations from bowen ratio stations and eddy covariance towers the et results with a spatial resolution of 36 km showed good agreement with ground data with a root mean square error varying from 0 91 to 1 22 mm d the recently released smap sm product at 3 km produces et estimates with a root mean square error of 0 63 mm d for autumn winter season the new et model results were also compared with the well known et myd16a2 product making evident that the proposed approach outreaches the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis methodology the preliminary results presented with our simple flexible universal and robust et equation using smap sm are promising keywords evapotranspiration passive microwave soil moisture ratio relative evapotranspiration 1 introduction the evapotranspiration et describes the water lost from the earth s surface by combining evaporation and transpiration processes et is a main component of the water cycle since the process returns up to 60 of the land precipitation back to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 in addition et expends most of the solar energy absorbed by the earth surface during a year trenberth et al 2009 therefore understanding the et distribution at large scale is essential for many agricultural water resources and forest management applications conventional ground measurement techniques e g energy balance bowen ratio eddy covariance techniques weighing lysimeter etc provide accurate et estimations liou and kar 2014 however in situ observations are rather limited to solve regional and global scale problems because they cannot be directly extended to large scales due to the heterogeneity of the land surface knipper et al 2017 in contrast with satellite remote sensing technology it is possible to map the earth s surface in a consistent and economically viable manner tang et al 2010 as a result the scientific community has developed different methodologies to estimate et using satellite information over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales hu and jia 2015 classified them as simplified empirical regression methods carlson et al 1995 wang and liang 2008 trapezoid or triangle feature space methods jiang and islam 2001 nishida et al 2003 minacapilli et al 2016 surface energy balance based single and dual source models bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 and the traditional et estimation approaches examples of the latest are the penman monteith or priestley taylor equations p t from here on combined with remote sensing information mu et al 2007 venturini et al 2008 girolimetto and virginia 2014 autovino et al 2016 knipper et al 2017 srivastava et al 2018 venturini et al s model venturini et al 2008 stands out because derived et remotely sensed maps without auxiliaries or site specific relationships the authors established a relationship between es to the concept of tu defined as the temperature of the surface if it is brought to saturation without changing the actual surface vapor pressure however they recognized that the tu expression is a numerical solution and did not follow the physic of the problem venturini et al 2008 in 2014 girolimetto and venturini proposed a new methodology to obtain the relative evapotranspiration f based on the surface moisture availability defined by barton 1979 as σ es e s where e s is the surface saturation water vapor pressure in their model σ was estimated from the reflectance of the short wave infrared bands of optical satellite sensors venturini et al s and girolimetto and venturini s models were successfully applied with modis and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster data venturini et al 2011 sun et al 2012 girolimetto and virginia 2014 nevertheless the atmospheric effects limit the application of these methods mainly during clear sky days producing temporal gaps in the et calculated time series in the aforementioned methods es is the key variable which depends on the surface moisture availability i e es increases as the soil moisture sm content increases so the relationship between es and sm has been widely studied since the 40 s deardorff 1978 bosilovich and sun 1998 ye and pielke 1993 dekić et al 1995 liu and kotoda 1998 additionally sm content controls the exchange of latent and sensible heat fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere koster et al 2003 thus the sm content plays an important role in the knowledge of es and et estimations wang and liang 2008 global maps of the soil moisture active passive smap mission provided by the passive microwave sensor are an important source of sm data smap was launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in january 2015 with an l band passive sensor onboard entekhabi et al 2014 the smap sm products have a coarse spatial resolution however active microwave satellite missions with better spatial resolution would allow the smap team to derive routinely et maps with acceptable precision several authors combine passive microwave and optical information often in conjunction with ancillary data to retrieve et barraza et al 2015 proposed combining optical and passive microwave vegetation indexes using advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e satellite data to compute the surface conductance in forest ecosystems they calculated et by using penman monteith s equation recently this method was validated in arid and semi arid ecosystems barraza et al 2017 li et al 2015 incorporated passive microwave sm into the surface energy balance system sebs model integrating the sm content with thermal data from aster to approximate et under water stress conditions in this occasion an airborne polarimetric l band multibeam radiometer plmr provided the sm values in addition hu and jia 2015 included amsr e sm data into a hybrid remotely sensed et model in order to estimate daily et in the heihe river basin in china on the other hand knipper et al 2017 obtained et maps only from remote sensing data combining modis products with sm from the soil moisture ocean salinity smos satellite all these methods model the resistance factors hu and jia 2015 or use empirical relationships barraza et al 2015 li et al 2015 knipper et al 2017 reason why they are data demanding and or intricate thus the objective of the current study is to improve the venturini et al s methodology venturini et al 2008 by estimating es with the soil texture and the sm content in such a way as to be representative of the physical process the proposed upgrade of venturini et al s model resulted in a simple universal and flexible equation moreover this calculation exploits the sm data of the passive microwave sensors incorporating the smap sm products into the et formulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology the venturini et al s methodology venturini et al 2008 modified the p t equation priestley and taylor 1972 using granger s complementary relationship granger 1989 and the relative evapotranspiration f defined as the ratio between actual et and potential evapotranspiration epot as a result the authors obtained the following model 1 e t v v α f δ f δ γ r n g 1 l ρ where α is the p t parameter dimensionless f is the relative evapotranspiration dimensionless rn is the net radiation mj m2 day g is the surface soil heat flux mj m2 day δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure svp curve kpa ºc γ is the psychrometric constant kpa ºc l is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg and ρ is the water density kg m3 venturini et al adopted for f the equation proposed by granger and gray 1989 assuming that the wind function similarly affects et and epot the authors suggested that the saturation and actual vapor pressure could be calculated from the svp curve and introduced a new temperature variable tu the authors emphasized that their tu expression was a numerical solution and it did not physically represent the variable definition further discussion and a complete description of this methodology can be found in venturini et al 2008 in this work the original f proposed by granger and gray 1998 is reformulated in fact the surface actual water vapor pressure depends on the surface moisture availability i e in a saturated surface es e s while for an unsaturated surface es will be smaller than e s as it was mentioned in the introduction the relationship between es and sm has been the subject of several researches since 1943 edlefsen and anderson 1943 and later philip 1957 established that the ratio between es and e s can be solved by thermodynamic considerations as follows 2 e s ω e s where ω is a function of the surface wetness however the so called ω models have been found to be not suitable in many cases kondo et al 1990 mahfouf and noilhan 1991 thus later mihailović et al 1993 suggested another expression to es involving more variables 3 e s β e s 1 β e a where β is the function of the surface wetness and ea is the air actual water vapor pressure comparisons of the soil evaporation estimates obtained by ω and β functions demonstrated that methods using the β function provided better results as showed in bosilovich and sun 1998 and cahill et al 1999 these authors suggested that β can be successfully parameterized by sm alone that is why es formulation with the β function was explored in this work to solve eq 3 different β formulations have been proposed from experimental data and in a rather ad hoc manner deardorff 1978 barton 1979 ye and pielke 1993 dekić et al 1995 liu and kotoda 1998 among them deardorff s formula deardorff 1978 stands for its simplicity the author assumed a linear relationship between β and sm smc where sm is the volumetric soil moisture content and smc the soil field capacity point under this hypothesis in this work the soil saturation water content smsat surrogates smc in the β formulation to enclose all the possible surface wetness conditions so β was calculated as sm smsat then it is possible to estimate f as follows 4 f e t e p o t β e s e a e s e a s m s m s a t e s e a e s e a s m s m s a t where β is the relative surface wetness thereby f is a dimensionless coefficient varying from 0 to 1 where f 0 corresponds to et 0 and f 1 to et epot for instance in a dry surface sm tends to zero and f would be close to zero indicating low evapotranspiration rates conversely on a wet surface sm tends to smsat and f would be close to one expressing evapotranspiration rates near to the potential rates situations between these extreme evapotranspiration rates would be of 0 f 1 f new formulation is introduced into the venturini et al s equation to estimate et hereafter referred as etwv hence the new etwv method simplified the venturini et al s calculation adapting the f parameter with the surface properties and the sm content etwv considers surface variables along with the available energy variables which would be the main factors that control et process on a soil vegetated surface venturini et al 2008 in their original method integrated surface and atmospheric variables into the et formulation representing a wide range of real situations venturini et al 2008 2011 girolimetto and virginia 2014 however sm was not directly incorporated in the et approximation it should be mentioned that several et models are based on surface variables such as surface temperature ts and vegetation indexes yielding acceptable results jiang and islam 2001 nishida et al 2003 minacapilli et al 2016 these methods assumed that ts controls the surface energy balance and the rn is the driving force for the et process but they fail to quantify the source of available water for et for this reason they would not be suitable in environments where water availability is the main limiting factor for et for example in arid and semiarid regions seneviratne et al 2010 the etwv model reduces the number of variables introduced in the original methodology venturini et al 2008 deriving a simplest et model the etwv equation is based on universal relationships so the proposed model is suitable to be applied to any remote region moreover etwv is a flexible model that could be applicable using diverse datasets at different spatial and temporal scales from the remote sensing point of view eq 4 can be resolved with sm data provided by the smap mission and knowing the saturation point of the soil texture class that prevails in the study area to analyze the soundness of the proposed method the determination coefficient r2 bias root mean square error rmse and the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse were quantified the statistics were calculated through the following formulations willmott 1982 5 r 2 e t m o d e t o b s 2 e t o b s e t o b s 2 6 b i a s e t o b s e t m o d n 7

measurements were used i e the atmospheric radiation measurement arm and the ameriflux af ground observations networks the location of these two networks and the distribution of the stations in each of them are shown in fig 1 the arm program maintains an extensive and continuous in situ measurements network of energy balance bowen ratio ebbr stations distributed over the southern great plains sgp region of the united states see fig 1 the ebbr system estimates the vertical latent and sensible heat fluxes every 30 min at local scale the fluxes from the stations are calculated with observations of rn g and vertical gradients of relative humidity rh and air temperature ta at two different levels moreover the stations register a set of critical environmental variables such as ea atmospheric pressure sm ts direction and speed wind stations e9 e11 e12 e13 e15 e32 e34 e35 e36 e39 and e40 distributed over various surface types pasture native prairie hayfield alfalfa and wheat were the operative stations during 2016 2017 the sgp region extends over the state of oklahoma and the southern part of kansas in general it is characterized by a flat terrain with an elevation that increases from east to west the climate is semiarid subtropical with cold and dry winters and hot summers the average annual temperature varies from 14 c to 18 c and rainfall range between 490 740 mm mainly during summer the area has a heterogeneous land cover dominated by prairie vegetation mixed with crops and forest the observations provided by the arm program have been proved to be reliable in several studies venturini et al 2008 girolimetto and venturini 2014 zhu et al 2017 further information about the instruments and the facilities can be found at http www arm gov the af network was established in 1996 as a network of eddy covariance ec towers that provides continuous observations of carbon water and energy fluxes across the americas the ec technique measures the biosphere atmosphere exchanges every 30 min at a local scale a set of meteorological observations including ta rh ts sm direction and wind speed accompanied the flux measurements in this work field measurements were collected for five different stations distributed along the minnesota and illinois states stations us ib1 and us ib2 located in illinois and us ro1 us ro2 and us ro4 in minnesota were selected see fig 1 these towers are distributed over two land cover types cropland and grassland both with the same type of climate i e severe winters humid with no dry season and hot summers the average annual temperature is 9 c and 6 4 c and the mean annual precipitation is 930 mm and 879 mm for the illinois and minnesota area respectively the af network has also been widely used in several works mu et al 2007 wang and liang 2008 bhattarai et al 2017 more details about this network can be found in http ameriflux lbl gov the satellite data set used in this work is composed of passive microwave images and optical data of 25 days a summary of the acquisition day and name of the used products is presented in table 1 passive microwave information was obtained from smap satellite the nasa smap mission is an l band satellite in orbit which was explicitly devoted to provide global maps of sm entekhabi et al 2014 it carries a passive radiometer in l band that scan the earth s surface with a sun synchronous 6 00 am descending and 6 00 pm ascending in this study the l3 soil moisture passive smap l3 sm p and the l2 soil moisture sentinel passive smap l2 sm sp products have been used to build the relative evapotranspiration parameter the current baseline algorithm of smap radiometer sm product is the single channel algorithm sca that uses polarized brightness temperature observations o neill et al 2015 the l3 sm product is a daily gridded composed of the smap l2 radiometer sm product of 36 km spatial resolution the l2 sm product is derived from smap l band brightness temperature and copernicus sentinel 1 c band backscatter coefficients which are resampled to a fixed 3 km grid smap products are available at http smap jpl nasa gov et images from the optical moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor on board eos aqua were used to evaluate the proposed method this nasa mission was launched in 2002 as a part of the earth observing system eos aqua s orbit around the earth is timed so that it passes from south to north across the equator during the afternoon http modis gsfc nasa gov the myd16a2 product provides et maps at 500 m spatial resolution every eight days et is the accumulation of 8 day total water loss this product is based on others modis products and the penman monteith equation mu et al 2007 2011 3 results 3 1 data preprocessing smap sm and modis et products were georeferenced to a common geographic latitude longitude coordinate system particularly to georeference the smap l2 sm sp product a geographic lookup table file was made using the latitude and longitude bands that were included in this product these smap and modis products were used with their original spatial resolution i e 3 and 36 km for smap and 500 m for modis mean daily rn g ta and et values were required thus they were calculated by integrating half hourly measurements provided by arm and af networks rn and g were mapped using the inverse distance weighting method to interpolate data from arm and af stations even though there are several methodologies to compute these two variables from remotely sensed data bisht et al 2005 wang and liang 2009 li et al 2012 carmona et al 2015 observed data always represent the ground truth also parameter was computed with interpolated maps of ta obtained from the stations consequently here direct observations of these variables were chosen to minimize uncertainties in the resulting et estimates venturini et al 2008 3 2 etwv using smap at 36 km smsat value must be determined to estimate f from eq 4 chang et al 2003 found that the most representative soil type of the sgp region were loamy on the other hand the af stations are distributed over silty and silty loam soils based on cosby et al 1984 loam and silty loam soil textures have a smsat ranges from 40 4 to 47 6 respectively therefore the highest value of smsat was adopted to enclose all the possible saturation conditions field sm measurements and smap data were compared yielding a r2 of 0 38 and 0 15 for the arm and af observations respectively the poor correlation with ground af data could be due to the lower number of observations 38 than arm network 190 for the studied period observed arm sm varied from 5 to 35 6 and smap sm from 6 to 38 6 at the af network measured sm range from 23 3 to 43 4 and smap sm from 12 6 to 40 3 the differences between minimum observed sm values at both sites could be due to the higher annual precipitation of af compared to arm smap sm images and the smsat value were used to compute f and the relationship between f and observed sm for the studied period and datasets arm and af is shown in fig 2 it can be observed a moderated dispersion in fig 2 due to the differences between observed sm and smap product af data presented a larger dispersion than arm data however f increases with sm f was incorporated into the et formulation and its performance was evaluated mean daily et estimates obtained from different methodologies etmod were compared with et observations etobs from arm and af ground stations networks the p t etpt model the myd16a2 product etm and the proposed method etwv were evaluated the pixel scale of etmod mismatch the point station scale therefore the results validation at the pixel scale assumed that et observations are representative of the surrounding area the footprint of a tower is only a small fraction of the smap pixel thus it is difficult to represent the variability of such pixel with just an observation point however the validation procedure adopted here was widely used by several authors to verify moderated spatial resolution maps jiang and islam 2001 mu et al 2007 venturini et al 2008 mu et al 2011 barraza et al 2015 hu and jia 2015 li et al 2015 barraza et al 2017 knipper et al 2017 thus direct contrast between etmod and etobs were used when there was one station on the smap pixel otherwise observations within a pixel were averaged before contrasting the results myd16a2 estimated 8 day et data were converted into daily et dividing the pixel values by 8 before contrasting this product with etmod results the regional maximum minimum and mean of etobs and etmod are presented in table 2 etwv shows similar statistics for etobs at both networks the mean etwv differed from the mean etobs in 0 34 mm d and 0 65 mm d for the arm and af measurements respectively etpt yields higher values than etobs showing a difference in the mean value of 2 48 mm d and 2 55 mm d for the arm and af data such differences were expected since etpt model is considered to be a wet environment et formulation the etm product diverges from the average etobs in 3 26 mm d at the arm network and in 0 88 mm d at the af network in spite of the technological differences between arm and af observation towers et ranges are similar in both networks and consistent with the climate of each region table 3 presents a summary of the r2 rmse ubrmse and the bias for each evaluated methodology compared with in situ measurements from arm and af networks the etwv method yielded a rmse of 0 91 mm d and a bias of 0 33 mm d compared with arm field measurements at the af network the methodology showed a rmse of 1 22 mm d and a bias of 0 65 mm d the r2 were 0 90 and 0 79 for the arm and af data respectively the distinctive etwv behavior in both networks in terms of rmse and bias may be caused by the differences between bowen ratio and eddy covariance technologies as well as by the climate differences there is certain discrepancy between smap sm and observed sm at af sites which is reflected in f results see fig 2 the contrast between etwv and etobs from each network is observed in fig 3 where the overall agreement between both modeled et is reflected in the global rmse of 0 98 mm d as was expected etpt overestimated etobs for the studied period and datasets etpt comparison with af observations showed similar results to those obtained in arm network expressed by a rmse of 2 80 mm d and an ubrmse of 1 51 mm d fig 4 shows that etpt with arm and af dataset overestimated et observations etm presented a poor correlation with ground arm observations with a rmse of 3 94 mm d and ubrmse of 2 18 mm d notably etm with af data yielded a rmse ubrmse and bias of about half of those calculated with arm observations although the r2 were similar for arm and af measurements see table 3 fig 5 shows the relationship between myd16a2 et product and the observed et for the studied period and networks the reader can observe that results from af are closer to the 1 1 line than arm etm in all cases etwv showed a better performance than the etpt and the well known operative product myd16a2 these results are consistent with those from different works that validated modis et product ramoelo et al 2014 hu and jia 2015 autovino et al 2016 barraza et al 2017 additionally a seasonal analysis of the errors for all the data was made table 4 presents the bias rmse and ubrmse for the etwv model estimations compared with ground observations for three seasons i e summer spring and fall clearly the errors were not equally distributed during the seasons i e as the et decreased the errors increased in percentages of the mean observed et although the nominal error decreased with et during summer when the water demand is extreme the etwv method showed the lowest rmse close to 14 of the mean observed et fig 6 shows the seasonal variation of etobs and etmod for selected stations stations e9 e15 e36 and e40 of the arm network and both stations of the af network over pasture grassland and cropland land covers were randomly selected it is clear that etwv performs significantly better than the etm method for the studied period and analyzed stations the proposed model seems to follow the same variation as etobs over time besides as it was mentioned before etm underestimated the arm in situ measurements and capture the behavior of the af observations this preliminary analysis suggested that the new model appropriately represent the bowen ratio and eddy covariance observations venturini et al s in 2008 reported overall values of 1 19 mm d for the rmse and 0 38 mm d for the bias in 2014 girolimetto and venturini presented a rmse of 1 40 mm d and a bias of 0 51 mm d for sgp region using only modis products barraza et al 2015 and barraza et al 2017 published rmse values of 0 60 to 0 86 mm d and r2 of about 0 37 to 0 72 for mean daily et estimated by combining optical and passive microwave data their model did not include sm information in penman monteith formulation hu and jia 2015 proposed a hybrid remote sensing model incorporating amsr e sm data to approximate daily et in a semi arid inland river basin their results yielded rmses from 0 63 to 0 87 mm d for different sites however the model used by these authors calculate all the resistance factors reason why it is data demanding and might not be suitable for remote region knipper et al 2017 used smos passive microwave data and modified p t with a soil moisture function to finally obtain r2 between modeled and observed et varying from 0 63 to 0 83 and rmses ranging from 1 40 to 3 37 mm d the structure of their model is similar to that presented here but with an intricate soil moisture function that depend on root zone moisture a vegetation index and soil properties recently bhattarai et al 2017 proposed a modification of seb bastiaanssen et al 1998 model using venturini et al f parameterization these authors found rmse of about 0 73 to 1 24 mm d with af dataset in different biomes however their model require many data from different sources at this point it is important to highlight that the etwv model exhibited results comparable with those published by other authors while it explicitly rates the water availability for evapotranspiration i e the sm content and implicitly consider the resistance factor finally introducing the sm content in es estimation led to a physically meaningful estimation of venturini et al s f that notably reduced the errors originally published by the authors this modification does not overtly incorporate atmospheric variables such as the original venturini et al s model indicating that f can be explained only by surface variables therefore the relationship between et and epot directly depends on the soil water content and soil texture moreover this modification minimized the number of variables introduced in the venturini et al s model venturini et al 2008 yielding a simplest and robust model furthermore etwv equation is applicable with different satellite datasets to any remote region since it is based on universal relationships 3 2 1 etwv sensitivity analysis in this work etwv model was applied using the highest smsat value to enclose all the possible saturation conditions i e the whole study area was assumed to have a silty loam soil type however in vast regions variations of the soil type and textures are expected for instance fig 7 shows the soil s texture based on webb et al 1991 and the corresponding smsat derived by cosby et al 1984 for arm fig 7a and af fig 7b regions for both regions it can be seen that changes within the soil texture imply slight variations in smsat therefore was needed to perform a sensitivity analysis of the variable the objective of this analysis was to determine the significance of smsat errors in etwv estimates hence smsat was modified assuming variations of 2 and 4 of the silty loam smsat i e smsat equal to 46 47 48 49 and 50 were used to compute etwv and contrasted them with the etobs table 5 shows the bias and the rmse obtained in each case in general variations of 2 to 4 in smsat imply variations in etwv rmses of about 1 2 to 3 while 2 to 4 variation of smsat yielded rmse of 1 to 1 7 clearly the method is sensitive to smsat variations however the errors in this parameter would not be magnified in et estimates remarkably slightly better results were found when using smsat for silty clay loam texture although it does not ensure the saturation condition when silty loam soils dominated the area 3 3 etwv using smap at 3 km the recently released smap l2 sm sp product provides estimates of land surface conditions on a fixed 3 km grid this new product would make possible to improve the calculated etwv spatial resolutions considering this the proposed etwv methodology was also analyzed using smap sm product at 3 km spatial resolution for the sgp region where the number of arm station are enough to ensure the validate process since smap l2 sm sp is a beta product still in a validation process it may contain some errors thus results from the contrast with ground observations are preliminary and further research should be done this product has a discontinuous temporal coverage limiting the available data mainly to autumn winter of 2017 das et al 2017 for this reason only six days were evaluated see table 1 during the studied days observed sm ranged from 7 4 to 32 7 and smap sm product from 6 9 to 26 4 ground sm measurements and smap sm data comparison yielded a r2 of 0 53 see fig 8 a preliminary conclusion at this stage could be that for the analyzed days the smap l2 sm sp underestimated sm observations mean daily etwv estimations using smap at 3 km spatial resolution were evaluated against etobs the range of etobs varies from 0 54 to 2 80 mm d while etwv ranges from 0 30 to 3 81 mm d during the studied dates etwv versus etobs resulted in a rmse of 0 63 mm d an ubrmse of 0 55 mm d and a bias of 0 32 mm d whereas the coefficient r2 was 0 61 the etwv with this new smap product presented an acceptable correlation with field measurements as shown in fig 9 it should be note that the latest rmse it is about 40 of the mean autumn winter et observed value usually errors are magnified during winter consistent with the temperature drop lópez moreno et al 2009 in order to analyze the spatial distribution of the etwv maps at 3 km spatial resolution were compared with those obtained at 36 km interpolated rn and g maps were resized to smap spatial resolutions then they were subtracted and multiplied by constant δ and γ values and f image required in eq 1 two randomly selected days were presented in fig 10 03 13 2017 and 11 21 2017 the first column shows the etwv maps at 36 km and the second column the estimated etwv at 3 km the smap l2 sm sp product has regions with non value pixels which are masked with zero values black areas in fig 10 in general the etwv at 36 km ranged from 1 47 to 3 27 mm d and from 0 38 to 1 93 mm d for 03 13 2017 and 21 11 2017 respectively for the same dates etwv at 3 km varied from 0 80 to 4 40 mm d and from 0 31 to 2 42 mm d the mean values on the 03 13 2017 at 36 km and 3 km spatial resolution were 2 42 mm d and 2 60 mm d respectively on 11 21 2017 the average values were 1 16 mm d and 1 37 mm d a visual comparison indicated that the general spatial gradient of both et sources agrees even though etwv at 3 km maps seems to capture more detailed spatial et variations than etwv at 36 km giving a wider range of et estimations 4 conclusion in this study a new parameterization of the relative evapotranspiration introduced by venturini et al 2008 was presented as in venturini et al 2008 the assumption that the wind function similarly affects actual and potential et was also used however here the actual water vapor pressure of the surface was estimated using the soil moisture content due to the facts that many authors had investigated the relationship between the water vapor pressure of an evapotranspirating surface and the soil moisture since 1940 was decided to adopt deardorff 1978 assumption because it simply stated that both variables are linearly related thus the surface moisture ratio defined as the ratio between soil moisture and smsat replaced the traditional relative evapotranspiration f es ea e s ea formulation the theoretical background of the etwv derivation yielded a model without calibration parameters and flexible in terms of data sources however smap passive microwave products were used here for testing purposes ground observations from arm and af networks were selected to validate the new model results with coarse spatial resolution 36 km of smap soil moisture product etwv estimates were compared with in situ observations showing rmses of 0 91 and 1 22 mm d with bowen ratio and eddy covariance stations respectively it is worth to note that most of the ground measurement stations were located in pasture grass and crop fields and none of them in forest areas the overall rmse was about 0 98 mm d comparable with results from other authors for these types of land use as discussed in the results section moreover the temporal variability of etwv estimates followed etobs along time in pasture and crop fields while modis et product did not succeeded to capturing et temporal variation preliminary maps of etwv with a better spatial resolution 3 km were achieved for the southern great plains region using a recently released smap soil moisture product the comparison with field measurements resulted in a rmse of 0 63 mm d an ubrmse of 0 55 mm d and a bias of 0 32 mm d for autumn winter season etwv at 3 km could not be verified for spring summer season when et water loss reaches higher values and it is necessary to have better accuracies in the et estimation however the preliminary etwv maps at 3 km are richer in details than those one obtained using smap soil moisture product at 36 km besides the fact than the mean regional values are similar a visual comparison indicated that etwv 3 km copied the regional patterns of etwv at 36 km however further research with smap l2 sm sp product will be done as soon as smap scientific team release more data the etwv results can be improved considering smsat spatial variability indeed here this parameter was assumed constant for the whole region yet slight variability in the soil texture is expected at the pixel scale thus more realistic etwv estimates can be obtained by combining soil texture maps with smap soil moisture incorporating a new soil information layer would bring more details to et maps although the smsat sensitivity analysis showed that the new model parameterization would not amplify parameter s errors our ongoing research is looking forward to verify the applicability of the proposed new method to woodland areas where the main source of water for the trees are underground water rather than superficial water content in such a case remote sensing data may not be the appropriate source data for the modelling input data 
11118,evapotranspiration et is the main water loss in water balance particularly in arid and semiarid regions in the last decades remote sensing technology has been providing valuable information to monitor et at large scale in this study a modification of the relative evapotranspiration f parameter introduced by venturini et al 2008 is presented the surface actual water vapor pressure es is estimated incorporating surface texture information and the soil moisture sm content as proposed by deardorff 1978 the introduction of sm content in es estimation led to a physically meaningful estimation of the traditional f formulation as a result the original venturini et al s et application is simpler more flexible and robust the results presented here were calculated from the soil moisture active passive smap products with two different spatial resolutions 36 and 3 km to compute regional et the proposed et model was validated using ground observations from bowen ratio stations and eddy covariance towers the et results with a spatial resolution of 36 km showed good agreement with ground data with a root mean square error varying from 0 91 to 1 22 mm d the recently released smap sm product at 3 km produces et estimates with a root mean square error of 0 63 mm d for autumn winter season the new et model results were also compared with the well known et myd16a2 product making evident that the proposed approach outreaches the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis methodology the preliminary results presented with our simple flexible universal and robust et equation using smap sm are promising keywords evapotranspiration passive microwave soil moisture ratio relative evapotranspiration 1 introduction the evapotranspiration et describes the water lost from the earth s surface by combining evaporation and transpiration processes et is a main component of the water cycle since the process returns up to 60 of the land precipitation back to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 in addition et expends most of the solar energy absorbed by the earth surface during a year trenberth et al 2009 therefore understanding the et distribution at large scale is essential for many agricultural water resources and forest management applications conventional ground measurement techniques e g energy balance bowen ratio eddy covariance techniques weighing lysimeter etc provide accurate et estimations liou and kar 2014 however in situ observations are rather limited to solve regional and global scale problems because they cannot be directly extended to large scales due to the heterogeneity of the land surface knipper et al 2017 in contrast with satellite remote sensing technology it is possible to map the earth s surface in a consistent and economically viable manner tang et al 2010 as a result the scientific community has developed different methodologies to estimate et using satellite information over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales hu and jia 2015 classified them as simplified empirical regression methods carlson et al 1995 wang and liang 2008 trapezoid or triangle feature space methods jiang and islam 2001 nishida et al 2003 minacapilli et al 2016 surface energy balance based single and dual source models bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 and the traditional et estimation approaches examples of the latest are the penman monteith or priestley taylor equations p t from here on combined with remote sensing information mu et al 2007 venturini et al 2008 girolimetto and virginia 2014 autovino et al 2016 knipper et al 2017 srivastava et al 2018 venturini et al s model venturini et al 2008 stands out because derived et remotely sensed maps without auxiliaries or site specific relationships the authors established a relationship between es to the concept of tu defined as the temperature of the surface if it is brought to saturation without changing the actual surface vapor pressure however they recognized that the tu expression is a numerical solution and did not follow the physic of the problem venturini et al 2008 in 2014 girolimetto and venturini proposed a new methodology to obtain the relative evapotranspiration f based on the surface moisture availability defined by barton 1979 as σ es e s where e s is the surface saturation water vapor pressure in their model σ was estimated from the reflectance of the short wave infrared bands of optical satellite sensors venturini et al s and girolimetto and venturini s models were successfully applied with modis and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster data venturini et al 2011 sun et al 2012 girolimetto and virginia 2014 nevertheless the atmospheric effects limit the application of these methods mainly during clear sky days producing temporal gaps in the et calculated time series in the aforementioned methods es is the key variable which depends on the surface moisture availability i e es increases as the soil moisture sm content increases so the relationship between es and sm has been widely studied since the 40 s deardorff 1978 bosilovich and sun 1998 ye and pielke 1993 dekić et al 1995 liu and kotoda 1998 additionally sm content controls the exchange of latent and sensible heat fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere koster et al 2003 thus the sm content plays an important role in the knowledge of es and et estimations wang and liang 2008 global maps of the soil moisture active passive smap mission provided by the passive microwave sensor are an important source of sm data smap was launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in january 2015 with an l band passive sensor onboard entekhabi et al 2014 the smap sm products have a coarse spatial resolution however active microwave satellite missions with better spatial resolution would allow the smap team to derive routinely et maps with acceptable precision several authors combine passive microwave and optical information often in conjunction with ancillary data to retrieve et barraza et al 2015 proposed combining optical and passive microwave vegetation indexes using advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e satellite data to compute the surface conductance in forest ecosystems they calculated et by using penman monteith s equation recently this method was validated in arid and semi arid ecosystems barraza et al 2017 li et al 2015 incorporated passive microwave sm into the surface energy balance system sebs model integrating the sm content with thermal data from aster to approximate et under water stress conditions in this occasion an airborne polarimetric l band multibeam radiometer plmr provided the sm values in addition hu and jia 2015 included amsr e sm data into a hybrid remotely sensed et model in order to estimate daily et in the heihe river basin in china on the other hand knipper et al 2017 obtained et maps only from remote sensing data combining modis products with sm from the soil moisture ocean salinity smos satellite all these methods model the resistance factors hu and jia 2015 or use empirical relationships barraza et al 2015 li et al 2015 knipper et al 2017 reason why they are data demanding and or intricate thus the objective of the current study is to improve the venturini et al s methodology venturini et al 2008 by estimating es with the soil texture and the sm content in such a way as to be representative of the physical process the proposed upgrade of venturini et al s model resulted in a simple universal and flexible equation moreover this calculation exploits the sm data of the passive microwave sensors incorporating the smap sm products into the et formulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology the venturini et al s methodology venturini et al 2008 modified the p t equation priestley and taylor 1972 using granger s complementary relationship granger 1989 and the relative evapotranspiration f defined as the ratio between actual et and potential evapotranspiration epot as a result the authors obtained the following model 1 e t v v α f δ f δ γ r n g 1 l ρ where α is the p t parameter dimensionless f is the relative evapotranspiration dimensionless rn is the net radiation mj m2 day g is the surface soil heat flux mj m2 day δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure svp curve kpa ºc γ is the psychrometric constant kpa ºc l is the latent heat of vaporization mj kg and ρ is the water density kg m3 venturini et al adopted for f the equation proposed by granger and gray 1989 assuming that the wind function similarly affects et and epot the authors suggested that the saturation and actual vapor pressure could be calculated from the svp curve and introduced a new temperature variable tu the authors emphasized that their tu expression was a numerical solution and it did not physically represent the variable definition further discussion and a complete description of this methodology can be found in venturini et al 2008 in this work the original f proposed by granger and gray 1998 is reformulated in fact the surface actual water vapor pressure depends on the surface moisture availability i e in a saturated surface es e s while for an unsaturated surface es will be smaller than e s as it was mentioned in the introduction the relationship between es and sm has been the subject of several researches since 1943 edlefsen and anderson 1943 and later philip 1957 established that the ratio between es and e s can be solved by thermodynamic considerations as follows 2 e s ω e s where ω is a function of the surface wetness however the so called ω models have been found to be not suitable in many cases kondo et al 1990 mahfouf and noilhan 1991 thus later mihailović et al 1993 suggested another expression to es involving more variables 3 e s β e s 1 β e a where β is the function of the surface wetness and ea is the air actual water vapor pressure comparisons of the soil evaporation estimates obtained by ω and β functions demonstrated that methods using the β function provided better results as showed in bosilovich and sun 1998 and cahill et al 1999 these authors suggested that β can be successfully parameterized by sm alone that is why es formulation with the β function was explored in this work to solve eq 3 different β formulations have been proposed from experimental data and in a rather ad hoc manner deardorff 1978 barton 1979 ye and pielke 1993 dekić et al 1995 liu and kotoda 1998 among them deardorff s formula deardorff 1978 stands for its simplicity the author assumed a linear relationship between β and sm smc where sm is the volumetric soil moisture content and smc the soil field capacity point under this hypothesis in this work the soil saturation water content smsat surrogates smc in the β formulation to enclose all the possible surface wetness conditions so β was calculated as sm smsat then it is possible to estimate f as follows 4 f e t e p o t β e s e a e s e a s m s m s a t e s e a e s e a s m s m s a t where β is the relative surface wetness thereby f is a dimensionless coefficient varying from 0 to 1 where f 0 corresponds to et 0 and f 1 to et epot for instance in a dry surface sm tends to zero and f would be close to zero indicating low evapotranspiration rates conversely on a wet surface sm tends to smsat and f would be close to one expressing evapotranspiration rates near to the potential rates situations between these extreme evapotranspiration rates would be of 0 f 1 f new formulation is introduced into the venturini et al s equation to estimate et hereafter referred as etwv hence the new etwv method simplified the venturini et al s calculation adapting the f parameter with the surface properties and the sm content etwv considers surface variables along with the available energy variables which would be the main factors that control et process on a soil vegetated surface venturini et al 2008 in their original method integrated surface and atmospheric variables into the et formulation representing a wide range of real situations venturini et al 2008 2011 girolimetto and virginia 2014 however sm was not directly incorporated in the et approximation it should be mentioned that several et models are based on surface variables such as surface temperature ts and vegetation indexes yielding acceptable results jiang and islam 2001 nishida et al 2003 minacapilli et al 2016 these methods assumed that ts controls the surface energy balance and the rn is the driving force for the et process but they fail to quantify the source of available water for et for this reason they would not be suitable in environments where water availability is the main limiting factor for et for example in arid and semiarid regions seneviratne et al 2010 the etwv model reduces the number of variables introduced in the original methodology venturini et al 2008 deriving a simplest et model the etwv equation is based on universal relationships so the proposed model is suitable to be applied to any remote region moreover etwv is a flexible model that could be applicable using diverse datasets at different spatial and temporal scales from the remote sensing point of view eq 4 can be resolved with sm data provided by the smap mission and knowing the saturation point of the soil texture class that prevails in the study area to analyze the soundness of the proposed method the determination coefficient r2 bias root mean square error rmse and the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse were quantified the statistics were calculated through the following formulations willmott 1982 5 r 2 e t m o d e t o b s 2 e t o b s e t o b s 2 6 b i a s e t o b s e t m o d n 7

measurements were used i e the atmospheric radiation measurement arm and the ameriflux af ground observations networks the location of these two networks and the distribution of the stations in each of them are shown in fig 1 the arm program maintains an extensive and continuous in situ measurements network of energy balance bowen ratio ebbr stations distributed over the southern great plains sgp region of the united states see fig 1 the ebbr system estimates the vertical latent and sensible heat fluxes every 30 min at local scale the fluxes from the stations are calculated with observations of rn g and vertical gradients of relative humidity rh and air temperature ta at two different levels moreover the stations register a set of critical environmental variables such as ea atmospheric pressure sm ts direction and speed wind stations e9 e11 e12 e13 e15 e32 e34 e35 e36 e39 and e40 distributed over various surface types pasture native prairie hayfield alfalfa and wheat were the operative stations during 2016 2017 the sgp region extends over the state of oklahoma and the southern part of kansas in general it is characterized by a flat terrain with an elevation that increases from east to west the climate is semiarid subtropical with cold and dry winters and hot summers the average annual temperature varies from 14 c to 18 c and rainfall range between 490 740 mm mainly during summer the area has a heterogeneous land cover dominated by prairie vegetation mixed with crops and forest the observations provided by the arm program have been proved to be reliable in several studies venturini et al 2008 girolimetto and venturini 2014 zhu et al 2017 further information about the instruments and the facilities can be found at http www arm gov the af network was established in 1996 as a network of eddy covariance ec towers that provides continuous observations of carbon water and energy fluxes across the americas the ec technique measures the biosphere atmosphere exchanges every 30 min at a local scale a set of meteorological observations including ta rh ts sm direction and wind speed accompanied the flux measurements in this work field measurements were collected for five different stations distributed along the minnesota and illinois states stations us ib1 and us ib2 located in illinois and us ro1 us ro2 and us ro4 in minnesota were selected see fig 1 these towers are distributed over two land cover types cropland and grassland both with the same type of climate i e severe winters humid with no dry season and hot summers the average annual temperature is 9 c and 6 4 c and the mean annual precipitation is 930 mm and 879 mm for the illinois and minnesota area respectively the af network has also been widely used in several works mu et al 2007 wang and liang 2008 bhattarai et al 2017 more details about this network can be found in http ameriflux lbl gov the satellite data set used in this work is composed of passive microwave images and optical data of 25 days a summary of the acquisition day and name of the used products is presented in table 1 passive microwave information was obtained from smap satellite the nasa smap mission is an l band satellite in orbit which was explicitly devoted to provide global maps of sm entekhabi et al 2014 it carries a passive radiometer in l band that scan the earth s surface with a sun synchronous 6 00 am descending and 6 00 pm ascending in this study the l3 soil moisture passive smap l3 sm p and the l2 soil moisture sentinel passive smap l2 sm sp products have been used to build the relative evapotranspiration parameter the current baseline algorithm of smap radiometer sm product is the single channel algorithm sca that uses polarized brightness temperature observations o neill et al 2015 the l3 sm product is a daily gridded composed of the smap l2 radiometer sm product of 36 km spatial resolution the l2 sm product is derived from smap l band brightness temperature and copernicus sentinel 1 c band backscatter coefficients which are resampled to a fixed 3 km grid smap products are available at http smap jpl nasa gov et images from the optical moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor on board eos aqua were used to evaluate the proposed method this nasa mission was launched in 2002 as a part of the earth observing system eos aqua s orbit around the earth is timed so that it passes from south to north across the equator during the afternoon http modis gsfc nasa gov the myd16a2 product provides et maps at 500 m spatial resolution every eight days et is the accumulation of 8 day total water loss this product is based on others modis products and the penman monteith equation mu et al 2007 2011 3 results 3 1 data preprocessing smap sm and modis et products were georeferenced to a common geographic latitude longitude coordinate system particularly to georeference the smap l2 sm sp product a geographic lookup table file was made using the latitude and longitude bands that were included in this product these smap and modis products were used with their original spatial resolution i e 3 and 36 km for smap and 500 m for modis mean daily rn g ta and et values were required thus they were calculated by integrating half hourly measurements provided by arm and af networks rn and g were mapped using the inverse distance weighting method to interpolate data from arm and af stations even though there are several methodologies to compute these two variables from remotely sensed data bisht et al 2005 wang and liang 2009 li et al 2012 carmona et al 2015 observed data always represent the ground truth also parameter was computed with interpolated maps of ta obtained from the stations consequently here direct observations of these variables were chosen to minimize uncertainties in the resulting et estimates venturini et al 2008 3 2 etwv using smap at 36 km smsat value must be determined to estimate f from eq 4 chang et al 2003 found that the most representative soil type of the sgp region were loamy on the other hand the af stations are distributed over silty and silty loam soils based on cosby et al 1984 loam and silty loam soil textures have a smsat ranges from 40 4 to 47 6 respectively therefore the highest value of smsat was adopted to enclose all the possible saturation conditions field sm measurements and smap data were compared yielding a r2 of 0 38 and 0 15 for the arm and af observations respectively the poor correlation with ground af data could be due to the lower number of observations 38 than arm network 190 for the studied period observed arm sm varied from 5 to 35 6 and smap sm from 6 to 38 6 at the af network measured sm range from 23 3 to 43 4 and smap sm from 12 6 to 40 3 the differences between minimum observed sm values at both sites could be due to the higher annual precipitation of af compared to arm smap sm images and the smsat value were used to compute f and the relationship between f and observed sm for the studied period and datasets arm and af is shown in fig 2 it can be observed a moderated dispersion in fig 2 due to the differences between observed sm and smap product af data presented a larger dispersion than arm data however f increases with sm f was incorporated into the et formulation and its performance was evaluated mean daily et estimates obtained from different methodologies etmod were compared with et observations etobs from arm and af ground stations networks the p t etpt model the myd16a2 product etm and the proposed method etwv were evaluated the pixel scale of etmod mismatch the point station scale therefore the results validation at the pixel scale assumed that et observations are representative of the surrounding area the footprint of a tower is only a small fraction of the smap pixel thus it is difficult to represent the variability of such pixel with just an observation point however the validation procedure adopted here was widely used by several authors to verify moderated spatial resolution maps jiang and islam 2001 mu et al 2007 venturini et al 2008 mu et al 2011 barraza et al 2015 hu and jia 2015 li et al 2015 barraza et al 2017 knipper et al 2017 thus direct contrast between etmod and etobs were used when there was one station on the smap pixel otherwise observations within a pixel were averaged before contrasting the results myd16a2 estimated 8 day et data were converted into daily et dividing the pixel values by 8 before contrasting this product with etmod results the regional maximum minimum and mean of etobs and etmod are presented in table 2 etwv shows similar statistics for etobs at both networks the mean etwv differed from the mean etobs in 0 34 mm d and 0 65 mm d for the arm and af measurements respectively etpt yields higher values than etobs showing a difference in the mean value of 2 48 mm d and 2 55 mm d for the arm and af data such differences were expected since etpt model is considered to be a wet environment et formulation the etm product diverges from the average etobs in 3 26 mm d at the arm network and in 0 88 mm d at the af network in spite of the technological differences between arm and af observation towers et ranges are similar in both networks and consistent with the climate of each region table 3 presents a summary of the r2 rmse ubrmse and the bias for each evaluated methodology compared with in situ measurements from arm and af networks the etwv method yielded a rmse of 0 91 mm d and a bias of 0 33 mm d compared with arm field measurements at the af network the methodology showed a rmse of 1 22 mm d and a bias of 0 65 mm d the r2 were 0 90 and 0 79 for the arm and af data respectively the distinctive etwv behavior in both networks in terms of rmse and bias may be caused by the differences between bowen ratio and eddy covariance technologies as well as by the climate differences there is certain discrepancy between smap sm and observed sm at af sites which is reflected in f results see fig 2 the contrast between etwv and etobs from each network is observed in fig 3 where the overall agreement between both modeled et is reflected in the global rmse of 0 98 mm d as was expected etpt overestimated etobs for the studied period and datasets etpt comparison with af observations showed similar results to those obtained in arm network expressed by a rmse of 2 80 mm d and an ubrmse of 1 51 mm d fig 4 shows that etpt with arm and af dataset overestimated et observations etm presented a poor correlation with ground arm observations with a rmse of 3 94 mm d and ubrmse of 2 18 mm d notably etm with af data yielded a rmse ubrmse and bias of about half of those calculated with arm observations although the r2 were similar for arm and af measurements see table 3 fig 5 shows the relationship between myd16a2 et product and the observed et for the studied period and networks the reader can observe that results from af are closer to the 1 1 line than arm etm in all cases etwv showed a better performance than the etpt and the well known operative product myd16a2 these results are consistent with those from different works that validated modis et product ramoelo et al 2014 hu and jia 2015 autovino et al 2016 barraza et al 2017 additionally a seasonal analysis of the errors for all the data was made table 4 presents the bias rmse and ubrmse for the etwv model estimations compared with ground observations for three seasons i e summer spring and fall clearly the errors were not equally distributed during the seasons i e as the et decreased the errors increased in percentages of the mean observed et although the nominal error decreased with et during summer when the water demand is extreme the etwv method showed the lowest rmse close to 14 of the mean observed et fig 6 shows the seasonal variation of etobs and etmod for selected stations stations e9 e15 e36 and e40 of the arm network and both stations of the af network over pasture grassland and cropland land covers were randomly selected it is clear that etwv performs significantly better than the etm method for the studied period and analyzed stations the proposed model seems to follow the same variation as etobs over time besides as it was mentioned before etm underestimated the arm in situ measurements and capture the behavior of the af observations this preliminary analysis suggested that the new model appropriately represent the bowen ratio and eddy covariance observations venturini et al s in 2008 reported overall values of 1 19 mm d for the rmse and 0 38 mm d for the bias in 2014 girolimetto and venturini presented a rmse of 1 40 mm d and a bias of 0 51 mm d for sgp region using only modis products barraza et al 2015 and barraza et al 2017 published rmse values of 0 60 to 0 86 mm d and r2 of about 0 37 to 0 72 for mean daily et estimated by combining optical and passive microwave data their model did not include sm information in penman monteith formulation hu and jia 2015 proposed a hybrid remote sensing model incorporating amsr e sm data to approximate daily et in a semi arid inland river basin their results yielded rmses from 0 63 to 0 87 mm d for different sites however the model used by these authors calculate all the resistance factors reason why it is data demanding and might not be suitable for remote region knipper et al 2017 used smos passive microwave data and modified p t with a soil moisture function to finally obtain r2 between modeled and observed et varying from 0 63 to 0 83 and rmses ranging from 1 40 to 3 37 mm d the structure of their model is similar to that presented here but with an intricate soil moisture function that depend on root zone moisture a vegetation index and soil properties recently bhattarai et al 2017 proposed a modification of seb bastiaanssen et al 1998 model using venturini et al f parameterization these authors found rmse of about 0 73 to 1 24 mm d with af dataset in different biomes however their model require many data from different sources at this point it is important to highlight that the etwv model exhibited results comparable with those published by other authors while it explicitly rates the water availability for evapotranspiration i e the sm content and implicitly consider the resistance factor finally introducing the sm content in es estimation led to a physically meaningful estimation of venturini et al s f that notably reduced the errors originally published by the authors this modification does not overtly incorporate atmospheric variables such as the original venturini et al s model indicating that f can be explained only by surface variables therefore the relationship between et and epot directly depends on the soil water content and soil texture moreover this modification minimized the number of variables introduced in the venturini et al s model venturini et al 2008 yielding a simplest and robust model furthermore etwv equation is applicable with different satellite datasets to any remote region since it is based on universal relationships 3 2 1 etwv sensitivity analysis in this work etwv model was applied using the highest smsat value to enclose all the possible saturation conditions i e the whole study area was assumed to have a silty loam soil type however in vast regions variations of the soil type and textures are expected for instance fig 7 shows the soil s texture based on webb et al 1991 and the corresponding smsat derived by cosby et al 1984 for arm fig 7a and af fig 7b regions for both regions it can be seen that changes within the soil texture imply slight variations in smsat therefore was needed to perform a sensitivity analysis of the variable the objective of this analysis was to determine the significance of smsat errors in etwv estimates hence smsat was modified assuming variations of 2 and 4 of the silty loam smsat i e smsat equal to 46 47 48 49 and 50 were used to compute etwv and contrasted them with the etobs table 5 shows the bias and the rmse obtained in each case in general variations of 2 to 4 in smsat imply variations in etwv rmses of about 1 2 to 3 while 2 to 4 variation of smsat yielded rmse of 1 to 1 7 clearly the method is sensitive to smsat variations however the errors in this parameter would not be magnified in et estimates remarkably slightly better results were found when using smsat for silty clay loam texture although it does not ensure the saturation condition when silty loam soils dominated the area 3 3 etwv using smap at 3 km the recently released smap l2 sm sp product provides estimates of land surface conditions on a fixed 3 km grid this new product would make possible to improve the calculated etwv spatial resolutions considering this the proposed etwv methodology was also analyzed using smap sm product at 3 km spatial resolution for the sgp region where the number of arm station are enough to ensure the validate process since smap l2 sm sp is a beta product still in a validation process it may contain some errors thus results from the contrast with ground observations are preliminary and further research should be done this product has a discontinuous temporal coverage limiting the available data mainly to autumn winter of 2017 das et al 2017 for this reason only six days were evaluated see table 1 during the studied days observed sm ranged from 7 4 to 32 7 and smap sm product from 6 9 to 26 4 ground sm measurements and smap sm data comparison yielded a r2 of 0 53 see fig 8 a preliminary conclusion at this stage could be that for the analyzed days the smap l2 sm sp underestimated sm observations mean daily etwv estimations using smap at 3 km spatial resolution were evaluated against etobs the range of etobs varies from 0 54 to 2 80 mm d while etwv ranges from 0 30 to 3 81 mm d during the studied dates etwv versus etobs resulted in a rmse of 0 63 mm d an ubrmse of 0 55 mm d and a bias of 0 32 mm d whereas the coefficient r2 was 0 61 the etwv with this new smap product presented an acceptable correlation with field measurements as shown in fig 9 it should be note that the latest rmse it is about 40 of the mean autumn winter et observed value usually errors are magnified during winter consistent with the temperature drop lópez moreno et al 2009 in order to analyze the spatial distribution of the etwv maps at 3 km spatial resolution were compared with those obtained at 36 km interpolated rn and g maps were resized to smap spatial resolutions then they were subtracted and multiplied by constant δ and γ values and f image required in eq 1 two randomly selected days were presented in fig 10 03 13 2017 and 11 21 2017 the first column shows the etwv maps at 36 km and the second column the estimated etwv at 3 km the smap l2 sm sp product has regions with non value pixels which are masked with zero values black areas in fig 10 in general the etwv at 36 km ranged from 1 47 to 3 27 mm d and from 0 38 to 1 93 mm d for 03 13 2017 and 21 11 2017 respectively for the same dates etwv at 3 km varied from 0 80 to 4 40 mm d and from 0 31 to 2 42 mm d the mean values on the 03 13 2017 at 36 km and 3 km spatial resolution were 2 42 mm d and 2 60 mm d respectively on 11 21 2017 the average values were 1 16 mm d and 1 37 mm d a visual comparison indicated that the general spatial gradient of both et sources agrees even though etwv at 3 km maps seems to capture more detailed spatial et variations than etwv at 36 km giving a wider range of et estimations 4 conclusion in this study a new parameterization of the relative evapotranspiration introduced by venturini et al 2008 was presented as in venturini et al 2008 the assumption that the wind function similarly affects actual and potential et was also used however here the actual water vapor pressure of the surface was estimated using the soil moisture content due to the facts that many authors had investigated the relationship between the water vapor pressure of an evapotranspirating surface and the soil moisture since 1940 was decided to adopt deardorff 1978 assumption because it simply stated that both variables are linearly related thus the surface moisture ratio defined as the ratio between soil moisture and smsat replaced the traditional relative evapotranspiration f es ea e s ea formulation the theoretical background of the etwv derivation yielded a model without calibration parameters and flexible in terms of data sources however smap passive microwave products were used here for testing purposes ground observations from arm and af networks were selected to validate the new model results with coarse spatial resolution 36 km of smap soil moisture product etwv estimates were compared with in situ observations showing rmses of 0 91 and 1 22 mm d with bowen ratio and eddy covariance stations respectively it is worth to note that most of the ground measurement stations were located in pasture grass and crop fields and none of them in forest areas the overall rmse was about 0 98 mm d comparable with results from other authors for these types of land use as discussed in the results section moreover the temporal variability of etwv estimates followed etobs along time in pasture and crop fields while modis et product did not succeeded to capturing et temporal variation preliminary maps of etwv with a better spatial resolution 3 km were achieved for the southern great plains region using a recently released smap soil moisture product the comparison with field measurements resulted in a rmse of 0 63 mm d an ubrmse of 0 55 mm d and a bias of 0 32 mm d for autumn winter season etwv at 3 km could not be verified for spring summer season when et water loss reaches higher values and it is necessary to have better accuracies in the et estimation however the preliminary etwv maps at 3 km are richer in details than those one obtained using smap soil moisture product at 36 km besides the fact than the mean regional values are similar a visual comparison indicated that etwv 3 km copied the regional patterns of etwv at 36 km however further research with smap l2 sm sp product will be done as soon as smap scientific team release more data the etwv results can be improved considering smsat spatial variability indeed here this parameter was assumed constant for the whole region yet slight variability in the soil texture is expected at the pixel scale thus more realistic etwv estimates can be obtained by combining soil texture maps with smap soil moisture incorporating a new soil information layer would bring more details to et maps although the smsat sensitivity analysis showed that the new model parameterization would not amplify parameter s errors our ongoing research is looking forward to verify the applicability of the proposed new method to woodland areas where the main source of water for the trees are underground water rather than superficial water content in such a case remote sensing data may not be the appropriate source

11119,wheat triticum aestivum is one of the most important staple food crops in ethiopia however its production is limited by moisture and nutrient stresses a field experiment was conducted in northern ethiopia to i evaluate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizer application rates on yield biomass and irrigation water productivity iwp of wheat ii calibrate and validate a crop model for simulating yield and biomass of wheat under different levels of nitrogen and irrigation applications iii evaluate consecutive above ground biomass accumulation as affected by different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer rates the decision support for agro technology transfer cropping system model dssat csm was calibrated and validated with experimental data the calibrated and validated dssat csm was used to simulate wheat biomass yield and irrigation water productivity under rainfed and three irrigation scenarios i0 rainfed di1 two irrigations from heading

kg ha simulation results showed that both irrigation and nitrogen applications positively affected wheat yield biomass and iwp much of the increase in biomass and yield was due to increased n than to increased irrigation yield increased with increase in n application rates however at a diminishing rate yielding a curvilinear relationship four irrigation di2 starting from heading to early grain filling stage resulted in a yield similar to di3 six irrigation applications from heading to mid grain filling stage simulations showed that two irrigation applications strategy di1 yielded relatively higher iwp 1 8 kg m3 at the highest application rate of 160 kg n ha further economic analysis would help to identify most efficient practices for wheat production in northern ethiopia keywords dssat irrigation nitrogen wheat ethiopia 1 introduction ethiopia is one of the major wheat triticum aestivum producers in africa tefera 2012 wheat is the fourth largest crop grown in ethiopia behind tef eragrostis tef maize zea mays and sorghum sorghum bicolor csa 2012 wheat can be grown at elevations between 1900 and 2700 m above sea level hailu 1991 crop production in ethiopia mainly depends on amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season bewket and conway 2007 in particular the northern part of the country has a rainfall period of only 2 3 months too short to grow a cereal crop araya and stroosnijder 2011 in addition late onset and early cessation of the rainfall further limits the crop production araya et al 2010b 2012 deficit irrigation is a water saving practice in water constrained environments oweis et al 2000 where irrigation is applied selectively at sensitive stage of a crop deficit irrigation improves yield per unit of water but may not maximize yield per unit of land zhang and oweis 1999 zhang 2003 deficit irrigation in conjunction with improved nutrient management in organic fertilizer application or organic forms of nutrients can enhance crop productivity and water productivity zhang et al 1998 oweis et al 2000 mandal et al 2005 araya et al 2010a such practices will contribute towards stabilizing the yield and providing better opportunities to achieve food self sufficiency and income oweis et al 2000 oweis and hachum 2012 however the response of wheat to combined use of n and p fertilizers and deficit irrigation is not well understood in northern ethiopia as a result there has been uncertainty about the use of recommended fertilizer rates in relation to the seasonal rainfall as well as deficit irrigation the high mobility of n and greater possibility of p fixation in northern ethiopian soils make these nutrients critical in soil fertility management moard 2006 to solve this problem application of mineral fertilizers is important habtegebrial and singh 2006 in some cases use of mineral fertilizers might have little positive effect on yield when water is limiting el mejahed and aouragh 2005 rusan et al 2005 in northern ethiopia rainfall ceases soil water scarcity usually occurs after start of booting or flowering of wheat it is not clear to what extent wheat irrigation water productivity could be improved if wheat is supplied with additional irrigation from a heading to grain milk stage zgs 55 73 and b heading to ripening zgs 55 90 under current or improved fertilizer management practices understanding the response of wheat to these alternative water and nutrient management practices along with the number of irrigation applications based on long term climate perspectives is needed to assist producers to improve irrigation water productivity and enable appropriate sharing of resources water and fertilizers among users to enhance resource use efficiency and increase overall production however it is very difficult and expensive to addresses these critical issues with experimental evidences as it is affected by many environmental and management factors including climate soil cultivar management and location crop models are computer programs that uses quantitative representations of plant and soils processes to simulate plant growth and development under different management and climate conditions crop models are decision making tools effective to address the aforementioned issues in cost effective and timely way the objectives of the current research were to i evaluate the effects of irrigation and n and p fertilizer application rates on grain yield above ground biomass and irrigation water productivity iwp of wheat ii calibrate and validate a crop model for simulating grain yield and above ground biomass of wheat under different levels of nitrogen and irrigation application rates and iii evaluate consecutive above ground biomass accumulation as affected by different combinations of irrigation and fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment that was conducted in 2012 and 2013 at mekelle endayesus ey lat 13 28 n long 39 30 e and altitude of 2212 m above sea level northern ethiopia mekelle is a semi arid agricultural region with two rainfall seasons the belg or very light rain season february to may and the kiremt or the main rain season june to september araya et al 2010b about 80 of annual rainfall is received between the months of june and september while the other 20 is received between february and may araya and stroosnijder 2011 long term 1980 2013 daily meteorological data for the study site such as temperature minimum and maximum relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed were obtained from the ethiopian national meteorological agency enma the mean annual rainfall was approximately 600 mm the annual reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the total annual eto for mekelle endayesus ey was 1750 mm the 2012 and 2013 growing season s jul nov mean minimum maximum and average temperature ranges from 10 to 14 22 25 and 16 5 19 0 c respectively in 2012 and 2013 rainfall depth of 367 4 and 273 3 mm respectively was received from planting to harvest the experimental soil texture was sandy clay loam table 1 presents soil chemical and physical characteristics for experimental site 2 2 experimental setup cultivar fertilizer use quantity type and n p ratio rainfall trends in irrigation water use and commonly achievable high target yield levels in the region were assessed before conducting the current research wheat was planted on july 05 in 2012 and on july 16 to 20 in 2013 with a raw spacing and depth of about 16 and 3 cm respectively and at a plant density of 250 plants m2 the local variety of bread wheat har 2501 known as hawi was used as a test crop the plot size was 2 5 4 0 and 3 0 4 0 m in 2012 and 2013 respectively the spacing between treatments and replications was approximately 1 5 m the experiments in both 2012 and 2013 used a two factorial randomized complete block deign rcbd with three replications it consisted of three levels of fertilizer rates that mimic prevailing practices in the region no fertilizer f0 32 kg n and 23 kg p ha f1 and 64 kg n and 46 kg p ha f2 in combinations with one rainfed i0 no irrigation and two irrigation treatments i1 irrigation from heading to grain milk stage zgs 55 73 and i2 irrigation from heading to ripening zgs 55 90 i2 table 2 under standard condition crop evapotranspiration is determined by climate reference evapotranspiration and crop characteristics crop coefficient while under non standard field conditions crop evapotranspiration is affected by climate crop characteristics management and other environmental factors allen et al 1998 wheat crop coefficient is available in fao publications doorenbos and pruitt 1977 doorenbos et al 1979 allen et al 1998 the reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated based on fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 in northern ethiopia the time of rainy period during the main crop growing season is shorter than the length of growing period of many cereals studies showed rainfall in northern ethiopia ends around early to mid september when most small grain cereals reach at heading stage araya et al 2011 araya and stroosnijder 2011 araya et al 2012 accordingly in this experiment irrigation was scheduled to meet the crop water needs of selected wheat crop growth stages at time of heading and afterwards table 2 the crop coefficient for wheat at time of heading to early grain filling irrigation treatment i1 reaches as high as 1 2 doorenbos et al 1979 allen et al 1998 based on long term climate information 1980 2010 the daily eto at time of heading and afterwards in september to october ranged from 5 to 6 mm day however crop evapotranspiration rate gradually decreases after the start of leaf senescence allen et al 1998 araya et al 2011 despite the variability in eto and crop coefficient a fixed irrigation depth and interval was determined to give practical sense to water users in sandy clay loam soils based on the following assumptions the soil average water holding capacity was approximately 100 mm m table 1 since irrigation was done manually using a pipe over small plots controlled the irrigation efficiency was assumed to be 80 considering soil depth of 0 6 m table1 with assumed maximum soil water depletion before moisture stress occurs as 40 and eto of 5 5 mm day the applied fixed depth was a reasonable estimate based on eqs 1 and 2 1 t w 1000 q f c q w p r z 2 r a d p t w where tw is total available soil water in the root zone mm qfc soil water content at field capacity m3 m3 qwp water content at wilting point m3 m3 rz rooting depth m ra is readily available soil water mm or the crop uses water from the soil without stress dp is a depletion fraction 0 1 dp values differ by crop soil and et value allen et al 1998 in this work dp value of 0 4 for wheat grown in sandy clay loam soils was assumed reasonable in this case the calculated readily available soil water 23 5 mm was adequate to meet the daily crop water needs 5 5 mm day for at least four days accordingly an irrigation depth of 20 and 25 mm was applied every four days in 2012 and 2013 respectively nitrogen was broadcast in two split applications half at planting and the other half 30 days after planting phosphorus was applied as basal dose at sowing only the main source of n and p were urea 46 n and di ammonium phosphate dap 18 n and 46 p respectively 2 3 yield and yield components in 2012 only days to flowering and maturity and grain yield were recorded whereas in 2013 the phenology days to flowering and maturity biomass grain yield and related components 1000 grain weight and sequential dry matter were recorded in 2013 the sequentially cumulative above ground dry biomass was collected at 10 day intervals starting from 10 days after planting throughout the growing season from a small representative plot area of 20 20 cm and replicated three times for each treatment the sequential above ground biomass was oven dried at 65 c until constant weight was recorded final grain yield and above ground biomass were measured at harvest maturity from the middle plot area of 2 2 m 2 4 irrigation water productivity iwp irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated using the equation applied by zhang et al 1999 howell 2001 and araya et al 2011 eq 3 3 i w p g y i g r i where gyi is grain yield obtained from irrigated treatments kg ha gr is the corresponding yield obtained from rainfed treatment kg ha and i is the amount of irrigation water m3 ha percent of yield pg changes was estimated as the yield obtained from the various treatments minus the yield obtained from the control i0f0 divided by the yield obtained from the control treatment and multiplied by 100 percent of biomass pbm changes was calculated using the same method analysis of variance anova was carried out to determine the effects of irrigation and fertilizer application rates on wheat yield and related components using genstat a statistical software means among treatments were compared using duncan s multiple range test 2 5 model set up calibration and validation the dssat csm v 4 7 jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 was used for evaluating management scenarios in this study model calibration involve entry of the actual soil and daily climate data including minimum and maximum temperatures rainfall and solar radiation initial soil water and nitrogen residue cover and other management practices the initial soil water and nitrogen content was set as 60 and 2 kg ha with a residue cover of 1000 kg ha undocumented data the planting date for the calibration dataset in 2012 and 2013 was on 05th and 20th of july respectively with a plant density of 250 plants m2 planted at 3 cm depth and 16 cm row spacing the cultivar har2501 was used in both experiment seasons 2012 and 2013 all fertiliser and irrigation interaction treatments in 2012 and the i2f2 treatment in 2013 were used for model calibration calibration procedures followed as presented in hoogenboom et al 2012 the experimental data for the other 8 treatments in 2013 were used for model validation accordingly the model was treated exactly similar to the experiment with three different nitrogen n rates 0 32 and 64 kg ha in combination with three different irrigation strategies rainfed i0 four irrigations from heading to early grain filling zgs 55 73 i1 eleven irrigations from heading to maturity zgs 55 90 table 2 the model was instructed to simulate yield biomass days to flowering and maturity based on the treatments the measured data of the various treatments were compared with the simulated model simulation performance evaluations was carried using a statistical fitness of test that include r2 index of agreement ia eq 4 and normalized root mean square of error and percent of deviation eq 5 4 i a 1 i 1 n p i m s i 2 i 1 n p i m s x m s i m s x 2 where pi predicted msi measured and msx measured average value according to liu et al 2013 ia values 0 70 0 71 0 80 0 81 0 90 and 0 91 indicated poor moderate good and excellent agreements respectively normalized root means square of error nrmse which was calculated as root means square of error divided by the average of the measured value of treatments for the parameter variable under consideration according to soler et al 2007 values less than 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 indicate good moderate fair and poor performance respectively the percent of deviation pv is another performance statistic used on this study 5 p v p i m s i m s i 100 where pi predicted simulated msi measured and msx average of the measure values 2 6 model simulation setup and scenarios after calibration and validation the model was used to simulate yield and biomass of the same wheat cultivar at a nearby location adigudom ag located at latitude of 13 15 e and longitude of 39 30 n with elevation of 2068 m above sea level with similar climate and soils condition as in mekelle endayesus ey site fig 1 this location was selected due to availability of long term climate data and representativeness in terms of cropping system soil and agrometeorological conditions long term daily climate data from ag 1980 2009 that included rainfall minimum and maximum temperature and solar radiation was obtained from ethiopian national meteorological agency the soils data as described in table 1 was entered into the model agronomic management that include four irrigation treatments i0 rainfed no irrigation di1 two irrigations at heading and flowering di2 four irrigations at heading and early grain filling and di3 six irrigations from heading to mid grain filling table 3 and nine nitrogen treatments 0 16 32 48 64 80 96 112 128 and 160 kg ha were also set into the model table 3 source of nitrogen was urea which was applied in two equal split applications each at sowing and 30 days after sowing previous crop was assumed to be wheat with a residue of 1000 kg ha and nitrogen content of the residue of 0 8 the initial soil water and nitrogen content of the soil at planting was set to 65 and 8 kg ha respectively undocumented data the model crop cultivar planting date plant population spacing and planting depth for evaluating different fertilizer and irrigation strategies with long term climatic data were the same as that used in the model calibration unless otherwise mentioned finally simulated yield biomass and calculated iwp under various combinations of nitrogen and irrigation application strategies were plotted 3 results 3 1 yield and related components and iwp based on measured experimental data the days to flowering and maturity in treatments f2 were significantly higher p 0 05 than the f0 treatments table 4 there were significant differences p 0 05 among fertilizer treatments in grain yield during the 2013 cropping season table 4 the highest grain yield p 0 05 was obtained with treatment i2f2 yield increased by 186 followed by i1f2 yield increased by 155 when compared to the control table 4 for the irrigation strategy i0 yield increased by 61 in response to change from f0 to f1 treatment p 0 05 similarly under i0 strategy increasing fertilizer application rate from f0 to f2 increased the yield by 70 while under i1 strategy increasing fertilizer application rate from f0 to f1 and f0 to f2 increased yield by 70 and 131 respectively under i2 strategy increased fertilizer application rate from f0 to f2 increased yield by 75 with no fertilizer application f0 application of i1 irrigation strategy resulted in a 10 increase in yield and an additional irrigation with i2 strategy increased wheat yield by 65 p 0 05 over the control which means that the increased irrigation from i1 to i2 added a 55 yield gain relative to the control which was significantly different table 4 there was significant p 0 05 yield increase by 22 to 75 and 9 to 98 due to increased fertilizer application rates from f0 to f1 and f1 to f2 respectively relative to the control similarly yield significantly p 0 05 increased by 9 6 to 84 and 3 to 56 with a change in the irrigation strategy from i0 to i1 and i1 to i2 respectively compared to the control there was no significant difference in cumulative above ground biomass of wheat among the three irrigation strategies figs 2 and 3 when grown with no fertilizer applications in contrast between 60 90 days after planting there was a significant increase p 0 05 in the above ground biomass accumulation when i2 irrigation strategy is applied in combination with f2 fertilizer rate however the increases in the above ground biomass was minor when irrigation strategy is changed from i1 to i2 indicating that i1 irrigation strategy met most the crop water demand during the growing season cumulative above ground biomass under three irrigation levels was substantially affected by fertilizer rates for example the above ground biomass 50 90 days after planting in treatment i2f2 was much higher than that with i2f0 p 0 05 similarly the above ground biomass 50 90 days after planting in i0f2 was substantially higher than in i0f0 p 0 05 however wheat treated with i2f2 was not substantially different from i2f1 effects of fertilizer treatments were more clearly observed after 50 days of planting this study showed that wheat s response to fertilizer was much higher than that with irrigation water application treatments i0f1 and i0f2 resulted in final biomass gains p 0 05 of 48 and 75 respectively when compared with the control i0f0 further increases in fertilizer application rate from i0f1 to i0f2 i1f1 to i1f2 and i2fi to i2f2 increased the above ground biomass p 0 05 by 27 60 and 75 respectively the final above ground biomass increases in both i1f0 and i2f0 treatments were not significantly different from the control i0f0 table 4 increase due to irrigation applications were relatively small when compared to the biomass increase due to fertilizer applications the final above ground biomass was highest with the i2f2 treatment however the increase with i2f2 treatment was not substantially different from i1f2 table 4 and thus was not efficient considering the additional amount of water applied over the treatment i1f2 3 2 irrigation water productivity iwp higher iwp was recorded with the i1 treatment when compared to i2 the iwp of wheat for the har 2501 cultivar ranged from 0 14 to 2 4 kg m3 it decreased with increase in irrigation amount this implies that irrigating wheat during its heading to grain milk stage 4 irrigations has relative yield advantages per unit of water when compared to irrigating wheat during its heading to ripening z55 90 growth stages the results indicated that deficit irrigation in combinations with relatively higher fertilizer application rate f2 resulted in considerably higher iwp table 4 3 3 model calibration and validation the model was able to simulate the measured grain yield and phenology in 2012 and 2013 the model simulated the measured grain yield for the calibration dataset with normalized root mean square of error of 19 indicating the difference between the predicted and measured values prediction errors were low there was strong agreement between the simulated and measured grain yield with r2 fig 4 and index of agreement values of 0 87 and 0 98 respectively similarly the model simulated the measured yield and biomass data validation dataset with ia of 0 97 and 0 87 respectively table 5 results indicated strong relationship between the measured and simulated yield and biomass with r2 values of 0 94 and 0 74 respectively fig 5a b the normalized root mean square of error for yield and biomass were 10 2 and 21 6 respectively table 5 the statistical evaluation showed that yield was adequately simulated by the model when compared to the measured biomass fig 5 b in addition the days to flowering and maturity were predicted with nrmse of 11 6 and 3 4 respectively overall the model has satisfactorily simulated the yield biomass and phenology of the wheat cultivar used in this study the genetic coefficients for the har2501 are presented in table 6 3 4 simulated grain yield biomass and iwp as affected by nitrogen and irrigation strategies 3 4 1 yield and biomass grain and biomass yield increased with increase in nitrogen fertilizer rate the highest grain and biomass yield were obtained with di3 fig 6 a and b there was a curvilinear relationship between yield and nitrogen similarly there was an increase in yield with increase in irrigation from i0 rainfed to application of irrigation from heading to mid of grain filling stage di3 although there was an increase in grain and biomass yield with increase in irrigation irrigation beyond di2 did not increased the biomass and grain yield significantly fig 6a and b 3 4 2 irrigation water productivity iwp simulated iwp increased with increase in nitrogen fertilizer rate fig 7 the highest iwps were obtained from two irrigation applied between heading to flowering stage 1 8 kg m3 followed by four irrigation applied during heading to early grain filling stage 1 5 kg m3 with highest n application rate the lowest iwp 0 1 kg m3 was obtained in treatment with two irrigations at heading to flowering stages with zero n application fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 yield and its components grain yield of wheat treated with i2f2 experiment and di2 or di3 n 160 kg ha simulations were higher than that in other treatments this is most likely due to availability of adequate plant nutrients and water in the root zone that increases leaf expansion and leaf area growth kibe et al 2006 which improves light and co2 capture experimental studies have shown that wheat with optimal n levels produce relatively higher leaf area index and intercept more radiation to produce more biomass and grain yield caviglia and sadras 2001 in addition to enhanced transport of plant assimilates the relatively longer period to maturity compared to treatments with reduced water and fertilizer availability could be a factor treatments with a relatively longer growing period are more likely to accumulate more assimilates over an extended period compared to those slightly shorter growing period adequate supply of n was reported to increase crop transpiration when compared to wheat treated with low n inputs zhang et al 1998 the increase in transpiration in turn could lead to a substantial increase in biomass and grain yield steduto et al 2009 this study showed that deficit irrigation substantially improved biomass and grain yield of wheat many reports have indicated that irrigation applied during water sensitive periods stem elongation or jointing booting anthesis and early grain filling when combined with suitable fertilizer application rates could result in higher yield zhang and oweis 1999 huang et al 2004 zhang et al 2006 this study also showed that higher fertilizer input under rainfed water stressed conditions results in low yield this could be related to the accumulation of high canopy growth during the rainy period followed by long dry spells after cessation of rain enhancing quick senescence and reduced translocation grain formation and grain filling period giunta et al 1993 likewise increasing water availability at low fertilizer levels has been shown to result in low leaf area index and yield montazar and mohseni 2011 this was substantiated at our experimental site not shown in which there was a 10 increase in yield in i1f0 over i0f0 which is relatively small given the large amount of water applied under i1f0 strategy similarly simulation results showed that there was slight increase in yield with increased irrigation under no nitrogen fertilizer input but was not significant this implies that irrigation under no or low fertilizer input in less fertile soils was less productive compared to those supplied with adequate fertilizer mirzaei et al 2011 reported that moisture stress during stem elongation could reduce grain yield significantly water deficit during grain filling will reduce grain weight and yield plaut et al 2004 additional irrigation late in the season did not show significant yield gain over the others which were treated with irrigation up to early grain filling stage with the same fertilizer rate studies showed that nitrogen uptake and use correlated with the quantity of irrigation water applied abourached et al 2008 this study showed that wheat yield increased with nitrogen fertilizer rates although the increase per unit of applied nitrogen gradually decreased to have a curve linear relationship there was an increase in above ground biomass and plant height with an increase in n and p fertilizer applications similarly mandal et al 2005 observed better leaf and biomass growth enhanced tillering capability ear bearing tillers and better grain formation when sufficient n with optimal water was applied to wheat optimal fertilizer and water interaction effects could be reflected by a substantial increase in the transpiration component which in turn increases yield and biomass zhang et al 1998 oweis et al 2000 in the current study there were considerable interaction effects between deficit irrigation and n fertilizer 4 2 irrigation water productivity iwp this study showed that deficit irrigation improved the iwp of wheat compared to full irrigation prior studies have indicated that wheat is more responsive to mid than late season irrigation zhang and oweis 1999 zhang et al 1999 kibe et al 2006 which indicates that more yield per applied water can be obtained by applying irrigation water from heading to grain milk stage rather than heading to ripening growth stages in arid and semi arid areas where moisture stress occurs during the crops moisture sensitive stages deficit irrigation can result in higher yield kijne et al 2009 montazar and mohseni 2011 oweis and hachum 2012 huang et al 2005 and wang et al 2012 also reported that iwp decreased in non stressed wheat compared to mildly stressed conditions because the available soil water during stress conditions was used more effectively when compared to non stressed conditions other studies have also indicated an increase in root extraction capabilities under mild water stress conditions compared to non water stress conditions li et al 2004 mesbah 2009 in addition the extra water not used in producing grain may be lost via soil water evaporation or deep percolation higher levels of irrigation may also enhance nutrient leaching wang et al 2012 furthermore application of irrigation during the heading to grain milk could facilitate pollination and the transport of nutrient and plant assimilates for the formation of grain compared to the application of water during dough to ripening when it is primarily for grain filling late grain filling can also be accomplished from translocation of stored carbon and nutrients from leaves or stems the iwps in the experimental study ranged from 0 14 to 2 4 kg m3 which is almost within the ranges of values 0 32 to 2 52 kg m3 reported in north china zhang et al 1999 similarly the iwps 0 1 to 1 8 kg m3 based on simulated yield was within but less than the reported range of values the difference in simulated iwp values might be attributed to difference in climate cultivar and irrigation amount used for example the simulated average iwp based on long term climate 1980 2009 was affected by year to year variation in climate however iwp increased especially with nitrogen application the increase in iwp with n and p fertilizer application might be attributed to the relatively higher grain yield in treatments with higher n fertilizer application rates when compared to the other treatments from the current results it can be seen that irrigation water was not efficiently used by wheat plants under lower or no nitrogen fertilizer application due to low leaf area index low canopy cover reduced radiation interception and increased evaporation caviglia and sadras 2001 reduced transport of plant assimilates and slightly reduced days to maturity when sufficient water and nitrogen were provided like in i1f2 it increased yield per unit water applied this indicates that fertilizer nutrient supply influences water productivity zhang et al 1998 oweis et al 2000 caviglia and sadras 2001 mandal et al 2005 therefore understanding the optimal interaction of fertilizers and water could be vital for higher iwp and greater yield wang et al 2012 revealed that a high rate of n fertilizer 221 kg ha with moderate irrigation improves iwp deficit irrigation in conjunction with good n supply could improve iwp howell 2001 and mandal et al 2005 suggested careful management decisions need to be made in this regard for improved yield and water productivities simulation study with dssat as presented in this work could guide decisions and provide producers and agronomists with necessary information on best and efficient agronomic management to follow in order to achieve the desired goal of improving productivity and resource use efficiency 5 conclusions this study showed a strong and positive interdependence between irrigation and nitrogen application rates as well as timing of irrigation increasing irrigation levels alone had little impact at low fertilizer nutrient levels yield might increase with nitrogen rates but the rate of increase in yield per applied nitrogen gradually decreased resulting in a curvilinear relationship in addition wheat was not responsive for irrigation after early grain filling thus there is no need for additional irrigation after the milk stage of wheat since the rainfall in northern ethiopia ends shortly after the start of heading the treatment combination that resulted in the highest irrigation water productivity is recommended experimental data showed that for higher iwp grain and biomass farmers should use at least 64 kg n and 46 kg p ha in combination with irrigation from heading to grain milk stage simulations showed that higher nitrogen up to 160 kg ha could improve yield 3 8 mg ha significantly with good supply of irrigation 4 irrigations with total of 100 mm during the most sensitive stages of the crop development however further economic analyses can help with best options that can provide most efficient and economic management practices for improving wheat yields in northern ethiopia acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the foundation for food

11119,wheat triticum aestivum is one of the most important staple food crops in ethiopia however its production is limited by moisture and nutrient stresses a field experiment was conducted in northern ethiopia to i evaluate the effects of irrigation and nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizer application rates on yield biomass and irrigation water productivity iwp of wheat ii calibrate and validate a crop model for simulating yield and biomass of wheat under different levels of nitrogen and irrigation applications iii evaluate consecutive above ground biomass accumulation as affected by different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer rates the decision support for agro technology transfer cropping system model dssat csm was calibrated and validated with experimental data the calibrated and validated dssat csm was used to simulate wheat biomass yield and irrigation water productivity under rainfed and three irrigation scenarios i0 rainfed di1 two irrigations from heading to flowering di2 four irrigations from heading to early grain filling and di3 six irrigations from heading to mid grain filling period in combination with nine n rates 0 16 32 64 80 96 112 128 and 160 kg ha simulation results showed that both irrigation and nitrogen applications positively affected wheat yield biomass and iwp much of the increase in biomass and yield was due to increased n than to increased irrigation yield increased with increase in n application rates however at a diminishing rate yielding a curvilinear relationship four irrigation di2 starting from heading to early grain filling stage resulted in a yield similar to di3 six irrigation applications from heading to mid grain filling stage simulations showed that two irrigation applications strategy di1 yielded relatively higher iwp 1 8 kg m3 at the highest application rate of 160 kg n ha further economic analysis would help to identify most efficient practices for wheat production in northern ethiopia keywords dssat irrigation nitrogen wheat ethiopia 1 introduction ethiopia is one of the major wheat triticum aestivum producers in africa tefera 2012 wheat is the fourth largest crop grown in ethiopia behind tef eragrostis tef maize zea mays and sorghum sorghum bicolor csa 2012 wheat can be grown at elevations between 1900 and 2700 m above sea level hailu 1991 crop production in ethiopia mainly depends on amount and distribution of rainfall during the growing season bewket and conway 2007 in particular the northern part of the country has a rainfall period of only 2 3 months too short to grow a cereal crop araya and stroosnijder 2011 in addition late onset and early cessation of the rainfall further limits the crop production araya et al 2010b 2012 deficit irrigation is a water saving practice in water constrained environments oweis et al 2000 where irrigation is applied selectively at sensitive stage of a crop deficit irrigation improves yield per unit of water but may not maximize yield per unit of land zhang and oweis 1999 zhang 2003 deficit irrigation in conjunction with improved nutrient management in organic fertilizer application or organic forms of nutrients can enhance crop productivity and water productivity zhang et al 1998 oweis et al 2000 mandal et al 2005 araya et al 2010a such practices will contribute towards stabilizing the yield and providing better opportunities to achieve food self sufficiency and income oweis et al 2000 oweis and hachum 2012 however the response of wheat to combined use of n and p fertilizers and deficit irrigation is not well understood in northern ethiopia as a result there has been uncertainty about the use of recommended fertilizer rates in relation to the seasonal rainfall as well as deficit irrigation the high mobility of n and greater possibility of p fixation in northern ethiopian soils make these nutrients critical in soil fertility management moard 2006 to solve this problem application of mineral fertilizers is important habtegebrial and singh 2006 in some cases use of mineral fertilizers might have little positive effect on yield when water is limiting el mejahed and aouragh 2005 rusan et al 2005 in northern ethiopia rainfall ceases soil water scarcity usually occurs after start of booting or flowering of wheat it is not clear to what extent wheat irrigation water productivity could be improved if wheat is supplied with additional irrigation from a heading to grain milk stage zgs 55 73 and b heading to ripening zgs 55 90 under current or improved fertilizer management practices understanding the response of wheat to these alternative water and nutrient management practices along with the number of irrigation applications based on long term climate perspectives is needed to assist producers to improve irrigation water productivity and enable appropriate sharing of resources water and fertilizers among users to enhance resource use efficiency and increase overall production however it is very difficult and expensive to addresses these critical issues with experimental evidences as it is affected by many environmental and management factors including climate soil cultivar management and location crop models are computer programs that uses quantitative representations of plant and soils processes to simulate plant growth and development under different management and climate conditions crop models are decision making tools effective to address the aforementioned issues in cost effective and timely way the objectives of the current research were to i evaluate the effects of irrigation and n and p fertilizer application rates on grain yield above ground biomass and irrigation water productivity iwp of wheat ii calibrate and validate a crop model for simulating grain yield and above ground biomass of wheat under different levels of nitrogen and irrigation application rates and iii evaluate consecutive above ground biomass accumulation as affected by different combinations of irrigation and fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the field experiment that was conducted in 2012 and 2013 at mekelle endayesus ey lat 13 28 n long 39 30 e and altitude of 2212 m above sea level northern ethiopia mekelle is a semi arid agricultural region with two rainfall seasons the belg or very light rain season february to may and the kiremt or the main rain season june to september araya et al 2010b about 80 of annual rainfall is received between the months of june and september while the other 20 is received between february and may araya and stroosnijder 2011 long term 1980 2013 daily meteorological data for the study site such as temperature minimum and maximum relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed were obtained from the ethiopian national meteorological agency enma the mean annual rainfall was approximately 600 mm the annual reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the total annual eto for mekelle endayesus ey was 1750 mm the 2012 and 2013 growing season s jul nov mean minimum maximum and average temperature ranges from 10 to 14 22 25 and 16 5 19 0 c respectively in 2012 and 2013 rainfall depth of 367 4 and 273 3 mm respectively was received from planting to harvest the experimental soil texture was sandy clay loam table 1 presents soil chemical and physical characteristics for experimental site 2 2 experimental setup cultivar fertilizer use quantity type and n p ratio rainfall trends in irrigation water use and commonly achievable high target yield levels in the region were assessed before conducting the current research wheat was planted on july 05 in 2012 and on july 16 to 20 in 2013 with a raw spacing and depth of about 16 and 3 cm respectively and at a plant density of 250 plants m2 the local variety of bread wheat har 2501 known as hawi was used as a test crop the plot size was 2 5 4 0 and 3 0 4 0 m in 2012 and 2013 respectively the spacing between treatments and replications was approximately 1 5 m the experiments in both 2012 and 2013 used a two factorial randomized complete block deign rcbd with three replications it consisted of three levels of fertilizer rates that mimic prevailing practices in the region no fertilizer f0 32 kg n and 23 kg p ha f1 and 64 kg n and 46 kg p ha f2 in combinations with one rainfed i0 no irrigation and two irrigation treatments i1 irrigation from heading to grain milk stage zgs 55 73 and i2 irrigation from heading to ripening zgs 55 90 i2 table 2 under standard condition crop evapotranspiration is determined by climate reference evapotranspiration and crop characteristics crop coefficient while under non standard field conditions crop evapotranspiration is affected by climate crop characteristics management and other environmental factors allen et al 1998 wheat crop coefficient is available in fao publications doorenbos and pruitt 1977 doorenbos et al 1979 allen et al 1998 the reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated based on fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 in northern ethiopia the time of rainy period during the main crop growing season is shorter than the length of growing period of many cereals studies showed rainfall in northern ethiopia ends around early to mid september when most small grain cereals reach at heading stage araya et al 2011 araya and stroosnijder 2011 araya et al 2012 accordingly in this experiment irrigation was scheduled to meet the crop water needs of selected wheat crop growth stages at time of heading and afterwards table 2 the crop coefficient for wheat at time of heading to early grain filling irrigation treatment i1 reaches as high as 1 2 doorenbos et al 1979 allen et al 1998 based on long term climate information 1980 2010 the daily eto at time of heading and afterwards in september to october ranged from 5 to 6 mm day however crop evapotranspiration rate gradually decreases after the start of leaf senescence allen et al 1998 araya et al 2011 despite the variability in eto and crop coefficient a fixed irrigation depth and interval was determined to give practical sense to water users in sandy clay loam soils based on the following assumptions the soil average water holding capacity was approximately 100 mm m table 1 since irrigation was done manually using a pipe over small plots controlled the irrigation efficiency was assumed to be 80 considering soil depth of 0 6 m table1 with assumed maximum soil water depletion before moisture stress occurs as 40 and eto of 5 5 mm day the applied fixed depth was a reasonable estimate based on eqs 1 and 2 1 t w 1000 q f c q w p r z 2 r a d p t w where tw is total available soil water in the root zone mm qfc soil water content at field capacity m3 m3 qwp water content at wilting point m3 m3 rz rooting depth m ra is readily available soil water mm or the crop uses water from the soil without stress dp is a depletion fraction 0 1 dp values differ by crop soil and et value allen et al 1998 in this work dp value of 0 4 for wheat grown in sandy clay loam soils was assumed reasonable in this case the calculated readily available soil water 23 5 mm was adequate to meet the daily crop water needs 5 5 mm day for at least four days accordingly an irrigation depth of 20 and 25 mm was applied every four days in 2012 and 2013 respectively nitrogen was broadcast in two split applications half at planting and the other half 30 days after planting phosphorus was applied as basal dose at sowing only the main source of n and p were urea 46 n and di ammonium phosphate dap 18 n and 46 p respectively 2 3 yield and yield components in 2012 only days to flowering and maturity and grain yield were recorded whereas in 2013 the phenology days to flowering and maturity biomass grain yield and related components 1000 grain weight and sequential dry matter were recorded in 2013 the sequentially cumulative above ground dry biomass was collected at 10 day intervals starting from 10 days after planting throughout the growing season from a small representative plot area of 20 20 cm and replicated three times for each treatment the sequential above ground biomass was oven dried at 65 c until constant weight was recorded final grain yield and above ground biomass were measured at harvest maturity from the middle plot area of 2 2 m 2 4 irrigation water productivity iwp irrigation water productivity iwp was calculated using the equation applied by zhang et al 1999 howell 2001 and araya et al 2011 eq 3 3 i w p g y i g r i where gyi is grain yield obtained from irrigated treatments kg ha gr is the corresponding yield obtained from rainfed treatment kg ha and i is the amount of irrigation water m3 ha percent of yield pg changes was estimated as the yield obtained from the various treatments minus the yield obtained from the control i0f0 divided by the yield obtained from the control treatment and multiplied by 100 percent of biomass pbm changes was calculated using the same method analysis of variance anova was carried out to determine the effects of irrigation and fertilizer application rates on wheat yield and related components using genstat a statistical software means among treatments were compared using duncan s multiple range test 2 5 model set up calibration and validation the dssat csm v 4 7 jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2017 was used for evaluating management scenarios in this study model calibration involve entry of the actual soil and daily climate data including minimum and maximum temperatures rainfall and solar radiation initial soil water and nitrogen residue cover and other management practices the initial soil water and nitrogen content was set as 60 and 2 kg ha with a residue cover of 1000 kg ha undocumented data the planting date for the calibration dataset in 2012 and 2013 was on 05th and 20th of july respectively with a plant density of 250 plants m2 planted at 3 cm depth and 16 cm row spacing the cultivar har2501 was used in both experiment seasons 2012 and 2013 all fertiliser and irrigation interaction treatments in 2012 and the i2f2 treatment in 2013 were used for model calibration calibration procedures followed as presented in hoogenboom et al 2012 the experimental data for the other 8 treatments in 2013 were used for model validation accordingly the model was treated exactly similar to the experiment with three different nitrogen n rates 0 32 and 64 kg ha in combination with three different irrigation strategies rainfed i0 four irrigations from heading to early grain filling zgs 55 73 i1 eleven irrigations from heading to maturity zgs 55 90 table 2 the model was instructed to simulate yield biomass days to flowering and maturity based on the treatments the measured data of the various treatments were compared with the simulated model simulation performance evaluations was carried using a statistical fitness of test that include r2 index of agreement ia eq 4 and normalized root mean square of error and percent of deviation eq 5 4 i a 1 i 1 n p i m s i 2 i 1 n p i m s x m s i m s x 2 where pi predicted msi measured and msx measured average value according to liu et al 2013 ia values 0 70 0 71 0 80 0 81 0 90 and 0 91 indicated poor moderate good and excellent agreements respectively normalized root means square of error nrmse which was calculated as root means square of error divided by the average of the measured value of treatments for the parameter variable under consideration according to soler et al 2007 values less than 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 indicate good moderate fair and poor performance respectively the percent of deviation pv is another performance statistic used on this study 5 p v p i m s i m s i 100 where pi predicted simulated msi measured and msx average of the measure values 2 6 model simulation setup and scenarios after calibration and validation the model was used to simulate yield and biomass of the same wheat cultivar at a nearby location adigudom ag located at latitude of 13 15 e and longitude of 39 30 n with elevation of 2068 m above sea level with similar climate and soils condition as in mekelle endayesus ey site fig 1 this location was selected due to availability of long term climate data and representativeness in terms of cropping system soil and agrometeorological conditions long term daily climate data from ag 1980 2009 that included rainfall minimum and maximum temperature and solar radiation was obtained from ethiopian national meteorological agency the soils data as described in table 1 was entered into the model agronomic management that include four irrigation treatments i0 rainfed no irrigation di1 two irrigations at heading and flowering di2 four irrigations at heading and early grain filling and di3 six irrigations from heading to mid grain filling table 3 and nine nitrogen treatments 0 16 32 48 64 80 96 112 128 and 160 kg ha were also set into the model table 3 source of nitrogen was urea which was applied in two equal split applications each at sowing and 30 days after sowing previous crop was assumed to be wheat with a residue of 1000 kg ha and nitrogen content of the residue of 0 8 the initial soil water and nitrogen content of the soil at planting was set to 65 and 8 kg ha respectively undocumented data the model crop cultivar planting date plant population spacing and planting depth for evaluating different fertilizer and irrigation strategies with long term climatic data were the same as that used in the model calibration unless otherwise mentioned finally simulated yield biomass and calculated iwp under various combinations of nitrogen and irrigation application strategies were plotted 3 results 3 1 yield and related components and iwp based on measured experimental data the days to flowering and maturity in treatments f2 were significantly higher p 0 05 than the f0 treatments table 4 there were significant differences p 0 05 among fertilizer treatments in grain yield during the 2013 cropping season table 4 the highest grain yield p 0 05 was obtained with treatment i2f2 yield increased by 186 followed by i1f2 yield increased by 155 when compared to the control table 4 for the irrigation strategy i0 yield increased by 61 in response to change from f0 to f1 treatment p 0 05 similarly under i0 strategy increasing fertilizer application rate from f0 to f2 increased the yield by 70 while under i1 strategy increasing fertilizer application rate from f0 to f1 and f0 to f2 increased yield by 70 and 131 respectively under i2 strategy increased fertilizer application rate from f0 to f2 increased yield by 75 with no fertilizer application f0 application of i1 irrigation strategy resulted in a 10 increase in yield and an additional irrigation with i2 strategy increased wheat yield by 65 p 0 05 over the control which means that the increased irrigation from i1 to i2 added a 55 yield gain relative to the control which was significantly different table 4 there was significant p 0 05 yield increase by 22 to 75 and 9 to 98 due to increased fertilizer application rates from f0 to f1 and f1 to f2 respectively relative to the control similarly yield significantly p 0 05 increased by 9 6 to 84 and 3 to 56 with a change in the irrigation strategy from i0 to i1 and i1 to i2 respectively compared to the control there was no significant difference in cumulative above ground biomass of wheat among the three irrigation strategies figs 2 and 3 when grown with no fertilizer applications in contrast between 60 90 days after planting there was a significant increase p 0 05 in the above ground biomass accumulation when i2 irrigation strategy is applied in combination with f2 fertilizer rate however the increases in the above ground biomass was minor when irrigation strategy is changed from i1 to i2 indicating that i1 irrigation strategy met most the crop water demand during the growing season cumulative above ground biomass under three irrigation levels was substantially affected by fertilizer rates for example the above ground biomass 50 90 days after planting in treatment i2f2 was much higher than that with i2f0 p 0 05 similarly the above ground biomass 50 90 days after planting in i0f2 was substantially higher than in i0f0 p 0 05 however wheat treated with i2f2 was not substantially different from i2f1 effects of fertilizer treatments were more clearly observed after 50 days of planting this study showed that wheat s response to fertilizer was much higher than that with irrigation water application treatments i0f1 and i0f2 resulted in final biomass gains p 0 05 of 48 and 75 respectively when compared with the control i0f0 further increases in fertilizer application rate from i0f1 to i0f2 i1f1 to i1f2 and i2fi to i2f2 increased the above ground biomass p 0 05 by 27 60 and 75 respectively the final above ground biomass increases in both i1f0 and i2f0 treatments were not significantly different from the control i0f0 table 4 increase due to irrigation applications were relatively small when compared to the biomass increase due to fertilizer applications the final above ground biomass was highest with the i2f2 treatment however the increase with i2f2 treatment was not substantially different from i1f2 table 4 and thus was not efficient considering the additional amount of water applied over the treatment i1f2 3 2 irrigation water productivity iwp higher iwp was recorded with the i1 treatment when compared to i2 the iwp of wheat for the har 2501 cultivar ranged from 0 14 to 2 4 kg m3 it decreased with increase in irrigation amount this implies that irrigating wheat during its heading to grain milk stage 4 irrigations has relative yield advantages per unit of water when compared to irrigating wheat during its heading to ripening z55 90 growth stages the results indicated that deficit irrigation in combinations with relatively higher fertilizer application rate f2 resulted in considerably higher iwp table 4 3 3 model calibration and validation the model was able to simulate the measured grain yield and phenology in 2012 and 2013 the model simulated the measured grain yield for the calibration dataset with normalized root mean square of error of 19 indicating the difference between the predicted and measured values prediction errors were low there was strong agreement between the simulated and measured grain yield with r2 fig 4 and index of agreement values of 0 87 and 0 98 respectively similarly the model simulated the measured yield and biomass data validation dataset with ia of 0 97 and 0 87 respectively table 5 results indicated strong relationship between the measured and simulated yield and biomass with r2 values of 0 94 and 0 74 respectively fig 5a b the normalized root mean square of error for yield and biomass were 10 2 and 21 6 respectively table 5 the statistical evaluation showed that yield was adequately simulated by the model when compared to the measured biomass fig 5 b in addition the days to flowering and maturity were predicted with nrmse of 11 6 and 3 4 respectively overall the model has satisfactorily simulated the yield biomass and phenology of the wheat cultivar used in this study the genetic coefficients for the har2501 are presented in table 6 3 4 simulated grain yield biomass and iwp as affected by nitrogen and irrigation strategies 3 4 1 yield and biomass grain and biomass yield increased with increase in nitrogen fertilizer rate the highest grain and biomass yield were obtained with di3 fig 6 a and b there was a curvilinear relationship between yield and nitrogen similarly there was an increase in yield with increase in irrigation from i0 rainfed to application of irrigation from heading to mid of grain filling stage di3 although there was an increase in grain and biomass yield with increase in irrigation irrigation beyond di2 did not increased the biomass and grain yield significantly fig 6a and b 3 4 2 irrigation water productivity iwp simulated iwp increased with increase in nitrogen fertilizer rate fig 7 the highest iwps were obtained from two irrigation applied between heading to flowering stage 1 8 kg m3 followed by four irrigation applied during heading to early grain filling stage 1 5 kg m3 with highest n application rate the lowest iwp 0 1 kg m3 was obtained in treatment with two irrigations at heading to flowering stages with zero n application fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 yield and its components grain yield of wheat treated with i2f2 experiment and di2 or di3 n 160 kg ha simulations were higher than that in other treatments this is most likely due to availability of adequate plant nutrients and water in the root zone that increases leaf expansion and leaf area growth kibe et al 2006 which improves light and co2 capture experimental studies have shown that wheat with optimal n levels produce relatively higher leaf area index and intercept more radiation to produce more biomass and grain yield caviglia and sadras 2001 in addition to enhanced transport of plant assimilates the relatively longer period to maturity compared to treatments with reduced water and fertilizer availability could be a factor treatments with a relatively longer growing period are more likely to accumulate more assimilates over an extended period compared to those slightly shorter growing period adequate supply of n was reported to increase crop transpiration when compared to wheat treated with low n inputs zhang et al 1998 the increase in transpiration in turn could lead to a substantial increase in biomass and grain yield steduto et al 2009 this study showed that deficit irrigation substantially improved biomass and grain yield of wheat many reports have indicated that irrigation applied during water sensitive periods stem elongation or jointing booting anthesis and early grain filling when combined with suitable fertilizer application rates could result in higher yield zhang and oweis 1999 huang et al 2004 zhang et al 2006 this study also showed that higher fertilizer input under rainfed water stressed conditions results in low yield this could be related to the accumulation of high canopy growth during the rainy period followed by long dry spells after cessation of rain enhancing quick senescence and reduced translocation grain formation and grain filling period giunta et al 1993 likewise increasing water availability at low fertilizer levels has been shown to result in low leaf area index and yield montazar and mohseni 2011 this was substantiated at our experimental site not shown in which there was a 10 increase in yield in i1f0 over i0f0 which is relatively small given the large amount of water applied under i1f0 strategy similarly simulation results showed that there was slight increase in yield with increased irrigation under no nitrogen fertilizer input but was not significant this implies that irrigation under no or low fertilizer input in less fertile soils was less productive compared to those supplied with adequate fertilizer mirzaei et al 2011 reported that moisture stress during stem elongation could reduce grain yield significantly water deficit during grain filling will reduce grain weight and yield plaut et al 2004 additional irrigation late in the season did not show significant yield gain over the others which were treated with irrigation up to early grain filling stage with the same fertilizer rate studies showed that nitrogen uptake and use correlated with the quantity of irrigation water applied abourached et al 2008 this study showed that wheat yield increased with nitrogen fertilizer rates although the increase per unit of applied nitrogen gradually decreased to have a curve linear relationship there was an increase in above ground biomass and plant height with an increase in n and p fertilizer applications similarly mandal et al 2005 observed better leaf and biomass growth enhanced tillering capability ear bearing tillers and better grain formation when sufficient n with optimal water was applied to wheat optimal fertilizer and water interaction effects could be reflected by a substantial increase in the transpiration component which in turn increases yield and biomass zhang et al 1998 oweis et al 2000 in the current study there were considerable interaction effects between deficit irrigation and n fertilizer 4 2 irrigation water productivity iwp this study showed that deficit irrigation improved the iwp of wheat compared to full irrigation prior studies have indicated that wheat is more responsive to mid than late season irrigation zhang and oweis 1999 zhang et al 1999 kibe et al 2006 which indicates that more yield per applied water can be obtained by applying irrigation water from heading to grain milk stage rather than heading to ripening growth stages in arid and semi arid areas where moisture stress occurs during the crops moisture sensitive stages deficit irrigation can result in higher yield kijne et al 2009 montazar and mohseni 2011 oweis and hachum 2012 huang et al 2005 and wang et al 2012 also reported that iwp decreased in non stressed wheat compared to mildly stressed conditions because the available soil water during stress conditions was used more effectively when compared to non stressed conditions other studies have also indicated an increase in root extraction capabilities under mild water stress conditions compared to non water stress conditions li et al 2004 mesbah 2009 in addition the extra water not used in producing grain may be lost via soil water evaporation or deep percolation higher levels of irrigation may also enhance nutrient leaching wang et al 2012 furthermore application of irrigation during the heading to grain milk could facilitate pollination and the transport of nutrient and plant assimilates for the formation of grain compared to the application of water during dough to ripening when it is primarily for grain filling late grain filling can also be accomplished from translocation of stored carbon and nutrients from leaves or stems the iwps in the experimental study ranged from 0 14 to 2 4 kg m3 which is almost within the ranges of values 0 32 to 2 52 kg m3 reported in north china zhang et al 1999 similarly the iwps 0 1 to 1 8 kg m3 based on simulated yield was within but less than the reported range of values the difference in simulated iwp values might be attributed to difference in climate cultivar and irrigation amount used for example the simulated average iwp based on long term climate 1980 2009 was affected by year to year variation in climate however iwp increased especially with nitrogen application the increase in iwp with n and p fertilizer application might be attributed to the relatively higher grain yield in treatments with higher n fertilizer application rates when compared to the other treatments from the current results it can be seen that irrigation water was not efficiently used by wheat plants under lower or no nitrogen fertilizer application due to low leaf area index low canopy cover reduced radiation interception and increased evaporation caviglia and sadras 2001 reduced transport of plant assimilates and slightly reduced days to maturity when sufficient water and nitrogen were provided like in i1f2 it increased yield per unit water applied this indicates that fertilizer nutrient supply influences water productivity zhang et al 1998 oweis et al 2000 caviglia and sadras 2001 mandal et al 2005 therefore understanding the optimal interaction of fertilizers and water could be vital for higher iwp and greater yield wang et al 2012 revealed that a high rate of n fertilizer 221 kg ha with moderate irrigation improves iwp deficit irrigation in conjunction with good n supply could improve iwp howell 2001 and mandal et al 2005 suggested careful management decisions need to be made in this regard for improved yield and water productivities simulation study with dssat as presented in this work could guide decisions and provide producers and agronomists with necessary information on best and efficient agronomic management to follow in order to achieve the desired goal of improving productivity and resource use efficiency 5 conclusions this study showed a strong and positive interdependence between irrigation and nitrogen application rates as well as timing of irrigation increasing irrigation levels alone had little impact at low fertilizer nutrient levels yield might increase with nitrogen rates but the rate of increase in yield per applied nitrogen gradually decreased resulting in a curvilinear relationship in addition wheat was not responsive for irrigation after early grain filling thus there is no need for additional irrigation after the milk stage of wheat since the rainfall in northern ethiopia ends shortly after the start of heading the treatment combination that resulted in the highest irrigation water productivity is recommended experimental data showed that for higher iwp grain and biomass farmers should use at least 64 kg n and 46 kg p ha in combination with irrigation from heading to grain milk stage simulations showed that higher nitrogen up to 160 kg ha could improve yield 3 8 mg ha significantly with good supply of irrigation 4 irrigations with total of 100 mm during the most sensitive stages of the crop development however further economic analyses can help with best options that can provide most efficient and economic management practices for improving wheat yields in northern ethiopia acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the foundation for food
