23890,forecast errors of subsurface temperature and salinity are substantially reduced with an efficient two step multiscale ensemble optimal interpolation enoi system applied to a near global eddy resolving ocean model a critical element of any data assimilation system is the background error covariance which for enoi is typically a static ensemble of anomalies from a long model run here we construct two ensembles one based on intraseasonal anomalies from a free run of the same eddy resolving ocean model used to underpin the forecasts and a second ensemble of climatogical anomalies calculated using a relatively coarse 1 degree global ocean model for each assimilation cycle the coarse resolution ensemble is used to correct the broad scales and the high resolution ensemble is used to correct the eddy scales corrections from the coarse steps are more effective at reducing systematic errors in the subsurface ocean whereas the high resolution steps typically produce vertically coherent corrections associated with mesoscale eddies we compare two configurations of multiscale data assimilation with different localisation radii in the coarse data assimilation step the best performance and slowest error growth was found with localisation that was large enough to encompass neighbouring profiles in each assimilation cycle the efficacy of the approach is demonstrated in ocean reanalyses over 2017 8 that assimilate data every 3 days we demonstrate clear improvements in the representation of temperature and salinity at all depths around australia model observation differences are particularly improved in and below the thermocline the corrections to the ocean state with multiscale data assimilation follow water mass structures the increased computational cost of this multiscale approach is modest about double the analysis step but the performance improvement is significant making this approach suitable for research and operational applications keywords ocean reanalysis multiscale data assimilation ensemble optimal interpolation operational oceanography 1 introduction the challenge for ocean reanalyses is to simulate the real ocean with minimal differences to available observations and time tendencies that are smooth and dynamically realistic the real ocean has dynamics and processes that span scales from the microscopic to planetary and it is impossible for all to be faithfully represented in any single model regardless of resolution or parameterisations applied hence all ocean models are left with some extent of bias in general models with higher spatial resolution have smaller biases being able to explicitly resolve important dynamics and less dependent on subgrid parameterisations albeit with extra computational expense but differences to observations remain to some degree e g rackow et al 2019 kiss et al 2020 mesoscale dynamics of the ocean such as eddies filaments and boundary currents evolve rapidly on the order of days and are a major component of ocean variability but the ocean also contains intrinsic dynamic modes with interannual timescales e g o kane et al 2013 as well as slow broad baroclinic waves that propogate along waveguides or storm tracks within the thermoclines e g o kane et al 2014b ocean reanalyses assimilate available observations to capture all these dynamical features ideally with no bias in the long term mean state the bluelink project has produced a series of ocean reanalyses bluelink reanalysis bran since the 2000s schiller et al 2020 the most recent being bran2015 oke et al 2018 that is based on the ocean forecasting australia model ofam version 3 oke et al 2013a bran is closely related to oceanmaps an operational ocean reanalysis system used by the australian bureau of meteorology brassington et al 2007 2012 bran and related ocean reanalyses have various research and operational applications they may be studied directly such as to characterise past ocean state for extreme events e g schiller et al 2009 oke and griffin 2011 or to analyse ocean features hard to observe directly such as boundary current structure schiller et al 2008 zonal currents in the southeast indian ocean divakaran and brassington 2011 and langrangrian eddy behaviour in the tasman sea brassington et al 2011 indirectly reanalysis products support further research such as particle tracking for dispersal studies e g chiswell and rickard 2011 or as boundary conditions for embedded models at higher resolution e g steven et al 2019 operational applications of ocean reanalyses include generating initial conditions for forecasts and particle tracking for search and rescue or spill containment penny et al 2019 a long standing problem with bran like other ocean reanalyses has been the difficulty in reducing misfits of the model to deep observations high quality data with good global coverage has been available for many years from the network of argo floats roemmich et al 2019 but misfits remain significantly greater than observation or representation errors in the work presented here we show implementations of multiscale data assimilation da to bran ocean reanalyses and the associated improvements in fit to observations we take advantage of existing ocean da configurations that use the same ocean model and da infrastructure but configured for different resolutions we combine the existing bran configuration with a configuration at 1 resolution used by o kane et al 2014a being a coarse model the configuration is relatively cheap to run and it is possible to calculate ensemble anomalies from long spinups focused on slow interannual modes of variability which have more spread at depth in the ensemble examples of multiscale da can now be found in many disciplines interested in constraining the state of systems with variability across a wide range of scales a multiscale 3d var system was applied to a coastal model li et al 2015 which improved the analysis in both an idealised simulation and a test in a real time system a multiscale approach has also been used in a 4d var system to improve the assimilation of smaller scale features with high density observations within a regional ocean model in the north atlantic carrier et al 2019 in another regional model focused on assimilating high resolution altimetry data a multiscale da system was able to better constrain submesoscale and mesoscale features than a single step da system souopgui et al 2020 the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the multiscale da system including the descriptions of the underlying ocean models and associated ensembles this section describes the sequence followed in applying the multiscale da including the da parameters used at each scale section 3 compares results from two multiscale da experiments with bran2015 comparing da statistics as well as model observation differences in the simulated ocean states section 4 discusses the results increments and ensembles to demonstrate why the two step multiscale da is more effective section 5 summarises the work 2 method da in existing bran systems use an ensemble optimal interpolation enoi method as described by oke et al 2008 multiscale da here is achieved by a two step enoi approach corrections are obtained by assimilating data with separate ensembles constructed to emphasise different spatial scales as explained below 2 1 ocean models and ensembles all ocean models used here are global in scale and based on the modular ocean model mom versions 4 1 and 5 griffies 2008 2012 however mom is configured differently when simulating the ocean at different resolutions free running ocean only experiments at each resolution forced with atmospheric reanalyses generate the background ensembles used for the enoi 2 1 1 ofam the ofam resolution ensemble is the same as used in bran2015 oke et al 2018 which is based on the free running model described in oke et al 2013a briefly these products use version 3 of ofam which is near global 75 s to 75 n with 0 1 resolution and 51 vertical levels the uppermost layers are 5 m thick and in the deep ocean below 2000 m temperature and salinity are restored to climatology 365 day timescale and the layers are allowed to expand to more than 500 m vertical coordinates are zstar which are geopotential levels that scale with a varying free surface being an eddy resolving model only a biharmonic scheme is enabled for friction and neutral physics parameterisations are not required the spinup was forced with era interim dee and uppala 2009 ofam ensemble members are calculated as the difference between corresponding 3 day and 3 month averages centred on the middle of each month over 12 years of the spinup years 2000 to 2011 144 members these differences capture eddies and mesoscale variability fig 1 shows examples of ensemble members ensemble spread and background error covariance from the ofam ensemble for temperature from two regions first in the tasman sea and second the subantarctic zone south of australia the spread of ensemble members middle row is high in the thermocline especially in regions of significant mesoscale eddy activity such as near the separation point of the east australia current eac in the tasman sea and along the subantarctic front in the southern ocean this spread decreases to very low values with depth at all locations background error covariances bec bottom row fig 1 are shown with respect to the positions indicated in both regions the bec produces a mesoscale eddy like structure correlations are narrow and have large vertical extents the subantarctic location is within the antarctic circumpolar current where anomalies follow the zonal structure of the current albeit with mesoscale features within this zone bec structures in fig 1 are associated with anomalies from vertical displacement of the water column induced by mesoscale eddies the ensemble of salinity anomalies are almost identical in character to the temperature ensemble at these scales fig 2 however the vertical structure of the bec for salinity is discontinuous where the vertical gradient of the salinity is zero and vertical displacements do not produce salinity anomalies 2 1 2 1 degree access ocean model the coarse ensemble is based on a grid from the ocean component of the australian community climate and earth system simulator access see bi et al 2013 for a detailed description of this ocean model the implementation used here is like the ocean sea ice configuration used in o kane et al 2013 the nominal horizontal resolution of the grid is 1 with higher meridional resolution near the equator and in the southern ocean the grid is tripolar to avoid the grid singularity at the north pole the grid becomes curvilinear north of 65 n the access grid has 50 vertical levels using zstar coordinates like the ofam model the top layers are 10 m thick down to a depth of 200 m and the resolution expands to 300 m for the bottommost levels the access ocean model includes extra parameterisations to represent processes that are unresolved in the 1 resolution models such as neutral physics to emulate mixing by mesoscale eddies both laplacian and biharmonic friction schemes are used to capture dissipation at different scales the 1 model spinup used the jra 55 forcing and being less computationally expensive was run longer than the ofam spinup the ocean state was spun up for several centuries with climatology and two passes of 60 years 1958 to 2017 of jra 55 forcing kobayashi et al 2015 the coarse ensemble members are monthly anomalies from a detrended climatology constructed using 40 years of the second pass of jra 55 forcing years 1970 2009 avoiding early years with less observational constraints in the forcing and also avoiding the last years affected by climate change fig 3 shows examples of ensemble members spread and background error covariance in the same regions as the ofam resolution examples from fig 1 and illustrate the different nature of this coarse ensemble the samples shown have broad coherent features with scales of the order of several 100 km for example north of 45 s up into the great australian bight fig 3c in regions where there is little variability in the ofam ensemble variability at depth here is slower than seasonal timescales and hence are not significant in the ofam ensemble anomalies but can appear as climatological anomalies in the coarse ensemble in the upper ocean the spread of 1 ensembles is less than the high resolution ensemble however the high resolution spread decreases substantially with depth and deeper than 1000 m the 1 ensemble spread is greater figs 1 and 3 panels f and h covariances of the 1 ensemble have lobes of low to moderate correlations that are much wider than seen in high resolution ensembles of the order of 1000s km extending beyond the domain shown bottom row fig 3 in the subantarctic zone the 1 ensemble is able to modify the position of the antarctic circumpolar current whereas the ofam ensemble modified features within the current also in this region the 1 ensemble anomalies are tilted along isopycnals when viewed in sections rather than in vertical eddy features that dominate the ofam ensemble similarly in the tasman sea the 1 ensemble has broader influence following water mass structures reaching into the extension of the east australia current in this case 2 2 multiscale data assimilation both steps of the multiscale da system presented here use the ensemble optimal interpolation enoi capability of enkf c sakov 2014 a generic da system designed for large geophysical models enoi is similar to 3d var schemes that are commonly used both are computationally efficient methods that assimilate observations into models a major difference between enoi and 3d var is the way the schemes estimate the system s background forecast error covariance as discussed in fu et al 2009 for enoi these covariances are based on a stationary ensemble of anomalies from a previous free running simulation that are typically multivariate whereas in 3d var systems these covariances are based on user defined correlation functions specified length scales and functional forms and are usually univariate projection of observations onto other variables using 3d var usually involves some assumption about dynamics e g velocity increments are geostrophic or empirical relationships between variables e g t s correlations derived from historical observations a comparison between enoi and 3d var is presented by fu et al 2009 and is discussed by moore et al 2019 in enoi da observation model differences within a specified radius are projected onto ensemble members to construct a weighted average that becomes the correction to the local ocean state the bran da is configured to reduce observation model differences in temperature salinity and sea level anomaly in each experiment u and v velocity corrections are also applied using covariances calculated from ensembles to maintain dynamical balance in the analysis oke et al 2013b the multiscale da system here is developed by adding a low resolution step to the da component of bran2015 the da workflow is summarised in fig 4 the initial background background i is the ocean state or restart at end of the ocean model run from the previous cycle forecast statistics are calculated with this initial background and observations at high resolution in order to compare to other ocean reanalyses background i is averaged and regridded onto the coarse grid background l values at high resolution within each coarse grid cell are aggregated in this averaging the coarse da step da l is applied to this coarse background using the coarse 1 ensemble observations in da l are also merged and averaged onto the coarse grid greatly reducing the number of observations the size of the da problem and the computational cost of the step the correction from da l increment l is interpolated back to the ofam grid and added to the background i for the new background background h in this way broad scale corrections get incorporated into the background without losing the important mesoscale features from background i the second high resolution da cycle da h produces analysis h that now includes low and high resolution corrections this da h cycle uses the same ofam ensemble that was used in bran2015 the final analysis from this cycle becomes the initial condition for the next ocean model integration the ocean model integrates the ocean state forward in time and the final restart becomes the background to the next da cycle data assimilation parameters at each step are discussed in the following section 2 2 1 experiments and da parameters results shown in this work were produced by the experiments listed in table 1 namely the control bran2015 run and two tests of the multiscale da configurations table 2 contains further details of da parameters used at each step of the multiscale da cycle these values are based on the configurations where each step was originally developed in separate models at different resolutions da h is based on bran2015 and da l on the 1 model in o kane et al 2014a the cycle length of 3 days is unchanged in any of the configurations tested here larger ensemble sizes are possible with the coarse ocean model 480 compared to 144 since it is computationally cheaper to run the coarse spinup model the larger ensemble can improve the da performance since the ensemble can encompass more modes of variability within the simulation the stride feature of enkf c reduces the da computational cost for large high resolution grids in particular weightings of ensemble members to produce an increment are calculated at grid points spaced by the stride value weightings are interpolated to other intermediate points two setups of multiscale da are tested in the first the localisation radius of da l is 400 km whereas in the second it is increased to 1600 km effectively increasing the length scale of the increments calculated these length scales aim to capture features larger than typical mesoscale eddies the larger length scales also make these da l increments far more effective at correcting biases in the ocean state in the subsurface which is sparsely sampled da h localisation length scale is focused on mesoscale corrections note these values are support localisation radii and the effective localisation is 3 5 less than the specified value as described in the enkf c user guide sakov 2014 a short test of 10 cycles was also done with a larger localisation 2400 km however the errors in the subsurface analyses and forecasts were greater for both temperature and salinity and deteriorated further with additional da cycles not shown and were not investigated further here long distance correlations can be subject to noise and degradation in analyses oke et al 2007 showed this to be true for a number of small idealised models comparing the impacts of localisation and ensemble size on enkf and enoi systems the magnitude of corrections calculated by enkf c depend on the relative size of observation and model or ensemble variances and r factor and k factor are two procedures within enkf c used to modify these variances and tune the performance of the da system see sakov 2014 for details r factor is a scaling factor applied to observation error variances and is typically increased for larger localisations that include more observations to avoid overfitting the higher r factor in ms1600 reduces the impact of observations in the analysis we also use an adaptive quality control procedure the k factor which is also described in sakov and sandery 2017 this procedure prevents overfitting by smoothly increasing the variance of observations with misfit so that the corresponding increments do not exceed the standard deviation of the ensemble scaled by the specified value da l corrections are calculated from observations within 65 s 65 n encompassing most of the ofam bran domain but avoiding influences of sea ice and the tripolar access ocean grid that are not considered here model sea level anomalies are calculated with respect to the mean sea level of the long free running spinup of the high resolution model which is interpolated onto the coarse grid for the da l step larger data windows are used for subsurface observations in the coarse da step these larger windows increase the number of observations assimilated by sampling over the complete argo cycle 10 days this significantly improved the performance of the multiscale da system relative to using only a 3 day window which would include data from less than a third of the argo floats available a 9 day data window was initially used in ms400 so as to be a simple multiple of the da cycle length but a 10 day window was used in ms1600 in contrast to the subsurface sea surface temperature sst and sea level anomalies sla are well observed and constrained with 3 day data windows a short test of 20 cycles configured identically to bran2015 but with larger argo observation windows as applied in the multiscale configurations also showed some improvement in da performance however the magnitude of the reduction in da errors was less than half than that with the multiscale da not shown and this was not pursued further here the forecast observation model differences are calculated on background i fig 4 at the start of the da cycle these forecasts are calculated at the ofam resolution with 3 day observation windows in these bran experiments observation windows for all steps are centred at analysis time the large argo observation windows of da l 9 or 10 days matching the argo cycle time are now longer than the cycle length 3 days so that each cycle has data from the full argo array to assimilate increasing the data density this observation window configuration would not work in a real time application in this way individual argo observations are typically assimilated in 3 subsequent cycles also the wide argo analysis window now overlaps with the 3 day window of the next cycle s subsurface forecast calculation due to this overlap a subset 10 of future argo observations from the wide da l data windows are withheld from analysis argo data files are preprocessed and every tenth argo profile is extracted from these files and reserved clean forecast differences for subsurface temperature and salinity are then calculated in the next cycle using these withheld observations that were not previously assimilated into the ocean state all other forecasts remain clean 2 3 observations the observations used in the multiscale da tests presented were for consistency the same as those used in bran2015 the satellite sst assimilated are advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data compiled by navo naval oceanographic office 2014a b c d along track satellite sla data from all available platforms are assimilated accessed from the radar altimeter database system rads v 3 scharroo et al 2013 for the years 2017 and 2018 bran2015 assimilated in situ temperature and salinity from a near real time version of the csiro atlas of regional seas cars ridgway et al 2002 which contain global argo subsurface observations argo 2020 roemmich et al 2019 errors associated with individual observations are assumed to be 0 1 m for sla 0 35 c for sst 0 5 c and 0 1 psu for subsurface temperature and salinity these values include measurement errors and representation errors due to unresolved variability within a model grid cell note components of observation errors representation error in particular are poorly known so values are somewhat tuned for performance in the reanalysis in practice observation errors are reduced by super observations where data of the same type at the grid position are averaged see sakov 2014 super observations greatly reduce the data to be assimilated and the computational cost particularly at coarse resolution 3 results to demonstrate the impact of multiscale da on the bran ocean reanalysis output from the da cycles and the ocean model are shown for the different experiments described results here are focused around australia reducing the domain shown to demonstrate more clearly the varied responses to the multiscale da in different regions it is also the region of interest to the bluelink project supporting the development of bran 3 1 da analysis and forecast statistics da statistics are useful metrics to assess the full ocean da system and a means to compare overall performance of different setups time series of da observation model differences or mean absolute deviations mad calculated by the da system averaged over the australian region 90 180 e 50 s 5 n for the three experiments presented here table 1 are shown for 2017 8 in fig 5 3 day forecast errors are not shown for 2017 of ms400 because no subsurface observations were withheld for independent analysis over these dates analysis deviations are calculated from the final analysis after the two da steps which is passed to the ocean model for the next cycle analysis h in fig 4 da statistics are presented for the main categories of observations assimilated surface temperatures sea level anomalies subsurface temperature and subsurface salinity subsurface observations are from argo so these data span from the surface to the nominal argo depth of 2000 m relative to bran2015 multiscale da has negligible impact to the observation model differences of surface fields i e sea level and sst which are well observed and constrained with global coverage from satellite instruments however there are substantial reductions in both analysis and forecast deviations of subsurface temperatures and salinity in both multiscale da systems relative to bran2015 fig 5 shows these reductions are established within several da cycles from the point ms400 branches from bran2015 and are then consistent throughout the rest of experiment and independent of season the larger cycle to cycle variability in the multiscale da subsurface forecast mads relative to the bran2015 forecasts is due to the smaller sample size since these multiscale forecasts are calculated with less data the 10 of observations withheld from the coarse analysis in the previous cycle as described in section 2 2 1 to compare the performance of the different da setups averages of mads for the full year of 2018 are shown in tables 3 and 4 for analyses and forecasts respectively the forecast values shown here are with observations independent of any previous analysis which for the subsurface observations means the forecast calculations are based on the withheld 10 of available observations these tables also report a break down of mean deviations with depth ms400 shows slight degradation in sst with a 3 5 increase in forecast deviations for sea level there is a small improvement in analysis deviations 2 9 but forecasts are relatively unchanged 0 9 with ms1600 sst forecasts are less degraded 0 8 relative to ms400 sea level forecasts also show a small degradation 0 7 and analysis deviations in these surface fields about the same as bran2015 observation model deviations of subsurface temperatures and salinities are substantially reduced with respect to bran2015 the overall reduction in temperature salinity analysis deviations from all depths in ms400 are 30 6 26 3 which are larger improvements than in ms1600 which are 24 6 21 1 however ms1600 has larger improvements in forecast deviations 14 0 16 0 compared with those for ms400 9 4 11 6 indicating that ms400 has faster error growth and is overfitting data in the analysis noting that forecast mads have larger uncertainty due to the smaller withheld sample size when considering the breakdown of these improvements with depth improvements in temperature are clearly greater in deep waters for both analysis and forecast fields for instance a 31 3 reduction relative to bran2015 in forecast deviations with ms1600 for temperatures 500 m and no significant change in temperatures 50 m shallow temperatures vary rapidly from surface forcing but are also well observed in all the experiments presented here being strongly coupled to sst hence similar performance is expected here on the other hand subsurface salinity shows substantial improvements with multiscale da in all depth classes in analysis deviations in salinity forecasts improvements relative to bran2015 are still significant at all depths including near the surface due to the absence of equivalent high quality surface salinity observations to constrain the upper ocean and the benefits of the coarse da step fig 6 shows pairs of rows showing binned values of mad and bias at various depths and sections for temperature and salinity around australia the model observation misfits shown are averaged from forecast calculations of the da cycles over the year 2018 using withheld observations in the case of multiscale da experiments previous results in table 4 indicated significant temperature improvements at depth with multiscale da and the top pair of rows show the spatial distribution of these misfits at 1120 m and how multiscale da affects the mad and bias regionally in bran2015 bias at 1120 m panel d is dominated by a midlatitude band of positive bias peaking at 0 7 c at 35 40 s and a band of negative bias 0 5 c in the southern ocean 55 60 s these bands of bias also coincide with regions of high mad panel a multiscale da in both ms400 and ms1600 reduces bias across the domain shown and these bands of bias are no longer discernable in panels e and f the bands of high mad in bran2015 are lost in the background with multiscale da panels b and c temperature sections in the middle pair of rows of fig 6 show the vertical extent and structure of the biases indicated at 1120 m the cool bias in the southern ocean extends 600 2000 m south of 50 s and most of the warm bias is at depths 800 1200 m from 45 s and extending north in ms400 and ms1600 the cool bias is reduced and the warm bias removed panels e and f mad is reduced across most of the section however there is no clear improvement in the uppermost bins north of 45 s salinity in the upper ocean shows significant improvement with multiscale da unlike temperature as indicated in tables 3 and 4 and shown in the bottom pair of rows in fig 6 salinity bias and mad at 195 m in bran2015 is positive in the southern ocean and indonesia negative in the low latitudes of the pacific all of the magnitude 0 2 psu panel d multiscale da corrects biases in all these regions panels e and f mad is substantially reduced in the southern ocean down to 0 05 0 10 psu while remaining at moderate values at other latitudes panels b and c for all results in fig 6 there are subtle differences in the mad and bias of ms400 and ms1600 but these are minor compared to the improvement with respect to bran2015 fig 7 is an initial comparison of the different da setups here evaluating simulated temperatures top row model observation differences second row and the low and high resolution increments applied bottom rows at the depth shown 1120 m model observation differences in the multiscale da cases panels e and f are substantially smaller in amplitude relative to the bran2015 differences panel d it is not clear if one multiscale system has better performance here ofam resolution increments are qualitatively the same in the setups shown panels j k l the character of the coarse ms1600 increments panel i with larger spatially coherent corrections and smaller amplitudes relative to ms400 panel h along with the greater reduction in subsurface forecast errors table 4 are why ms1600 is preferred of the multiscale da setups shown the simulated ocean state from ms1600 is compared in detail with respect to bran2015 and available observations in the following section interestingly the ofam resolution increments from all setups in fig 7 are very similar here indicating da h is unaffected by corrections at larger length scales this confirms the coarse da l corrections contain scales that are independent of da h or that there is a separation in scales in the increments calculated from the two da steps even though they assimilate the same observations 3 2 effect on ocean state figs 8 and 9 compare temperature and salinity simulated by ms1600 and bran2015 in the australian region with in situ argo observations overall the amplitudes of the model observation differences are significantly smaller for ms1600 2nd row than bran2015 differences 4th row at all depths for both temperature and salinity even though the signs of the differences vary across the domain shown while differences can be large from an individual profile from either ms1600 or bran2015 particularly in the upper ocean and regions of high variability such as the mesoscale eddy fields there are also clear large scale patterns in the distribution in differences between the two models at all depths shown bottom row the spatial distribution of bran2015 observation differences 4th row typically match the bran2015 ms1600 difference 5th row for example bran2015 is cooler and fresher than ms1600 by 1 c and 0 1 psu practical salinity units in the deep southern ocean figs 8 and 9 panel o consistent with bran2015 being cooler and fresher than observations in this region panel l while ms1600 observation differences are negligible panel f elsewhere the coral sea is warmer in ms1600 at 1120 m by 0 5 c and a midlatitude band around australia 30 s to 45 s is cooler and fresher at 1120 m in ms1600 relative to bran2015 by 1 c and 0 1 psu in contrast at 680 m this band is warmer and saltier by similar magnitudes representing different biases in different water masses through the thermocline in the upper ocean model observation differences are larger due to variability associated with mesoscale dynamics variability in surface forcing and higher gradients in water properties here however ms1600 still shows large regions with significant improvements even close to the surface for salinity in particular fig 9d j and m for instance a broad region near the surface of the southern ocean is cooler and fresher in ms1600 by 1 c and 0 2 psu while the western pacific is saltier by 0 2 psu which are all again consistent with corrections to bran2015 observation differences figs 8 and 9 panel j multiscale da is also effective in improving simulated temperature and salinity at regional scales for example bounty trough southeast of new zealand is a body of water with a scale of 200 km 172 e 46 s bounded at depth by the campbell plateau and chatham rise water in bounty trough is 1 c warmer and 0 1 psu saltier in bran2015 relative to the available argo observations figs 8 and 9 panels k and l whereas in ms1600 these occasional isolated observations are sufficient to correct the ocean state so that model observations differences become negligible here panels e and f the distributions of differences in figs 8 and 9 vary with depth indicating the biases and model differences are following the structure of water masses which are now shown in zonal sections in figs 10 and 11 from 100 e in the indian ocean single profiles are subject to mesocale variability and differences in profile positions but the model observation deviations shown are consistent with the bran2015 ms1600 differences that are the result of hundreds of da cycles figs 10 and 11 panels f and are also compatible with the zonal structure of results in the depth slices of figs 8 and 9 as indicated before the southern ocean is warmer and saltier in ms1600 and also the midlatitude band of the thermocline at 680 m note again the amplitude of the differences between ms1600 and observations in the southern ocean are substantially less than differences with bran2015 figs 10 and 11 panels d and e model observation differences are reduced in ms1600 not just at depth but also for example in waters at 100 to 200 m in the southern ocean that are cooler and fresher in ms1600 evident now in the section view is that the ms1600 has cooled and freshened the antarctic intermediate waters from around the surface of the southern ocean between 45 and 50 s to underneath the thermocline at 1000 to 1200 m at midlatitudes the isopycnal contours from ms1600 and bran2015 are relatively invariant indicating differences between the models are largely density compensated as another demonstration of the improved performance with the multiscale da fig 12 compares model results with observations from expendable bathythermographs xbts across the southern ocean line ix28 from dumont d urville antarctica to hobart australia that are completely independent of data assimilated into the experiments presented data shown are from a voyage in march 2017 accessed through the coriolis ocean dataset for reanalysis cora cabanes et al 2013 and enkf c is used to calculate the model observation misfits without assimilation xbt lines in the domain are infrequent only observe temperature and only record data to 800 m these data are not as useful as the global argo array for constraining the ocean state but they can still assess the reanalysis performance in some xbt lines there is little improvement evident with multiscale da due to large vertical temperature gradients in fig 8 there is little improvement in temperatures at 95 m in most regions and xbt data are not deep enough to sample 1000 m where multiscale da had an impact fig 12 shows an xbt line in the southern ocean where the vertical gradients are less and the improvements are clearer bran2015 has a warm bias of 2 c in a wedge below the mld in the southern ocean 100 m thick near antarctica thickening to 800 m in the subantarctic zone 50 s a cool bias of 1 c exists in the deep southern ocean below this wedge these biases are substantially reduced with the relatively sparse argo observations available and multiscale da results here are consistent with fig 10 which includes results across a wider and deeper domain 4 analysis and discussion we now examine increments from the all da experiments presented including both multiscale setups and compare them with features shown in the ensembles and ocean states presented in sections 2 and 3 as a way to understand the improvement found with the multiscale da fig 13 shows temperature increments from all experiments in a section at 100 e in the indian ocean the same domain shown in figs 10 and 11 differences in the spatial distribution of the coarse and high resolution increments are evident 1st and 2nd rows respectively positive and negative features within the coarse increments have more substantial horizontal extent and vary with depth on the other hand high resolution increments have small horizontal and large vertical extents forming narrow coherent vertical structures any vertical changes in high resolution increments are typically limited to the base of the mixed layer in the upper ocean annual averages fig 13 middle two rows combine increments from 100 da cycles spatial features in the average of coarse increments have similar extents as the single samples and still vary with depth albeit with different phases and smaller amplitudes the spatial extent of average low resolution increments correspond well with the structure in the temperature and salinity sections figs 10 and 11 where most corrections are in the warmer saltier waters above the intermediate water in water with potential density less than 1027 2 kg m 3 50 s 10 s reaching depths of 1000 m at 40 s average high resolution increments extend deep 1000 m in the southern ocean 45 s 55 s annual mean increments in general do not show any significant values over large regions that match any structures of bran2015 ms1600 differences in figs 10 and 11 nor consistency between the experiments however there may be significant persistent features in average increments at smaller local scales for instance there is the warming in the average increments centred at 5 s and 100 200 m common to all experiments in ms400 this feature is mostly corrected in the da l step but not in ms1600 where it is corrected with high resolution increments as in bran2015 this indicates there is overlap in the scales being corrected within the ms400 setup whereas ms1600 has separation between effective scales of the two da steps the da could be correcting for biases in the ocean model or deficiencies in the surface forcing here however further diagnosis is beyond the scope of this work the root mean squared rms of coarse increments fig 13 2nd bottom row again have a similar spatial distribution substantial increment rms in water above the intermediate water with relatively small rms in deeper waters rms in the high resolution increments bottom row show a similar extent in midlatitudes however in the southern ocean high resolution increments extend much deeper deeper than 1000 m at 45 55 s it is apparent these increments are not driven by local model observation temperature differences as seen in fig 8 the magnitudes of temperature differences at depth are spatially uniform across all latitudes and not limited to the southern ocean rather these increments match the spatial extents of anomalies that make up the high resolution ensemble for example fig 1h noting also the vertical structures in the background error covariances fig 1j and l the nature of increments in salinity fig 14 largely match those described here for temperature the one difference is the minima in salinity increment rms corresponding to depths of zero salinity gradient and insensitivity of salinity to vertical displacements as also seen in the salinity bec in the high resolution ensemble fig 2j and l increments in sea level are shown in fig 15 interestingly annual means of the high resolution increments show regions in the southern ocean with significant magnitudes 5 cm in bran2015 that are reduced in ms400 and ms1600 however some of these same features appear in mean coarse increments as well now indicating an overlap here in the scales being corrected by the two da steps related possibly to the high density of observations also the spatial distributions of the rms of high resolution sea level increments are modified in some regions e g 115 e 55 s bottom row fig 15 changes in these features could be associated with corrections in the subsurface water structure simulated with the multiscale da however the mean and rms of low resolution sea level increments are relatively small the model observation differences shown in figs 10 and 11 vary with depth following water mass structures panel e in each figure however ofam resolution increments are vertically coherent under the mixed layer due to the structure of the ensemble members and the narrow vertical background error covariances fig 1 making them inefficient to correct these biases that vary with depth on the other hand the climatological anomalies in the coarse ensemble fig 3 vary vertically and are effective at correcting these differences in the deep ocean operating as a water mass bias correction close examination of increments also gives insight into the difference in performance between the two multiscale da setups presented the spread of increments from ms400 fig 13n also indicates some deep increments in the southern ocean like those in the high resolution increments these are more subdued in ms1600 with a larger localisation radius fig 13o typical spacing of argo profiles and subsurface observations are of the order of a few 100 km and sometimes up to several 100 km see distribution of observations in figs 8 and 9 with the smaller localisation there are more instances where increments are calculated based on isolated observations which increases the chances of spurious increments from vertical covariances as seen in the high resolution da or far field poorly constrained extrapolations with the wider localisation more subsurface observations are considered with each increment calculation which may be less effective at matching a single profile but perform better interpolating between profiles hence while the ms400 may have smaller analysis errors ms1600 is more dynamically consistent with smaller error growth and produces better forecasts as shown in tables 3 and 4 there is an indication of this in fig 7 where an anomaly 1 c warmer than surrounding water appears in the great australian bight 120 e 45 s simulated in ms400 panel b that is not supported by observations this feature is substantially subdued in ms1600 panel c where the localisation radius is larger and increments are constrained by more data 5 summary and conclusions model observation differences in a near global eddy resolving ocean reanalysis are significantly reduced using a multiscale da approach the da method used is ensemble optimal interpolation where corrections to the ocean state are calculated by projecting observation model differences onto a static ensemble of anomalies the multiscale da approach uses two separate ensembles based on different ocean models in this case where anomalies have different length scales and spatial structures the high resolution da ensemble is the same as that used in recent bran experiments e g bran2015 oke et al 2018 on the ofam grid oke et al 2013a with 3 day minus 3 month anomalies that emphasise mesoscale features the multiscale da here uses a second da step with an ensemble at low resolution constructed from monthly climatological anomalies from a 1 resolution ocean model based on o kane et al 2014a these climatological anomalies contain subsurface modes of variability in the ocean that are broader and have vertical structures that are well suited to correcting biases in the underlying ocean models these modes are much slower than mesoscale dynamics and are lost in the high resolution ensemble we show that model observation differences in both the analysis and forecast are significantly reduced in the ocean reanalysis with multiscale da relative to bran2015 mean absolute deviations of analyses in subsurface temperature salinity from all depths around australia are reduced by 24 6 21 1 compared to bran2015 forecast deviations are reduced by 14 0 16 0 improvements in temperature are greater at depth forecast deviations deeper than 500 m are reduced by 31 3 the best performance in the multiscale da system here is found with a localisation radius set to 1600 km with an effective radius of 450 km large enough to usually encompass neighbouring argo profiles that are typically spaced 300 km changes in the average errors of sst and sea level are relatively small with multiscale da since these fields are well observed and constrained with the existing high resolution da methods the largest improvements are in the subsurface where observations are comparatively sparse maps of temperature and salinity differences between the multiscale da reanalysis and bran2015 show broad coherent structures consistent with reductions of model observation differences in bran2015 improvements are evident at all depths sections of temperature and salinity differences between models show features following isopycnals indicating the multiscale da corrections can effectively follow particular water masses the 3 d character of increments applied in the reanalyses are similar to that of the members and covariance of the underlying ensembles rather than the structure of model observation differences the inclusion of the second da step with an ensemble of climatological anomalies allows the reanalysis to effectively correct the structure of biases that vary with depth horizontally there is a separation of scales in the corrections from the two da steps in this work we present an ocean reanalysis with a two step da cycle that is essentially a combination of two analogous systems originally developed separately with ocean models at different resolutions we find the results of the combined system significantly improved relative to original individual configurations why does it work we show there is increased diversity in the construction of the ensembles and a separation in scale at which they operate for instance when examining ensemble members it was shown that the coarse ensemble could modify the position of the antarctic circumpolar current while the high resolution ensemble modified features within the current a challenge for a da system is that there are typically more degrees of freedom in the model observation misfits than in the ensemble so the ability to find an ensemble member to match the misfits is limited often referred to as rank deficiency increasing the diversity in the ensembles reduces this deficiency making the multiscale system more effective when constructing corrections to the ocean state improving the overall performance some testing of the configuration of the coarse da step was explored here however the scope for further exploration of ensemble construction is wide for instance further benefits to the ocean reanalysis might still be realised with yet larger ensemble sizes ensembles constructed from different time periods different ensemble generation algorithms seasonal resolution ensembles from different ocean models and even tuning to the management of observations and their errors any of these ensemble aspects have potential for further incremental improvements beyond the step change we present here and are subject to continuing investigation it may also be possible to combine the important elements of different ensembles into a single hybrid ensemble and be used in a single step credit authorship contribution statement m a chamberlain conceptualization investigation visualization writing

23890,forecast errors of subsurface temperature and salinity are substantially reduced with an efficient two step multiscale ensemble optimal interpolation enoi system applied to a near global eddy resolving ocean model a critical element of any data assimilation system is the background error covariance which for enoi is typically a static ensemble of anomalies from a long model run here we construct two ensembles one based on intraseasonal anomalies from a free run of the same eddy resolving ocean model used to underpin the forecasts and a second ensemble of climatogical anomalies calculated using a relatively coarse 1 degree global ocean model for each assimilation cycle the coarse resolution ensemble is used to correct the broad scales and the high resolution ensemble is used to correct the eddy scales corrections from the coarse steps are more effective at reducing systematic errors in the subsurface ocean whereas the high resolution steps typically produce vertically coherent corrections associated with mesoscale eddies we compare two configurations of multiscale data assimilation with different localisation radii in the coarse data assimilation step the best performance and slowest error growth was found with localisation that was large enough to encompass neighbouring profiles in each assimilation cycle the efficacy of the approach is demonstrated in ocean reanalyses over 2017 8 that assimilate data every 3 days we demonstrate clear improvements in the representation of temperature and salinity at all depths around australia model observation differences are particularly improved in and below the thermocline the corrections to the ocean state with multiscale data assimilation follow water mass structures the increased computational cost of this multiscale approach is modest about double the analysis step but the performance improvement is significant making this approach suitable for research and operational applications keywords ocean reanalysis multiscale data assimilation ensemble optimal interpolation operational oceanography 1 introduction the challenge for ocean reanalyses is to simulate the real ocean with minimal differences to available observations and time tendencies that are smooth and dynamically realistic the real ocean has dynamics and processes that span scales from the microscopic to planetary and it is impossible for all to be faithfully represented in any single model regardless of resolution or parameterisations applied hence all ocean models are left with some extent of bias in general models with higher spatial resolution have smaller biases being able to explicitly resolve important dynamics and less dependent on subgrid parameterisations albeit with extra computational expense but differences to observations remain to some degree e g rackow et al 2019 kiss et al 2020 mesoscale dynamics of the ocean such as eddies filaments and boundary currents evolve rapidly on the order of days and are a major component of ocean variability but the ocean also contains intrinsic dynamic modes with interannual timescales e g o kane et al 2013 as well as slow broad baroclinic waves that propogate along waveguides or storm tracks within the thermoclines e g o kane et al 2014b ocean reanalyses assimilate available observations to capture all these dynamical features ideally with no bias in the long term mean state the bluelink project has produced a series of ocean reanalyses bluelink reanalysis bran since the 2000s schiller et al 2020 the most recent being bran2015 oke et al 2018 that is based on the ocean forecasting australia model ofam version 3 oke et al 2013a bran is closely related to oceanmaps an operational ocean reanalysis system used by the australian bureau of meteorology brassington et al 2007 2012 bran and related ocean reanalyses have various research and operational applications they may be studied directly such as to characterise past ocean state for extreme events e g schiller et al 2009 oke and griffin 2011 or to analyse ocean features hard to observe directly such as boundary current structure schiller et al 2008 zonal currents in the southeast indian ocean divakaran and brassington 2011 and langrangrian eddy behaviour in the tasman sea brassington et al 2011 indirectly reanalysis products support further research such as particle tracking for dispersal studies e g chiswell and rickard 2011 or as boundary conditions for embedded models at higher resolution e g steven et al 2019 operational applications of ocean reanalyses include generating initial conditions for forecasts and particle tracking for search and rescue or spill containment penny et al 2019 a long standing problem with bran like other ocean reanalyses has been the difficulty in reducing misfits of the model to deep observations high quality data with good global coverage has been available for many years from the network of argo floats roemmich et al 2019 but misfits remain significantly greater than observation or representation errors in the work presented here we show implementations of multiscale data assimilation da to bran ocean reanalyses and the associated improvements in fit to observations we take advantage of existing ocean da configurations that use the same ocean model and da infrastructure but configured for different resolutions we combine the existing bran configuration with a configuration at 1 resolution used by o kane et al 2014a being a coarse model the configuration is relatively cheap to run and it is possible to calculate ensemble anomalies from long spinups focused on slow interannual modes of variability which have more spread at depth in the ensemble examples of multiscale da can now be found in many disciplines interested in constraining the state of systems with variability across a wide range of scales a multiscale 3d var system was applied to a coastal model li et al 2015 which improved the analysis in both an idealised simulation and a test in a real time system a multiscale approach has also been used in a 4d var system to improve the assimilation of smaller scale features with high density observations within a regional ocean model in the north atlantic carrier et al 2019 in another regional model focused on assimilating high resolution altimetry data a multiscale da system was able to better constrain submesoscale and mesoscale features than a single step da system souopgui et al 2020 the structure of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the multiscale da system including the descriptions of the underlying ocean models and associated ensembles this section describes the sequence followed in applying the multiscale da including the da parameters used at each scale section 3 compares results from two multiscale da experiments with bran2015 comparing da statistics as well as model observation differences in the simulated ocean states section 4 discusses the results increments and ensembles to demonstrate why the two step multiscale da is more effective section 5 summarises the work 2 method da in existing bran systems use an ensemble optimal interpolation enoi method as described by oke et al 2008 multiscale da here is achieved by a two step enoi approach corrections are obtained by assimilating data with separate ensembles constructed to emphasise different spatial scales as explained below 2 1 ocean models and ensembles all ocean models used here are global in scale and based on the modular ocean model mom versions 4 1 and 5 griffies 2008 2012 however mom is configured differently when simulating the ocean at different resolutions free running ocean only experiments at each resolution forced with atmospheric reanalyses generate the background ensembles used for the enoi 2 1 1 ofam the ofam resolution ensemble is the same as used in bran2015 oke et al 2018 which is based on the free running model described in oke et al 2013a briefly these products use version 3 of ofam which is near global 75 s to 75 n with 0 1 resolution and 51 vertical levels the uppermost layers are 5 m thick and in the deep ocean below 2000 m temperature and salinity are restored to climatology 365 day timescale and the layers are allowed to expand to more than 500 m vertical coordinates are zstar which are geopotential levels that scale with a varying free surface being an eddy resolving model only a biharmonic scheme is enabled for friction and neutral physics parameterisations are not required the spinup was forced with era interim dee and uppala 2009 ofam ensemble members are calculated as the difference between corresponding 3 day and 3 month averages centred on the middle of each month over 12 years of the spinup years 2000 to 2011 144 members these differences capture eddies and mesoscale variability fig 1 shows examples of ensemble members ensemble spread and background error covariance from the ofam ensemble for temperature from two regions first in the tasman sea and second the subantarctic zone south of australia the spread of ensemble members middle row is high in the thermocline especially in regions of significant mesoscale eddy activity such as near the separation point of the east australia current eac in the tasman sea and along the subantarctic front in the southern ocean this spread decreases to very low values with depth at all locations background error covariances bec bottom row fig 1 are shown with respect to the positions indicated in both regions the bec produces a mesoscale eddy like structure correlations are narrow and have large vertical extents the subantarctic location is within the antarctic circumpolar current where anomalies follow the zonal structure of the current albeit with mesoscale features within this zone bec structures in fig 1 are associated with anomalies from vertical displacement of the water column induced by mesoscale eddies the ensemble of salinity anomalies are almost identical in character to the temperature ensemble at these scales fig 2 however the vertical structure of the bec for salinity is discontinuous where the vertical gradient of the salinity is zero and vertical displacements do not produce salinity anomalies 2 1 2 1 degree access ocean model the coarse ensemble is based on a grid from the ocean component of the australian community climate and earth system simulator access see bi et al 2013 for a detailed description of this ocean model the implementation used here is like the ocean sea ice configuration used in o kane et al 2013 the nominal horizontal resolution of the grid is 1 with higher meridional resolution near the equator and in the southern ocean the grid is tripolar to avoid the grid singularity at the north pole the grid becomes curvilinear north of 65 n the access grid has 50 vertical levels using zstar coordinates like the ofam model the top layers are 10 m thick down to a depth of 200 m and the resolution expands to 300 m for the bottommost levels the access ocean model includes extra parameterisations to represent processes that are unresolved in the 1 resolution models such as neutral physics to emulate mixing by mesoscale eddies both laplacian and biharmonic friction schemes are used to capture dissipation at different scales the 1 model spinup used the jra 55 forcing and being less computationally expensive was run longer than the ofam spinup the ocean state was spun up for several centuries with climatology and two passes of 60 years 1958 to 2017 of jra 55 forcing kobayashi et al 2015 the coarse ensemble members are monthly anomalies from a detrended climatology constructed using 40 years of the second pass of jra 55 forcing years 1970 2009 avoiding early years with less observational constraints in the forcing and also avoiding the last years affected by climate change fig 3 shows examples of ensemble members spread and background error covariance in the same regions as the ofam resolution examples from fig 1 and illustrate the different nature of this coarse ensemble the samples shown have broad coherent features with scales of the order of several 100 km for example north of 45 s up into the great australian bight fig 3c in regions where there is little variability in the ofam ensemble variability at depth here is slower than seasonal timescales and hence are not significant in the ofam ensemble anomalies but can appear as climatological anomalies in the coarse ensemble in the upper ocean the spread of 1 ensembles is less than the high resolution ensemble however the high resolution spread decreases substantially with depth and deeper than 1000 m the 1 ensemble spread is greater figs 1 and 3 panels f and h covariances of the 1 ensemble have lobes of low to moderate correlations that are much wider than seen in high resolution ensembles of the order of 1000s km extending beyond the domain shown bottom row fig 3 in the subantarctic zone the 1 ensemble is able to modify the position of the antarctic circumpolar current whereas the ofam ensemble modified features within the current also in this region the 1 ensemble anomalies are tilted along isopycnals when viewed in sections rather than in vertical eddy features that dominate the ofam ensemble similarly in the tasman sea the 1 ensemble has broader influence following water mass structures reaching into the extension of the east australia current in this case 2 2 multiscale data assimilation both steps of the multiscale da system presented here use the ensemble optimal interpolation enoi capability of enkf c sakov 2014 a generic da system designed for large geophysical models enoi is similar to 3d var schemes that are commonly used both are computationally efficient methods that assimilate observations into models a major difference between enoi and 3d var is the way the schemes estimate the system s background forecast error covariance as discussed in fu et al 2009 for enoi these covariances are based on a stationary ensemble of anomalies from a previous free running simulation that are typically multivariate whereas in 3d var systems these covariances are based on user defined correlation functions specified length scales and functional forms and are usually univariate projection of observations onto other variables using 3d var usually involves some assumption about dynamics e g velocity increments are geostrophic or empirical relationships between variables e g t s correlations derived from historical observations a comparison between enoi and 3d var is presented by fu et al 2009 and is discussed by moore et al 2019 in enoi da observation model differences within a specified radius are projected onto ensemble members to construct a weighted average that becomes the correction to the local ocean state the bran da is configured to reduce observation model differences in temperature salinity and sea level anomaly in each experiment u and v velocity corrections are also applied using covariances calculated from ensembles to maintain dynamical balance in the analysis oke et al 2013b the multiscale da system here is developed by adding a low resolution step to the da component of bran2015 the da workflow is summarised in fig 4 the initial background background i is the ocean state or restart at end of the ocean model run from the previous cycle forecast statistics are calculated with this initial background and observations at high resolution in order to compare to other ocean reanalyses background i is averaged and regridded onto the coarse grid background l values at high resolution within each coarse grid cell are aggregated in this averaging the coarse da step da l is applied to this coarse background using the coarse 1 ensemble observations in da l are also merged and averaged onto the coarse grid greatly reducing the number of observations the size of the da problem and the computational cost of the step the correction from da l increment l is interpolated back to the ofam grid and added to the background i for the new background background h in this way broad scale corrections get incorporated into the background without losing the important mesoscale features from background i the second high resolution da cycle da h produces analysis h that now includes low and high resolution corrections this da h cycle uses the same ofam ensemble that was used in bran2015 the final analysis from this cycle becomes the initial condition for the next ocean model integration the ocean model integrates the ocean state forward in time and the final restart becomes the background to the next da cycle data assimilation parameters at each step are discussed in the following section 2 2 1 experiments and da parameters results shown in this work were produced by the experiments listed in table 1 namely the control bran2015 run and two tests of the multiscale da configurations table 2 contains further details of da parameters used at each step of the multiscale da cycle these values are based on the configurations where each step was originally developed in separate models at different resolutions da h is based on bran2015 and da l on the 1 model in o kane et al 2014a the cycle length of 3 days is unchanged in any of the configurations tested here larger ensemble sizes are possible with the coarse ocean model 480 compared to 144 since it is computationally cheaper to run the coarse spinup model the larger ensemble can improve the da performance since the ensemble can encompass more modes of variability within the simulation the stride feature of enkf c reduces the da computational cost for large high resolution grids in particular weightings of ensemble members to produce an increment are calculated at grid points spaced by the stride value weightings are interpolated to other intermediate points two setups of multiscale da are tested in the first the localisation radius of da l is 400 km whereas in the second it is increased to 1600 km effectively increasing the length scale of the increments calculated these length scales aim to capture features larger than typical mesoscale eddies the larger length scales also make these da l increments far more effective at correcting biases in the ocean state in the subsurface which is sparsely sampled da h localisation length scale is focused on mesoscale corrections note these values are support localisation radii and the effective localisation is 3 5 less than the specified value as described in the enkf c user guide sakov 2014 a short test of 10 cycles was also done with a larger localisation 2400 km however the errors in the subsurface analyses and forecasts were greater for both temperature and salinity and deteriorated further with additional da cycles not shown and were not investigated further here long distance correlations can be subject to noise and degradation in analyses oke et al 2007 showed this to be true for a number of small idealised models comparing the impacts of localisation and ensemble size on enkf and enoi systems the magnitude of corrections calculated by enkf c depend on the relative size of observation and model or ensemble variances and r factor and k factor are two procedures within enkf c used to modify these variances and tune the performance of the da system see sakov 2014 for details r factor is a scaling factor applied to observation error variances and is typically increased for larger localisations that include more observations to avoid overfitting the higher r factor in ms1600 reduces the impact of observations in the analysis we also use an adaptive quality control procedure the k factor which is also described in sakov and sandery 2017 this procedure prevents overfitting by smoothly increasing the variance of observations with misfit so that the corresponding increments do not exceed the standard deviation of the ensemble scaled by the specified value da l corrections are calculated from observations within 65 s 65 n encompassing most of the ofam bran domain but avoiding influences of sea ice and the tripolar access ocean grid that are not considered here model sea level anomalies are calculated with respect to the mean sea level of the long free running spinup of the high resolution model which is interpolated onto the coarse grid for the da l step larger data windows are used for subsurface observations in the coarse da step these larger windows increase the number of observations assimilated by sampling over the complete argo cycle 10 days this significantly improved the performance of the multiscale da system relative to using only a 3 day window which would include data from less than a third of the argo floats available a 9 day data window was initially used in ms400 so as to be a simple multiple of the da cycle length but a 10 day window was used in ms1600 in contrast to the subsurface sea surface temperature sst and sea level anomalies sla are well observed and constrained with 3 day data windows a short test of 20 cycles configured identically to bran2015 but with larger argo observation windows as applied in the multiscale configurations also showed some improvement in da performance however the magnitude of the reduction in da errors was less than half than that with the multiscale da not shown and this was not pursued further here the forecast observation model differences are calculated on background i fig 4 at the start of the da cycle these forecasts are calculated at the ofam resolution with 3 day observation windows in these bran experiments observation windows for all steps are centred at analysis time the large argo observation windows of da l 9 or 10 days matching the argo cycle time are now longer than the cycle length 3 days so that each cycle has data from the full argo array to assimilate increasing the data density this observation window configuration would not work in a real time application in this way individual argo observations are typically assimilated in 3 subsequent cycles also the wide argo analysis window now overlaps with the 3 day window of the next cycle s subsurface forecast calculation due to this overlap a subset 10 of future argo observations from the wide da l data windows are withheld from analysis argo data files are preprocessed and every tenth argo profile is extracted from these files and reserved clean forecast differences for subsurface temperature and salinity are then calculated in the next cycle using these withheld observations that were not previously assimilated into the ocean state all other forecasts remain clean 2 3 observations the observations used in the multiscale da tests presented were for consistency the same as those used in bran2015 the satellite sst assimilated are advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr data compiled by navo naval oceanographic office 2014a b c d along track satellite sla data from all available platforms are assimilated accessed from the radar altimeter database system rads v 3 scharroo et al 2013 for the years 2017 and 2018 bran2015 assimilated in situ temperature and salinity from a near real time version of the csiro atlas of regional seas cars ridgway et al 2002 which contain global argo subsurface observations argo 2020 roemmich et al 2019 errors associated with individual observations are assumed to be 0 1 m for sla 0 35 c for sst 0 5 c and 0 1 psu for subsurface temperature and salinity these values include measurement errors and representation errors due to unresolved variability within a model grid cell note components of observation errors representation error in particular are poorly known so values are somewhat tuned for performance in the reanalysis in practice observation errors are reduced by super observations where data of the same type at the grid position are averaged see sakov 2014 super observations greatly reduce the data to be assimilated and the computational cost particularly at coarse resolution 3 results to demonstrate the impact of multiscale da on the bran ocean reanalysis output from the da cycles and the ocean model are shown for the different experiments described results here are focused around australia reducing the domain shown to demonstrate more clearly the varied responses to the multiscale da in different regions it is also the region of interest to the bluelink project supporting the development of bran 3 1 da analysis and forecast statistics da statistics are useful metrics to assess the full ocean da system and a means to compare overall performance of different setups time series of da observation model differences or mean absolute deviations mad calculated by the da system averaged over the australian region 90 180 e 50 s 5 n for the three experiments presented here table 1 are shown for 2017 8 in fig 5 3 day forecast errors are not shown for 2017 of ms400 because no subsurface observations were withheld for independent analysis over these dates analysis deviations are calculated from the final analysis after the two da steps which is passed to the ocean model for the next cycle analysis h in fig 4 da statistics are presented for the main categories of observations assimilated surface temperatures sea level anomalies subsurface temperature and subsurface salinity subsurface observations are from argo so these data span from the surface to the nominal argo depth of 2000 m relative to bran2015 multiscale da has negligible impact to the observation model differences of surface fields i e sea level and sst which are well observed and constrained with global coverage from satellite instruments however there are substantial reductions in both analysis and forecast deviations of subsurface temperatures and salinity in both multiscale da systems relative to bran2015 fig 5 shows these reductions are established within several da cycles from the point ms400 branches from bran2015 and are then consistent throughout the rest of experiment and independent of season the larger cycle to cycle variability in the multiscale da subsurface forecast mads relative to the bran2015 forecasts is due to the smaller sample size since these multiscale forecasts are calculated with less data the 10 of observations withheld from the coarse analysis in the previous cycle as described in section 2 2 1 to compare the performance of the different da setups averages of mads for the full year of 2018 are shown in tables 3 and 4 for analyses and forecasts respectively the forecast values shown here are with observations independent of any previous analysis which for the subsurface observations means the forecast calculations are based on the withheld 10 of available observations these tables also report a break down of mean deviations with depth ms400 shows slight degradation in sst with a 3 5 increase in forecast deviations for sea level there is a small improvement in analysis deviations 2 9 but forecasts are relatively unchanged 0 9 with ms1600 sst forecasts are less degraded 0 8 relative to ms400 sea level forecasts also show a small degradation 0 7 and analysis deviations in these surface fields about the same as bran2015 observation model deviations of subsurface temperatures and salinities are substantially reduced with respect to bran2015 the overall reduction in temperature salinity analysis deviations from all depths in ms400 are 30 6 26 3 which are larger improvements than in ms1600 which are 24 6 21 1 however ms1600 has larger improvements in forecast deviations 14 0 16 0 compared with those for ms400 9 4 11 6 indicating that ms400 has faster error growth and is overfitting data in the analysis noting that forecast mads have larger uncertainty due to the smaller withheld sample size when considering the breakdown of these improvements with depth improvements in temperature are clearly greater in deep waters for both analysis and forecast fields for instance a 31 3 reduction relative to bran2015 in forecast deviations with ms1600 for temperatures 500 m and no significant change in temperatures 50 m shallow temperatures vary rapidly from surface forcing but are also well observed in all the experiments presented here being strongly coupled to sst hence similar performance is expected here on the other hand subsurface salinity shows substantial improvements with multiscale da in all depth classes in analysis deviations in salinity forecasts improvements relative to bran2015 are still significant at all depths including near the surface due to the absence of equivalent high quality surface salinity observations to constrain the upper ocean and the benefits of the coarse da step fig 6 shows pairs of rows showing binned values of mad and bias at various depths and sections for temperature and salinity around australia the model observation misfits shown are averaged from forecast calculations of the da cycles over the year 2018 using withheld observations in the case of multiscale da experiments previous results in table 4 indicated significant temperature improvements at depth with multiscale da and the top pair of rows show the spatial distribution of these misfits at 1120 m and how multiscale da affects the mad and bias regionally in bran2015 bias at 1120 m panel d is dominated by a midlatitude band of positive bias peaking at 0 7 c at 35 40 s and a band of negative bias 0 5 c in the southern ocean 55 60 s these bands of bias also coincide with regions of high mad panel a multiscale da in both ms400 and ms1600 reduces bias across the domain shown and these bands of bias are no longer discernable in panels e and f the bands of high mad in bran2015 are lost in the background with multiscale da panels b and c temperature sections in the middle pair of rows of fig 6 show the vertical extent and structure of the biases indicated at 1120 m the cool bias in the southern ocean extends 600 2000 m south of 50 s and most of the warm bias is at depths 800 1200 m from 45 s and extending north in ms400 and ms1600 the cool bias is reduced and the warm bias removed panels e and f mad is reduced across most of the section however there is no clear improvement in the uppermost bins north of 45 s salinity in the upper ocean shows significant improvement with multiscale da unlike temperature as indicated in tables 3 and 4 and shown in the bottom pair of rows in fig 6 salinity bias and mad at 195 m in bran2015 is positive in the southern ocean and indonesia negative in the low latitudes of the pacific all of the magnitude 0 2 psu panel d multiscale da corrects biases in all these regions panels e and f mad is substantially reduced in the southern ocean down to 0 05 0 10 psu while remaining at moderate values at other latitudes panels b and c for all results in fig 6 there are subtle differences in the mad and bias of ms400 and ms1600 but these are minor compared to the improvement with respect to bran2015 fig 7 is an initial comparison of the different da setups here evaluating simulated temperatures top row model observation differences second row and the low and high resolution increments applied bottom rows at the depth shown 1120 m model observation differences in the multiscale da cases panels e and f are substantially smaller in amplitude relative to the bran2015 differences panel d it is not clear if one multiscale system has better performance here ofam resolution increments are qualitatively the same in the setups shown panels j k l the character of the coarse ms1600 increments panel i with larger spatially coherent corrections and smaller amplitudes relative to ms400 panel h along with the greater reduction in subsurface forecast errors table 4 are why ms1600 is preferred of the multiscale da setups shown the simulated ocean state from ms1600 is compared in detail with respect to bran2015 and available observations in the following section interestingly the ofam resolution increments from all setups in fig 7 are very similar here indicating da h is unaffected by corrections at larger length scales this confirms the coarse da l corrections contain scales that are independent of da h or that there is a separation in scales in the increments calculated from the two da steps even though they assimilate the same observations 3 2 effect on ocean state figs 8 and 9 compare temperature and salinity simulated by ms1600 and bran2015 in the australian region with in situ argo observations overall the amplitudes of the model observation differences are significantly smaller for ms1600 2nd row than bran2015 differences 4th row at all depths for both temperature and salinity even though the signs of the differences vary across the domain shown while differences can be large from an individual profile from either ms1600 or bran2015 particularly in the upper ocean and regions of high variability such as the mesoscale eddy fields there are also clear large scale patterns in the distribution in differences between the two models at all depths shown bottom row the spatial distribution of bran2015 observation differences 4th row typically match the bran2015 ms1600 difference 5th row for example bran2015 is cooler and fresher than ms1600 by 1 c and 0 1 psu practical salinity units in the deep southern ocean figs 8 and 9 panel o consistent with bran2015 being cooler and fresher than observations in this region panel l while ms1600 observation differences are negligible panel f elsewhere the coral sea is warmer in ms1600 at 1120 m by 0 5 c and a midlatitude band around australia 30 s to 45 s is cooler and fresher at 1120 m in ms1600 relative to bran2015 by 1 c and 0 1 psu in contrast at 680 m this band is warmer and saltier by similar magnitudes representing different biases in different water masses through the thermocline in the upper ocean model observation differences are larger due to variability associated with mesoscale dynamics variability in surface forcing and higher gradients in water properties here however ms1600 still shows large regions with significant improvements even close to the surface for salinity in particular fig 9d j and m for instance a broad region near the surface of the southern ocean is cooler and fresher in ms1600 by 1 c and 0 2 psu while the western pacific is saltier by 0 2 psu which are all again consistent with corrections to bran2015 observation differences figs 8 and 9 panel j multiscale da is also effective in improving simulated temperature and salinity at regional scales for example bounty trough southeast of new zealand is a body of water with a scale of 200 km 172 e 46 s bounded at depth by the campbell plateau and chatham rise water in bounty trough is 1 c warmer and 0 1 psu saltier in bran2015 relative to the available argo observations figs 8 and 9 panels k and l whereas in ms1600 these occasional isolated observations are sufficient to correct the ocean state so that model observations differences become negligible here panels e and f the distributions of differences in figs 8 and 9 vary with depth indicating the biases and model differences are following the structure of water masses which are now shown in zonal sections in figs 10 and 11 from 100 e in the indian ocean single profiles are subject to mesocale variability and differences in profile positions but the model observation deviations shown are consistent with the bran2015 ms1600 differences that are the result of hundreds of da cycles figs 10 and 11 panels f and are also compatible with the zonal structure of results in the depth slices of figs 8 and 9 as indicated before the southern ocean is warmer and saltier in ms1600 and also the midlatitude band of the thermocline at 680 m note again the amplitude of the differences between ms1600 and observations in the southern ocean are substantially less than differences with bran2015 figs 10 and 11 panels d and e model observation differences are reduced in ms1600 not just at depth but also for example in waters at 100 to 200 m in the southern ocean that are cooler and fresher in ms1600 evident now in the section view is that the ms1600 has cooled and freshened the antarctic intermediate waters from around the surface of the southern ocean between 45 and 50 s to underneath the thermocline at 1000 to 1200 m at midlatitudes the isopycnal contours from ms1600 and bran2015 are relatively invariant indicating differences between the models are largely density compensated as another demonstration of the improved performance with the multiscale da fig 12 compares model results with observations from expendable bathythermographs xbts across the southern ocean line ix28 from dumont d urville antarctica to hobart australia that are completely independent of data assimilated into the experiments presented data shown are from a voyage in march 2017 accessed through the coriolis ocean dataset for reanalysis cora cabanes et al 2013 and enkf c is used to calculate the model observation misfits without assimilation xbt lines in the domain are infrequent only observe temperature and only record data to 800 m these data are not as useful as the global argo array for constraining the ocean state but they can still assess the reanalysis performance in some xbt lines there is little improvement evident with multiscale da due to large vertical temperature gradients in fig 8 there is little improvement in temperatures at 95 m in most regions and xbt data are not deep enough to sample 1000 m where multiscale da had an impact fig 12 shows an xbt line in the southern ocean where the vertical gradients are less and the improvements are clearer bran2015 has a warm bias of 2 c in a wedge below the mld in the southern ocean 100 m thick near antarctica thickening to 800 m in the subantarctic zone 50 s a cool bias of 1 c exists in the deep southern ocean below this wedge these biases are substantially reduced with the relatively sparse argo observations available and multiscale da results here are consistent with fig 10 which includes results across a wider and deeper domain 4 analysis and discussion we now examine increments from the all da experiments presented including both multiscale setups and compare them with features shown in the ensembles and ocean states presented in sections 2 and 3 as a way to understand the improvement found with the multiscale da fig 13 shows temperature increments from all experiments in a section at 100 e in the indian ocean the same domain shown in figs 10 and 11 differences in the spatial distribution of the coarse and high resolution increments are evident 1st and 2nd rows respectively positive and negative features within the coarse increments have more substantial horizontal extent and vary with depth on the other hand high resolution increments have small horizontal and large vertical extents forming narrow coherent vertical structures any vertical changes in high resolution increments are typically limited to the base of the mixed layer in the upper ocean annual averages fig 13 middle two rows combine increments from 100 da cycles spatial features in the average of coarse increments have similar extents as the single samples and still vary with depth albeit with different phases and smaller amplitudes the spatial extent of average low resolution increments correspond well with the structure in the temperature and salinity sections figs 10 and 11 where most corrections are in the warmer saltier waters above the intermediate water in water with potential density less than 1027 2 kg m 3 50 s 10 s reaching depths of 1000 m at 40 s average high resolution increments extend deep 1000 m in the southern ocean 45 s 55 s annual mean increments in general do not show any significant values over large regions that match any structures of bran2015 ms1600 differences in figs 10 and 11 nor consistency between the experiments however there may be significant persistent features in average increments at smaller local scales for instance there is the warming in the average increments centred at 5 s and 100 200 m common to all experiments in ms400 this feature is mostly corrected in the da l step but not in ms1600 where it is corrected with high resolution increments as in bran2015 this indicates there is overlap in the scales being corrected within the ms400 setup whereas ms1600 has separation between effective scales of the two da steps the da could be correcting for biases in the ocean model or deficiencies in the surface forcing here however further diagnosis is beyond the scope of this work the root mean squared rms of coarse increments fig 13 2nd bottom row again have a similar spatial distribution substantial increment rms in water above the intermediate water with relatively small rms in deeper waters rms in the high resolution increments bottom row show a similar extent in midlatitudes however in the southern ocean high resolution increments extend much deeper deeper than 1000 m at 45 55 s it is apparent these increments are not driven by local model observation temperature differences as seen in fig 8 the magnitudes of temperature differences at depth are spatially uniform across all latitudes and not limited to the southern ocean rather these increments match the spatial extents of anomalies that make up the high resolution ensemble for example fig 1h noting also the vertical structures in the background error covariances fig 1j and l the nature of increments in salinity fig 14 largely match those described here for temperature the one difference is the minima in salinity increment rms corresponding to depths of zero salinity gradient and insensitivity of salinity to vertical displacements as also seen in the salinity bec in the high resolution ensemble fig 2j and l increments in sea level are shown in fig 15 interestingly annual means of the high resolution increments show regions in the southern ocean with significant magnitudes 5 cm in bran2015 that are reduced in ms400 and ms1600 however some of these same features appear in mean coarse increments as well now indicating an overlap here in the scales being corrected by the two da steps related possibly to the high density of observations also the spatial distributions of the rms of high resolution sea level increments are modified in some regions e g 115 e 55 s bottom row fig 15 changes in these features could be associated with corrections in the subsurface water structure simulated with the multiscale da however the mean and rms of low resolution sea level increments are relatively small the model observation differences shown in figs 10 and 11 vary with depth following water mass structures panel e in each figure however ofam resolution increments are vertically coherent under the mixed layer due to the structure of the ensemble members and the narrow vertical background error covariances fig 1 making them inefficient to correct these biases that vary with depth on the other hand the climatological anomalies in the coarse ensemble fig 3 vary vertically and are effective at correcting these differences in the deep ocean operating as a water mass bias correction close examination of increments also gives insight into the difference in performance between the two multiscale da setups presented the spread of increments from ms400 fig 13n also indicates some deep increments in the southern ocean like those in the high resolution increments these are more subdued in ms1600 with a larger localisation radius fig 13o typical spacing of argo profiles and subsurface observations are of the order of a few 100 km and sometimes up to several 100 km see distribution of observations in figs 8 and 9 with the smaller localisation there are more instances where increments are calculated based on isolated observations which increases the chances of spurious increments from vertical covariances as seen in the high resolution da or far field poorly constrained extrapolations with the wider localisation more subsurface observations are considered with each increment calculation which may be less effective at matching a single profile but perform better interpolating between profiles hence while the ms400 may have smaller analysis errors ms1600 is more dynamically consistent with smaller error growth and produces better forecasts as shown in tables 3 and 4 there is an indication of this in fig 7 where an anomaly 1 c warmer than surrounding water appears in the great australian bight 120 e 45 s simulated in ms400 panel b that is not supported by observations this feature is substantially subdued in ms1600 panel c where the localisation radius is larger and increments are constrained by more data 5 summary and conclusions model observation differences in a near global eddy resolving ocean reanalysis are significantly reduced using a multiscale da approach the da method used is ensemble optimal interpolation where corrections to the ocean state are calculated by projecting observation model differences onto a static ensemble of anomalies the multiscale da approach uses two separate ensembles based on different ocean models in this case where anomalies have different length scales and spatial structures the high resolution da ensemble is the same as that used in recent bran experiments e g bran2015 oke et al 2018 on the ofam grid oke et al 2013a with 3 day minus 3 month anomalies that emphasise mesoscale features the multiscale da here uses a second da step with an ensemble at low resolution constructed from monthly climatological anomalies from a 1 resolution ocean model based on o kane et al 2014a these climatological anomalies contain subsurface modes of variability in the ocean that are broader and have vertical structures that are well suited to correcting biases in the underlying ocean models these modes are much slower than mesoscale dynamics and are lost in the high resolution ensemble we show that model observation differences in both the analysis and forecast are significantly reduced in the ocean reanalysis with multiscale da relative to bran2015 mean absolute deviations of analyses in subsurface temperature salinity from all depths around australia are reduced by 24 6 21 1 compared to bran2015 forecast deviations are reduced by 14 0 16 0 improvements in temperature are greater at depth forecast deviations deeper than 500 m are reduced by 31 3 the best performance in the multiscale da system here is found with a localisation radius set to 1600 km with an effective radius of 450 km large enough to usually encompass neighbouring argo profiles that are typically spaced 300 km changes in the average errors of sst and sea level are relatively small with multiscale da since these fields are well observed and constrained with the existing high resolution da methods the largest improvements are in the subsurface where observations are comparatively sparse maps of temperature and salinity differences between the multiscale da reanalysis and bran2015 show broad coherent structures consistent with reductions of model observation differences in bran2015 improvements are evident at all depths sections of temperature and salinity differences between models show features following isopycnals indicating the multiscale da corrections can effectively follow particular water masses the 3 d character of increments applied in the reanalyses are similar to that of the members and covariance of the underlying ensembles rather than the structure of model observation differences the inclusion of the second da step with an ensemble of climatological anomalies allows the reanalysis to effectively correct the structure of biases that vary with depth horizontally there is a separation of scales in the corrections from the two da steps in this work we present an ocean reanalysis with a two step da cycle that is essentially a combination of two analogous systems originally developed separately with ocean models at different resolutions we find the results of the combined system significantly improved relative to original individual configurations why does it work we show there is increased diversity in the construction of the ensembles and a separation in scale at which they operate for instance when examining ensemble members it was shown that the coarse ensemble could modify the position of the antarctic circumpolar current while the high resolution ensemble modified features within the current a challenge for a da system is that there are typically more degrees of freedom in the model observation misfits than in the ensemble so the ability to find an ensemble member to match the misfits is limited often referred to as rank deficiency increasing the diversity in the ensembles reduces this deficiency making the multiscale system more effective when constructing corrections to the ocean state improving the overall performance some testing of the configuration of the coarse da step was explored here however the scope for further exploration of ensemble construction is wide for instance further benefits to the ocean reanalysis might still be realised with yet larger ensemble sizes ensembles constructed from different time periods different ensemble generation algorithms seasonal resolution ensembles from different ocean models and even tuning to the management of observations and their errors any of these ensemble aspects have potential for further incremental improvements beyond the step change we present here and are subject to continuing investigation it may also be possible to combine the important elements of different ensembles into a single hybrid ensemble and be used in a single step credit authorship contribution statement m a chamberlain conceptualization investigation visualization writing

23891,bias correction of reanalysis based wind stress using scatterometer derived equivalent neutral wind has been a common practice in producing the forcing datasets used in recent global ocean model intercomparisons omips here we systematically evaluate the effect of this wind correction procedure on the simulation of the pacific north equatorial countercurrent necc with multiple sets of model experiments the weak necc evident in earlier omips employing the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments cores forcing dataset persists with the new jra55 do japanese 55 year reanalysis forcing dataset two factors appear to significantly affect the pacific necc in forced ocean simulations i the bias correction procedure using quikscat derived winds and ii whether or not the ocean current is considered in the bulk formula in the forced ocean simulations the quikscat correction weakens the averaged necc transports by about 60 taking the ocean currents into account in the bulk formula may weaken the averaged necc transports by about 26 30 under the current omip protocol the above two procedures are used together to force the ocean model resulting in a double counting of ocean surface current feedback on wind stress because the quikscat estimates the equivalent 10 m neutral winds relative to surface current we further systematically verify and investigate the impacts of this double counting of the ocean surface currents on the modeled pacific necc using offline linear sverdrup transport analysis in which the observational data of vector wind and surface current are used to calculate the surface wind stress it shows that including the ocean current in the bulk formula may reduce the zonal sverdrup transport zst by about 6 6 sv 33 and the further double counting of the ocean current leads to an additional reduction of 6 4 sv 48 next using perfect model experiments with output from a coupled ocean atmosphere model we further identify that the double counting of current feedback in the bulk formula results in approximately 21 weakened volume transport the built in nonlinear processes in the model such as the advection and friction terms may partly damp the reduction due to the double counting of the ocean current however the double counting bias can only explain 26 30 of the pacific necc simulation bias and the other part of the bias around 30 caused by the correction with quikscat has not been explained we speculate that this part may be explained by the retrieval biases in quikscat wind data and the use of annual mean climatological wind adjustment factors keywords pacific north equatorial countercurrent wind correction double counting bias 1 introduction the north equatorial countercurrent necc is an eastward upper ocean wind driven current located between 3 and 10 n in the tropical pacific ocean wyrtki and kendall 1967 donguy and meyers 1996 johnson et al 2002 the necc transports a significant amount about 10 30 sv of water out of the western pacific warm pool region to the relatively cold eastern pacific it plays an important role in maintaining the warm pool heat budget meyers and donguy 1984 picaut and delcroix 1995 clement et al 2005 chen et al 2016 so as to modulate the tropical pacific climate richards et al 2009 masunaga and l ecuyer 2011 tan and zhou 2018 the simulated necc in the stand alone ocean models participating in the second phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core ii seems to be generally weak tseng et al 2016 their figure 19 the mean zonal currents of the necc at 140 w in all 15 participating models is weaker than the observational value from johnson et al 2002 for the same time period this bias may potentially affect the simulated upper tropical pacific climatology and its seasonal and interannual variability sun et al 2019 suggested that the simulated necc biases are primarily due to the biases in the zonal surface wind stress and wind stress curl wsc wu et al 2012 introduced by the satellite quikscat based wind bias correction of the reanalysis surface wind a similar correction was also applied in the new forcing dataset jra55 do japanese 55 year reanalysis data for driving ocean sea ice models tsujino et al 2018 used in the recent ocean model intercomparison program phase 2 omip thus the next generation of forced ocean sea ice model experiments may potentially suffer from similar biases in the tropical pacific and it is necessary to investigate the fundamental causes so as to improve the existing wind correction procedure recent results from the omip 2 do show a weak necc though slightly stronger than that for omip 1 forced by the core ii forcing tsujino et al 2020 figure s44 for omip 1 and s45 for omip 2 the reanalysis dataset has its own bias and it is necessary to be corrected with scatterometer observations in order to improve the forcing wind field and the model results tsujino et al 2018 belmonte rivas and stoffelen 2019 but from the point of view of necc simulation the quikscat correction makes things worse the typical procedure used to correct 10 m reanalysis winds such as jra 55 with quikscat in a standard omip experiment is provided in fig 1 the surface wind stresses τ are derived from the bulk formula the magnitude and direction of the uncorrected reanalysis wind vector are adjusted by an offsetting factor δ w λ ϕ and a counter clockwise rotating factor χ λ ϕ respectively where λ and ϕ are longitude and latitude respectively these offsetting factors are computed in three phases 1958 1972 1973 1997 and 1998 present according to reference data the microwave scatterometer quikscat and radiometer ssm i table 6 in tsujino et al 2018 the first two periods 1958 1972 and 1973 1997 are corrected using the remote sensing systems ssm i wind speed data and the third period is corrected using the quikscat wind vector data the remote sensing systems ssm i wind was also adjusted relative to quikscat in nov 1999 oct 2009 tsujino et al 2018 therefore our discussion focuses on the third period during which the correction is directly related to quikscat here we address how the ocean currents and atmosphere winds are fed through the coupler and for simplicity we are ignoring other variables 10 m air temperature 10 m specific humidity sst etc in the flux computations which may also affect drag coefficient in fig 1 as described in tsujino et al 2018 the remote sensing systems quikscat ku 2011 daily ocean vector winds on 0 25 deg grid version 4 quikscat v 4 ricciardulli and wentz 2015 was used to correct the wind field of jra55 raw dataset and the atmospheric stability is the only factor considered when inverting quikscat v 4 wind field with empirically derived geophysical model function gmf although de kloe et al 2017 further considered air density in the process of inversion to improve the use of scatterometer measurements and make scatterometer winds best represented by so called stress equivalent 10 m winds the remote sensing systems quikscat product only estimates the equivalent 10 m neutral winds u 10 n liu and tang 1996 wentz and smith 1999 chelton et al 2001 and corresponding surface stresses liu and tang 1996 kelly et al 2001 therefore two possible sources of errors exist when the reanalysis actual 10 m winds are corrected towards the quikscat u 10 n first in the regions of an unstable air sea interface the neutral winds u 10 n are stronger than the actual winds typically by a few tens of cm s 1 liu and tang 1996 thus by adjusting the actual winds in the reanalysis towards the quikscat u 10 n the wind speed is spuriously increased in these unstable regions particularly in the tropics e g warm pool and western boundary currents in winter this potential source of error has already been taken into account in the new omip dataset tsujino et al 2018 in which the 10 m actual winds in jra55 reanalysis are converted to u 10 n before performing the wind correction after the wind correction the results are converted back to 10 m actual winds again to force the sea ice ocean models fig 1 second the quikscat surface winds u 10 n are a function of the air sea motion difference i e the relative wind kelly et al 2001 chelton et al 2004 the surface currents simulated by ocean models are usually fed into the surface bulk flux calculations to ensure the physical integrity of the atmosphere ocean coupling when dealing with forced ocean models cornillon and park 2002 kelly et al 2001 large and yeager 2004 hersbach and bidlot 2008 belmonte rivas and stoffelen 2019 that is the effect of surface currents has already been taken into account in the flux algorithm through u a u o where u a is 10 m actual wind and u o is ocean surface current therefore if the quikscat data is directly used to correct the reanalysis 10 m winds the impact of ocean surface current on the surface stress may be counted twice because the zonal surface winds are against the surface currents in the necc region on average the easterly trade winds will be spuriously enhanced leading to the change of wsc on both sides of pacific necc which can then affect the simulation of necc tsujino et al 2018 and renault et al 2020 have previously recognized the double counting effect of the current feedback to the atmosphere when forcing oceanic simulations however tsujino et al 2018 only gave a qualitative description of above mentioned double counting bias and renault et al 2020 mainly focused on the overall simulation of large scale circulation and mesoscale eddies between 45 s and 45 n not specifically in the necc region the specific comparison between their research and ours will be expanded in the discussion part the objective of the present paper is to evaluate the impact of satellite based wind corrections to the jra55 dataset on the simulation of the necc in ocean models specifically we investigate the impact of possibly double counting the influence of ocean currents in stress using numerical models and diagnostics other possible error sources introduced by quikscat wind correction are also discussed 2 datasets numerical experiments and methods 2 1 omip 2 forcing and observation datasets jra 55 is an atmospheric reanalysis dataset on the reduced tl319 55 km grid available from 1958 to present with 3h temporal resolution the current feedback cfb in the momentum coupling between ocean and atmosphere is not considered jma 2013 o neill et al 2015 to derive an appropriate forcing dataset for omip 2 the original jra 55 dataset has been adjusted see details in tsujino et al 2018 which is called jra55 do the atmospheric variables provided with the dataset include 10 m wind vector u a 10 m specific humidity 10 m air temperature sea level pressure precipitation snow downward shortwave downward longwave radiation and river runoff we use two versions of the jra55 do data in the present study jra55 do v1 1 downloadable from http amaterasu ees hokudai ac jp tsujino jra55 do v1 1 and jra55 do v1 3 downloadable from http amaterasu ees hokudai ac jp tsujino jra55 do v1 3 the plan of tsujino et al is to continually update its version using near real time updates to the raw jra55 reanalysis and the version number of jra55 do dataset will advance whenever new datasets or adjustment methods are incorporated version 1 3 is evolved from the version 1 1 and 1 2 with some changes to the wind field from version 1 1 to version 1 2 an error in computing the annual mean climatology of wind speed for jra55 do and a subset of jra55 do was corrected it resulted in minor less than 0 5 changes in the wind speed adjustment factors from version 1 2 to version 1 3 the same adjustment procedure is applied for the wind direction while minor differences exist in the wind speed adjustment the magnitude of the wind vector was adjusted by a multiplicative factor in version 1 2 whereas an offsetting factor was used for version 1 3 tsujino et al 2018 the variables from the unadjusted jra55 data called jra raw here are also used in this study to evaluate the model results we use in situ observations of ocean currents johnson et al 2002

acoustic doppler current profiler adcp data across the pacific have been used to construct the climatology of the upper 400 m zonal current in the equatorial pacific the johnson climatology was constructed primarily during the 1990s and contain ten meridional sections 143 e 156 e 165 e 180 e 170 w 155 w 140 w 125 w 110 w and 95 w missing values exist at certain depths and latitudes particularly the most western section 143 e johnson data are unusual in that they allow direct estimates of properties of the near equatorial currents especially including the measurement of tropical upper ocean current velocity the use of direct velocity data can allow inclusion of ageostrophic effects both around the equator and away from it for example the subsurface velocity maximum in the necc is the combination of the wind driven ekman layer and geostrophic shear a feature that geostrophic calculations alone would not resolve this dataset thus adds additional information to the longer record from mimoc which is based on geostrophy alone the salinity and temperature data from mimoc monthly isopycnal and mixed layer ocean climatology schmidtko et al 2013 downloadable from https www pmel noaa gov mimoc also have been used to evaluate the model results the monthly climatological mimoc data have been used to calculate the geostrophic currents in the upper 400 m in addition the ocean current from the soda 2 2 4 reanalysis giese and ray 2011 downloadable from http apdrc soest hawaii edu datadoc soda 2 2 4 php is used to compute the volume transport 2 2 numerical experiments the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 has been employed here a displaced north pole grid with a nominal 1 horizontal resolution meridional resolution increased to 0 27 near the equator is used in its ocean component parallel ocean program 2 pop2 pop2 has 60 vertical levels monotonically increasing from 10 m upper 150 m to 250 m in the deep ocean danabasoglu et al 2014 the atmospheric component of cesm2 is the version 6 0 of the community atmosphere model cam6 with a finite volume nominal resolution of 1 0 9 1 25 and 30 vertical levels the community ice code version 5 cice5 and the community land model version 5 clm5 are used in order to analyze the impacts of new forcing datasets and feedback of surface ocean current on the tropical ocean currents simulation two sets of experiments are designed in our research the first set contains four experiments table 1 i a standard ocean sea ice experiment pop2 coupled to cice5 forced by the uncorrected jra 55 forcing dataset the surface ocean current is included when calculating the surface wind stress τ referred to as the jra raw oc experiment hereinafter ii similar to the experiment i but the surface ocean current is not included when calculating the surface wind stress referred to as the jra raw nc experiment iii a standard ocean sea ice experiment forced by the corrected jra 55 forcing dataset version 1 1 the surface ocean current is included when calculating the surface wind stress referred to as the jra do oc experiment hereinafter iv similar to the experiment iii but the surface ocean current is not included when calculating the surface wind stress referred to as the jra do nc experiment these four pop2 experiments are all initialized with the january climatology in the world ocean atlas 2013 version 2 and run for two cycles 1958 to 2009 as mentioned above there are obvious differences in the wind correction between the first two and the third phase figure 10 and figure 11 in tsujino et al 2018 here the attention is paid to the phase iii wind correction only 1998 present during which the quikscat data has been employed to correct the surface wind the results from the period of 1998 2007 are used for the analysis we notice that the difference between corrected jra 55 jra55 do and uncorrected jra 55 is not just in wind but in all other variables such as temperature humidity etc according to sun et al 2019 the changes to wind forcing will be more important to necc than changes to other variables the second set of numerical experiments attempts to investigate the effect of double counting ocean currents on the necc simulation using both the fully coupled model and the ocean only model cesm2 and pop2 respectively three experiments have been conducted table 2 i a 140 year preindustrial control run of cesm2 hereafter to referred to as the cesm based on the 1850 greenhouse gas emissions the surface atmospheric variables from this experiment are saved hourly as forcing data for the additional two experiments ii a 10 year ocean sea ice coupled experiment forced by the last 10 years year 131 to 140 hourly atmospheric output of the coupled cesm hereafter referred to as the pop f starting from the end of 130th year iii same as ii pop f but in which the last 10 year mean ocean surface currents are subtracted from the lowest level atmospheric winds 50 m the top of the surface layer of the planetary boundary layer before computing the surface wind stresses to mimic the double counting process of the ocean current feedback in jra55 do data this experiment is called pop fs hereafter the last 10 years of these three experiments cesm pop f pop fs are analyzed it should be noted that ideally to be consistent with consideration of quikscat 10 m winds the mean surface currents should be subtracted from coupled model 10 m winds rather than the 50 m winds in the pop fs experiment however the software infrastructure in cesm made this option impractical 2 3 diagnostic analysis offline the necc transport can be estimated using the surface wind stress based on sverdrup s linear theory therefore we also estimated the impact of surface currents feedback using this offline alternative using the same bulk formula within the cesm large and yeager 2009 we can calculate the wind stress with and without the effects of surface ocean current and then estimate the corresponding sverdrup transports the atmospheric states are from the 3 hourly atmospheric jra55 raw data the ocean surface currents and the sea surface temperature are from 5 day ocean surface current analyses real time oscar data johnson et al 2007 downloadable from https podaac opendap jpl nasa gov opendap alldata oscar l4 oscar 1 deg and daily optimum interpolation sea surface

the wind stress is calculated referred to as the uo no experiment ii the surface ocean current is included once in the bulk formula referred to as the uo once experiment iii the surface ocean current is included twice in the bulk formula referred to as the uo twice experiment iv the main effects of the surface ocean current on the wind stress are quantified with a simplified bulk formula referred to as the uo only experiment the formulation details are provided in section 2 4 2 4 the effect of the current feedback on the wind stress the typical bulk formula calculating the surface wind stress ocean surface current included is as follows 1 τ ρ a c d n u a α u o u a α u o where ρ a is the near surface air density u a is the 10 m atmospheric wind vector u o is the ocean surface currents c d n is the drag coefficient calculated from the 10 m wind vector u a 10 m specific humidity 10 m air temperature sea level pressure and sea surface temperature α is the specified parameter controlling the inclusion of ocean surface current with three options i e 0 for the exp uo no 1 for the exp uo once and 2 for the exp uo twice here the sea level pressure is used to translate the 10 m air temperature to the 10 m potential temperature large and yeager 2009 the absolute value in eq 1 is computed as u a α u o u a α u o 2 v a α v o 2 according to jullien et al 2020 the effect of the ocean current

following kessler et al 2003 and sun et al 2019 the equation for the zonal transport is derived from momentum equations as follows 6 u 1 β x e b c u r l τ y d x u e b here τ τ a f p v t which represents surface wind stress τ advection a friction f horizontal pressure gradient p and the tendency of the horizontal ocean current terms v t respectively kessler et al 2003 among them a a x a y u h u ds represents the vertically integrated horizontal momentum flux f f x f y represents the boundary friction u e b is the transport at the eastern boundary eb the stream function form of eq 6 is used to compute u to avoid the uncertainties of the value of u e b as kessler et al 2003 7 u φ y φ 1 β x y x c u r l τ y d x is the stream function of vertically integrated volume transport the values of φ along the coast of the americas are assigned to 0 as in sun et al 2019 we integrate the total transport from the surface to 400 m comparable with 353 m used in kessler et al 2003 qualitatively similar results can be obtained when we integrate the upper 200 m this equation is also used to estimate the zonal transport of necc offline in which only the surface wind stresses are used to compute τ 3 results 3 1 the necc simulation in ocean sea ice coupled model forced by new jra55 do dataset to investigate the necc simulation in ocean sea ice coupled model forced by new jra55 dataset the zonal currents vertically integrated over the upper 400 m are compared in fig 2a d from four experiments jra raw oc jra raw nc jra do oc and jra do nc the eastward pacific necc between 3 and 10 n is accompanied by the westward north south equatorial current nec sec at its northern southern flank and the eastward equatorial undercurrent euc is located at the equator beneath the surface current the comparison indicates that both surface wind correction and considering ocean current in the bulk formula significantly weaken the pacific necc especially west of 120 w both jra do experiments exhibit a bias of weak necc similar to the core simulations by sun et al 2019 the volume transport of the necc defined as the meridional integration of upper 400 m eastward transports between 3 and 10 n is further estimated solid lines and compared with johnson climatology black dots fig 2e both the quikscat correction and whether or not the ocean currents are taken into account in the bulk formula significantly affect the simulation of necc the average zonal volume transports of necc for each experiment are shown in table 3 the quikscat correction leads to the necc transports weakened by 61 from 11 1 sv in the jra raw oc to 4 3 sv in the jra do oc and 60 from 15 0 sv in the jra raw nc to 6 1 sv in the jra do nc respectively the inclusion of the ocean current in the bulk formula weakens the average necc transports by 26 from 15 0 to 11 1 sv for the raw data jra raw nc and jra raw oc and 30 from 6 1 to 4 3 sv for corrected data jra do nc and jra do oc overall the effect of quikscat correction mainly comes from the differences between quikscat winds and the jra raw reanalysis winds and the effect of ocean current is also part of it the impacts of these two procedures are most evident west of 120 w we note that the zonal transport of pacific necc in the jra raw nc is closest to the observations however the bulk formula in the jra raw nc experiment is not consistent with the actual process of momentum transfer at the air sea interface because the ocean current should be considered in the wind stress calculation kelly et al 2001 cornillon and park 2002 large and yeager 2004 hersbach and bidlot 2008 by including the effect of the ocean currents in air sea momentum transfer the zonal transport of pacific necc is about 30 weaker in the jra raw oc than johnson s observation suggesting other factors in the jra raw reanalysis winds in addition to the quikscat correction may also contribute to the weak pacific necc in pop2 simulation in the present study we focus mainly on the impacts of forcing wind dataset corrected with quikscat to further confirm these impacts the geostrophic currents estimated from the mimoc data are compared with model results at three meridional vertical sections 180 e 140 w and 110 w fig 3 here the climatological zonal current of johnson climatology is also shown for comparison leftmost panel in fig 3 all modeled strengths of pacific necc over the whole pacific are much weaker than those estimated from mimoc the maximum velocity of pacific necc for mimoc is about 0 2 m s 1 0 3 m s 1 and 0 15 m s 1 at 180 e 140 w and 110 w respectively compared to modeled maximum velocities around 0 1 m s 1 at these three sections the same conclusion holds for different time spans for temporal averaging indicating the robustness of the above mentioned results fig 4 shows the wscs and corresponding zonal sverdrup transports zst in the four experiments based on jra forcing note the zst can be viewed as the direct impact of the surface wind stresses on the necc the eastward positive zsts between 3 n and 10 n are related to the necc while the eastward zsts along the equator are due to the euc we note that the weak euc in the jra55 raw numerical experiments are partly due to the bias of jra55 raw reanalysis dataset which has been improved in the jra55 do wind dataset and hence a stronger euc is obtained in the jra55 do numerical experiments the zsts from necc averaged over 150 e and 90 w for each experiment are shown in table 3 the quikscat wind correction weakened the necc induced zst 49 for oc experiments and 45 for nc experiments meanwhile the necc induced zst is also reduced by about 30 if the ocean current is taken into account in the bulk formula 30 for jra raw oc jra raw nc and 35 for jra do oc jra do nc these results are generally consistent with the reduction of total zst of necc shown in fig 2 but the actual contribution differs due to other nonlinear forcing terms for example the advection and friction terms rather than the wind itself sun et al 2019 two patches of maximum wsc can be found in the adjusted data on both sides of 7 n for jra do oc and jra do nc between 170 w and 130 w showing a zonal belt of positive wsc splitting into two parts in the itcz region however only one maximum center exists in the jra raw oc and jra raw nc datasets these wsc differences result from the wind correction procedure using the scatterometer equivalent neutral winds i e quikscat and have been identified in the core data figure 6a in sun et al 2019 the split branches of positive wsc in the itcz region are also clear in the climatological quikscat results figure 58 tsujino et al 2018 possibly resulting from the retrieval biases in quikscat wind data milliff et al 2004 kilpatrick and xie 2016 the cause and effect of this split require further investigation but are beyond the scope of this study it has been verified that the signature of surface ocean current is contained in the quikscat wind data figure 3 in kelly et al 2001 is there any surface current signal in the corrected forcing datasets fig 5 compares the 10 m zonal wind differences between different products with the data of johnson et al 2002 at six meridional sections 180 e 170 w 155 w 140 w 125 w 110 w for the observed surface ocean current data of johnson et al positive values exist between 3 n and 10 n and negative values south of 3 n black dashed lines representing the eastward necc and the westward sec respectively in all of these meridional sections a big offset can be found between the black solid line difference between jra55 raw and quikscat and dashed line observed surface zonal ocean current near the necc region 3 n 10 n this suggests large systematic errors beyond that related to the surface ocean current may exist in the jra55 raw wind for example the easterly wind in the jra55 raw is generally weak in the tropical pacific 180 e 140 w these systematic errors are universal for reanalysis datasets belmonte rivas and stoffelen 2019 and cannot be easily separated here the meridional profile of the zonal wind difference between jra55 raw and jra55 do v1 1 the blue solid line in fig 5 follows well with the meridional profile of the observed surface zonal ocean current the dashed line confirming the inclusion of surface ocean current in the corrected jra 55 data comparing with jra55 do v1 1 we only found small changes in the procedure of wind speed correction for jra55 do v1 3 tsujino et al 2018 also shown with the relatively small 10 m zonal wind difference between jra55 do v1 1 and jra55 do v1 3 in fig 5 the blue solid line aligning well with the red solid line 3 2 observation based analysis on the effect of double counting of ocean currents the previous section shows that the simulated neccs are generally weaker in the oc jra raw oc and jra do oc than the nc jra raw nc and jra do nc experiments note that because of the inclusion of ocean currents in quikscat data the surface currents are indeed double counted in the oc experiments forced by the quikscat corrected wind product we further evaluate this weakening impact on the necc from the perspective of linear sverdrup theory by using the observational data in the linear analysis three different types of bulk formulasfor the wind stresses eq 1 represent three different cases i e that of no ocean current feedback α 0 once counted ocean current feedback α 1 and double counted ocean current feedback α 2 then the effect of the ocean currents in the wind stress formula on the necc may be explicitly estimated using eq 5 fig 6 shows that the whole band of positive wsc is separated into two zonal bands branched at 9 n when the ocean current is taken into account compare fig 6c and e with fig 6a induced by the corresponding changes in the meridional gradient of the wsc c u r l τ y the necc is weakened with its axis being moved southward fig 6d and f the effects of ocean current feedback on the zst are analytically quantified in fig 6g and h from eq 5 a belt of negative meridional gradient of wsc c u r l τ y is shown and that of negative anomaly in the zst between 3 and 10 n near the pacific necc may well explain the reduction of the necc transport the zonal sverdrup transports zsts of necc averaged from 150 e to 90 w are 19 8 sv α 0 13 2 sv α 1 and 6 8 sv α 2 respectively table 4 here the zonal sverdrup transports of necc are defined as the meridional integration of the sverdrup transports between 3 n and 10 n note the relationship of the weakening of necc induced zonal sverdrup transports with the strength of ocean current feedback in the bulk formula α is nearly linear i e around 6 6 sv 33 from α 0 to α 1 13 2 sv and 6 4 sv from α 1 to α 2 respectively on the other hand the reduction of necc induced zst due to the surface current feedback estimated by eqs 5 and 6 is 6 9 sv basically consistent with the above mentioned estimates suggesting that it is reasonable to quantify the impact of ocean current on the necc simulation using eq 5 comparing this 6 9 sv reduction with the 6 5 sv reduction in the experiments forced by jra 55 data 21 7 sv in jra raw nc and 15 2 sv in jra raw oc respectively we believe the observation based offline experiments are generally consistent with above two jra raw numerical experiments 3 3 the effects of double counted surface ocean currents on the necc simulation in a perfect experiment we further quantify the impacts of double counted surface ocean currents within the bulk formula on the resulting necc simulation using a set of perfect cesm2 sensitivity experiments here perfect is meant by the internal consistency between the experiments and the exclusion of possible inconsistencies between the different data sources observational and or of reanalysis first a coupled simulation with the cesm2 under the preindustrial climate forcing is performed see section 2 1 for details then pop f a standard omip type experiment forced by the last 10 year atmospheric state of the coupled cesm2 simulation is performed similarly we further performed the pop fs experiment in which we subtract the last 10 year averaged surface currents of coupled cesm2 simulation from the lowest level winds of the cesm2 simulation before calculating the surface wind stresses which mimics the double counting process of the ocean current feedback in the jra55 do data fig 7a and b compare the meridional profiles of the mean zonal current at 180 e for pop f and pop fs experiments respectively the results from the coupled cesm2 simulation are not shown here since they are indistinguishable from the results from the pop f experiment the mean speed of necc in the pop fs is approximately 0 2 m s 1 about 0 1 m s 1 weaker than that in the pop f 0 3 m s 1 experiment similarly the sec and nec speeds are also reduced by around 0 1 m s 1 in the pop fs experiment while the euc is almost unaffected fig 7c and d show the zonal necc transports in pop f and pop fs respectively this depth integrated modeled zonal transport can be directly compared with the sverdrup transport both experiments have the maximum necc transports west of 150 w while the maximum necc transport over 60 m2 s 1 in the pop f is larger than that in the pop fs fig 7e compares the total transports of necc solid lines the necc transports in the cesm2 simulation and in the pop f experiment are nearly identical as expected due to the almost identical atmospheric forcing used in the two experiments it is apparent that the necc transport in the pop f 17 2 sv experiment is generally greater than that in the pop fs 13 6 sv within 150 e 90 w this suggests the necc is weakened by about 3 6sv around 21 if the surface ocean currents are calculated twice within the bulk formulation the above mentioned linear sverdrup analysis suggests the ocean current impacts are about 6 6 or 6 4 sv table 4 much stronger than 3 6 sv the difference between pop f and pop fs experiments the bigger ocean current impacts in linear sverdrup analysis may come from the inconsistencies between the different data sources used observational and or of reanalysis it is also possible that the built in nonlinear processes within the model partly damp the reduction of the necc transport due to the double counting we further compare the mean zonal wind stress zws wsc and the corresponding zst in the pop fs and pop f experiments fig 8 respectively with their differences pop fs minus pop f being presented at the bottom panel of fig 8 in the pop fs experiment the double counted surface ocean currents lead to a negative zws difference over 3 n 10 n just above necc and positive differences above the sec 6 s 3 n and nec 10 15 n regions fig 8g while the magnitudes of these zws anomalies are relatively small less than 10 compared with the wind stress itself but they may significantly affect the wsc via the meridional gradient of zws the changes of the zonal wind pattern reducing over the necc and increasing over the sec and nec result in positive wsc over 3 6 n and negative wsc over 6 14 n fig 8h and hence result in a belt of negative zonal sverdrup transport zst anomaly over the necc latitudes since the meridional gradient of the wsc c u r l τ y is the dominant term for the zst the necc transports averaged between 150 e and 90 w attributed by the wind differences are 20 1 sv and 14 2 sv for pop f and pop fs experiments and hence the double counting of the ocean surface current reduces the volume transport of necc by about 5 9 sv it should be noted that other processes such as the advection and diffusion processes tend to compensate the reduction caused by the wind stresses figures not shown and that these impacts are limited to the tropical region only no significant impacts are identified outside the tropical region even over the western boundary currents wbcs and antarctic circumpolar current acc figure s1 where the surface currents are as strong as those in the tropical pacific 4 summary and discussion in the present study we find that the weak necc identified in ocean model runs forced by core ii dataset for omip 1 still occurs when the new jra55 do dataset japanese 55 year reanalysis adjusted for driving ocean models for omip2 forcing data is used the simulated zonal transport is about 11 3 sv 72 weaker than the johnson observation 4 3 sv in jra do oc compared with 15 6 sv in the johnson observation the quikscat correction procedure and whether or not the modeled ocean current is considered in the bulk formula can significantly affect the pacific necc the quikscat correction weakens the averaged necc transports by about 60 taking the ocean currents into account in the bulk formula may weaken the averaged necc transports by about 26 30 the above two procedures are used together to force the ocean models in the ocean model intercomparison program omip currently and it will cause the bias of double counting current feedback when calculating the momentum budget wind stress in the bulk formula since the quikscat estimates the equivalent 10 m neutral winds relative to the motion of the ocean surface next we systematically verify and investigate the impacts of double counting the ocean surface currents on the modeled pacific necc using the typical surface wind stress bulk calculation and linear sverdrup transport analysis using observational data of wind and surface current confirms that including the ocean current in the bulk formula may reduce zst by around 6 6 sv 33 and the further double counting of the ocean current leads to an additional reduction of 6 4 sv 48 using the cesm2 numerical experiments we identify that the double counting in the bulk formula results in approximately 21 weakened volume transport the built in nonlinear processes in the model may partly damp the reduction due to the double counting of the ocean current it seems that the double counting effects of the current feedback is only evident in the equatorial pacific and no significant impacts are identified outside the tropical region in our coarse resolution model experiments 1 even over the western boundary currents wbcs and antarctic circumpolar current acc figure s1 where the surface currents are as strong as those in the tropical pacific although the quikscat correction weakens the averaged necc transports significantly the bias correction of jra55 raw reanalysis winds using scatterometer dataset is also required to improve the global simulation tsujino et al 2018 has compared the equivalent neutral 10 m wind speeds zonally averaged over the ocean of jra55 raw and quikscat datasets in their figure 12 and found there is a big difference between them reaching around 0 5 m s at 50 s renault et al 2020 have recently analyzed the recipes for how to force oceanic model dynamics with different existing datasets both the reanalysis and scatterometer equivalent neutral winds on the large scale circulation and mesoscale eddies between 45 s and 45 n with a series of numerical experiments they do not conduct exactly the same experiments as the present study and their focus was on ocean eddy energetics not countercurrents having said that their experiments to mimic forcing ocean model using scatterometer equivalent neutral winds experiments sc c f b w a b s and sc c f b w r e l can be partially compared with our experiments jra do nc and jra do oc respectively and the experiments r n o c f b w a b s and r n o c f b w r e l are comparable with our experiments jra raw nc and jra raw oc respectively the cfb effects were both double counted in experiment sc c f b w r e l and jra do oc they found that the double counting of the surface current will also lead to the reduction of the area averaged large scale circulation but only by about 5 10 the reduction of necc in the present study was around one third 26 30 it possibly can be explained by what they measure is a mean value of a larger meridional extent between 45 s and 45 n not only just in the necc region in addition the experiments of pop f and pop fs are also comparable with experiments r c f b w r e l and sc c f b w r e l in renault et al 2020 respectively one alternative to approximate the absolute winds and solve the double counting bias in necc simulation was proposed in tsujino et al 2018 and renault et al 2020 who added the surface current climatology to the corrected jra 55 winds jra55 do this addition method is similar to renault et al s 2020 experiment r cfb w rel and the global large scale ocean circulation is reasonably simulated figure 11 of renault et al 2020 experiment r cfb w rel means forcing the ocean model with reanalysis like produced data with the cfb and considering the surface current in the bulk formula without current feedback parameterization however the improvement of pacific necc simulation with this method may be limited because the double counting bias can only explain 26 30 of the pacific necc simulation bias and the other part of this bias around 30 caused by the correction with quikscat has not been explained we notice this part of quikscat corrected necc simulation bias may be explained by the retrieval biases in quikscat wind data and the use of annual mean climatological wind adjustment factors weissman et al 2002 milliff et al 2004 risien and chelton 2008 o neill et al 2015 chen and fu 2017 king et al 2017 kilpatrick and xie 2016 xu and stoffelen 2020 one possible alternative is to replace quikscat with advanced scatterometer ascat dataset when correcting the jra55 raw wind field stoffelen et al 2019 wang et al 2019 bentamy et al 2012 compared ascat and quikscat surface winds during the overlap period and found a positive zonal strip of the difference between collocated quikscat and ascat wind speed quikscat minus ascat located at tropical pacific particularly figure 3a in bentamy et al 2012 their results suggested that the quikscat derived wind speed is greater than the ascat which may form an artificial negative positive wsc on the north south side of this zonal strip and lead to the negative meridional gradient of wsc and weak

23891,bias correction of reanalysis based wind stress using scatterometer derived equivalent neutral wind has been a common practice in producing the forcing datasets used in recent global ocean model intercomparisons omips here we systematically evaluate the effect of this wind correction procedure on the simulation of the pacific north equatorial countercurrent necc with multiple sets of model experiments the weak necc evident in earlier omips employing the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments cores forcing dataset persists with the new jra55 do japanese 55 year reanalysis forcing dataset two factors appear to significantly affect the pacific necc in forced ocean simulations i the bias correction procedure using quikscat derived winds and ii whether or not the ocean current is considered in the bulk formula in the forced ocean simulations the quikscat correction weakens the averaged necc transports by about 60 taking the ocean currents into account in the bulk formula may weaken the averaged necc transports by about 26 30 under the current omip protocol the above two procedures are used together to force the ocean model resulting in a double counting of ocean surface current feedback on wind stress because the quikscat estimates the equivalent 10 m neutral winds relative to surface current we further systematically verify and investigate the impacts of this double counting of the ocean surface currents on the modeled pacific necc using offline linear sverdrup transport analysis in which the observational data of vector wind and surface current are used to calculate the surface wind stress it shows that including the ocean current in the bulk formula may reduce the zonal sverdrup transport zst by about 6 6 sv 33 and the further double counting of the ocean current leads to an additional reduction of 6 4 sv 48 next using perfect model experiments with output from a coupled ocean atmosphere model we further identify that the double counting of current feedback in the bulk formula results in approximately 21 weakened volume transport the built in nonlinear processes in the model such as the advection and friction terms may partly damp the reduction due to the double counting of the ocean current however the double counting bias can only explain 26 30 of the pacific necc simulation bias and the other part of the bias around 30 caused by the correction with quikscat has not been explained we speculate that this part may be explained by the retrieval biases in quikscat wind data and the use of annual mean climatological wind adjustment

al 2005 chen et al 2016 so as to modulate the tropical pacific climate richards et al 2009 masunaga and l ecuyer 2011 tan and zhou 2018 the simulated necc in the stand alone ocean models participating in the second phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core ii seems to be generally weak tseng et al 2016 their figure 19 the mean zonal currents of the necc at 140 w in all 15 participating models is weaker than the observational value from johnson et al 2002 for the same time period this bias may potentially affect the simulated upper tropical pacific climatology and its seasonal and interannual variability sun et al 2019 suggested that the simulated necc biases are primarily due to the biases in the zonal surface wind stress and wind stress curl wsc wu et al 2012 introduced by the satellite quikscat based wind bias correction of the reanalysis surface wind a similar correction was also applied in the new forcing dataset jra55 do japanese 55 year reanalysis data for driving ocean sea ice models tsujino et al 2018 used in the recent ocean model intercomparison program phase 2 omip thus the next generation of forced ocean sea ice model experiments may potentially suffer from similar biases in the tropical pacific and it is necessary to investigate the fundamental causes so as to improve the existing wind correction procedure recent results from the omip 2 do show a weak necc though slightly stronger than that for omip 1 forced by the core ii forcing tsujino et al 2020 figure s44 for omip 1 and s45 for omip 2 the reanalysis dataset has its own bias and it is necessary to be corrected with scatterometer observations in order to improve the forcing wind field and the model results tsujino et al 2018 belmonte rivas and stoffelen 2019 but from the point of view of necc simulation the quikscat correction makes things worse the typical procedure used to correct 10 m reanalysis winds such as jra 55 with quikscat in a standard omip experiment is provided in fig 1 the surface wind stresses τ are derived from the bulk formula the magnitude and direction of the uncorrected reanalysis wind vector are adjusted by an offsetting factor δ w λ ϕ and a counter clockwise rotating factor χ λ ϕ respectively where λ and ϕ are longitude and latitude respectively these offsetting factors are computed in three phases 1958 1972 1973 1997 and 1998 present according to reference data the microwave scatterometer quikscat and radiometer ssm i table 6 in tsujino et al 2018 the first two periods 1958 1972 and 1973 1997 are corrected using the remote sensing systems ssm i wind speed data and the third period is corrected using the quikscat wind vector data the remote sensing systems ssm i wind was also adjusted relative to quikscat in nov 1999 oct 2009 tsujino et al 2018 therefore our discussion focuses on the third period during which the correction is directly related to quikscat here we address how the ocean currents and atmosphere winds are fed through the coupler and for simplicity we are ignoring other variables 10 m air temperature 10 m specific humidity sst etc in the flux computations which may also affect drag coefficient in fig 1 as described in tsujino et al 2018 the remote sensing systems quikscat ku 2011 daily ocean vector winds on 0 25 deg grid version 4 quikscat v 4 ricciardulli and wentz 2015 was used to correct the wind field of jra55 raw dataset and the atmospheric stability is the only factor considered when inverting quikscat v 4 wind field with empirically derived geophysical model function gmf although de kloe et al 2017 further considered air density in the process of inversion to improve the use of scatterometer measurements and make scatterometer winds best represented by so called stress equivalent 10 m winds the remote sensing systems quikscat product only estimates the equivalent 10 m neutral winds u 10 n liu and tang 1996 wentz and smith 1999 chelton et al 2001 and corresponding surface stresses liu and tang 1996 kelly et al 2001 therefore two possible sources of errors exist when the reanalysis actual 10 m winds are corrected towards the quikscat u 10 n first in the regions of an unstable air sea interface the neutral winds u 10 n are stronger than the actual winds typically by a few tens of cm s 1 liu and tang 1996 thus by adjusting the actual winds in the reanalysis towards the quikscat u 10 n the wind speed is spuriously increased in these unstable regions particularly in the tropics e g warm pool and western boundary currents in winter this potential source of error has already been taken into account in the new omip dataset tsujino et al 2018 in which the 10 m actual winds in jra55 reanalysis are converted to u 10 n before performing the wind correction after the wind correction the results are converted back to 10 m actual winds again to force the sea ice ocean models fig 1 second the quikscat surface winds u 10 n are a function of the air sea motion difference i e the relative wind kelly et al 2001 chelton et al 2004 the surface currents simulated by ocean models are usually fed into the surface bulk flux calculations to ensure the physical integrity of the atmosphere ocean coupling when dealing with forced ocean models cornillon and park 2002 kelly et al 2001 large and yeager 2004 hersbach and bidlot 2008 belmonte rivas and stoffelen 2019 that is the effect of surface currents has already been taken into account in the flux algorithm through u a u o where u a is 10 m actual wind and u o is ocean surface current therefore if the quikscat data is directly used to correct the reanalysis 10 m winds the impact of ocean surface current on the surface stress may be counted twice because the zonal surface winds are against the surface currents in the necc region on average the easterly trade winds will be spuriously enhanced leading to the change of wsc on both sides of pacific necc which can then affect the simulation of necc tsujino et al 2018 and renault et al 2020 have previously recognized the double counting effect of the current feedback to the atmosphere when forcing oceanic simulations however tsujino et al 2018 only gave a qualitative description of above mentioned double counting bias and renault et al 2020 mainly focused on the overall simulation of large scale circulation and mesoscale eddies between 45 s and 45 n not specifically in the necc region the specific comparison between their research and ours will be expanded in the discussion part the objective of the present paper is to evaluate the impact of satellite based wind corrections to the jra55 dataset on the simulation of the necc in ocean models specifically we investigate the impact of possibly double counting the influence of ocean currents in stress using numerical models and diagnostics other possible error sources introduced by quikscat wind correction are also discussed 2 datasets numerical experiments and methods 2 1 omip 2 forcing and observation datasets jra 55 is an atmospheric reanalysis dataset on the reduced tl319 55 km grid available from 1958 to present with 3h temporal resolution the current feedback cfb in the momentum coupling between ocean and atmosphere is not considered jma 2013 o neill et al 2015 to derive an appropriate forcing dataset for omip 2 the original jra 55 dataset has been adjusted see details in tsujino et al 2018 which is called jra55 do the atmospheric variables provided with the dataset include 10 m wind vector u a 10 m specific humidity 10 m air temperature sea level pressure precipitation snow downward shortwave downward longwave radiation and river runoff we use two versions of the jra55 do data in the present study jra55 do v1 1 downloadable from http amaterasu ees hokudai ac jp tsujino jra55 do v1 1 and jra55 do v1 3 downloadable from http amaterasu ees hokudai ac jp tsujino jra55 do v1 3 the plan of tsujino et al is to continually update its version using near real time updates to the raw jra55 reanalysis and the version number of jra55 do dataset will advance whenever new datasets or adjustment methods are incorporated version 1 3 is evolved from the version 1 1 and 1 2 with some changes to the wind field from version 1 1 to version 1 2 an error in computing the annual mean climatology of wind speed for jra55 do and a subset of jra55 do was corrected it resulted in minor less than 0 5 changes in the wind speed adjustment factors from version 1 2 to version 1 3 the same adjustment procedure is applied for the wind direction while minor differences exist in the wind speed adjustment the magnitude of the wind vector was adjusted by a multiplicative factor in version 1 2 whereas an offsetting factor was used for version 1 3 tsujino et al 2018 the variables from the unadjusted jra55 data called jra raw here are also used in this study to evaluate the model results we use in situ observations of ocean currents johnson et al 2002 downloadable from https floats pmel noaa gov gregory c johnson home page referred to as johnson climatology hereafter meridional sections of contemporaneous conductivity temperature depth ctd and acoustic doppler current profiler adcp data across the pacific have been used to construct the climatology of the upper 400 m zonal current in the equatorial pacific the johnson climatology was constructed primarily during the 1990s and contain ten meridional sections 143 e 156 e 165 e 180 e 170 w 155 w 140 w 125 w 110 w and 95 w missing values exist at certain depths and latitudes particularly the most western section 143 e johnson data are unusual in that they allow direct estimates of properties of the near equatorial currents especially including the measurement of tropical upper ocean current velocity the use of direct velocity data can allow inclusion of ageostrophic effects both around the equator and away from it for example the subsurface velocity maximum in the necc is the combination of the wind driven ekman layer and geostrophic shear a feature that geostrophic calculations alone would not resolve this dataset thus adds additional information to the longer record from mimoc which is based on geostrophy alone the salinity and temperature data from mimoc monthly isopycnal and mixed layer ocean climatology schmidtko et al 2013 downloadable from https www pmel noaa gov mimoc also have been used to evaluate the model results the monthly climatological mimoc data have been used to calculate the geostrophic currents in the upper 400 m in addition the ocean current from the soda 2 2 4 reanalysis giese and ray 2011 downloadable from http apdrc soest hawaii edu datadoc soda 2 2 4 php is used to compute the volume transport 2 2 numerical experiments the community earth system model version 2 cesm2 has been employed here a displaced north pole grid with a nominal 1 horizontal resolution meridional resolution increased to 0 27 near the equator is used in its ocean component parallel ocean program 2 pop2 pop2 has 60 vertical levels monotonically increasing from 10 m upper 150 m to 250 m in the deep ocean danabasoglu et al 2014 the atmospheric component of cesm2 is the version 6 0 of the community atmosphere model cam6 with a finite volume nominal resolution of 1 0 9 1 25 and 30 vertical levels the community ice code version 5 cice5 and the community land model version 5 clm5 are used in order to analyze the impacts of new forcing datasets and feedback of surface ocean current on the tropical ocean currents simulation two sets of experiments are designed in our research the first set contains four experiments table 1 i a standard ocean sea ice experiment pop2 coupled to cice5 forced by the uncorrected jra 55 forcing dataset the surface ocean current is included when calculating the surface wind stress τ referred to as the jra raw oc experiment hereinafter ii similar to the experiment i but the surface ocean current is not included when calculating the surface wind stress referred to as the jra raw nc experiment iii a standard ocean sea ice experiment forced by the corrected jra 55 forcing dataset version 1 1 the surface ocean current is included when calculating the surface wind stress referred to as the jra do oc experiment hereinafter iv similar to the experiment iii but the surface ocean current is not included when calculating the surface wind stress referred to as the jra do nc experiment these four pop2 experiments are all initialized with the january climatology in the world ocean atlas 2013 version 2 and run for two cycles 1958 to 2009 as mentioned above there are obvious differences in the wind correction between the first two and the third phase figure 10 and figure 11 in tsujino et al 2018 here the attention is paid to the phase iii wind correction only 1998 present during which the quikscat data has been employed to correct the surface wind the results from the period of 1998 2007 are used for the analysis we notice that the difference between corrected jra 55 jra55 do and uncorrected jra 55 is not just in wind but in all other variables such as temperature humidity etc according to sun et al 2019 the changes to wind forcing will be more important to necc than changes to other variables the second set of numerical experiments attempts to investigate the effect of double counting ocean currents on the necc simulation using both the fully coupled model and the ocean only model cesm2 and pop2 respectively three experiments have been conducted table 2 i a 140 year preindustrial control run of cesm2 hereafter to referred to as the cesm based on the 1850 greenhouse gas emissions the surface atmospheric variables from this experiment are saved hourly as forcing data for the additional two experiments ii a 10 year ocean sea ice coupled experiment forced by the last 10 years year 131 to 140 hourly atmospheric output of the coupled cesm hereafter referred to as the pop f starting from the end of 130th year iii same as ii pop f but in which the last 10 year mean ocean surface currents are subtracted from the lowest level atmospheric winds 50 m the top of the surface layer of the planetary boundary layer before computing the surface wind stresses to mimic the double counting process of the ocean current feedback in jra55 do data this experiment is called pop fs hereafter the last 10 years of these three experiments cesm pop f pop fs are analyzed it should be noted that ideally to be consistent with consideration of quikscat 10 m winds the mean surface currents should be subtracted from coupled model 10 m winds rather than the 50 m winds in the pop fs experiment however the software infrastructure in cesm made this option impractical 2 3 diagnostic analysis offline the necc transport can be estimated using the surface wind stress based on sverdrup s linear theory therefore we also estimated the impact of surface currents feedback using this offline alternative using the same bulk formula within the cesm large and yeager 2009 we can calculate the wind stress with and without the effects of surface ocean current and then estimate the corresponding sverdrup transports the atmospheric states are from the 3 hourly atmospheric jra55 raw data the ocean surface currents and the sea surface temperature are from 5 day ocean surface current analyses real time oscar data johnson et al 2007 downloadable from https podaac opendap jpl nasa gov opendap alldata oscar l4 oscar 1 deg and daily optimum interpolation sea surface temperature oisst v2 0 data reynolds et al 2007 downloadable from https www ncdc noaa gov oisst four experiments are designed here i the surface ocean current is not included in the bulk formula when the wind stress is calculated referred to as the uo no experiment ii the surface ocean current is included once in the bulk formula referred to as the uo once experiment iii the surface ocean current is included twice in the bulk formula referred to as the uo twice experiment iv the main effects of the surface ocean current on the wind stress are quantified with a simplified bulk formula referred to as the uo only experiment the formulation details are provided in section 2 4 2 4 the effect of the current feedback on the wind stress the typical bulk formula calculating the surface wind stress ocean surface current included is as follows 1 τ ρ a c d n u a α u o u a α u o where ρ a is the near surface air density u a is the 10 m atmospheric wind vector u o is the ocean surface currents c d n is the drag coefficient calculated from the 10 m wind vector u a 10 m specific humidity 10 m air temperature sea level pressure and sea surface temperature α is the specified parameter controlling the inclusion of ocean surface current with three options i e 0 for the exp uo no 1 for the exp uo once and 2 for the exp uo twice here the sea level pressure is used to translate the 10 m air temperature to the 10 m potential temperature large and yeager 2009 the absolute value in eq 1 is computed as u a α u o u a α u o 2 v a α v o 2 according to jullien et al 2020 the effect of the ocean current feedback on the wind stress exp uo only can be explicitly derived from eq 1 2 τ u o o n l y ρ a c d n u a u o u a u o ρ a c d n u a u a considering u a u o it follows that 3 u a u o u a 2 2 u a u o c

u o c o s θ u a u o u a u a ρ a c d n u a u o u a u o c o s θ 2 5 zonal transport of necc to understand the dynamics of necc in these experiments the annual mean vorticity balance is calculated following kessler et al 2003 and sun et al 2019 the equation for the zonal transport is derived from momentum equations as follows 6 u 1 β x e b c u r l τ y d x u e b here τ τ a f p v t which represents surface wind stress τ advection a friction f horizontal pressure gradient p and the tendency of the horizontal ocean current terms v t respectively kessler et al 2003 among them a a x a y u h u ds represents the vertically integrated horizontal momentum flux f f x f y represents the boundary friction u e b is the transport at the eastern boundary eb the stream function form of eq 6 is used to compute u to avoid the uncertainties of the value of u e b as kessler et al 2003 7 u φ y φ 1 β x y x c u r l τ y d x is the stream function of vertically integrated volume transport the values of φ along the coast of the americas are assigned to 0 as in sun et al 2019 we integrate the total transport from the surface to 400 m comparable with 353 m used in kessler et al 2003 qualitatively similar results can be obtained when we integrate the upper 200 m this equation is also used to estimate the zonal transport of necc offline in which only the surface wind stresses are used to compute τ 3 results 3 1 the necc simulation in ocean sea ice coupled model forced by new jra55 do dataset to investigate the necc simulation in ocean sea ice coupled model forced by new jra55 dataset the zonal currents vertically integrated over the upper 400 m are compared in fig 2a d from four experiments jra raw oc jra raw nc jra do oc and jra do nc the eastward pacific necc between 3 and 10 n is accompanied by the westward north south equatorial current nec sec at its northern southern flank and the eastward equatorial undercurrent euc is located at the equator beneath the surface current the comparison indicates that both surface wind correction and considering ocean current in the bulk formula significantly weaken the pacific necc especially west of 120 w both jra do experiments exhibit a bias of weak necc similar to the core simulations by sun et al 2019 the volume transport of the necc defined as the meridional integration of upper 400 m eastward transports between 3 and 10 n is further estimated solid lines and compared with johnson climatology black dots fig 2e both the quikscat correction and whether or not the ocean currents are taken into account in the bulk formula significantly affect the simulation of necc the average zonal volume transports of necc for each experiment are shown in table 3 the quikscat correction leads to the necc transports weakened by 61 from 11 1 sv in the jra raw oc to 4 3 sv in the jra do oc and 60 from 15 0 sv in the jra raw nc to 6 1 sv in the jra do nc respectively the inclusion of the ocean current in the bulk formula weakens the average necc transports by 26 from 15 0 to 11 1 sv for the raw data jra raw nc and jra raw oc and 30 from 6 1 to 4 3 sv for corrected data jra do nc and jra do oc overall the effect of quikscat correction mainly comes from the differences between quikscat winds and the jra raw reanalysis winds and the effect of ocean current is also part of it the impacts of these two procedures are most evident west of 120 w we note that the zonal transport of pacific necc in the jra raw nc is closest to the observations however the bulk formula in the jra raw nc experiment is not consistent with the actual process of momentum transfer at the air sea interface because the ocean current should be considered in the wind stress calculation kelly et al 2001 cornillon and park 2002 large and yeager 2004 hersbach and bidlot 2008 by including the effect of the ocean currents in air sea momentum transfer the zonal transport of pacific necc is about 30 weaker in the jra raw oc than johnson s observation suggesting other factors in the jra raw reanalysis winds in addition to the quikscat correction may also contribute to the weak pacific necc in pop2 simulation in the present study we focus mainly on the impacts of forcing wind dataset corrected with quikscat to further confirm these impacts the geostrophic currents estimated from the mimoc data are compared with model results at three meridional vertical sections 180 e 140 w and 110 w fig 3 here the climatological zonal current of johnson climatology is also shown for comparison leftmost panel in fig 3 all modeled strengths of pacific necc over the whole pacific are much weaker than those estimated from mimoc the maximum velocity of pacific necc for mimoc is about 0 2 m s 1 0 3 m s 1 and 0 15 m s 1 at 180 e 140 w and 110 w respectively compared to modeled maximum velocities around 0 1 m s 1 at these three sections the same conclusion holds for different time spans for temporal averaging indicating the robustness of the above mentioned results fig 4 shows the wscs and corresponding zonal sverdrup transports zst in the four experiments based on jra forcing note the zst can be viewed as the direct impact of the surface wind stresses on the necc the eastward positive zsts between 3 n and 10 n are related to the necc while the eastward zsts along the equator are due to the euc we note that the weak euc in the jra55 raw numerical experiments are partly due to the bias of jra55 raw reanalysis dataset which has been improved in the jra55 do wind dataset and hence a stronger euc is obtained in the jra55 do numerical experiments the zsts from necc averaged over 150 e and 90 w for each experiment are shown in table 3 the quikscat wind correction weakened the necc induced zst 49 for oc experiments and 45 for nc experiments meanwhile the necc induced zst is also reduced by about 30 if the ocean current is taken into account in the bulk formula 30 for jra raw oc jra raw nc and 35 for jra do oc jra do nc these results are generally consistent with the reduction of total zst of necc shown in fig 2 but the actual contribution differs due to other nonlinear forcing terms for example the advection and friction terms rather than the wind itself sun et al 2019 two patches of maximum wsc can be found in the adjusted data on both sides of 7 n for jra do oc and jra do nc between 170 w and 130 w showing a zonal belt of positive wsc splitting into two parts in the itcz region however only one maximum center exists in the jra raw oc and jra raw nc datasets these wsc differences result from the wind correction procedure using the scatterometer equivalent neutral winds i e quikscat and have been identified in the core data figure 6a in sun et al 2019 the split branches of positive wsc in the itcz region are also clear in the climatological quikscat results figure 58 tsujino et al 2018 possibly resulting from the retrieval biases in quikscat wind data milliff et al 2004 kilpatrick and xie 2016 the cause and effect of this split require further investigation but are beyond the scope of this study it has been verified that the signature of surface ocean current is contained in the quikscat wind data figure 3 in kelly et al 2001 is there any surface current signal in the corrected forcing datasets fig 5 compares the 10 m zonal wind differences between different products with the data of johnson et al 2002 at six meridional sections 180 e 170 w 155 w 140 w 125 w 110 w for the observed surface ocean current data of johnson et al positive values exist between 3 n and 10 n and negative values south of 3 n black dashed lines representing the eastward necc and the westward sec respectively in all of these meridional sections a big offset can be found between the black solid line difference between jra55 raw and quikscat and dashed line observed surface zonal ocean current near the necc region 3 n 10 n this suggests large systematic errors beyond that related to the surface ocean current may exist in the jra55 raw wind for example the easterly wind in the jra55 raw is generally weak in the tropical pacific 180 e 140 w these systematic errors are universal for reanalysis datasets belmonte rivas and stoffelen 2019 and cannot be easily separated here the meridional profile of the zonal wind difference between jra55 raw and jra55 do v1 1 the blue solid line in fig 5 follows well with the meridional profile of the observed surface zonal ocean current the dashed line confirming the inclusion of surface ocean current in the corrected jra 55 data comparing with jra55 do v1 1 we only found small changes in the procedure of wind speed correction for jra55 do v1 3 tsujino et al 2018 also shown with the relatively small 10 m zonal wind difference between jra55 do v1 1 and jra55 do v1 3 in fig 5 the blue solid line aligning well with the red solid line 3 2 observation based analysis on the effect of double counting of ocean currents the previous section shows that the simulated neccs are generally weaker in the oc jra raw oc and jra do oc than the nc jra raw nc and jra do nc experiments note that because of the inclusion of ocean currents in quikscat data the surface currents are indeed double counted in the oc experiments forced by the quikscat corrected wind product we further evaluate this weakening impact on the necc from the perspective of linear sverdrup theory by using the observational data in the linear analysis three different types of bulk formulasfor the wind stresses eq 1 represent three different cases i e that of no ocean current feedback α 0 once counted ocean current feedback α 1 and double counted ocean current feedback α 2 then the effect of the ocean currents in the wind stress formula on the necc may be explicitly estimated using eq 5 fig 6 shows that the whole band of positive wsc is separated into two zonal bands branched at 9 n when the ocean current is taken into account compare fig 6c and e with fig 6a induced by the corresponding changes in the meridional gradient of the wsc c u r l τ y the necc is weakened with its axis being moved southward fig 6d and f the effects of ocean current feedback on the zst are analytically quantified in fig 6g and h from eq 5 a belt of negative meridional gradient of wsc c u r l τ y is shown and that of negative anomaly in the zst between 3 and 10 n near the pacific necc may well explain the reduction of the necc transport the zonal sverdrup transports zsts of necc averaged from 150 e to 90 w are 19 8 sv α 0 13 2 sv α 1 and 6 8 sv α 2 respectively table 4 here the zonal sverdrup transports of necc are defined as the meridional integration of the sverdrup transports between 3 n and 10 n note the relationship of the weakening of necc induced zonal sverdrup transports with the strength of ocean current feedback in the bulk formula α is nearly linear i e around 6 6 sv 33 from α 0 to α 1 13 2 sv and 6 4 sv from α 1 to α 2 respectively on the other hand the reduction of necc induced zst due to the surface current feedback estimated by eqs 5 and 6 is 6 9 sv basically consistent with the above mentioned estimates suggesting that it is reasonable to quantify the impact of ocean current on the necc simulation using eq 5 comparing this 6 9 sv reduction with the 6 5 sv reduction in the experiments forced by jra 55 data 21 7 sv in jra raw nc and 15 2 sv in jra raw oc respectively we believe the observation based offline experiments are generally consistent with above two jra raw numerical experiments 3 3 the effects of double counted surface ocean currents on the necc simulation in a perfect experiment we further quantify the impacts of double counted surface ocean currents within the bulk formula on the resulting necc simulation using a set of perfect cesm2 sensitivity experiments here perfect is meant by the internal consistency between the experiments and the exclusion of possible inconsistencies between the different data sources observational and or of reanalysis first a coupled simulation with the cesm2 under the preindustrial climate forcing is performed see section 2 1 for details then pop f a standard omip type experiment forced by the last 10 year atmospheric state of the coupled cesm2 simulation is performed similarly we further performed the pop fs experiment in which we subtract the last 10 year averaged surface currents of coupled cesm2 simulation from the lowest level winds of the cesm2 simulation before calculating the surface wind stresses which mimics the double counting process of the ocean current feedback in the jra55 do data fig 7a and b compare the meridional profiles of the mean zonal current at 180 e for pop f and pop fs experiments respectively the results from the coupled cesm2 simulation are not shown here since they are indistinguishable from the results from the pop f experiment the mean speed of necc in the pop fs is approximately 0 2 m s 1 about 0 1 m s 1 weaker than that in the pop f 0 3 m s 1 experiment similarly the sec and nec speeds are also reduced by around 0 1 m s 1 in the pop fs experiment while the euc is almost unaffected fig 7c and d show the zonal necc transports in pop f and pop fs respectively this depth integrated modeled zonal transport can be directly compared with the sverdrup transport both experiments have the maximum necc transports west of 150 w while the maximum necc transport over 60 m2 s 1 in the pop f is larger than that in the pop fs fig 7e compares the total transports of necc solid lines the necc transports in the cesm2 simulation and in the pop f experiment are nearly identical as expected due to the almost identical atmospheric forcing used in the two experiments it is apparent that the necc transport in the pop f 17 2 sv experiment is generally greater than that in the pop fs 13 6 sv within 150 e 90 w this suggests the necc is weakened by about 3 6sv around 21 if the surface ocean currents are calculated twice within the bulk formulation the above mentioned linear sverdrup analysis suggests the ocean current impacts are about 6 6 or 6 4 sv table 4 much stronger than 3 6 sv the difference between pop f and pop fs experiments the bigger ocean current impacts in linear sverdrup analysis may come from the inconsistencies between the different data sources used observational and or of reanalysis it is also possible that the built in nonlinear processes within the model partly damp the reduction of the necc transport due to the double counting we further compare the mean zonal wind stress zws wsc and the corresponding zst in the pop fs and pop f experiments fig 8 respectively with their differences pop fs minus pop f being presented at the bottom panel of fig 8 in the pop fs experiment the double counted surface ocean currents lead to a negative zws difference over 3 n 10 n just above necc and positive differences above the sec 6 s 3 n and nec 10 15 n regions fig 8g while the magnitudes of these zws anomalies are relatively small less than 10 compared with the wind stress itself but they may significantly affect the wsc via the meridional gradient of zws the changes of the zonal wind pattern reducing over the necc and increasing over the sec and nec result in positive wsc over 3 6 n and negative wsc over 6 14 n fig 8h and hence result in a belt of negative zonal sverdrup transport zst anomaly over the necc latitudes since the meridional gradient of the wsc c u r l τ y is the dominant term for the zst the necc transports averaged between 150 e and 90 w attributed by the wind differences are 20 1 sv and 14 2 sv for pop f and pop fs experiments and hence the double counting of the ocean surface current reduces the volume transport of necc by about 5 9 sv it should be noted that other processes such as the advection and diffusion processes tend to compensate the reduction caused by the wind stresses figures not shown and that these impacts are limited to the tropical region only no significant impacts are identified outside the tropical region even over the western boundary currents wbcs and antarctic circumpolar current acc figure s1 where the surface currents are as strong as those in the tropical pacific 4 summary and discussion in the present study we find that the weak necc identified in ocean model runs forced by core ii dataset for omip 1 still occurs when the new jra55 do dataset japanese 55 year reanalysis adjusted for driving ocean models for omip2 forcing data is used the simulated zonal transport is about 11 3 sv 72 weaker than the johnson observation 4 3 sv in jra do oc compared with 15 6 sv in the johnson observation the quikscat correction procedure and whether or not the modeled ocean current is considered in the bulk formula can significantly affect the pacific necc the quikscat correction weakens the averaged necc transports by about 60 taking the ocean currents into account in the bulk formula may weaken the averaged necc transports by about 26 30 the above two procedures are used together to force the ocean models in the ocean model intercomparison program omip currently and it will cause the bias of double counting current feedback when calculating the momentum budget wind stress in the bulk formula since the quikscat estimates the equivalent 10 m neutral winds relative to the motion of the ocean surface next we systematically verify and investigate the impacts of double counting the ocean surface currents on the modeled pacific necc using the typical surface wind stress bulk calculation and linear sverdrup transport analysis using observational data of wind and surface current confirms that including the ocean current in the bulk formula may reduce zst by around 6 6 sv 33 and the further double counting of the ocean current leads to an additional reduction of 6 4 sv 48 using the cesm2 numerical experiments we identify that the double counting in the bulk formula results in approximately 21 weakened volume transport the built in nonlinear processes in the model may partly damp the reduction due to the double counting of the ocean current it seems that the double counting effects of the current feedback is only evident in the equatorial pacific and no significant impacts are identified outside the tropical region in our coarse resolution model experiments 1 even over the western boundary currents wbcs and antarctic circumpolar current acc figure s1 where the surface currents are as strong as those in the tropical pacific although the quikscat correction weakens the averaged necc transports significantly the bias correction of jra55 raw reanalysis winds using scatterometer dataset is also required to improve the global simulation tsujino et al 2018 has compared the equivalent neutral 10 m wind speeds zonally averaged over the ocean of jra55 raw and quikscat datasets in their figure 12 and found there is a big difference between them reaching around 0 5 m s at 50 s renault et al 2020 have recently analyzed the recipes for how to force oceanic model dynamics with different existing datasets both the reanalysis and scatterometer equivalent neutral winds on the large scale circulation and mesoscale eddies between 45 s and 45 n with a series of numerical experiments they do not conduct exactly the same experiments as the present study and their focus was on ocean eddy energetics not countercurrents having said that their experiments to mimic forcing ocean model using scatterometer equivalent neutral winds experiments sc c f b w a b s and sc c f b w r e l can be partially compared with our experiments jra do nc and jra do oc respectively and the experiments r n o c f b w a b s and r n o c f b w r e l are comparable with our experiments jra raw nc and jra raw oc respectively the cfb effects were both double counted in experiment sc c f b w r e l and jra do oc they found that the double counting of the surface current will also lead to the reduction of the area averaged large scale circulation but only by about 5 10 the reduction of necc in the present study was around one third 26 30 it possibly can be explained by what they measure is a mean value of a larger meridional extent between 45 s and 45 n not only just in the necc region in addition the experiments of pop f and pop fs are also comparable with experiments r c f b w r e l and sc c f b w r e l in renault et al 2020 respectively one alternative to approximate the absolute winds and solve the double counting bias in necc simulation was proposed in tsujino et al 2018 and renault et al 2020 who added the surface current climatology to the corrected jra 55 winds jra55 do this addition method is similar to renault et al s 2020 experiment r cfb w rel and the global large scale ocean circulation is reasonably simulated figure 11 of renault et al 2020 experiment r cfb w rel means forcing the ocean model with reanalysis like produced data with the cfb and considering the surface current in the bulk formula without current feedback parameterization however the improvement of pacific necc simulation with this method may be limited because the double counting bias can only explain 26 30 of the pacific necc simulation bias and the other part of this bias around 30 caused by the correction with quikscat has not been explained we notice this part of quikscat corrected necc simulation bias may be explained by the retrieval biases in quikscat wind data and the use of annual mean climatological wind adjustment factors weissman et al 2002 milliff et al 2004 risien and chelton 2008 o neill et al 2015 chen and fu 2017 king et al 2017 kilpatrick and xie 2016 xu and stoffelen 2020 one possible alternative is to replace quikscat with advanced scatterometer ascat dataset when correcting the jra55 raw wind field stoffelen et al 2019 wang et al 2019 bentamy et al 2012 compared ascat and quikscat surface winds during the overlap period and found a positive zonal strip of the difference between collocated quikscat and ascat wind speed quikscat minus ascat located at tropical pacific particularly figure 3a in bentamy et al 2012 their results suggested that the quikscat derived wind speed is greater than the ascat which may form an artificial negative positive wsc on the north south side of this zonal strip and lead to the negative meridional gradient of wsc and weak

23892,various strategies are proposed for enforcing stress free boundary conditions on deformed domains using a weak form based discretization in a cartesian frame of reference due to the irregularity of the computational domain and the particular type of boundary condition a coupling between the cartesian velocity components is introduced as such a different computational kernel is required for the numerical solution of the associated vector helmholtz equation as contrasted to what is used for the scalar unknowns of the equations three approaches are presented aimed towards the exact or approximate implementation of zero tangential stress traction at the deformed boundary while ensuring a decoupling of the velocity components in the solution of the vector helmholtz equation two of these strategies those which approximate the free slip boundary condition are applied to the propagation of an internal solitary wave isw of depression over a deformed bathymetry the spatial structure and amplitude of the resultant pseudo traction which is accurately predicted by a simple scaling estimate are explored as a function of the isw based reynolds number r e for the r e values considered the pseudo traction is negligible with respect to the corresponding no slip tangential shear stress the pseudo traction induced time integrated loss of isw energy is found to be significantly weaker than the associated viscous dissipation in the interior water column although at laboratory scale or oceanic r e an approximate free slip boundary condition is found to yield negligible pseudo traction this might not be the case when an elevated eddy viscosity is used in this context as a surrogate for no slip turbulent bottom boundary layer dynamics keywords incompressible navier stokes equations spectral element method free slip boundary condition curved bathymetry pseudo traction internal solitary waves 1 introduction the incompressible navier stokes ins equations under the boussinesq approximation are a commonly used mathematical model of choice to simulate highly non linear non hydrostatic phenomena with characteristic scales of o 1 km or less in the stratified ocean winters et al 2004 winters and de la fuente 2012 fringer et al 2006 durran 2013 typical examples of such geophysical flow phenomena are highly non linear internal waves and the resulting turbulence formation within the wave core rivera rosario et al 2020 tidally driven stratified boundary layers over a bathymetric slope winters 2015 and flows over ocean ridges perfect et al 2018 critical to the robust simulation of such phenomena is the prescription of physically relevant boundary conditions namely over the deformed bathymetry intimately connected to the enforcement of such boundary conditions is the operator splitting approach used in the time advancement of the ins equations in the context of such splitting schemes the lack of a prognostic equation for the pressure associated with a non hydrostatic flow in the ins equations is commonly dealt with by decoupling the pressure from the velocity field by implicitly enforcing via a projection to a divergence free space the incompressibility constraint the resulting equations are elliptic in nature both for the pressure and the viscous diffusive terms of the velocity and density field in the presence of stratification respectively after the splitting time discretization see eq 5 specifically using a popular velocity projection scheme karniadakis et al 1991 the three elliptic equations a pressure poisson equation a vector helmholtz equation for the velocity field and a scalar helmholtz equation for the density have to be consecutively solved for the time advancement of the flow field therefore from an implementation standpoint the preferred strategy is to utilize one single computational kernel which solves numerically the scalar elliptic equations either poisson or helmholtz for all field variables both scalars and vectors ideally each of the components of the velocity field can be computed separately by treating the vector helmholtz equation in the same way as its scalar counterpart nevertheless the geometry of the computational domain and the type of boundary conditions for the velocity field prescribed both by the physics of the problem as well as for stability of the numerical simulation effectively dictate whether each velocity component can be solved independently or not for the simulation of highly non linear non hydrostatic internal waves propagating over a bathymetry a vast range of scales is present within the wave as determined by a wave based reynolds number of o 1 0 8 lien et al 2014 defined using the water column depth and the propagation speed of the internal wave resolving such a very broad range of scales in its entirety is unrealistic in terms of computational cost one path towards enabling the feasibility of these type of simulations is to bypass the resolution of the fine scale no slip driven wave induced bottom boundary layer bbl therefore facilitating the resolution of areas of interest e g regions of shear and convective instability within the wave lien et al 2012 boegman and stastna 2019 to this end traction boundary conditions allow one to circumvent the resolution of the bbl by either emulating bulk bbl effects via the imposition of a predefined bottom stress or by specifying a frictionless bottom boundary i e a free slip condition consequently assuming that the no slip driven fine scale bbl physics are not of interest boegman and stastna 2019 sakai et al 2020a b any challenges linked to the under resolution of the no slip bbl which may compromise the numerical experiment are circumvented the enforcement of a traction boundary condition on a deformed boundary as in the case of an actual oceanic bathymetry introduces a coupling between the cartesian velocity components through the definition of the stress tensor kundu and cohen 2008 accordingly the vector helmholtz equation for the cartesian components of the velocity field has to be solved under the constraint of the associated coupling of all the velocity components a series of approaches may then be followed for the exact imposition of a stress type boundary condition depending on the numerical method of choice a point wise rotation and the subsequent coupling of the cartesian momentum equations on the deformed boundary was first introduced by engelman et al 1982 and is extensively used in various applications when a galerkin based numerical method is adopted behr 2004 ford et al 2004 cerquaglia et al 2017 for discretizations based on the strong form of the equations winters et al 2000 a terrain following coordinate system is commonly utilized nevertheless a simplification of the transformed equations enabled by a strictly diagonal metric tensor is necessary and is usually achieved by virtue of an orthogonal grid winters et al 2000 while these strategies are designed to impose exactly any type of stress boundary condition on general geometries the resulting coupling between the cartesian velocity components leads to an increase of computational complexity on the other hand a series of assumptions can be made to simplify the equations and decouple the velocity field components which give rise to a number of physical inconsistencies limache et al 2007 a potential solution for the above problems has been introduced by epifanio 2007 for a finite difference discretization i e a strong form based numerical method where a decoupled system of equations for the velocity field results through a series of conditions more specifically a system of equations for the boundary values of the velocity field is derived from the stress boundary condition and the impermeability of the boundary a subsequent solve of the discretized boundary conditions is then performed in each time step to specify the boundary values of the velocity field to our best understanding there is a limited discussion in the literature in the context of the ins and the implementation of stress free boundary conditions using a weak form based numerical method in this work the discretization of the ins equations is performed using the hp nodal version of the finite element method namely the spectral element method sem patera 1984 more specifically the imposition of a stress free boundary condition on a deformed boundary in two dimensions is examined for the weak form of the ins equations under the boussinesq approximation which leads to a decoupled vector helmholtz equation for the velocity field first by following a similar methodology as in epifanio 2007 a series of decoupled boundary conditions are derived for each of the velocity components for the variational formulation of the viscous terms deviating from the approach followed in epifanio 2007 the resulting boundary condition is imposed weakly in the form of a natural boundary condition which will effectively modify the variational formulation of the viscous terms therefore the same computational kernel is used for all the elliptic equations in combination with the imposition of the stress free boundary condition in a physically consistent way second a series of assumptions which lead to a decoupled system for the velocity field and avoids the intricacies of modifying the variational formulation is investigated the efficacy of these various strategies is demonstrated for the propagation of an internal solitary wave isw of depression over a gaussian bump at three different values of wave based reynolds number in particular the structure and amplitude of the resultant spuriously induced bottom tangential traction i e pseudo traction and the predictive accuracy of a scaling estimate for the latter are explored under the assumptions of a decoupled velocity field the pseudo traction exerted on the fluid is compared to the wall shear stress for a no slip boundary furthermore the energy lost due to the pseudo traction as the isw crosses the gaussian bump is computed and is found to constitute a negligible portion of the viscous dissipation of the flow in the water column interior 2 equations of motion the equations of motion of an incompressible fluid under the boussinesq approximation are typically written as 1 u t u u g ρ 0 ρ k 1 ρ 0 p ν 2 u 2 ρ t u ρ κ 2 ρ 3 u 0 restricting the presentation to a two dimensional flow field u is the velocity vector field with components u x u z in the x z directions respectively ρ 0 is the reference density g is the gravitational acceleration and k is the unit vector in the upward positive direction additionally ρ is the density perturbation which originates from the decomposition kundu and cohen 2008 4 ρ ρ 0 ρ z ρ x z t with ρ ρ ρ 0 here p is the pressure perturbation deviation from the hydrostatic pressure when ρ 0 and ν κ are the molecular diffusivities which are assumed to be constant note that the representation of the viscous terms i e vector laplacian in eq 1 is a direct result of incompressibility alternatively the viscous terms can be expressed with respect to the deviatoric stress tensor as will be further described in section 4 1 as such a representation is of critical importance in the context of weak form based numerical method and the imposition of a stress free bottom boundary condition per the scope of this paper 3 time discretization the semi discrete equations which arise from the velocity projection scheme karniadakis et al 1991 subich et al 2013 are comprised of three fractional steps the advective non linear term the pressure which entails the implicit solve of a poisson equation and the viscous term are treated separately in succession here the viscous term is shown in detail since it is during this step where any boundary conditions for the velocity field are imposed 3 1 viscous equation laplacian formulation the evaluation of the velocity field at the next time step is computed implicitly via a vector helmholtz equation notice that as written in eq 1 the viscous term of the incompressible navier stokes equations is usually expressed in the form of a vector laplacian under the assumption of a uniform kinematic viscosity 5 α 2 u u f here α ν δ t γ 0 with γ 0 a positive non zero coefficient which depends on the time discretization order karniadakis et al 1991 δ t is the time step and f the right hand side note that the pressure poisson equation ppe carries a very similar structure to eq 5 though without the second term on the left hand side hence as indicated in the introduction any machinery computational kernel developed for the ppe which is more computationally demanding would be ideally applied to the solution of eq 5 3 2 density equation the advection diffusion equation for the density perturbation eq 2 follows the same temporal discretization more specifically the splitting scheme is broken down into two successive steps a the explicit advancement of the advective part and b the implicit solve of the diffusive term i e a scalar helmholtz equation 3 3 weak form of the viscous equation laplacian formulation in the subsequent sections an emphasis is placed on the helmholtz equation for the viscous term eq 5 since at this step any stress type boundary conditions are enforced as required by the weak formulation eq 5 is multiplied by a vector test function v v with v h 1 ω an appropriate functional space deville et al 2002 6 α ω v u d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω 7 α ω u v t d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω α ω n u v d s after performing an integration by parts the boundary integral term which emerges in eq 7 corresponds to what is known in the finite element literature strang and fix 1973 as the natural boundary condition any neumann or robin type boundary conditions are enforced weakly via this boundary integral term dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed strongly by lifting the known solution karniadakis and sherwin 2013 subtleties in the prescription of this boundary integral term are critical in determining whether the free slip condition is truly satisfied since the integrand does not always correspond to the actual tangential stress as such in the next section this boundary integral term is described in terms of its physical underpinnings along with its connection to the enforcement of the free slip boundary condition 4 the free slip boundary condition the correct specification of boundary shear stress requires that one revisits the definition of the viscous force following the parlance of gresho and sani 2000 the viscous force per unit area on any given boundary can be expressed as a function of the viscous component of the stress tensor τ and the normal vector to the boundary n as 8 f n τ note that τ is the deviatoric stress tensor kundu and cohen 2008 9 τ 2 μ s where s 1 2 u u t is the strain rate tensor and μ ρ 0 ν is the dynamic viscosity the static component of the stress related to the pressure is omitted since the calculation of the pressure is decoupled from the viscous component of the incompressible navier stokes following the time splitting scheme described in section 3 although f is formally a force per unit area i e a stress for the sake of compactness and further adhering to the terminology of gresho and sani 2000 we will refer to it as a force hereafter the viscous force on a boundary can be decomposed accordingly into its normal f n n f and tangential f t t f components as schematically shown in fig 1 a free slip boundary condition requires that f t 0 in particular for an undeformed rectangular domain where the t and n vectors are parallel with the cartesian axes and for an impermeable boundary the free slip boundary condition is effectively imposed by simply requiring that n u j n i u j x i 0 therefore in this particular configuration by using the laplacian formulation eq 5 for the viscous terms the free slip boundary condition can be conveniently and exactly enforced through the boundary integral term of the variational formulation in eq 7 nevertheless for a deformed boundary where the cartesian velocity components do not correspond to those of the tangential and normal velocity the free slip boundary condition cannot be enforced as simply as in the rectangular domain case one can easily show that n u 0 is not a sufficient condition for f t 0 because 10 consequently if one adheres to the laplacian formulation eq 5 the resulting natural boundary integral term in the variational formulation eq 7 used for the weak enforcement of boundary conditions does not necessarily correspond to the physical force gresho and sani 2000 as the second term in eq 10 may actually still be non zero now irrespective of the formulation of the boundary condition for the laplacian formulation a spurious tangential force f p the pseudo traction will develop at the free slip boundary more specifically this pseudo traction for an impermeable boundary is directly associated with the boundary s curvature namely kelliher 2006 11 f p μ n u t t μ κ t u where κ t n s is the curvature and s the arc length parameterization of the boundary respectively for a particular formulation of the free slip condition see table 1 the pseudo traction f p may deviate from μ n u t t since the first term of eq 10 may not always be set exactly to zero for all of the velocity components therefore the pseudo traction f p scales with the dynamic viscosity μ the tangential velocity on the boundary t u and its curvature κ note that as expected for a rectilinear boundary where κ 0 when using the laplacian formulation the free slip boundary condition can be imposed exactly as noted in limache et al 2008 in contrast when the boundary is deformed the homogeneous neumann boundary conditions associated with the laplacian formulation can be interpreted as a specific type of navier boundary condition kelliher 2006 4 1 stress tensor formulation of the viscous equations in light of the previous discussion the use of a homogeneous neumann boundary condition as imposed through the boundary integral term of eq 7 in the context of prescribing a free slip condition effectively ignores some important physics and produces a spurious viscous force at the boundary the goal of this section is to present a variational formulation of the viscous terms in which the boundary integral term will correspond to the actual viscous force therefore a traction boundary condition can be consistently enforced introducing however some practical considerations that need to be taken into account as discussed below 4 1 1 the consistent natural boundary conditions formally the viscous term of the ins eq 1 can be written in the more general stress tensor based representation 12 1 ρ 0 τ 1 ρ 0 2 μ s 1 ρ 0 μ u u t notice that for an incompressible fluid the following vector identity holds 13 u t u 0 therefore for a constant viscosity μ and for a cartesian coordinate system the stress tensor based representation of the viscous term is identical to the commonly used vector laplacian formulation of eq 5 now the goal is to rewrite the natural boundary condition of the weak form of the viscous equation in such a way that the actual viscous force may be imposed weakly through the corresponding boundary integral term essential to this regard is that the viscous term in eq 5 be recast as a function of the stress tensor τ shown above in eq 12 which leads to a modified weak form representation 14 β ω v τ d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω applying integration by parts one obtains 15 β ω τ v t d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω β ω n τ v d s ω v f d ω β ω f v d s where β δ t ρ 0 γ 0 α μ and f u ˆ ˆ γ 0 to allow a closer comparison of this modified weak form with eq 7 one follows the methodology of limache et al 2007 and substitutes eq 9 into eq 15 eq 14 is equivalently written as 16 α ω u v t d ω ω v u d ω α ω n u t v d s ω v f d ω β ω f v d s where it is now apparent that the boundary integral term of the left hand side causes a coupling across the equations for each velocity component limache et al 2007 an immediate consequence of this integral term is that the vector helmholtz equation now has to be solved at once for the whole velocity field as a result the numerical implementation of the viscous solve becomes more elaborate since additional computational complexity and memory demands need to be considered most importantly the computational tool used for the numerical calculation of the scalar quantities i e the density perturbation ρ and the temporal mean of the pressure perturbation p cannot be directly adapted for the computation of the coupled velocity components now note that although boundary integral terms are commonly used for imposing weakly a boundary condition in this case the integrand of the boundary term in the left hand side of eq 16 involves unknown quantities and cannot be prescribed a priori nonetheless the boundary integral term in the right hand side is now the natural boundary condition i e the physical viscous force exerted on the fluid and thus the physically consistent boundary condition of the navier stokes equations gresho and sani 2000 4 2 decoupling the velocity components in the laplacian formulation now that the consistent variational formulation has been defined with its associated computational complexities i e coupling of the cartesian velocity components it will serve as a platform for the development of a series of either exact or approximate approaches for the enforcement of the free slip boundary condition in the framework of the laplacian formulation of the viscous terms eq 7 which are now discussed first the consistent non homogeneous neumann boundary condition which satisfies the impermeability of the boundary and guarantees a traction free boundary will be presented when the viscous terms are expressed in the form of a vector laplacian eq 7 however the resulting exact imposition of the free slip boundary condition as it will be subsequently described leads to a more complex variational formulation which poses various questions on its numerical stability from an implementation standpoint two different assumptions will be then presented which although do not guarantee an exact free slip boundary simplify the resulting variational formulations note that the common objective of these approaches for imposing the free slip condition is to allow the independent computation of each velocity component by circumventing the coupling discussed in section 4 1 1 4 2 1 implicit formulation the implicit formulation is constructed following the methodology of robertson et al 2004 for an impermeable and twice differentiable bottom boundary the derivation of the boundary conditions for the two velocity components is discussed in more detail in appendix a a non homogeneous neumann boundary condition is derived for the horizontal velocity component u x by rewriting the free slip boundary condition f t 0 as 17 n u x n x ζ x 2 n z ζ x 3 n x u x x u x z n x ζ x u x 2 ζ x 2 n x ζ x n z where n n x n z are the components of the boundary normal vector and ζ x is the boundary slope robertson et al 2004 subsequently in the framework of the weak form of the laplacian formulation of the viscous terms in eq 7 once the horizontal velocity component u x is computed with the above boundary condition the vertical velocity component u z can be independently computed by enforcing the impermeability of the boundary eq 18 as a non homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition 18 n u 0 u z u x ζ x nonetheless the use of the boundary condition of eq 17 will augment the left hand side of the weak form of the viscous operator in the form of additional boundary integral terms which may compromise the stability of the numerical method since it may constitute a variational crime brenner and scott 2007 the proof of stability of this more complex variational formulation is out of the scope of this study furthermore from a numerical standpoint the inclusion of terms associated with products of first or second derivatives of the bathymetry function ζ x and quadratic expressions thereof may contribute to aliasing effects even when higher order polynomial approximations are used in the spectral element discretization of the governing equations kirby and karniadakis 2003 along with what is apparently sufficient grid resolution of any bathymetric features at hand this aliasing effect is particularly true in the benchmark case considered in section 5 1 where ζ x is an exact gaussian since the representation of the bathymetry depends solely on the grid resolution it may also be present when any in situ sampled bathymetry is used based on lower order cubic spline interpolations rivera rosario et al 2020 therefore in the subsequent sections an emphasis will be given on enforcing approximately the free slip boundary condition in a simplified variational setting while ensuring a decoupling of the velocity components 4 2 2 small boundary slope approximation the complexity in the variational formulation that is introduced via the boundary condition of eq 17 in the form of additional boundary integral terms can be mitigated under the assumption of a sufficiently small boundary slope i e a weak departure from the rectilinear domain where ζ x 0 thus eq 17 may be written as 19 n u x 0 note that the impermeability of the bottom boundary needs to be satisfied exactly since it is associated with the divergence of the velocity field within the closed computational domain 20 ω u d ω ω n u d s 0 in the case where eq 20 is not satisfied up to machine precision a spurious non zero divergence may be formed which can compromise the stability of the numerical simulation therefore the boundary condition for the vertical velocity component u z is the one in eq 18 4 2 3 the inviscid and pseudo traction assumptions starting from the consistent viscous formulation of eq 16 two assumptions are made which lead to a decoupling of the velocity components first we assume that the viscous force exerted on the fluid at the boundary is f 0 i e what is regarded as an inviscid boundary limache et al 2007 second the boundary integral term on the left hand side of eq 16 associated with the coupling of the velocity components n u t and consequently the pseudo traction f p eq 11 is neglected therefore the component of the strain rate responsible for the pseudo traction is assumed to be zero thus taking the inviscid and pseudo traction assumptions into consideration the equation to be solved for the velocity field is identically the same as the laplacian formulation of eq 7 with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions i e n u 0 which may then also be employed in this case once the velocity field is computed a velocity correction takes place to enforce the impermeability of the boundary by projecting out the normal component of the velocity field 21 u u n u n where u is tangent to the bottom boundary 5 results 5 1 benchmark problem configuration the robustness of the different approaches in the enforcement of the free slip boundary condition discussed so far is now examined through simulating the propagation of an internal solitary wave isw over a gaussian hill in a lab scale flume with purely free slip boundaries in terms of the scope of the work under consideration the particular benchmark is attractive as the isw employed see below is an exact solution of the incompressible stratified euler equations under the boussinesq approximation dunphy et al 2011 as such it serves as a non trivially demanding test for the accuracy and robustness of an incompressible flow solver when run in inviscid mode in a uniform depth channel the isw should propagate at a constant theoretically prescribed speed while maintaining its initial waveform and having its total energy sum of kinetic and available potential energy remain unchanged when viscous diffusive terms are incorporated in the governing equation in a uniform depth free slip channel the isw s propagation speed waveform and energy content will undergo a weak adjustment due to viscous and diffusive effects in the wave interior as determined by the values of the wave scale reynolds numbers see eq 23 and schmidt numbers s c ν κ neglecting the above viscous diffusive effects if a gentle i e small slope bathymetric feature such as the gaussian bump considered here is now inserted the numerically simulated wave should propagate over it without any significant structural changes and should recover its original waveform a short downstream distance from the bump nonetheless per section 4 and when an approximate free slip boundary condition is used the finite curvature of the bump will produce a pseudo traction which will serve as an additional form of isw energy loss focused at the bottom boundary when a higher order spatial discretization is used as is the case here a more accurate quantification of the pseudo traction and its impact as an energy sink is possible on one hand the numerical dissipation at the smallest resolved scales in the wave interior and bottom boundary is minimal on the other so is the numerical dispersion which will not spuriously interfere with any subtle physical dispersion effects of the isw as it propagates over the bump furthermore through the particular high order discretization and the isoparametric approximation of the bottom boundary via curvilinear elements kopriva 2009 any spurious separation documented for analogous problems when linearly mapped elements are used steinmoeller et al 2016 is not observed hence any contributions to the pseudo traction will originate from assumptions in the formulation of the approximate free slip boundary condition the initial conditions of the isw are generated via the solution of the dubreil jacotin long djl equation dunphy et al 2011 for a continuous two layer stratification given by 22 ρ ρ 0 1 δ ρ 2 ρ 0 tanh z h 1 δ where ρ 0 1000 kgm 3 is the reference density δ ρ 40 kgm 3 is the difference between the lower and upper densities h 1 3 cm is the upper layer depth and δ 0 5 cm is the interface thickness the isw is generated for an initial available potential energy ape of a p e 5 1 0 5 m 4 s 2 with an initial wavelength l w 0 69 m and a propagation speed c 0 114 ms 1 the domain dimensions are h 15 cm the domain height and l 7 l w 4 83 m the domain length the centre of the gaussian hill is placed in the middle of the computational domain with a height of h g 0 03 h and width l g 3 l w 4 the problem configuration is shown in fig 2 the simulation is stopped when the isw arrives at a along bed position which is symmetric to the wave s starting position with respect to the centre of gaussian bump the benchmark isw is intentionally chosen to be moderate in amplitude as measured by the ratio of wave induced maximum isopycnal displacement to water column depth which is equal to approximately 24 such a moderate amplitude isw will operate well below the convective or shear instability limits lamb 2003 both in uniform depth water but also while propagating over the gaussian bump such instabilities would drive elevated dissipation in the wave interior which would complicate any comparison thereof with the energy lost purely due to pseudo traction see section 5 5 finally the choice of amplitude of gaussian bump elevation is motivated by similar arguments as a steeper bump would enhance the likelihood of the above flow instabilities the maximum slope of the bump at hand is 3 which is less than the maximum bathymetric slope found in recent observational and modelling studies of isws shoaling in the south china sea rivera rosario et al 2020 lien et al 2012 lamb and warn varnas 2015 in regards to spatial discretization the nodal version of the spectral element method sem patera 1984 is used with m x 20 and m z 13 of quadrilateral elements in the x and z directions respectively for a polynomial order per element per dimension p 15 which corresponds to n x n z 301 196 grid points the high polynomial order is chosen to minimize any numerical dissipation and dispersion as discussed above a grid stretching technique applied to element height is used with δ z i 1 0 75 δ z i where δ z i is the height of the i th element a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the exact and approximate implementations of the free slip boundary condition is performed for three different values of wave based reynolds number r e 23 r e c h ν specifically values of r e 2 5 1 0 4 1 0 5 and 4 1 0 5 are chosen with the middle value representative of an isw propagating in a typical laboratory flume carr et al 2008 each test case is denoted as r e x x x y y xxx can be 025 100 or 400 depending on the value of r e whereas yy can be sa and ip which correspond to the small angle approximation and inviscid pseudo traction approach respectively as elaborated in sections 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 an additional test case with a no slip bottom boundary condition is also considered using the shorthand notation ns at each r e to compare free slip pseudo traction to no slip bottom shear stresses for all the test cases the resolution along with the time step was kept constant and dictated by the no slip run of the highest r e number r e 4 1 0 5 to allow comparison across different implementations and r e numbers the time step d t 6 6 1 0 3 s is chosen such that the initial c f l number in the vertical direction is equal to 0 33 5 2 tangential bottom shear stress structure fig 4 shows the spatial structure of the tangential force traction f t as a function of along bed position and time over the time interval during which isw propagates over the gaussian bump the contour values of f t are scaled by the free stream dynamic pressure a measure of form drag computed based on the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at the wave trough fig 4 is restricted to results for r e 2 5 1 0 4 for a particular boundary condition implementation the structure of f t is found to be independent of r e whereas its magnitude scales linearly with 1 r e as it is directly proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the fluid for the no slip case the tangential traction structure assumes values which are in direct response to bottom boundary layer formation under the wave and the resulting flow separation due to the isw induced adverse pressure gradient in the rear half of the wave boegman and stastna 2019 this particular structure of the tangential traction has been established prior to the arrival of the wave at the gaussian bump and subsequently tracks the propagating wave remaining relatively unchanged over the gaussian bump because of the moderate amplitude of the wave and steepness of the bathymetric bump no phenomena of enhanced bottom boundary layer separation are observed such as those reported by harnanan et al 2015 due to the adverse pressure gradient associated with the bathymetric bump itself finally for the lowest r e considered the magnitude of the local tangential traction can be as high as 3 of the bump induced form drag in contrast the structure of any non zero tangential traction for the case of an approximate free slip boundary is concentrated within a fixed region along the bottom boundary centred around the gaussian hill suggesting that the geometry of the bump and in particular its curvature is the primary driver fig 3 as such the peak positive tangential traction develops on the top of the hill for the lower r e considered this peak tangential traction is no greater than 2 1 0 5 of the bump induced form drag a distinctly small value the negative contour values that the tangential traction assumes for the two approximations are attributed to the overall change of sign of curvature i e convex at the beginning end of the gaussian bump fig 3 as noted in section 4 1 1 any results of the implicit formulation are not shown due to the formation of spurious high amplitude grid scale oscillations in the tangential traction which may be attributed to aliasing errors these errors result from the high order derivative terms of the bathymetry function ζ x eq 17 chosen to be an exact gaussian in our case as well as inconsistencies potentially introduced due to the modification of the variational formulation through the boundary integral terms associated with the updated natural boundary condition for the horizontal velocity component 5 3 pseudo traction as a function of curvature the prediction of the pseudo traction per the scaling of eq 11 is compared to the corresponding magnitude of the tangential free slip traction computed from the simulation results in fig 5 a c the comparison is restricted to the trough of the propagating isw where the tangential wave induced velocity is the largest noting that very similar trends occur along the entire gaussian bump for all r e examined the magnitude of the simulated tangential traction appears to scale linearly with the boundary curvature κ with a slope very close to the theoretically predicted μ t u consequently this a priori estimate of the pseudo traction by virtue of its scaling can be a useful assessment tool of the significance of the pseudo traction based on the flow s characteristic velocity and boundary s curvature 5 4 free slip to no slip traction ratio fig 4 and its higher r e counterparts not shown here indicate that the tangential traction computed from the different free slip implementation simulations is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding bottom tangential stress for the no slip case a simple predictive scaling for the ratio of pseudo traction f p to no slip traction f w leveraging the scaling of eq 11 as a function of either bump or isw based non dimensional parameters is 24 f p f w h r 1 r e details regarding the derivation are provided in appendix b eq 24 effectively indicates that the relative effect of pseudo traction is enhanced when the radius of curvature of a bathymetric feature r is considerably smaller than the water column depth h the practical implications of this dependence in the context of bathymetry resolution are further discussed in section 6 the predicted r e 1 2 scaling for f p f w is verified for our benchmark problem simulations in fig 6 shown on a log log plot since the ratio f p f w follows the expected power law behaviour see eq 24 consistent with the scaling analysis above the pseudo traction and the wall shear stress are computed at the trough of the wave at the highest point of curvature of the bottom boundary i e top of the gaussian bump oceanically relevant values of r e can be two to three orders of magnitude larger than the ones considered here adhering to the potentially limiting assumptions of laminar flow and constant viscosity near the bed pseudo traction may be regarded practically negligible at such r e section 6 addresses one scenario where such a claim might need to be reconsidered 5 5 energy lost due to pseudo traction so far we have established an understanding of the spatial structure of the free slip induced pseudo traction and its dependence on bathymetric curvature with a focus on the isw trough which carries the maximum horizontal wave induced velocity we now turn to investigating the associated cumulative energy losses along the entire wave footprint and over the full time required for the isw to propagate over the gaussian bump in particular a control volume cv analysis is used the boundaries of the cv coincide with those of the computational domain at any instance during which the isw propagates over the bottom gaussian bump the rate of change of kinetic energy in the fixed cv can be calculated as rowe et al 2020 25 d e d t ω u e p u 2 ν u s n d s ω ρ g w 2 ν s s d ω where e and e ρ 0 u 2 2 are the total kinetic energy and kinetic energy per unit volume respectively s is the strain rate tensor and n the outward wall normal vector notice that for impermeable boundaries n u 0 the boundary integral of eq 25 is equal to 26 2 ν ω u s n d s which corresponds to the kinetic energy loss due to viscous stresses on the boundaries of the control volume computational domain note that all the boundaries of the computational domain except the bottom one fig 2 are non deformed impermeable boundaries where the free slip boundary condition is exactly enforced thus any loss of kinetic energy due to physical or spurious viscous stresses will originate from the bottom boundary in the case of a no slip boundary this integral term is equal to zero since the velocity field assumes a zero value on the no slip boundary if instead an approximate free slip boundary condition is used pseudo traction is expected to drive the above loss of kinetic energy in that case for an impermeable bottom boundary with a tangential only velocity component the surface integral term eq 26 in combination with eq 10 becomes 27 2 ν ω u s n d s 2 ν ω u t s n d s 1 ρ 0 ω u f t d s one may now consider the relative importance of the time integrated energy lost to pseudo traction due to the approximate enforcement of the free slip condition with respect to that lost due to viscous dissipation in the domain interior in this regard one may ignore the buoyancy flux term i e the first of the two terms in the volume integral of the right hand side of eq 25 the time integrated ratio of energy lost due to pseudo traction and viscous dissipation may now be written as 28 r t 2 ν ω u s n d s d t t 2 ν ω s s d ω d t fig 7 shows the dependence of r on r e for the three reynolds numbers examined where time integration is applied over the time interval required for the isw to propagate over the bottom gaussian bump note the particularly small values o 10 4 r assumes irrespective of r e moreover the ratio value r appears to asymptotically assume a constant value as r e increases and approaches its oceanic counterpart whereas the analysis here considers two dimensional laminar flow in the wave interior the presence of turbulence and elevated viscous dissipation in the wave interior originating from shear or convective instabilities lien et al 2012 2014 moum et al 2003 would reduce the value of r even further at least in the context of a single topographic feature as considered here 6 discussion the relative magnitude of the pseudo traction on a deformed domain with respect to the equivalent bed stress of a no slip bottom boundary under the constraint of assuming two dimensional laminar flow at the bottom boundary has been examined for the benchmark of an isw propagating over a gaussian bump at three different r e representative of the laboratory scale or somewhat larger in value fig 6 the relative magnitude of the pseudo traction decreases with increasing r e with a 1 2 power law as predicted by the scaling analysis of section 5 4 consequently at oceanically relevant r e of o 1 0 8 1 0 9 the relative strength of the pseudo traction is expected to be reduced by as much as a factor of 100 as compared to what is shown in fig 6 however in practice near bed flows at such high r e will be inevitably three dimensional and turbulent sakai et al 2020a zulberti et al 2020 as discussed in the introduction a simulation of such complex three dimensional flows is practically not feasible due to the associated high computational cost inextricably linked to the resolution required to resolve the broad range of scales even in a partial manner in such a case a commonly used alternative is the use of an eddy viscosity which is often localized near the bottom lamb and warn varnas 2015 or is set equal to a constant background value at the boundary when it changes dynamically klymak et al 2010 klymak and legg 2010 a commonly used value of the eddy viscosity can be up to 4 to 6 orders of magnitude larger than its molecular counterpart lamb and warn varnas 2015 özgökmen et al 2004 as elaborated by özgökmen et al 2004 such high values will apply to both horizontal and vertical components of eddy viscosity for near boundary flows unlike what is the case in stratified mid water where the vertical component can be much weaker therefore when combined with the approximated free slip boundary use of an eddy viscosity is likely to drastically intensify the contribution of the resulting pseudo traction to the overall flow energetics nevertheless in the context of a large eddy simulation les subgrid scale model sagaut et al 2013 additional terms related to the model e g subgrid stress tensor will be introduced in the momentum equations and thus affect the overall coupling of the velocity components therefore their contribution to the overall pseudo traction needs to be carefully studied nonetheless any further investigation in the context of les subgrid scale modelling is out of the scope of the paper another possible increase of the pseudo traction contribution could be due to elevated curvature i e reduced radius of curvature of the bottom bathymetry see eq 24 nevertheless in this scenario a practical consideration needs to be taken into account high curvature boundaries are naturally very small in scale accurately representing them would require very high resolution which is prohibitive from an implementation standpoint furthermore the relative energy loss due to pseudo traction normalized by the viscous dissipation in the domain interior is shown as a function of r e number in fig 7 note that this ratio appears to plateau as r e is increased the energy lost due to pseudo traction over the time required for the wave to propagate over the gaussian bump is only 0 01 of the energy lost due to viscous dissipation over the same time interval therefore one can safely propose in the context of the benchmark at hand and the assumption of laminar flow within the water column that the effect of approximating the free slip bottom boundary condition to the overall flow energetics is also negligible in a time integrated sense such a claim would hold even more strongly if highly dissipative turbulence due to shear and convective instabilities were to be present in the isw interior under the restriction that the near bed flow is assumed to be laminar however in the case of an elevated near bed eddy viscosity discussed above any claim of negligible time integrated energetic significance of pseudo traction may have to be reconsidered 7 conclusions the exact enforcement of the free slip boundary condition on a deformed boundary introduces a coupling between the cartesian velocity components consequently solving for the velocity field under a free slip boundary condition adds a computational complexity which can be mitigated by approximating the free slip boundary to achieve an independent solve per each velocity component various free slip approximations have been proposed for a continuous high order galerkin numerical discretization with a possible extension to other weak form based and strong form based discretizations since the two proposed approximations are comprised of dirichlet and neumann type of boundary conditions these boundary conditions can be easily enforced strongly when a strong form based numerical discretization is used e g a finite difference method thus when these approximations are adopted the overall pseudo traction is expected to behave in a similar manner for the same type of flow irrespective of the numerical discretization the extension of these approximations to three dimensions follows naturally from its two dimensional counterpart now the pseudo traction will be a vector with two components the tangential and binormal to the bottom boundary with each component proportional to its respective curvature and thus to the tangent bi normal boundary velocity component therefore each component of the pseudo traction is expected to adhere to the scaling analyses presented in sections 4 and 5 4 the propagation of an internal solitary wave over a gaussian hill has been used as a benchmark to quantify the exerted traction on the fluid due an approximate free slip boundary condition the tangential traction i e pseudo traction associated with the approximated free slip boundary depends mainly on the magnitude of the tangential velocity component as well as the curvature of the deformed boundary the energy loss attributed to the pseudo traction compared to the total viscous dissipation accounts to a negligible percentage i e much less than 1 overall for oceanic flow modelling the effect of the pseudo traction seems to be negligible alleviating the modeller from the computational intricacies of solving a coupled vector equation for the velocity field however the significance of the pseudo traction to the overall flow energetics may possibly change in the case of an elevated near bottom eddy viscosity which poses an

scaling of pseudo traction to bottom shear stress ratio to this end one focuses on the isw trough which carries an induced horizontal current u in the no slip bottom case at this location under the wave one may assume that the development of the bottom boundary layer is driven purely by viscous diffusion and is not impacted by boundary layer separation under the propagating wave the boundary layer thickness may then be approximated as δ ν t if the bump s maximum radius of curvature which occurs at its centre is r 1 κ the time it takes for the wave to propagate up to this location is approximately t r c consequently if one further assumes that the near bed velocity profile is close to linear over a distance δ the wall shear stress for the no slip boundary for a purely tangential velocity u u t can be approximated as b 1 f w μ u t n μ u δ μ u κ r c ν f p r c ν where f p μ u κ is the pseudo traction due to an approximated free slip boundary per eq 11 the ratio of the pseudo traction to the bottom shear stress may then be written as a function of the isw based reynolds number as in eq 24 
23892,various strategies are proposed for enforcing stress free boundary conditions on deformed domains using a weak form based discretization in a cartesian frame of reference due to the irregularity of the computational domain and the particular type of boundary condition a coupling between the cartesian velocity components is introduced as such a different computational kernel is required for the numerical solution of the associated vector helmholtz equation as contrasted to what is used for the scalar unknowns of the equations three approaches are presented aimed towards the exact or approximate implementation of zero tangential stress traction at the deformed boundary while ensuring a decoupling of the velocity components in the solution of the vector helmholtz equation two of these strategies those which approximate the free slip boundary condition are applied to the propagation of an internal solitary wave isw of depression over a deformed bathymetry the spatial structure and amplitude of the resultant pseudo traction which is accurately predicted by a simple scaling estimate are explored as a function of the isw based reynolds number r e for the r e values considered the pseudo traction is negligible with respect to the corresponding no slip tangential shear stress the pseudo traction induced time integrated loss of isw energy is found to be significantly weaker than the associated viscous dissipation in the interior water column although at laboratory scale or oceanic r e an approximate free slip boundary condition is found to yield negligible pseudo traction this might not be the case when an elevated eddy viscosity is used in this context as a surrogate for no slip turbulent bottom boundary layer dynamics keywords incompressible navier stokes equations spectral element method free slip boundary condition curved bathymetry pseudo traction internal solitary waves 1 introduction the incompressible navier stokes ins equations under the boussinesq approximation are a commonly used mathematical model of choice to simulate highly non linear non hydrostatic phenomena with characteristic scales of o 1 km or less in the stratified ocean winters et al 2004 winters and de la fuente 2012 fringer et al 2006 durran 2013 typical examples of such geophysical flow phenomena are highly non linear internal waves and the resulting turbulence formation within the wave core rivera rosario et al 2020 tidally driven stratified boundary layers over a bathymetric slope winters 2015 and flows over ocean ridges perfect et al 2018 critical to the robust simulation of such phenomena is the prescription of physically relevant boundary conditions namely over the deformed bathymetry intimately connected to the enforcement of such boundary conditions is the operator splitting approach used in the time advancement of the ins equations in the context of such splitting schemes the lack of a prognostic equation for the pressure associated with a non hydrostatic flow in the ins equations is commonly dealt with by decoupling the pressure from the velocity field by implicitly enforcing via a projection to a divergence free space the incompressibility constraint the resulting equations are elliptic in nature both for the pressure and the viscous diffusive terms of the velocity and density field in the presence of stratification respectively after the splitting time discretization see eq 5 specifically using a popular velocity projection scheme karniadakis et al 1991 the three elliptic equations a pressure poisson equation a vector helmholtz equation for the velocity field and a scalar helmholtz equation for the density have to be consecutively solved for the time advancement of the flow field therefore from an implementation standpoint the preferred strategy is to utilize one single computational kernel which solves numerically the scalar elliptic equations either poisson or helmholtz for all field variables both scalars and vectors ideally each of the components of the velocity field can be computed separately by treating the vector helmholtz equation in the same way as its scalar counterpart nevertheless the geometry of the computational domain and the type of boundary conditions for the velocity field prescribed both by the physics of the problem as well as for stability of the numerical simulation effectively dictate whether each velocity component can be solved independently or not for the simulation of highly non linear non hydrostatic internal waves propagating over a bathymetry a vast range of scales is present within the wave as determined by a wave based reynolds number of o 1 0 8 lien et al 2014 defined using the water column depth and the propagation speed of the internal wave resolving such a very broad range of scales in its entirety is unrealistic in terms of computational cost one path towards enabling the feasibility of these type of simulations is to bypass the resolution of the fine scale no slip driven wave induced bottom boundary layer bbl therefore facilitating the resolution of areas of interest e g regions of shear and convective instability within the wave lien et al 2012 boegman and stastna 2019 to this end traction boundary conditions allow one to circumvent the resolution of the bbl by either emulating bulk bbl effects via the imposition of a predefined bottom stress or by specifying a frictionless bottom boundary i e a free slip condition consequently assuming that the no slip driven fine scale bbl physics are not of interest boegman and stastna 2019 sakai et al 2020a b any challenges linked to the under resolution of the no slip bbl which may compromise the numerical experiment are circumvented the enforcement of a traction boundary condition on a deformed boundary as in the case of an actual oceanic bathymetry introduces a coupling between the cartesian velocity components through the definition of the stress tensor kundu and cohen 2008 accordingly the vector helmholtz equation for the cartesian components of the velocity field has to be solved under the constraint of the associated coupling of all the velocity components a series of approaches may then be followed for the exact imposition of a stress type boundary condition depending on the numerical method of choice a point wise rotation and the subsequent coupling of the cartesian momentum equations on the deformed boundary was first introduced by engelman et al 1982 and is extensively used in various applications when a galerkin based numerical method is adopted behr 2004 ford et al 2004 cerquaglia et al 2017 for discretizations based on the strong form of the equations winters et al 2000 a terrain following coordinate system is commonly utilized nevertheless a simplification of the transformed equations enabled by a strictly diagonal metric tensor is necessary and is usually achieved by virtue of an orthogonal grid winters et al 2000 while these strategies are designed to impose exactly any type of stress boundary condition on general geometries the resulting coupling between the cartesian velocity components leads to an increase of computational complexity on the other hand a series of assumptions can be made to simplify the equations and decouple the velocity field components which give rise to a number of physical inconsistencies limache et al 2007 a potential solution for the above problems has been introduced by epifanio 2007 for a finite difference discretization i e a strong form based numerical method where a decoupled system of equations for the velocity field results through a series of conditions more specifically a system of equations for the boundary values of the velocity field is derived from the stress boundary condition and the impermeability of the boundary a subsequent solve of the discretized boundary conditions is then performed in each time step to specify the boundary values of the velocity field to our best understanding there is a limited discussion in the literature in the context of the ins and the implementation of stress free boundary conditions using a weak form based numerical method in this work the discretization of the ins equations is performed using the hp nodal version of the finite element method namely the spectral element method sem patera 1984 more specifically the imposition of a stress free boundary condition on a deformed boundary in two dimensions is examined for the weak form of the ins equations under the boussinesq approximation which leads to a decoupled vector helmholtz equation for the velocity field first by following a similar methodology as in epifanio 2007 a series of decoupled boundary conditions are derived for each of the velocity components for the variational formulation of the viscous terms deviating from the approach followed in epifanio 2007 the resulting boundary condition is imposed weakly in the form of a natural boundary condition which will effectively modify the variational formulation of the viscous terms therefore the same computational kernel is used for all the elliptic equations in combination with the imposition of the stress free boundary condition in a physically consistent way second a series of assumptions which lead to a decoupled system for the velocity field and avoids the intricacies of modifying the variational formulation is investigated the efficacy of these various strategies is demonstrated for the propagation of an internal solitary wave isw of depression over a gaussian bump at three different values of wave based reynolds number in particular the structure and amplitude of the resultant spuriously induced bottom tangential traction i e pseudo traction and the predictive accuracy of a scaling estimate for the latter are explored under the assumptions of a decoupled velocity field the pseudo traction exerted on the fluid is compared to the wall shear stress for a no slip boundary furthermore the energy lost due to the pseudo traction as the isw crosses the gaussian bump is computed and is found to constitute a negligible portion of the viscous dissipation of the flow in the water column interior 2 equations of motion the equations of motion of an incompressible fluid under the boussinesq approximation are typically written as 1 u t u u g ρ 0 ρ k 1 ρ 0 p ν 2 u 2 ρ t u ρ κ 2 ρ 3 u 0 restricting the presentation to a two dimensional flow field u is the velocity vector field with components u x u z in the x z directions respectively ρ 0 is the reference density g is the gravitational acceleration and k is the unit vector in the upward positive direction additionally ρ is the density perturbation which originates from the decomposition kundu and cohen 2008 4 ρ ρ 0 ρ z ρ x z t with ρ ρ ρ 0 here p is the pressure perturbation deviation from the hydrostatic pressure when ρ 0 and ν κ are the molecular diffusivities which are assumed to be constant note that the representation of the viscous terms i e vector laplacian in eq 1 is a direct result of incompressibility alternatively the viscous terms can be expressed with respect to the deviatoric stress tensor as will be further described in section 4 1 as such a representation is of critical importance in the context of weak form based numerical method and the imposition of a stress free bottom boundary condition per the scope of this paper 3 time discretization the semi discrete equations which arise from the velocity projection scheme karniadakis et al 1991 subich et al 2013 are comprised of three fractional steps the advective non linear term the pressure which entails the implicit solve of a poisson equation and the viscous term are treated separately in succession here the viscous term is shown in detail since it is during this step where any boundary conditions for the velocity field are imposed 3 1 viscous equation laplacian formulation the evaluation of the velocity field at the next time step is computed implicitly via a vector helmholtz equation notice that as written in eq 1 the viscous term of the incompressible navier stokes equations is usually expressed in the form of a vector laplacian under the assumption of a uniform kinematic viscosity 5 α 2 u u f here α ν δ t γ 0 with γ 0 a positive non zero coefficient which depends on the time discretization order karniadakis et al 1991 δ t is the time step and f the right hand side note that the pressure poisson equation ppe carries a very similar structure to eq 5 though without the second term on the left hand side hence as indicated in the introduction any machinery computational kernel developed for the ppe which is more computationally demanding would be ideally applied to the solution of eq 5 3 2 density equation the advection diffusion equation for the density perturbation eq 2 follows the same temporal discretization more specifically the splitting scheme is broken down into two successive steps a the explicit advancement of the advective part and b the implicit solve of the diffusive term i e a scalar helmholtz equation 3 3 weak form of the viscous equation laplacian formulation in the subsequent sections an emphasis is placed on the helmholtz equation for the viscous term eq 5 since at this step any stress type boundary conditions are enforced as required by the weak formulation eq 5 is multiplied by a vector test function v v with v h 1 ω an appropriate functional space deville et al 2002 6 α ω v u d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω 7 α ω u v t d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω α ω n u v d s after performing an integration by parts the boundary integral term which emerges in eq 7 corresponds to what is known in the finite element literature strang and fix 1973 as the natural boundary condition any neumann or robin type boundary conditions are enforced weakly via this boundary integral term dirichlet boundary conditions can be imposed strongly by lifting the known solution karniadakis and sherwin 2013 subtleties in the prescription of this boundary integral term are critical in determining whether the free slip condition is truly satisfied since the integrand does not always correspond to the actual tangential stress as such in the next section this boundary integral term is described in terms of its physical underpinnings along with its connection to the enforcement of the free slip boundary condition 4 the free slip boundary condition the correct specification of boundary shear stress requires that one revisits the definition of the viscous force following the parlance of gresho and sani 2000 the viscous force per unit area on any given boundary can be expressed as a function of the viscous component of the stress tensor τ and the normal vector to the boundary n as 8 f n τ note that τ is the deviatoric stress tensor kundu and cohen 2008 9 τ 2 μ s where s 1 2 u u t is the strain rate tensor and μ ρ 0 ν is the dynamic viscosity the static component of the stress related to the pressure is omitted since the calculation of the pressure is decoupled from the viscous component of the incompressible navier stokes following the time splitting scheme described in section 3 although f is formally a force per unit area i e a stress for the sake of compactness and further adhering to the terminology of gresho and sani 2000 we will refer to it as a force hereafter the viscous force on a boundary can be decomposed accordingly into its normal f n n f and tangential f t t f components as schematically shown in fig 1 a free slip boundary condition requires that f t 0 in particular for an undeformed rectangular domain where the t and n vectors are parallel with the cartesian axes and for an impermeable boundary the free slip boundary condition is effectively imposed by simply requiring that n u j n i u j x i 0 therefore in this particular configuration by using the laplacian formulation eq 5 for the viscous terms the free slip boundary condition can be conveniently and exactly enforced through the boundary integral term of the variational formulation in eq 7 nevertheless for a deformed boundary where the cartesian velocity components do not correspond to those of the tangential and normal velocity the free slip boundary condition cannot be enforced as simply as in the rectangular domain case one can easily show that n u 0 is not a sufficient condition for f t 0 because 10 consequently if one adheres to the laplacian formulation eq 5 the resulting natural boundary integral term in the variational formulation eq 7 used for the weak enforcement of boundary conditions does not necessarily correspond to the physical force gresho and sani 2000 as the second term in eq 10 may actually still be non zero now irrespective of the formulation of the boundary condition for the laplacian formulation a spurious tangential force f p the pseudo traction will develop at the free slip boundary more specifically this pseudo traction for an impermeable boundary is directly associated with the boundary s curvature namely kelliher 2006 11 f p μ n u t t μ κ t u where κ t n s is the curvature and s the arc length parameterization of the boundary respectively for a particular formulation of the free slip condition see table 1 the pseudo traction f p may deviate from μ n u t t since the first term of eq 10 may not always be set exactly to zero for all of the velocity components therefore the pseudo traction f p scales with the dynamic viscosity μ the tangential velocity on the boundary t u and its curvature κ note that as expected for a rectilinear boundary where κ 0 when using the laplacian formulation the free slip boundary condition can be imposed exactly as noted in limache et al 2008 in contrast when the boundary is deformed the homogeneous neumann boundary conditions associated with the laplacian formulation can be interpreted as a specific type of navier boundary condition kelliher 2006 4 1 stress tensor formulation of the viscous equations in light of the previous discussion the use of a homogeneous neumann boundary condition as imposed through the boundary integral term of eq 7 in the context of prescribing a free slip condition effectively ignores some important physics and produces a spurious viscous force at the boundary the goal of this section is to present a variational formulation of the viscous terms in which the boundary integral term will correspond to the actual viscous force therefore a traction boundary condition can be consistently enforced introducing however some practical considerations that need to be taken into account as discussed below 4 1 1 the consistent natural boundary conditions formally the viscous term of the ins eq 1 can be written in the more general stress tensor based representation 12 1 ρ 0 τ 1 ρ 0 2 μ s 1 ρ 0 μ u u t notice that for an incompressible fluid the following vector identity holds 13 u t u 0 therefore for a constant viscosity μ and for a cartesian coordinate system the stress tensor based representation of the viscous term is identical to the commonly used vector laplacian formulation of eq 5 now the goal is to rewrite the natural boundary condition of the weak form of the viscous equation in such a way that the actual viscous force may be imposed weakly through the corresponding boundary integral term essential to this regard is that the viscous term in eq 5 be recast as a function of the stress tensor τ shown above in eq 12 which leads to a modified weak form representation 14 β ω v τ d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω applying integration by parts one obtains 15 β ω τ v t d ω ω v u d ω ω v f d ω β ω n τ v d s ω v f d ω β ω f v d s where β δ t ρ 0 γ 0 α μ and f u ˆ ˆ γ 0 to allow a closer comparison of this modified weak form with eq 7 one follows the methodology of limache et al 2007 and substitutes eq 9 into eq 15 eq 14 is equivalently written as 16 α ω u v t d ω ω v u d ω α ω n u t v d s ω v f d ω β ω f v d s where it is now apparent that the boundary integral term of the left hand side causes a coupling across the equations for each velocity component limache et al 2007 an immediate consequence of this integral term is that the vector helmholtz equation now has to be solved at once for the whole velocity field as a result the numerical implementation of the viscous solve becomes more elaborate since additional computational complexity and memory demands need to be considered most importantly the computational tool used for the numerical calculation of the scalar quantities i e the density perturbation ρ and the temporal mean of the pressure perturbation p cannot be directly adapted for the computation of the coupled velocity components now note that although boundary integral terms are commonly used for imposing weakly a boundary condition in this case the integrand of the boundary term in the left hand side of eq 16 involves unknown quantities and cannot be prescribed a priori nonetheless the boundary integral term in the right hand side is now the natural boundary condition i e the physical viscous force exerted on the fluid and thus the physically consistent boundary condition of the navier stokes equations gresho and sani 2000 4 2 decoupling the velocity components in the laplacian formulation now that the consistent variational formulation has been defined with its associated computational complexities i e coupling of the cartesian velocity components it will serve as a platform for the development of a series of either exact or approximate approaches for the enforcement of the free slip boundary condition in the framework of the laplacian formulation of the viscous terms eq 7 which are now discussed first the consistent non homogeneous neumann boundary condition which satisfies the impermeability of the boundary and guarantees a traction free boundary will be presented when the viscous terms are expressed in the form of a vector laplacian eq 7 however the resulting exact imposition of the free slip boundary condition as it will be subsequently described leads to a more complex variational formulation which poses various questions on its numerical stability from an implementation standpoint two different assumptions will be then presented which although do not guarantee an exact free slip boundary simplify the resulting variational formulations note that the common objective of these approaches for imposing the free slip condition is to allow the independent computation of each velocity component by circumventing the coupling discussed in section 4 1 1 4 2 1 implicit formulation the implicit formulation is constructed following the methodology of robertson et al 2004 for an impermeable and twice differentiable bottom boundary the derivation of the boundary conditions for the two velocity components is discussed in more detail in appendix a a non homogeneous neumann boundary condition is derived for the horizontal velocity component u x by rewriting the free slip boundary condition f t 0 as 17 n u x n x ζ x 2 n z ζ x 3 n x u x x u x z n x ζ x u x 2 ζ x 2 n x ζ x n z where n n x n z are the components of the boundary normal vector and ζ x is the boundary slope robertson et al 2004 subsequently in the framework of the weak form of the laplacian formulation of the viscous terms in eq 7 once the horizontal velocity component u x is computed with the above boundary condition the vertical velocity component u z can be independently computed by enforcing the impermeability of the boundary eq 18 as a non homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition 18 n u 0 u z u x ζ x nonetheless the use of the boundary condition of eq 17 will augment the left hand side of the weak form of the viscous operator in the form of additional boundary integral terms which may compromise the stability of the numerical method since it may constitute a variational crime brenner and scott 2007 the proof of stability of this more complex variational formulation is out of the scope of this study furthermore from a numerical standpoint the inclusion of terms associated with products of first or second derivatives of the bathymetry function ζ x and quadratic expressions thereof may contribute to aliasing effects even when higher order polynomial approximations are used in the spectral element discretization of the governing equations kirby and karniadakis 2003 along with what is apparently sufficient grid resolution of any bathymetric features at hand this aliasing effect is particularly true in the benchmark case considered in section 5 1 where ζ x is an exact gaussian since the representation of the bathymetry depends solely on the grid resolution it may also be present when any in situ sampled bathymetry is used based on lower order cubic spline interpolations rivera rosario et al 2020 therefore in the subsequent sections an emphasis will be given on enforcing approximately the free slip boundary condition in a simplified variational setting while ensuring a decoupling of the velocity components 4 2 2 small boundary slope approximation the complexity in the variational formulation that is introduced via the boundary condition of eq 17 in the form of additional boundary integral terms can be mitigated under the assumption of a sufficiently small boundary slope i e a weak departure from the rectilinear domain where ζ x 0 thus eq 17 may be written as 19 n u x 0 note that the impermeability of the bottom boundary needs to be satisfied exactly since it is associated with the divergence of the velocity field within the closed computational domain 20 ω u d ω ω n u d s 0 in the case where eq 20 is not satisfied up to machine precision a spurious non zero divergence may be formed which can compromise the stability of the numerical simulation therefore the boundary condition for the vertical velocity component u z is the one in eq 18 4 2 3 the inviscid and pseudo traction assumptions starting from the consistent viscous formulation of eq 16 two assumptions are made which lead to a decoupling of the velocity components first we assume that the viscous force exerted on the fluid at the boundary is f 0 i e what is regarded as an inviscid boundary limache et al 2007 second the boundary integral term on the left hand side of eq 16 associated with the coupling of the velocity components n u t and consequently the pseudo traction f p eq 11 is neglected therefore the component of the strain rate responsible for the pseudo traction is assumed to be zero thus taking the inviscid and pseudo traction assumptions into consideration the equation to be solved for the velocity field is identically the same as the laplacian formulation of eq 7 with homogeneous neumann boundary conditions i e n u 0 which may then also be employed in this case once the velocity field is computed a velocity correction takes place to enforce the impermeability of the boundary by projecting out the normal component of the velocity field 21 u u n u n where u is tangent to the bottom boundary 5 results 5 1 benchmark problem configuration the robustness of the different approaches in the enforcement of the free slip boundary condition discussed so far is now examined through simulating the propagation of an internal solitary wave isw over a gaussian hill in a lab scale flume with purely free slip boundaries in terms of the scope of the work under consideration the particular benchmark is attractive as the isw employed see below is an exact solution of the incompressible stratified euler equations under the boussinesq approximation dunphy et al 2011 as such it serves as a non trivially demanding test for the accuracy and robustness of an incompressible flow solver when run in inviscid mode in a uniform depth channel the isw should propagate at a constant theoretically prescribed speed while maintaining its initial waveform and having its total energy sum of kinetic and available potential energy remain unchanged when viscous diffusive terms are incorporated in the governing equation in a uniform depth free slip channel the isw s propagation speed waveform and energy content will undergo a weak adjustment due to viscous and diffusive effects in the wave interior as determined by the values of the wave scale reynolds numbers see eq 23 and schmidt numbers s c ν κ neglecting the above viscous diffusive effects if a gentle i e small slope bathymetric feature such as the gaussian bump considered here is now inserted the numerically simulated wave should propagate over it without any significant structural changes and should recover its original waveform a short downstream distance from the bump nonetheless per section 4 and when an approximate free slip boundary condition is used the finite curvature of the bump will produce a pseudo traction which will serve as an additional form of isw energy loss focused at the bottom boundary when a higher order spatial discretization is used as is the case here a more accurate quantification of the pseudo traction and its impact as an energy sink is possible on one hand the numerical dissipation at the smallest resolved scales in the wave interior and bottom boundary is minimal on the other so is the numerical dispersion which will not spuriously interfere with any subtle physical dispersion effects of the isw as it propagates over the bump furthermore through the particular high order discretization and the isoparametric approximation of the bottom boundary via curvilinear elements kopriva 2009 any spurious separation documented for analogous problems when linearly mapped elements are used steinmoeller et al 2016 is not observed hence any contributions to the pseudo traction will originate from assumptions in the formulation of the approximate free slip boundary condition the initial conditions of the isw are generated via the solution of the dubreil jacotin long djl equation dunphy et al 2011 for a continuous two layer stratification given by 22 ρ ρ 0 1 δ ρ 2 ρ 0 tanh z h 1 δ where ρ 0 1000 kgm 3 is the reference density δ ρ 40 kgm 3 is the difference between the lower and upper densities h 1 3 cm is the upper layer depth and δ 0 5 cm is the interface thickness the isw is generated for an initial available potential energy ape of a p e 5 1 0 5 m 4 s 2 with an initial wavelength l w 0 69 m and a propagation speed c 0 114 ms 1 the domain dimensions are h 15 cm the domain height and l 7 l w 4 83 m the domain length the centre of the gaussian hill is placed in the middle of the computational domain with a height of h g 0 03 h and width l g 3 l w 4 the problem configuration is shown in fig 2 the simulation is stopped when the isw arrives at a along bed position which is symmetric to the wave s starting position with respect to the centre of gaussian bump the benchmark isw is intentionally chosen to be moderate in amplitude as measured by the ratio of wave induced maximum isopycnal displacement to water column depth which is equal to approximately 24 such a moderate amplitude isw will operate well below the convective or shear instability limits lamb 2003 both in uniform depth water but also while propagating over the gaussian bump such instabilities would drive elevated dissipation in the wave interior which would complicate any comparison thereof with the energy lost purely due to pseudo traction see section 5 5 finally the choice of amplitude of gaussian bump elevation is motivated by similar arguments as a steeper bump would enhance the likelihood of the above flow instabilities the maximum slope of the bump at hand is 3 which is less than the maximum bathymetric slope found in recent observational and modelling studies of isws shoaling in the south china sea rivera rosario et al 2020 lien et al 2012 lamb and warn varnas 2015 in regards to spatial discretization the nodal version of the spectral element method sem patera 1984 is used with m x 20 and m z 13 of quadrilateral elements in the x and z directions respectively for a polynomial order per element per dimension p 15 which corresponds to n x n z 301 196 grid points the high polynomial order is chosen to minimize any numerical dissipation and dispersion as discussed above a grid stretching technique applied to element height is used with δ z i 1 0 75 δ z i where δ z i is the height of the i th element a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the exact and approximate implementations of the free slip boundary condition is performed for three different values of wave based reynolds number r e 23 r e c h ν specifically values of r e 2 5 1 0 4 1 0 5 and 4 1 0 5 are chosen with the middle value representative of an isw propagating in a typical laboratory flume carr et al 2008 each test case is denoted as r e x x x y y xxx can be 025 100 or 400 depending on the value of r e whereas yy can be sa and ip which correspond to the small angle approximation and inviscid pseudo traction approach respectively as elaborated in sections 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 an additional test case with a no slip bottom boundary condition is also considered using the shorthand notation ns at each r e to compare free slip pseudo traction to no slip bottom shear stresses for all the test cases the resolution along with the time step was kept constant and dictated by the no slip run of the highest r e number r e 4 1 0 5 to allow comparison across different implementations and r e numbers the time step d t 6 6 1 0 3 s is chosen such that the initial c f l number in the vertical direction is equal to 0 33 5 2 tangential bottom shear stress structure fig 4 shows the spatial structure of the tangential force traction f t as a function of along bed position and time over the time interval during which isw propagates over the gaussian bump the contour values of f t are scaled by the free stream dynamic pressure a measure of form drag computed based on the maximum wave induced horizontal velocity at the wave trough fig 4 is restricted to results for r e 2 5 1 0 4 for a particular boundary condition implementation the structure of f t is found to be independent of r e whereas its magnitude scales linearly with 1 r e as it is directly proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the fluid for the no slip case the tangential traction structure assumes values which are in direct response to bottom boundary layer formation under the wave and the resulting flow separation due to the isw induced adverse pressure gradient in the rear half of the wave boegman and stastna 2019 this particular structure of the tangential traction has been established prior to the arrival of the wave at the gaussian bump and subsequently tracks the propagating wave remaining relatively unchanged over the gaussian bump because of the moderate amplitude of the wave and steepness of the bathymetric bump no phenomena of enhanced bottom boundary layer separation are observed such as those reported by harnanan et al 2015 due to the adverse pressure gradient associated with the bathymetric bump itself finally for the lowest r e considered the magnitude of the local tangential traction can be as high as 3 of the bump induced form drag in contrast the structure of any non zero tangential traction for the case of an approximate free slip boundary is concentrated within a fixed region along the bottom boundary centred around the gaussian hill suggesting that the geometry of the bump and in particular its curvature is the primary driver fig 3 as such the peak positive tangential traction develops on the top of the hill for the lower r e considered this peak tangential traction is no greater than 2 1 0 5 of the bump induced form drag a distinctly small value the negative contour values that the tangential traction assumes for the two approximations are attributed to the overall change of sign of curvature i e convex at the beginning end of the gaussian bump fig 3 as noted in section 4 1 1 any results of the implicit formulation are not shown due to the formation of spurious high amplitude grid scale oscillations in the tangential traction which may be attributed to aliasing errors these errors result from the high order derivative terms of the bathymetry function ζ x eq 17 chosen to be an exact gaussian in our case as well as inconsistencies potentially introduced due to the modification of the variational formulation through the boundary integral terms associated with the updated natural boundary condition for the horizontal velocity component 5 3 pseudo traction as a function of curvature the prediction of the pseudo traction per the scaling of eq 11 is compared to the corresponding magnitude of the tangential free slip traction computed from the simulation results in fig 5 a c the comparison is restricted to the trough of the propagating isw where the tangential wave induced velocity is the largest noting that very similar trends occur along the entire gaussian bump for all r e examined the magnitude of the simulated tangential traction appears to scale linearly with the boundary curvature κ with a slope very close to the theoretically predicted μ t u consequently this a priori estimate of the pseudo traction by virtue of its scaling can be a useful assessment tool of the significance of the pseudo traction based on the flow s characteristic velocity and boundary s curvature 5 4 free slip to no slip traction ratio fig 4 and its higher r e counterparts not shown here indicate that the tangential traction computed from the different free slip implementation simulations is at least three orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding bottom tangential stress for the no slip case a simple predictive scaling for the ratio of pseudo traction f p to no slip traction f w leveraging the scaling of eq 11 as a function of either bump or isw based non dimensional parameters is 24 f p f w h r 1 r e details regarding the derivation are provided in appendix b eq 24 effectively indicates that the relative effect of pseudo traction is enhanced when the radius of curvature of a bathymetric feature r is considerably smaller than the water column depth h the practical implications of this dependence in the context of bathymetry resolution are further discussed in section 6 the predicted r e 1 2 scaling for f p f w is verified for our benchmark problem simulations in fig 6 shown on a log log plot since the ratio f p f w follows the expected power law behaviour see eq 24 consistent with the scaling analysis above the pseudo traction and the wall shear stress are computed at the trough of the wave at the highest point of curvature of the bottom boundary i e top of the gaussian bump oceanically relevant values of r e can be two to three orders of magnitude larger than the ones considered here adhering to the potentially limiting assumptions of laminar flow and constant viscosity near the bed pseudo traction may be regarded practically negligible at such r e section 6 addresses one scenario where such a claim might need to be reconsidered 5 5 energy lost due to pseudo traction so far we have established an understanding of the spatial structure of the free slip induced pseudo traction and its dependence on bathymetric curvature with a focus on the isw trough which carries the maximum horizontal wave induced velocity we now turn to investigating the associated cumulative energy losses along the entire wave footprint and over the full time required for the isw to propagate over the gaussian bump in particular a control volume cv analysis is used the boundaries of the cv coincide with those of the computational domain at any instance during which the isw propagates over the bottom gaussian bump the rate of change of kinetic energy in the fixed cv can be calculated as rowe et al 2020 25 d e d t ω u e p u 2 ν u s n d s ω ρ g w 2 ν s s d ω where e and e ρ 0 u 2 2 are the total kinetic energy and kinetic energy per unit volume respectively s is the strain rate tensor and n the outward wall normal vector notice that for impermeable boundaries n u 0 the boundary integral of eq 25 is equal to 26 2 ν ω u s n d s which corresponds to the kinetic energy loss due to viscous stresses on the boundaries of the control volume computational domain note that all the boundaries of the computational domain except the bottom one fig 2 are non deformed impermeable boundaries where the free slip boundary condition is exactly enforced thus any loss of kinetic energy due to physical or spurious viscous stresses will originate from the bottom boundary in the case of a no slip boundary this integral term is equal to zero since the velocity field assumes a zero value on the no slip boundary if instead an approximate free slip boundary condition is used pseudo traction is expected to drive the above loss of kinetic energy in that case for an impermeable bottom boundary with a tangential only velocity component the surface integral term eq 26 in combination with eq 10 becomes 27 2 ν ω u s n d s 2 ν ω u t s n d s 1 ρ 0 ω u f t d s one may now consider the relative importance of the time integrated energy lost to pseudo traction due to the approximate enforcement of the free slip condition with respect to that lost due to viscous dissipation in the domain interior in this regard one may ignore the buoyancy flux term i e the first of the two terms in the volume integral of the right hand side of eq 25 the time integrated ratio of energy lost due to pseudo traction and viscous dissipation may now be written as 28 r t 2 ν ω u s n d s d t t 2 ν ω s s d ω d t fig 7 shows the dependence of r on r e for the three reynolds numbers examined where time integration is applied over the time interval required for the isw to propagate over the bottom gaussian bump note the particularly small values o 10 4 r assumes irrespective of r e moreover the ratio value r appears to asymptotically assume a constant value as r e increases and approaches its oceanic counterpart whereas the analysis here considers two dimensional laminar flow in the wave interior the presence of turbulence and elevated viscous dissipation in the wave interior originating from shear or convective instabilities lien et al 2012 2014 moum et al 2003 would reduce the value of r even further at least in the context of a single topographic feature as considered here 6 discussion the relative magnitude of the pseudo traction on a deformed domain with respect to the equivalent bed stress of a no slip bottom boundary under the constraint of assuming two dimensional laminar flow at the bottom boundary has been examined for the benchmark of an isw propagating over a gaussian bump at three different r e representative of the laboratory scale or somewhat larger in value fig 6 the relative magnitude of the pseudo traction decreases with increasing r e with a 1 2 power law as predicted by the scaling analysis of section 5 4 consequently at oceanically relevant r e of o 1 0 8 1 0 9 the relative strength of the pseudo traction is expected to be reduced by as much as a factor of 100 as compared to what is shown in fig 6 however in practice near bed flows at such high r e will be inevitably three dimensional and turbulent sakai et al 2020a zulberti et al 2020 as discussed in the introduction a simulation of such complex three dimensional flows is practically not feasible due to the associated high computational cost inextricably linked to the resolution required to resolve the broad range of scales even in a partial manner in such a case a commonly used alternative is the use of an eddy viscosity which is often localized near the bottom lamb and warn varnas 2015 or is set equal to a constant background value at the boundary when it changes dynamically klymak et al 2010 klymak and legg 2010 a commonly used value of the eddy viscosity can be up to 4 to 6 orders of magnitude larger than its molecular counterpart lamb and warn varnas 2015 özgökmen et al 2004 as elaborated by özgökmen et al 2004 such high values will apply to both horizontal and vertical components of eddy viscosity for near boundary flows unlike what is the case in stratified mid water where the vertical component can be much weaker therefore when combined with the approximated free slip boundary use of an eddy viscosity is likely to drastically intensify the contribution of the resulting pseudo traction to the overall flow energetics nevertheless in the context of a large eddy simulation les subgrid scale model sagaut et al 2013 additional terms related to the model e g subgrid stress tensor will be introduced in the momentum equations and thus affect the overall coupling of the velocity components therefore their contribution to the overall pseudo traction needs to be carefully studied nonetheless any further investigation in the context of les subgrid scale modelling is out of the scope of the paper another possible increase of the pseudo traction contribution could be due to elevated curvature i e reduced radius of curvature of the bottom bathymetry see eq 24 nevertheless in this scenario a practical consideration needs to be taken into account high curvature boundaries are naturally very small in scale accurately representing them would require very high resolution which is prohibitive from an implementation standpoint furthermore the relative energy loss due to pseudo traction normalized by the viscous dissipation in the domain interior is shown as a function of r e number in fig 7 note that this ratio appears to plateau as r e is increased the energy lost due to pseudo traction over the time required for the wave to propagate over the gaussian bump is only 0 01 of the energy lost due to viscous dissipation over the same time interval therefore one can safely propose in the context of the benchmark at hand and the assumption of laminar flow within the water column that the effect of approximating the free slip bottom boundary condition to the overall flow energetics is also negligible in a time integrated sense such a claim would hold even more strongly if highly dissipative turbulence due to shear and convective instabilities were to be present in the isw interior under the restriction that the near bed flow is assumed to be laminar however in the case of an elevated near bed eddy viscosity discussed above any claim of negligible time integrated energetic significance of pseudo traction may have to be reconsidered 7 conclusions the exact enforcement of the free slip boundary condition on a deformed boundary introduces a coupling between the cartesian velocity components consequently solving for the velocity field under a free slip boundary condition adds a computational complexity which can be mitigated by approximating the free slip boundary to achieve an independent solve per each velocity component various free slip approximations have been proposed for a continuous high order galerkin numerical discretization with a possible extension to other weak form based and strong form based discretizations since the two proposed approximations are comprised of dirichlet and neumann type of boundary conditions these boundary conditions can be easily enforced strongly when a strong form based numerical discretization is used e g a finite difference method thus when these approximations are adopted the overall pseudo traction is expected to behave in a similar manner for the same type of flow irrespective of the numerical discretization the extension of these approximations to three dimensions follows naturally from its two dimensional counterpart now the pseudo traction will be a vector with two components the tangential and binormal to the bottom boundary with each component proportional to its respective curvature and thus to the tangent bi normal boundary velocity component therefore each component of the pseudo traction is expected to adhere to the scaling analyses presented in sections 4 and 5 4 the propagation of an internal solitary wave over a gaussian hill has been used as a benchmark to quantify the exerted traction on the fluid due an approximate free slip boundary condition the tangential traction i e pseudo traction associated with the approximated free slip boundary depends mainly on the magnitude of the tangential velocity component as well as the curvature of the deformed boundary the energy loss attributed to the pseudo traction compared to the total viscous dissipation accounts to a negligible percentage i e much less than 1 overall for oceanic flow modelling the effect of the pseudo traction seems to be negligible alleviating the modeller from the computational intricacies of solving a coupled vector equation for the velocity field however the significance of the pseudo traction to the overall flow energetics may possibly change in the case of an elevated near bottom eddy viscosity which poses an

continuously differentiable a 5 u z x u x x ζ x u x 2 ζ x 2 the natural boundary condition in eq a 3 is made independent of the vertical velocity component u z and thus eq 17 is derived appendix b scaling of pseudo traction to bottom shear stress ratio to this end one focuses on the isw trough which carries an induced horizontal current u in the no slip bottom case at this location under the wave one may assume that the development of the bottom boundary layer is driven purely by viscous diffusion and is not impacted by boundary layer separation under the propagating wave the boundary layer thickness may then be approximated as δ ν t if the bump s maximum radius of curvature which occurs at its centre is r 1 κ the time it takes for the wave to propagate up to this location is approximately t r c consequently if one further assumes that the near bed velocity profile is close to linear over a distance δ the wall shear stress for the no slip boundary for a purely tangential velocity u u t can be approximated as b 1 f w μ u t n μ u δ μ u κ r c ν f p r c ν where f p μ u κ is the pseudo traction due to an approximated free slip boundary per eq 11 the ratio of the pseudo traction to the bottom shear stress may then be written as a function of the isw based reynolds number as in eq 24 
23893,the formation of dense shelf water dsw and antarctic bottom water aabw in the southern ocean is an essential part of the thermohaline circulation and understanding this phenomenon is crucial for studying the global climate aabw is formed as dsw flows down the continental slope and mixes with the surrounding waters however dsw formation and its descent remains a poorly resolved issue in many ocean models we therefore simulated the formation and descent of dsw and investigated the model sensitivities to horizontal and vertical grid spacings the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm was used for the region off cape darnley in east antarctica one of the main aabw production areas where historical and mooring data are available for comparison simulations with coarse horizontal grid resolutions of order 10 km yielded high volumes of dsw on the shelf however the largest part of this dsw was transformed into intermediate water and advected westward horizontal model resolutions equal to or higher than 2 km were required to simulate the descent of dsw and a realistic aabw production simulated time series at a mooring located at a depth of 2 600 m showed periodic fluctuations in velocity and temperature of 0 3 m s 1 and 0 5 c respectively consistent with observations we also found that high resolution bathymetry datasets are crucial because the newly formed aabw volume was reduced by 20 when a smoother bathymetry was used on a 2 km resolution grid vertical resolution had little influence on model performance because the plume was much thicker 170 m than the grids width therefore reproducing the downslope flow of dsw and aabw formation in the cape darnley region can be achieved with a high horizontal resolution 2 km and a relatively coarse vertical resolution 100 m on the continental slope keywords ocean ice modeling ocean general circulation models ogcm regional ocean models polynyas dense water production downslope flow east

flow of dense shelf water dsw along the continental slope and the mixing of this descending dsw with other water masses bindoff et al 2000 orsi et al 1999 rodman and gordon 1982 dsw also called high salinity shelf water is a cold salty and dense water mass formed in winter mainly in coastal polynyas at several locations around antarctica markus et al 1998 morales maqueda et al 2004 renfrew et al 2002 williams et al 2010 when sea ice forms in winter brine rejection occurs and the salinity of the cold surface waters increases the water becomes denser and sinks towards the bottom over the continental shelf then flows down the continental slope via troughs and underwater canyons baines and condie 1998 gordon et al 2009 aabw is formed as dsw flows deeper and mixes with surrounding waters mainly modified circumpolar deep water mcdw or warm deep water foster and carmack 1976 gill 1973 nicholls et al 2009 whitworth iii et al 1998 the ross sea weddell sea the region off the adélie coast and the region off cape darnley are the known sites for dsw production and aabw formation fukamachi et al 2000 gordon et al 1993 jacobs et al 1970 ohshima et al 2013 rintoul 1998 williams et al 2010 aabw may also be formed in a similar way following the downslope flow of ice shelf water a water mass resulting from the cooling of waters flowing beneath an ice shelf foldvik et al 1985 modeling aabw formation is challenging and previous studies raised many issues requiring further investigations downes et al 2011 dutay et al 2002 england 1992 kerr et al 2009 kim and stossel 1998 renner et al 2009 sasai et al 2004 stössel et al 1998 treguier et al 2010 in many global climate models with coarse horizontal resolutions coarser than 20 km aabw is formed more as a result of deep ocean convection in the open ocean regions rather than sea ice formation on the shelf e g goosse et al 2001 heuzé et al 2013 stössel et al 1998 kiss et al 2020 modeled aabw formation through this inaccurate process yields unrealistic aabw properties azaneu et al 2014 another crucial issue lies in dsw pathways e g van sebille et al 2013 many global ocean circulation models successfully reproduce dsw formation on the shelf but cannot reproduce its flow down the continental slope e g rodehacke et al 2007 in particular excessive vertical and horizontal mixing could potentially disrupt dsw s properties as it flows down the continental slope heuzé et al 2013 suggested that modeled dsw in most coarse resolution models mixes with intermediate waters before it can reach the bottom of the continental slope mid to high resolution models horizontal resolution about 0 1 0 25 yield more realistic aabw production kiss et al 2020 newsom et al 2016 snow et al 2016 they can also reproduce the export of dsw from the shelf to the oceanic basins but with significant underestimation of the dense water volume transport and its variability e g kerr et al 2012 kusahara et al 2017 sasai et al 2004 in these cases either the quality of the bathymetric dataset kerr et al 2012 or the horizontal resolution of the model 10 20 km kusahara et al 2017 were insufficient to resolve the canyons and troughs through which the dsw flows resolving topographic corrugations of order 100 km is indeed crucial to properly reproduce dense water outflows through a continental slope matsumura and hasumi 2010 2011 muench et al 2009a some studies using models with horizontal resolutions ranging from to 2 to 10 km on the antarctic shelf and slope regions e g kusahara et al 2010 morrison et al 2020 show seemingly realistic dsw pathways but do not provide a systematic comparison with observed pathways or aabw properties kusahara et al 2010 2017 also noted that the vertical and horizontal resolutions of their model may still be insufficient to properly model aabw formation this is likely due to spurious vertical mixing generated by step like bottom topographical changes for horizontal resolutions of order 101 km and vertical resolutions of order 101 m wang et al 2008 more generally the vertical and horizontal resolutions needed in a model to reproduce dense water plumes depend on the plume thickness and the continental slope steepness winton et al 1998 here we sought to simulate the formation and descent of dsw off cape darnley and investigate its sensitivities to horizontal and vertical grid spacings this study focused on the cape darnley polynya cdp region in east antarctica as this is one of the main regions of aabw formation ohshima et al 2013 there have been several studies of this region including oceanographic observations remote sensing and numerical modeling aoki et al 2020 fraser et al 2019 hirano et al 2015 nakayama et al 2014 nihashi and ohshima 2015 ohshima et al 2013 tamura et al 2016 williams et al 2016 wong and riser 2011 nakayama et al 2014 studied the cdp region using a model with realistic settings and forced with a constant surface salt flux between march and october to simulate the effects of sea ice production with this configuration the model was able to reproduce dsw formation and its downslope flow in the region that study also elucidated the dynamics responsible for the periodic outflow of dsw previously observed by ohshima et al 2013 the present study builds up on nakayama et al s 2014 work by developing a coupled ice ocean model in the cdp region with realistic wind forcing and improved bathymetry data the model setting and its validation are described in section 2 and section 3 respectively we conducted sensitivity experiments to study the importance of fine scale bathymetry which may be required to accurately represent the formation and descent of dsw section 4 we then discussed the implications of our results on the modeling of aabw formation in other regions section 5 we also compared our model output with the results from the estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean ecco state estimate ecco consortium et al 2019 2021 zhang et al 2018 the solution of a global free running coupled ice ocean model which served as a base configuration to our model section 3 2 model and experimental setup the model was an eddy resolving regional configuration of the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 for the cdp region with hydrostatic approximation and dynamic thermodynamic sea ice losch et al 2010 our configuration was similar to that of nakayama et al 2018 with some adjustments to the model parameters that are indicated in table 1 nakayama et al s 2014 model in the cdp region used constant surface salt flux to represent the effects of sea ice formation good representation of ocean ice processes should benefit the modeling of dense waters kerr et al 2009 renner et al 2009 and as such the main improvement we brought to nakayama et al s 2014 configuration was the inclusion of sea ice modeling our model also included realistic wind forcing and we improved the quality of the bathymetric dataset by including newer high resolution bathymetry data in the vicinity of the wild canyon fig 1 the most crucial area within the model domain the model simulation was conducted for the year 2008 and the model was forced using the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf 6 hourly atmospheric data from the era interim reanalysis product we applied a permanent fast ice mask based on fraser et al 2019 2020 fig 1 green shading the horizontal coordinate system was cartesian and the vertical coordinate system was a z grid with shaved grid cells adcroft et al 1997 we conducted a 1 year spin up of the model at a horizontal resolution of 4 km and with a 50 layer vertical grid see next chapter the spin up was initialized from a historical conductivity temperature and depth ctd dataset boyer et al 2018 treasure et al 2017 see section 3 1 mapped following shimada et al 2017 we then used the spin up temperature and salinity output on day 366 as initial conditions for all the sensitivity experiments table 2 a test simulation at 4 km resolution was conducted initialized with a 2 year spin up and yielded similar results as the simulation with a 1 year spin up the current velocity was uniformly set to 0 m s 1 as the initial condition the temperature and salinity boundary conditions were obtained from seasonal climatologies estimated from our historical ctd dataset following shimada et al 2017 the ocean current and sea ice boundary conditions were obtained from the monthly ecco ll270 state estimate zhang et al 2018 a passive tracer was restored to unity at the surface with a restoring time scale of an hour to detect the main pathways of dsw across the slope we designed various experiments using different horizontal and vertical resolutions table 2 the finest horizontal resolution was 1 km and the coarsest resolution was 16 km close to that of the ecco product the 16 km case may then represent the production and descent of dsw in coarse resolution global circulation models we also ran a 40 m vertical 2 km horizontal resolution 40m2km experiment with a 16 km resolution bathymetry linearly interpolated to the 2 km resolution grid this experiment is hereafter referred to as the 2 km smoothed case to assess how the accuracy of the bathymetric data may affect the downslope flow of dsw the coarsest vertical resolution was that of the ecco product whose 50 layers varied from a width of 10 m at the surface to 465 m at a depth of 5000 m the 40 m vertical grid had the same resolution as the ecco grid for those cells whose width was smaller than 40 m and all other grid cells had a width of 40 m the 20 m grid was built following the same principle and all cell widths for the 10 m grid were 10 m 3 data and validation 3 1 datasets 3 1 1 bathymetry data the model bathymetry data were based on ship based multibeam echo sounder data and the global relief model etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 multibeam bathymetric data were acquired by a 20 khz frequency seabeam3020 system l3 communications elac nautik installed on the r v hakuho maru and japanese icebreaker shirase the data were acquired during three hakuho maru cruises in february march 2008 cruise kh 08 leg 4 january march 2016 cruise kh 16 leg 1 and january february 2019 cruise kh 19 leg 1 and five successive japanese antarctic research expeditions jare from 2009 to 2013 jare no 51 55 the shirase data were provided by the japanese coast guard for scientific utilization most of the multibeam bathymetric data were acquired in the vicinity of the wild canyon on the eastern half of the domain and cover about 60 of the area within the orange box in fig 1 the sound velocity was corrected with real time data of the surface water velocity deep sea observations of ctd cast and expendable ctd xctd profiles the caris hips and sips software teledyne caris inc ltd fredericton canada was used for raw data processing the remaining blanks in the bathymetric map were interpolated using the global relief model etopo1 at 1 arc minute intervals the bathymetric model with a 500 m resolution was finally generated using all data mentioned above data were processed using the gmt system wessel et al 2013 and the bathymetric data were gridded using a weighted nearest neighbor algorithm and surface algorithm using adjustable tension continuous curvature splines 3 1 2 hydrographic and current velocity data historical temperature and salinity data acquired in the cdp region were used to validate the model results the dataset mostly comprised biologging data from the marine mammals exploring the oceans pole to pole consortium treasure et al 2017 which constitutes the largest source of ctd data in the polar regions most of the data on the continental shelf fig 1 were acquired via biologging this dataset was supplemented by argo floats and historical ctd data obtained from the world ocean database 2018 boyer et al 2018 a total of 1934 data points exist within the model domain at a depth of 200 m data were mostly acquired between 2007 and 2017 the m3 mooring was located in the wild canyon fig 1 and deployed at a depth of 2608 m recording temperature salinity and current velocity at discrete depths from 26 224 m above the bottom the m3 data constitute the main comparison data here because ohshima et al 2013 primarily observed dsw descent at this location to compare the velocity between the model and observation a time series based on data 220 m above the bottom was used because the meridional velocity at m3 in the model was not defined in the bottom most cell at most resolutions the m3 velocity time series at 224 and 26 m above the bottom had comparable characteristics the current at m3 is bottom intensified ohshima et al 2013 and the main difference between the current velocity at the two depths is a smaller amplitude of variations at 224 m 0 3 m s 1 than at 26 m above the bottom 0 5 m s 1 the comparison for the temperature and salinity was based on data located 20 m above the bottom we refer to the data 200 m above the bottom as near bottom and the data 20 m above the bottom as bottom data a comparison of the model data with time series at m1 m2 and m4 fig 1 was conducted as well section 4 2 3 1 3 water masses definition the main water masses discussed in our study are dsw and aabw we defined these two water masses in the θ s space based on ohshima et al 2013 specifically aabw is the water with neutral density γ 28 27 kg m 3 and potential density θ 0 4 c and dsw is the water with θ 1 26 c and s 31 61 other water masses mentioned in this paper were defined according to orsi and wiederwohl 2009 namely antarctic surface water aasw with γ 28 00 kg m 3 and mcdw with 28 00 γ 28 27 kg m 3 because aabw exists permanently at the bottom of the continental slope in the cdp region aoki et al 2020 the production of newly formed aabw was estimated by calculating the volume of water below 2000 m depth colder than 0 4 c and with a tracer concentration greater than 0 05 section 4 1 when analyzing the tracer experiment results figs 6 8 we may use the more generic term dense water when referring regardless of its depth to water colder than 0 4 c and with a tracer concentration greater than 0 05 3 2 model evaluation 3 2 1 sea ice production we first evaluated the model sea ice production of the 40m2km experiment control run against sea ice production estimated from advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e data following nakata et al 2019 2021 the time series of daily observed and modeled sea ice production fig 2 were in good agreement r 0 76 for most of 2008 the seasonal pattern in the model and satellite observations were consistent and remarkably the short term variability in the model also agreed well with that of the observations e g between day 193 205 and day 262 276 the modeled sea ice production was only slightly larger on average 0 87 km3 day 1 than the observations 0 75 km3 day 1 and lasted for a shorter duration day 65 308 vs day 25 320 such discrepancy between model and data can be considered small though 3 2 2 time averaged hydrography the results of the control run were compared to historical data along a cross section through wild canyon fig 1 the data within this cross section were averaged over the year 2008 for the model and all available years for the observations the model and observations showed the same vertical distribution of water masses towards the offshore and the influence of dsw on the shelf specifically for both model and observations the water column on the offshore side exhibited a 100 200 m thick layer of cold θ 1 c fig 3a b and fresh s 34 4 fig 3c d antarctic surface water above the warmer 0 c θ 1 c and saltier s 34 6 mcdw besides dsw was present on the shelf at the bottom of the burton basin in both sections noted b b in fig 3a b this dsw was likely produced in winter and subsequently stored in the basin nakayama et al 2014 it had the highest neutral density γ n 28 5 kg m 3 of the entire section a typical property of the dsw formed in the cdp region williams et al 2016 aabw was present in the model along the slope down from 800 m depth and covered the oceanic basin up to 500 m above the bottom fig 3b d f few observations were available below 2000 m note the discontinuity in values at 2000 m in fig 3a c and traces of aabw were only present along the slope around 1300 m depth in the observation section fig 3a c e the model data on the shelf poleward of the burton basin was colder by 0 2 c and saltier by 0 3 than observations this is likely because of the very small number of observations in winter when the water on the shelf is colder and saltier the root mean square rms difference in temperature and salinity between the simulated and observed sections for the respective ranges of 0 200 m and 200 2000 m were 0 27 and 0 09 for salinity 0 33 c and 0 38 c for temperature and 0 36 kg m 3 and 0 28 kg m 3 for neutral density these differences between the model and observations may be due to 1 the scarce distribution of observations with data averaged within a 50 km radius of each point along the section and 2 the low number of observations in winter resulting in an underrepresentation of periods of dsw formation and downslope flow in the dataset because the observations are averaged over more than 10 years with data mainly acquired between 2007 and 2017 interannual variabilities could also be responsible for some of the discrepancies 3 2 3 time series at bottom mooring m3 the modeled time series of the near bottom and bottom properties at m3 showed notable similarities with the time series obtained from the mooring data the observed flow 224 m above the bottom at m3 was characterized by a very weak and steady current until day 152 fig 4a after this day high frequency variations with 5 day period ohshima et al 2013 and with a maximum amplitude of 0 3 m s 1 occurred until around day 330 high frequency oscillations still occurred after day 330 albeit with a smaller amplitude the time series of the modeled current velocity showed high frequency oscillations fig 4a but only between day 172 and day 315 the shorter time span of modeled vs data high frequency oscillations could be related to the shorter duration of the sea ice production season in the model fig 2 in the observed temperature and salinity time series a sudden drop by about 0 5 c occurred around day 150 as the current velocity started to oscillate fig 4b c this drop was followed by high frequency variability similar to that of the current the modeled temperature and salinity abruptly dropped similarly to the observations and showed a comparable high frequency variability lasting only between day 172 and day 315 as well besides modeled temperature and salinity during this period were lower than the observations respectively by 0 13 c and 0 02 on average these negative biases are reasonable when compared to other high resolution models in the southern ocean e g newsom et al 2016 nakayama et al 2018 and compensated each other in terms of neutral density resulting in an insignificant averaged difference 0 00 kg m 3 in γ n between model and data 3 3 evaluation of the ecco state estimate in the cdp region we present the simulated hydrography in the cape darnley region of a well known global ice ocean model ecco llc270 zhang et al 2018 also based on mitgcm we note that many other global and regional simulations e g the southern ocean state estimate sose mazloff et al 2010 or the simple ocean data assimilation soda carton and giese 2008 are capable of simulating aabw production better than ecco ll270 and we show the simulated results of the ecco ll270 state estimate as an example because our surface boundary conditions and lateral boundary conditions of ocean current came from this state estimate the reader is referred to azaneu et al 2014 and dotto et al 2014 respectively for a full assessment of a previous version of ecco and a comparative study of reanalysis products in the weddell sea the output from the model s control run and ecco for september 2008 were compared along the same cross section as in fig 3 evidence of dsw production in both models is suggested by the presence of very cold water θ 1 5 c on the shelf fig 5a 5b with temperature close to the freezing point consistent with observed dsw properties aoki et al 2020 ohshima et al 2013 williams et al 2016 the production of dsw in ecco and our model is also evident in the monthly time series of neutral density in 2008 averaged over the shelf regions at a depth of 95 m fig 5c both time series indeed showed a strong increase 0 6 0 7 kg m 3 in neutral density starting in march model or may ecco with the maximum density reached in september model or october ecco the delay in density increase in ecco was likely caused by an approximately 80 underestimation of the polynya area within the model s domain in the state estimate not shown the underestimate of the polynya area in ecco may be related to the choice of air drag coefficient along and near the bottom of the continental slope the differences between the model and ecco data suggest that the dsw produced near the surface by ecco did not flow down the slope in our model dsw downslope flow was evident from the cold waters 1 c present all along the continental slope from the shelf break at around 400 m to the bottom of the oceanic basin at around 2500 m fig 5b in contrast waters colder than 0 c did not exist beyond 500 m in the ecco state estimate section fig 5a large differences also existed between the two models output in the time series of neutral density averaged over the slope regions at a 1900 m depth fig 5d in our model the neutral density started to increase in may two months after the onset of dsw and sea ice production consistent with ohshima et al s 2013 observations at m3 in ecco the neutral density time series did not show any time variation indicating that no dense water reached this depth such a problem was also documented in the weddell sea for ecco2 by azaneu et al 2014 who suggested that both changes in resolution and parametrisation e g vertical mixing convective processes could help to improve the modeling of aabw in ecco 4 results 4 1 sensitivity on horizontal and vertical resolutions 4 1 1 aabw volume the dense water volumes obtained from different horizontal resolutions at a fixed vertical resolution of 40 m suggest that resolutions of 2 km or better can produce aabw in reasonable amounts that reaches the bottom of the continental slope fig 6 aabw refers to waters with potential temperature less than 0 4 c and tracer concentration greater than 0 05 although experiments at all resolutions yielded a significant volume of aabw below 2000 m the maximum aabw volume was strongly dependent on resolution increasing from 7100 km3 16 km to 15 900 km3 1 km the time series of the 2 km and 1 km cases were comparable which suggests a 2 km resolution threshold we estimated the daily volume transport by calculating the time derivative of the daily volumes fig 6a the annual volume transports for the 1 km and 2 km resolution cases 0 51 sv and 0 50 sv respectively were consistent with previous estimates of 0 5 sv of aabw transport in the wild canyon ohshima et al 2013 nakayama et al 2014 the 4 km and 8 km resolution experiments also yielded reasonable yearly averaged estimates 0 44 sv and 0 38 sv respectively despite large differences in the time series compared with the 1 km or 2 km cases fig 6a only the 16 km resolution case annual volume transport 0 26 sv was inconsistent with previous estimates the depth volume profiles averaged between day 180 and day 270 fig 6b suggest that for resolutions of 8 km and less large amounts of dense water stayed mid depths whereas for resolutions of 2 km and more most dense waters flowed towards the slope s bottom for example the largest volume of dense water below 500 m was found at 1300 m depth 110 km3 for the 16 km resolution and at 2350 m for the 1 km and 2 km resolutions 140 km3 changing the criterion of aabw definition to θ 0 7 c instead of θ 0 4 c resulted in little to no aabw below 2000 m for resolutions lower than 4 km but still significant aabw amounts 95 km3 at 2350 m for the 1 km and 2 km resolutions cases fig 6c this suggests that at low 4 km resolutions even though some dense water flowed down to below 2000 m depth fig 6a b dsw warmed excessively along its way to the bottom we suggest as heuzé et al 2013 did that a large portion of dsw was changed into intermediate water thus explaining why the maximum volume of dense water was found at mid depth fig 6b the warming and concurrent loss of density of the dense water were possibly due to excessive convective mixing with surrounding waters winton et al 1998 reducing the quality of the bathymetric dataset significantly decreased the production of aabw the volume time series of the 2 km smoothed case were similar to those at 4 km resolution fig 6a with a maximum aabw volume 12 800 km3 about 20 less than that of the standard 2 km resolution 15 900 km3 meanwhile the maximum volume in the smoothed bathymetry case 80 km3 was about half that of the standard case in the depth volume profile 140 km3 fig 6b changing the vertical resolution had little influence on the volume of dense water produced and flowing to the bottom the dense water volume profiles for all four different vertical resolutions at 2 km fig 7a 4 km and 1 km not shown horizontal resolutions showed no significant difference a slight dependence on vertical resolution existed for resolutions of 8 km fig 7b and 16 km not shown however even a 10 m resolution 10m8km case yielded significantly lower dense water volume than the 40m2km or 40m1km cases fig 7b 4 1 2 pathways ohshima et al 2013 and nakayama et al 2014 suggested that the downslope flow of dsw in the cdp region follows topographical features such as underwater canyons to evaluate the descent pathways at different horizontal resolutions we vertically integrated the amount of tracer within 400 m of the bottom and calculated the average of this quantity referred to as bottom tracer hereafter between day 170 and day 220 fig 8 at low resolutions fig 8a c the bottom tracer was mostly confined to the shelf and only small amounts of tracer existed along the slope the isoline of 100 tracer concentration iso100 thick solid white line in fig 8 was generally located close to the 1000 m isobath and the contour line of iso40 thick solid blue line in fig 8 reached or exceeded the 2500 m isobath the relatively high amount of bottom tracer west of 65 e at 8 km and 16 km resolutions suggests a stronger westward advection of dense water at these resolutions such advection is evidenced in fig 9a b which shows the temporally averaged and vertically integrated tracer concentration between 1000 m and 2000 m mid depth tracer in these cases the largest amount of mid depth tracer was found far offshore over the oceanic basin depth 2500 m on the western side of the domain the strong mid depth concentration further suggests that at these low resolutions dsw was mainly transformed into intermediate waters and subsequently advected westward at high resolutions 2 and 1 km fig 8e f high concentrations of bottom tracer existed throughout the continental slope west of 68 e iso100 extended beyond the 2000 m isobath and iso40 reached the 3000 m isobath west of 64 e meanwhile the mid depth tracer fig 9c was essentially confined to the continental slope between the 1000 m and the 2500 m isobaths consistent with a downslope flow at these resolutions pathways represented by arrows in fig 8e f could be distinguished through the contours of bottom tracer iso40 or iso100 the most obvious pathway was a northward extension along the left flank of the wild canyon again the 2 km and 1 km resolutions yielded comparable results fig 8e f the tracer concentration in the 2 km smoothed bathymetry case fig 8d presented more similarities with the 8 km resolution fig 8b than with the 2 km fig 8e standard case this further indicates the strong effect of bathymetry data quality on the downslope processes in the model 4 1 3 slope s bottom flow characteristics the near bottom and bottom variability of ocean current and hydrographic properties at the mooring m3 were described in section 3 2 3 the time series outputs at 40 m vertical resolution 1 km and 2 km resolutions were consistent with observational data with only minor differences the current from the two cases exhibited a high frequency variability comparable to that of the observations as seen from the time series fig 10a vs fig 10b c and the energy spectra fig 11a vs fig 11b compared to the 2 km resolution case the current at the 1 km resolution had characteristics slightly closer to the observations in terms of oscillations amplitude fig 10b c and spectral density in particular the two maxima of the observed spectrum at the 5 day and 3 8 day periods fig 11a were replicated only in the 1 km case fig 11b the better definition of corrugations at 1 km resolution possibly explains this more accurate spectral definition this is consistent with nakayama et al s 2014 finding that the frequency of the downslope flow in the cdp region increases with the slope steepness the temperature time series of the 1 km and 2 km were remarkably similar to one another fig 12b c the only significant difference between these two time series and the observed temperatures fig 12a consisted in the later starting dates of the oscillations day 170 vs day 152 the discrepancies between the simulated ocean states at these two resolutions and the observations can be considered minor and both 1 km and 2 km resolutions reproduced the main characteristics of the flow the 4 km resolution case failed to replicate observations fig 10d 12d producing smaller amplitude oscillations 0 05 m s 1 and no high frequency variability in the temperature time series the temperature dropped only by 0 3 c on day 197 nearly 50 days after the observations the amplitude and frequency of the current and temperature variations in the 2 km smoothed case magenta line in fig 10c 12c generally resembled those at 4 km resolution the 8 km and 16 km outputs compared poorly to observations figs 10e f 12e f the velocity time series exhibited weak oscillations at 8 km resolution and no variability at 16 km resolution the temperature time series exhibited no significant variability at these resolutions which is consistent with the absence of dense water colder than 0 7 c beyond 2000 m depth in these cases fig 6c 4 1 4 aabw θ s properties the θ s observations at m3 showed a sharp contrast in properties before and after day 160 with data distributed on either side of the 28 35 kg m 3 isopycnal fig 13f before day 160 the θ s properties were located along the 28 32 kg m 3 isopycnal with little dispersion after day 150 the water tended to become colder fresher and denser and the observations were more dispersed the aabw salinity ranged 34 60 to 34 66 the potential temperature ranged 0 5 c to 1 0 c and the neutral density varied between 28 35 kg m 3 and 28 42 kg m 3 the averaged properties of aabw in the cdp region referred to as cdbw in ohshima et al 2013 are a neutral density of 28 37 kg m 3 a salinity of 34 64 and a potential temperature of 0 67 c in the model the changes in water properties associated with aabw formation were only observed at resolutions of 2 km or more the increase in density decrease in temperature and salinity and widening of the θ s range after day 170 were seen in the 2 km fig 13b and 1 km fig 13a resolutions the resulting averaged between day 200 and day 300 neutral densities respectively 28 39 kg m 3 and 28 37 kg m 3 were very close to the observations the model cases at the 4 km fig 13d and 2 km smoothed fig 13c resolutions produced weaker changes in temperature and salinity leading to the averaged properties of aabw being too warm 0 53 c and not dense enough 28 32 kg m 3 at resolutions of 8 km fig 13e and 16 km fig 13f aabw properties were grossly underestimated as only minor changes in temperature and salinity occurred leading to an averaged neutral density of only 28 30 kg m 3 the differences in properties for the horizontal resolutions equal to or lower than 4 km are also illustrated in the taylor diagram taylor 2001 of daily bottom neutral density at m3 fig 14 a taylor diagram summarizes in one plot the standard deviation of each time series as well as the rms difference and cross correlation between model and observed time series the results in the taylor diagram suggest that all different vertical resolutions with a fixed horizontal resolution of 2 km yielded accurate θ s properties similar to those of fig 13b the time series at four different vertical resolutions indeed presented nearly identical values of correlation and root mean square difference vs observation and standard deviation 4 2 characteristics of the downslope flow at other mooring locations 1 km resolution in addition to m3 the model could recreate the variations of the different properties at other mooring locations where the downslope flow presented different characteristics fig 15 ohshima et al 2013 observed that the downslope flow of dsw at m2 occurred nearly two months before that at m3 they concluded that the earlier arrival of cold waters at m2 indicated a westward advection of the dsw at the beginning of the dsw production season the model captured the earlier descent of dense water at m2 fig 15b and m1 fig 15a albeit with a significant lag 25 to 30 days to the observations at m4 the model only reproduced the lower frequency variability t 20 days but not the higher frequency signal fig 15d williams et al 2016 demonstrated that in the region of the m4 mooring the water properties near the bottom are influenced by fresher modified shelf water originating from the mackenzie bay polynya the mackenzie bay polynya is located southeast and outside of our model domain and the fresher dsw produced there is transported northwards towards the cdp via the prydz channel we surmise that the discrepancies between observations and model data at m4 are due to the exclusion of this upstream source of fresher dense water from our model domain 5 discussion 5 1 horizontal and vertical resolutions required for the cape darnley region the vertical and horizontal resolutions required for accurately modeling density driven downslope flows depend on the plume thickness and the slope angle winton et al 1998 specifically for a plume of layer thickness h flowing over a slope of angle α the vertical resolution r v must be finer than h 2 and the horizontal resolution r h should satisfy r h r v α our results demonstrated that resolutions of 2 km or higher are necessary to accurately reproduce the aabw formation process whereas vertical resolution had little effect on the model performance we now reexamine our findings by calculating the critical values r v c and r h c required for modeling aabw production off cape darnley following winton et al s 1998 hypothesis to determine r h c in the cdp region we first estimated a depth plume thickness vertical profile fig 16a from the 2 km resolution case along the wild canyon section shown in fig 3 the plume thickness was defined at all points along the slope as the thickness of the layer with γ 28 27 kg m 3 and θ 0 4 c and data were averaged between day 170 and day 300 to obtain the profile the profile exhibited two local minima near the shelf break h 171 m at 300 m depth and the bottom of the continental slope h 240 m at 2300 m depth and a maximum around 1200 m depth h 505 m this vertical structure is consistent with observations of plume thickness at various points along the slope by gordon et al 2009 in the ross sea and the modeled plume thickness of 400 m at 2600 m depth fig 16a agrees with the observation based estimate by ohshima et al 2013 the general shape of the plume thickness profile followed that of the angle α fig 16b which varied strongly along the slope the vertical profile of required r h fig 16c showed little variability down to about 1300 m and had a minimum value of 2 1 km at 750 m depth we can therefore define the critical horizontal resolution in the cdp region as r h c 2 1 km this value is consistent with the results of our previous analysis suggesting the existence of a 2 km resolution threshold which validates winton et al 1998 hypothesis above the 2 km threshold excessive warming fig 6c of the water within the dsw plume likely led to a loss of density which made the bulk of the dense water stay mid depth fig 6b this intermediate water was then advected westward by the ambient current fig 9a b below the 2 km resolution threshold the properties within the dense water plume were better conserved as colder water reached the slope s bottom fig 6c through realistic paths fig 8e f allowing for aabw to be produced in reasonable amounts fig 6a and with accurate ts properties fig 13a b minor differences existed in the 1 km vs 2 km resolution time series of current velocity figs 10b c and 11 but this had little influence on aabw properties fig 13a b our previous analysis suggested that our model in the cdp region was nearly insensitive to vertical resolution fig 7 14 this is rather unsurprising because the 40 m 20 m and 10 m grids all had a vertical resolution much finer than the r v c 85 m table 3 required for this region however many models have a vertical grid with depth varying layer width such as the ecco grid we used in some of our experiments table 2 the modeled plume thickness varied between 170 m and 505 m in the cdp region and a comparison between the plume thickness and the ecco grid width fig 16a shows that even this relatively coarse grid satisfies r v h 2 at all depths above 2000 m 5 2 implications for the other aabw formation regions we estimated the slope steepness α and plume thickness h for the weddell sea the ross sea and the adelie coast we estimated α at all points along the slope from the etopo1 global relief model amante and eakins 2009 by calculating the distance separating the 500 m and 1500 m isobaths we also provided ranges and an averaged value of plume thickness for each region based on observations reported in previous works in table 3 averaged values of α and h in the cdp region were also provided for comparison the results listed in table 3 suggest that modeling the weddell sea and the ross sea would require relatively lower resolutions than in the cdp region due to the weaker slope inclination α ws 0 020 α rs 0 025 and relatively large plume thickness 300 m on average in these areas table 3 in contrast properly modeling the aabw formation process off adelie land may require higher resolutions due to the high slope inclination α 0 073 and the thinner plumes h a c 170 m observed in this region williams et al 2010 the lower horizontal resolution required for the weddell and ross seas may explain why several models with horizontal resolutions of 3 5 km newsom et al 2016 morrison et al 2020 or order 0 1 kerr et al 2012 kiss et al 2020 renner et al 2009 yielded relatively realistic dsw pathways and or estimates of downslope flow volumes or aabw formation rate in one or both of these seas in particular the densest bottom waters in newsom et al s 2016 high resolution community climate system model grid spacing 3 5 km were found in the ross sea and the weddell sea which implies that the resolution of that model was sufficient for these areas on the other hand the model by kusahara et al 2010 yielded realistic dsw production and pathways with horizontal resolution ranging between a few kilometers and 15 km in east antarctica but could not reproduce well the mixing process of the downsloping dsw this may be explained by the 2 1 km r h c for the cdp region being smaller than the resolution of this model 6 summary and conclusion aabw is an essential ocean water mass that plays a crucial role in the global thermohaline circulation however modeling the formation and downslope descent of dsw and aabw production is challenging in this study sensitivity tests with different vertical and horizontal resolutions were conducted to assess how resolution impacts dsw production and its downslope flow off the cdp the essential criterion controlling downslope flow was horizontal resolution for resolutions equal to or higher than a 2 km threshold the simulations yielded realistic downslope flow aabw properties and bottom current and hydrographic properties variability all consistent with observations in the region ohshima et al 2013 the processes leading to the formation and downslope flow in the cdp were properly captured by the model especially the periodic high frequency variability of the downslope flow in the wild canyon nakayama et al 2014 ohshima et al 2013 considering the continental slope angle and plume thickness in the cdp region the 2 km threshold we found was consistent with winton et al s 1998 hypothesis that horizontal resolution depends on these two parameters for resolutions lower than 2 km the comparison between model outputs and observations worsened with decreasing resolution for example at 4 km resolution the downslope flow was reduced by 20 compared to the 1 km and 2 km resolution and at 16 km resolution aabw density was strongly underestimated our results suggest that as the resolution was decreased increasing amounts of intermediate water were formed and advected westward to the detriment of aabw formation further we demonstrated that a bathymetric dataset with poor data density produced aabw with misestimated properties even at high horizontal resolutions when a 16 km resolution bathymetry was linearly interpolated to the 2 km resolution grid the downslope flow of dsw and properties of aabw were largely underestimated similar to the 4 km resolution results acquiring a high resolution bathymetric dataset in the four regions where aabw is formed is therefore essential to properly model bottom water formation in the polar regions our model results were mostly insensitive to vertical resolution because in most of the vertical grids tested the grid width was much smaller than half the plume thickness winton et al 1998 even with a coarse vertical grid such as that of the ecco state estimate 170 m wide at 2000 m a model with a fine horizontal resolution can reproduce the downslope flow of dsw and its volume in the cdp region as well as the main aabw characteristics our results suggest that coupled ice ocean models with a similar configuration as ours may properly model the formation and properties of aabw in other polynya regions of the world s oceans however as plume thickness and slope angle affect the resolutions needed to resolve the downslope flows differences in the resolutions required in the different aabw formation regions may exist sensitivity experiments conducted in this study clarified the crucial role of resolution and fine scale bathymetry for generating the downslope flow of dsw its pathways and the formation of aabw with properties close to observations while regional models can be conducted at high resolutions higher than 2 km at a reasonable computational cost global circulation models have to employ coarser resolutions parametrisation of topographic properties in these coarse resolution models is an essential matter e g matsumura and hasumi 2011 and our study is a step towards addressing this issue also while we found that resolutions of order 10 km are inadequate to model aabw formation parametrisation of the bottom boundary layer processes may enable to solve the issue of excessive convective mixing wang et al 2008 winton et al 1998 affecting models at these resolutions the development or improvement of such parametrisation is a topic that remains

23893,the formation of dense shelf water dsw and antarctic bottom water aabw in the southern ocean is an essential part of the thermohaline circulation and understanding this phenomenon is crucial for studying the global climate aabw is formed as dsw flows down the continental slope and mixes with the surrounding waters however dsw formation and its descent remains a poorly resolved issue in many ocean models we therefore simulated the formation and descent of dsw and investigated the model sensitivities to horizontal and vertical grid spacings the massachusetts institute of technology general circulation model mitgcm was used for the region off cape darnley in east antarctica one of the main aabw production areas where historical and mooring data are available for comparison simulations with coarse horizontal grid resolutions of order 10 km yielded high volumes of dsw on the shelf however the largest part of this dsw was transformed into intermediate water and advected westward horizontal model resolutions equal to or higher than 2 km were required to simulate the descent of dsw and a realistic aabw production simulated time series at a mooring located at a depth of 2 600 m showed periodic fluctuations in velocity and temperature of 0 3 m s 1 and 0 5 c respectively consistent with observations we also found that high resolution bathymetry datasets are crucial because the newly formed aabw volume was reduced by 20 when a smoother bathymetry was used on a 2 km resolution grid vertical resolution had little influence on model performance because the plume was much thicker 170 m than the grids width therefore reproducing the downslope flow of dsw and aabw formation in the cape darnley region can be achieved with a high horizontal resolution 2 km and a relatively coarse vertical resolution 100 m on the continental slope keywords ocean ice modeling ocean general circulation models ogcm regional ocean models polynyas dense water production downslope flow east

2013 schmitz 1995 understanding and modeling the formation and properties of aabw and how these vary is therefore a crucial topic in climate related studies aabw is formed as a result of the downslope flow of dense shelf water dsw along the continental slope and the mixing of this descending dsw with other water masses bindoff et al 2000 orsi et al 1999 rodman and gordon 1982 dsw also called high salinity shelf water is a cold salty and dense water mass formed in winter mainly in coastal polynyas at several locations around antarctica markus et al 1998 morales maqueda et al 2004 renfrew et al 2002 williams et al 2010 when sea ice forms in winter brine rejection occurs and the salinity of the cold surface waters increases the water becomes denser and sinks towards the bottom over the continental shelf then flows down the continental slope via troughs and underwater canyons baines and condie 1998 gordon et al 2009 aabw is formed as dsw flows deeper and mixes with surrounding waters

aabw may also be formed in a similar way following the downslope flow of ice shelf water a water mass resulting from the cooling of waters flowing beneath an ice shelf foldvik et al 1985 modeling aabw formation is challenging and previous studies raised many issues requiring further investigations downes et al 2011 dutay et al 2002 england 1992 kerr et al 2009 kim and stossel 1998 renner et al 2009 sasai et al 2004 stössel et al 1998 treguier et al 2010 in many global climate models with coarse horizontal resolutions coarser than 20 km aabw is formed more as a result of deep ocean convection in the open ocean regions rather than sea ice formation on the shelf e g goosse et al 2001 heuzé et al 2013 stössel et al 1998 kiss et al 2020 modeled aabw formation through this inaccurate process yields unrealistic aabw properties azaneu et al 2014 another crucial issue lies in dsw pathways e g van sebille et al 2013 many global ocean circulation models successfully reproduce dsw formation on the shelf but cannot reproduce its flow down the continental slope e g rodehacke et al 2007 in particular excessive vertical and horizontal mixing could potentially disrupt dsw s properties as it flows down the continental slope heuzé et al 2013 suggested that modeled dsw in most coarse resolution models mixes with intermediate waters before it can reach the bottom of the continental slope mid to high resolution models horizontal resolution about 0 1 0 25 yield more realistic aabw production kiss et al 2020 newsom et al 2016 snow et al 2016 they can also reproduce the export of dsw from the shelf to the oceanic basins but with significant underestimation of the dense water volume transport and its variability e g kerr et al 2012 kusahara et al 2017 sasai et al 2004 in these cases either the quality of the bathymetric dataset kerr et al 2012 or the horizontal resolution of the model 10 20 km kusahara et al 2017 were insufficient to resolve the canyons and troughs through which the dsw flows resolving topographic corrugations of order 100 km is indeed crucial to properly reproduce dense water outflows through a continental slope matsumura and hasumi 2010 2011 muench et al 2009a some studies using models with horizontal resolutions ranging from to 2 to 10 km on the antarctic shelf and slope regions e g kusahara et al 2010 morrison et al 2020 show seemingly realistic dsw pathways but do not provide a systematic comparison with observed pathways or aabw properties kusahara et al 2010 2017 also noted that the vertical and horizontal resolutions of their model may still be insufficient to properly model aabw formation this is likely due to spurious vertical mixing generated by step like bottom topographical changes for horizontal resolutions of order 101 km and vertical resolutions of order 101 m wang et al 2008 more generally the vertical and horizontal resolutions needed in a model to reproduce dense water plumes depend on the plume thickness and the continental slope steepness winton et al 1998 here we sought to simulate the formation and descent of dsw off cape darnley and investigate its sensitivities to horizontal and vertical grid spacings this study focused on the cape darnley polynya cdp region in east antarctica as this is one of the main regions of aabw formation ohshima et al 2013 there have been several studies of this region including oceanographic observations remote sensing and numerical modeling aoki et al 2020 fraser et al 2019 hirano et al 2015 nakayama et al 2014 nihashi and ohshima 2015 ohshima et al 2013 tamura et al 2016 williams et al 2016 wong and riser 2011 nakayama et al 2014 studied the cdp region using a model with realistic settings and forced with a constant surface salt flux between march and october to simulate the effects of sea ice production with this configuration the model was able to reproduce dsw formation and its downslope flow in the region that study also elucidated the dynamics responsible for the periodic outflow of dsw previously observed by ohshima et al 2013 the present study builds up on nakayama et al s 2014 work by developing a coupled ice ocean model in the cdp region with realistic wind forcing and improved bathymetry data the model setting and its validation are described in section 2 and section 3 respectively we conducted sensitivity experiments to study the importance of fine scale bathymetry which may be required to accurately represent the formation and descent of dsw section 4 we then discussed the implications of our results on the modeling of aabw formation in other regions section 5 we also compared our model output with the results from the estimating the circulation and climate of the ocean ecco state estimate ecco consortium et al 2019 2021 zhang et al 2018 the solution of a global free running coupled ice ocean model which served as a base configuration to our model section 3 2 model and experimental setup the model was an eddy resolving regional configuration of the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 for the cdp region with hydrostatic approximation and dynamic thermodynamic sea ice losch et al 2010 our configuration was similar to that of nakayama et al 2018 with some adjustments to the model parameters that are indicated in table 1 nakayama et al s 2014 model in the cdp region used constant surface salt flux to represent the effects of sea ice formation good representation of ocean ice processes should benefit the modeling of dense waters kerr et al 2009 renner et al 2009 and as such the main improvement we brought to nakayama et al s 2014 configuration was the inclusion of sea ice modeling our model also included realistic wind forcing and we improved the quality of the bathymetric dataset by including newer high resolution bathymetry data in the vicinity of the wild canyon fig 1 the most crucial area within the model domain the model simulation was conducted for the year 2008 and the model was forced using the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf 6 hourly atmospheric data from the era interim reanalysis product we applied a permanent fast ice mask based on fraser et al 2019 2020 fig 1 green shading the horizontal coordinate system was cartesian and the vertical coordinate system was a z grid with shaved grid cells adcroft et al 1997 we conducted a 1 year spin up of the model at a horizontal resolution of 4 km and with a 50 layer vertical grid see next chapter the spin up was initialized from a historical conductivity temperature and depth ctd dataset boyer et al 2018 treasure et al 2017 see section 3 1 mapped following shimada et al 2017 we then used the spin up temperature and salinity output on day 366 as initial conditions for all the sensitivity experiments table 2 a test simulation at 4 km resolution was conducted initialized with a 2 year spin up and yielded similar results as the simulation with a 1 year spin up the current velocity was uniformly set to 0 m s 1 as the initial condition the temperature and salinity boundary conditions were obtained from seasonal climatologies estimated from our historical ctd dataset following shimada et al 2017 the ocean current and sea ice boundary conditions were obtained from the monthly ecco ll270 state estimate zhang et al 2018 a passive tracer was restored to unity at the surface with a restoring time scale of an hour to detect the main pathways of dsw across the slope we designed various experiments using different horizontal and vertical resolutions table 2 the finest horizontal resolution was 1 km and the coarsest resolution was 16 km close to that of the ecco product the 16 km case may then represent the production and descent of dsw in coarse resolution global circulation models we also ran a 40 m vertical 2 km horizontal resolution 40m2km experiment with a 16 km resolution bathymetry linearly interpolated to the 2 km resolution grid this experiment is hereafter referred to as the 2 km smoothed case to assess how the accuracy of the bathymetric data may affect the downslope flow of dsw the coarsest vertical resolution was that of the ecco product whose 50 layers varied from a width of 10 m at the surface to 465 m at a depth of 5000 m the 40 m vertical grid had the same resolution as the ecco grid for those cells whose width was smaller than 40 m and all other grid cells had a width of 40 m the 20 m grid was built following the same principle and all cell widths for the 10 m grid were 10 m 3 data and validation 3 1 datasets 3 1 1 bathymetry data the model bathymetry data were based on ship based multibeam echo sounder data and the global relief model etopo1 amante and eakins 2009 multibeam bathymetric data were acquired by a 20 khz frequency seabeam3020 system l3 communications elac nautik installed on the r v hakuho maru and japanese icebreaker shirase the data were acquired during three hakuho maru cruises in february march 2008 cruise kh 08 leg 4 january march 2016 cruise kh 16 leg 1 and january february 2019 cruise kh 19 leg 1 and five successive japanese antarctic research expeditions jare from 2009 to 2013 jare no 51 55 the shirase data were provided by the japanese coast guard for scientific utilization most of the multibeam bathymetric data were acquired in the vicinity of the wild canyon on the eastern half of the domain and cover about 60 of the area within the orange box in fig 1 the sound velocity was corrected with real time data of the surface water velocity deep sea observations of ctd cast and expendable ctd xctd profiles the caris hips and sips software teledyne caris inc ltd fredericton canada was used for raw data processing the remaining blanks in the bathymetric map were interpolated using the global relief model etopo1 at 1 arc minute intervals the bathymetric model with a 500 m resolution was finally generated using all data mentioned above data were processed using the gmt system wessel et al 2013 and the bathymetric data were gridded using a weighted nearest neighbor algorithm and surface algorithm using adjustable tension continuous curvature splines 3 1 2 hydrographic and current velocity data historical temperature and salinity data acquired in the cdp region were used to validate the model results the dataset mostly comprised biologging data from the marine mammals exploring the oceans pole to pole consortium treasure et al 2017 which constitutes the largest source of ctd data in the polar regions most of the data on the continental shelf fig 1 were acquired via biologging this dataset was supplemented by argo floats and historical ctd data obtained from the world ocean database 2018 boyer et al 2018 a total of 1934 data points exist within the model domain at a depth of 200 m data were mostly acquired between 2007 and 2017 the m3 mooring was located in the wild canyon fig 1 and deployed at a depth of 2608 m recording temperature salinity and current velocity at discrete depths from 26 224 m above the bottom the m3 data constitute the main comparison data here because ohshima et al 2013 primarily observed dsw descent at this location to compare the velocity between the model and observation a time series based on data 220 m above the bottom was used because the meridional velocity at m3 in the model was not defined in the bottom most cell at most resolutions the m3 velocity time series at 224 and 26 m above the bottom had comparable characteristics the current at m3 is bottom intensified ohshima et al 2013 and the main difference between the current velocity at the two depths is a smaller amplitude of variations at 224 m 0 3 m s 1 than at 26 m above the bottom 0 5 m s 1 the comparison for the temperature and salinity was based on data located 20 m above the bottom we refer to the data 200 m above the bottom as near bottom and the data 20 m above the bottom as bottom data a comparison of the model data with time series at m1 m2 and m4 fig 1 was conducted as well section 4 2 3 1 3 water masses definition the main water masses discussed in our study are dsw and aabw we defined these two water masses in the θ s space based on ohshima et al 2013 specifically aabw is the water with neutral density γ 28 27 kg m 3 and potential density θ 0 4 c and dsw is the water with θ 1 26 c and s 31 61 other water masses mentioned in this paper were defined according to orsi and wiederwohl 2009 namely antarctic surface water aasw with γ 28 00 kg m 3 and mcdw with 28 00 γ 28 27 kg m 3 because aabw exists permanently at the bottom of the continental slope in the cdp region aoki et al 2020 the production of newly formed aabw was estimated by calculating the volume of water below 2000 m depth colder than 0 4 c and with a tracer concentration greater than 0 05 section 4 1 when analyzing the tracer experiment results figs 6 8 we may use the more generic term dense water when referring regardless of its depth to water colder than 0 4 c and with a tracer concentration greater than 0 05 3 2 model evaluation 3 2 1 sea ice production we first evaluated the model sea ice production of the 40m2km experiment control run against sea ice production estimated from advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e data following nakata et al 2019 2021 the time series of daily observed and modeled sea ice production fig 2 were in good agreement r 0 76 for most of 2008 the seasonal pattern in the model and satellite observations were consistent and remarkably the short term variability in the model also agreed well with that of the observations e g between day 193 205 and day 262 276 the modeled sea ice production was only slightly larger on average 0 87 km3 day 1 than the observations 0 75 km3 day 1 and lasted for a shorter duration day 65 308 vs day 25 320 such discrepancy between model and data can be considered small though 3 2 2 time averaged hydrography the results of the control run were compared to historical data along a cross section through wild canyon fig 1 the data within this cross section were averaged over the year 2008 for the model and all available years for the observations the model and observations showed the same vertical distribution of water masses towards the offshore and the influence of dsw on the shelf specifically for both model and observations the water column on the offshore side exhibited a 100 200 m thick layer of cold θ 1 c fig 3a b and fresh s 34 4 fig 3c d antarctic surface water above the warmer 0 c θ 1 c and saltier s 34 6 mcdw besides dsw was present on the shelf at the bottom of the burton basin in both sections noted b b in fig 3a b this dsw was likely produced in winter and subsequently stored in the basin nakayama et al 2014 it had the highest neutral density γ n 28 5 kg m 3 of the entire section a typical property of the dsw formed in the cdp region williams et al 2016 aabw was present in the model along the slope down from 800 m depth and covered the oceanic basin up to 500 m above the bottom fig 3b d f few observations were available below 2000 m note the discontinuity in values at 2000 m in fig 3a c and traces of aabw were only present along the slope around 1300 m depth in the observation section fig 3a c e the model data on the shelf poleward of the burton basin was colder by 0 2 c and saltier by 0 3 than observations this is likely because of the very small number of observations in winter when the water on the shelf is colder and saltier the root mean square rms difference in temperature and salinity between the simulated and observed sections for the respective ranges of 0 200 m and 200 2000 m were 0 27 and 0 09 for salinity 0 33 c and 0 38 c for temperature and 0 36 kg m 3 and 0 28 kg m 3 for neutral density these differences between the model and observations may be due to 1 the scarce distribution of observations with data averaged within a 50 km radius of each point along the section and 2 the low number of observations in winter resulting in an underrepresentation of periods of dsw formation and downslope flow in the dataset because the observations are averaged over more than 10 years with data mainly acquired between 2007 and 2017 interannual variabilities could also be responsible for some of the discrepancies 3 2 3 time series at bottom mooring m3 the modeled time series of the near bottom and bottom properties at m3 showed notable similarities with the time series obtained from the mooring data the observed flow 224 m above the bottom at m3 was characterized by a very weak and steady current until day 152 fig 4a after this day high frequency variations with 5 day period ohshima et al 2013 and with a maximum amplitude of 0 3 m s 1 occurred until around day 330 high frequency oscillations still occurred after day 330 albeit with a smaller amplitude the time series of the modeled current velocity showed high frequency oscillations fig 4a but only between day 172 and day 315 the shorter time span of modeled vs data high frequency oscillations could be related to the shorter duration of the sea ice production season in the model fig 2 in the observed temperature and salinity time series a sudden drop by about 0 5 c occurred around day 150 as the current velocity started to oscillate fig 4b c this drop was followed by high frequency variability similar to that of the current the modeled temperature and salinity abruptly dropped similarly to the observations and showed a comparable high frequency variability lasting only between day 172 and day 315 as well besides modeled temperature and salinity during this period were lower than the observations respectively by 0 13 c and 0 02 on average these negative biases are reasonable when compared to other high resolution models in the southern ocean e g newsom et al 2016 nakayama et al 2018 and compensated each other in terms of neutral density resulting in an insignificant averaged difference 0 00 kg m 3 in γ n between model and data 3 3 evaluation of the ecco state estimate in the cdp region we present the simulated hydrography in the cape darnley region of a well known global ice ocean model ecco llc270 zhang et al 2018 also based on mitgcm we note that many other global and regional simulations e g the southern ocean state estimate sose mazloff et al 2010 or the simple ocean data assimilation soda carton and giese 2008 are capable of simulating aabw production better than ecco ll270 and we show the simulated results of the ecco ll270 state estimate as an example because our surface boundary conditions and lateral boundary conditions of ocean current came from this state estimate the reader is referred to azaneu et al 2014 and dotto et al 2014 respectively for a full assessment of a previous version of ecco and a comparative study of reanalysis products in the weddell sea the output from the model s control run and ecco for september 2008 were compared along the same cross section as in fig 3 evidence of dsw production in both models is suggested by the presence of very cold water θ 1 5 c on the shelf fig 5a 5b with temperature close to the freezing point consistent with observed dsw properties aoki et al 2020 ohshima et al 2013 williams et al 2016 the production of dsw in ecco and our model is also evident in the monthly time series of neutral density in 2008 averaged over the shelf regions at a depth of 95 m fig 5c both time series indeed showed a strong increase 0 6 0 7 kg m 3 in neutral density starting in march model or may ecco with the maximum density reached in september model or october ecco the delay in density increase in ecco was likely caused by an approximately 80 underestimation of the polynya area within the model s domain in the state estimate not shown the underestimate of the polynya area in ecco may be related to the choice of air drag coefficient along and near the bottom of the continental slope the differences between the model and ecco data suggest that the dsw produced near the surface by ecco did not flow down the slope in our model dsw downslope flow was evident from the cold waters 1 c present all along the continental slope from the shelf break at around 400 m to the bottom of the oceanic basin at around 2500 m fig 5b in contrast waters colder than 0 c did not exist beyond 500 m in the ecco state estimate section fig 5a large differences also existed between the two models output in the time series of neutral density averaged over the slope regions at a 1900 m depth fig 5d in our model the neutral density started to increase in may two months after the onset of dsw and sea ice production consistent with ohshima et al s 2013 observations at m3 in ecco the neutral density time series did not show any time variation indicating that no dense water reached this depth such a problem was also documented in the weddell sea for ecco2 by azaneu et al 2014 who suggested that both changes in resolution and parametrisation e g vertical mixing convective processes could help to improve the modeling of aabw in ecco 4 results 4 1 sensitivity on horizontal and vertical resolutions 4 1 1 aabw volume the dense water volumes obtained from different horizontal resolutions at a fixed vertical resolution of 40 m suggest that resolutions of 2 km or better can produce aabw in reasonable amounts that reaches the bottom of the continental slope fig 6 aabw refers to waters with potential temperature less than 0 4 c and tracer concentration greater than 0 05 although experiments at all resolutions yielded a significant volume of aabw below 2000 m the maximum aabw volume was strongly dependent on resolution increasing from 7100 km3 16 km to 15 900 km3 1 km the time series of the 2 km and 1 km cases were comparable which suggests a 2 km resolution threshold we estimated the daily volume transport by calculating the time derivative of the daily volumes fig 6a the annual volume transports for the 1 km and 2 km resolution cases 0 51 sv and 0 50 sv respectively were consistent with previous estimates of 0 5 sv of aabw transport in the wild canyon ohshima et al 2013 nakayama et al 2014 the 4 km and 8 km resolution experiments also yielded reasonable yearly averaged estimates 0 44 sv and 0 38 sv respectively despite large differences in the time series compared with the 1 km or 2 km cases fig 6a only the 16 km resolution case annual volume transport 0 26 sv was inconsistent with previous estimates the depth volume profiles averaged between day 180 and day 270 fig 6b suggest that for resolutions of 8 km and less large amounts of dense water stayed mid depths whereas for resolutions of 2 km and more most dense waters flowed towards the slope s bottom for example the largest volume of dense water below 500 m was found at 1300 m depth 110 km3 for the 16 km resolution and at 2350 m for the 1 km and 2 km resolutions 140 km3 changing the criterion of aabw definition to θ 0 7 c instead of θ 0 4 c resulted in little to no aabw below 2000 m for resolutions lower than 4 km but still significant aabw amounts 95 km3 at 2350 m for the 1 km and 2 km resolutions cases fig 6c this suggests that at low 4 km resolutions even though some dense water flowed down to below 2000 m depth fig 6a b dsw warmed excessively along its way to the bottom we suggest as heuzé et al 2013 did that a large portion of dsw was changed into intermediate water thus explaining why the maximum volume of dense water was found at mid depth fig 6b the warming and concurrent loss of density of the dense water were possibly due to excessive convective mixing with surrounding waters winton et al 1998 reducing the quality of the bathymetric dataset significantly decreased the production of aabw the volume time series of the 2 km smoothed case were similar to those at 4 km resolution fig 6a with a maximum aabw volume 12 800 km3 about 20 less than that of the standard 2 km resolution 15 900 km3 meanwhile the maximum volume in the smoothed bathymetry case 80 km3 was about half that of the standard case in the depth volume profile 140 km3 fig 6b changing the vertical resolution had little influence on the volume of dense water produced and flowing to the bottom the dense water volume profiles for all four different vertical resolutions at 2 km fig 7a 4 km and 1 km not shown horizontal resolutions showed no significant difference a slight dependence on vertical resolution existed for resolutions of 8 km fig 7b and 16 km not shown however even a 10 m resolution 10m8km case yielded significantly lower dense water volume than the 40m2km or 40m1km cases fig 7b 4 1 2 pathways ohshima et al 2013 and nakayama et al 2014 suggested that the downslope flow of dsw in the cdp region follows topographical features such as underwater canyons to evaluate the descent pathways at different horizontal resolutions we vertically integrated the amount of tracer within 400 m of the bottom and calculated the average of this quantity referred to as bottom tracer hereafter between day 170 and day 220 fig 8 at low resolutions fig 8a c the bottom tracer was mostly confined to the shelf and only small amounts of tracer existed along the slope the isoline of 100 tracer concentration iso100 thick solid white line in fig 8 was generally located close to the 1000 m isobath and the contour line of iso40 thick solid blue line in fig 8 reached or exceeded the 2500 m isobath the relatively high amount of bottom tracer west of 65 e at 8 km and 16 km resolutions suggests a stronger westward advection of dense water at these resolutions such advection is evidenced in fig 9a b which shows the temporally averaged and vertically integrated tracer concentration between 1000 m and 2000 m mid depth tracer in these cases the largest amount of mid depth tracer was found far offshore over the oceanic basin depth 2500 m on the western side of the domain the strong mid depth concentration further suggests that at these low resolutions dsw was mainly transformed into intermediate waters and subsequently advected westward at high resolutions 2 and 1 km fig 8e f high concentrations of bottom tracer existed throughout the continental slope west of 68 e iso100 extended beyond the 2000 m isobath and iso40 reached the 3000 m isobath west of 64 e meanwhile the mid depth tracer fig 9c was essentially confined to the continental slope between the 1000 m and the 2500 m isobaths consistent with a downslope flow at these resolutions pathways represented by arrows in fig 8e f could be distinguished through the contours of bottom tracer iso40 or iso100 the most obvious pathway was a northward extension along the left flank of the wild canyon again the 2 km and 1 km resolutions yielded comparable results fig 8e f the tracer concentration in the 2 km smoothed bathymetry case fig 8d presented more similarities with the 8 km resolution fig 8b than with the 2 km fig 8e standard case this further indicates the strong effect of bathymetry data quality on the downslope processes in the model 4 1 3 slope s bottom flow characteristics the near bottom and bottom variability of ocean current and hydrographic properties at the mooring m3 were described in section 3 2 3 the time series outputs at 40 m vertical resolution 1 km and 2 km resolutions were consistent with observational data with only minor differences the current from the two cases exhibited a high frequency variability comparable to that of the observations as seen from the time series fig 10a vs fig 10b c and the energy spectra fig 11a vs fig 11b compared to the 2 km resolution case the current at the 1 km resolution had characteristics slightly closer to the observations in terms of oscillations amplitude fig 10b c and spectral density in particular the two maxima of the observed spectrum at the 5 day and 3 8 day periods fig 11a were replicated only in the 1 km case fig 11b the better definition of corrugations at 1 km resolution possibly explains this more accurate spectral definition this is consistent with nakayama et al s 2014 finding that the frequency of the downslope flow in the cdp region increases with the slope steepness the temperature time series of the 1 km and 2 km were remarkably similar to one another fig 12b c the only significant difference between these two time series and the observed temperatures fig 12a consisted in the later starting dates of the oscillations day 170 vs day 152 the discrepancies between the simulated ocean states at these two resolutions and the observations can be considered minor and both 1 km and 2 km resolutions reproduced the main characteristics of the flow the 4 km resolution case failed to replicate observations fig 10d 12d producing smaller amplitude oscillations 0 05 m s 1 and no high frequency variability in the temperature time series the temperature dropped only by 0 3 c on day 197 nearly 50 days after the observations the amplitude and frequency of the current and temperature variations in the 2 km smoothed case magenta line in fig 10c 12c generally resembled those at 4 km resolution the 8 km and 16 km outputs compared poorly to observations figs 10e f 12e f the velocity time series exhibited weak oscillations at 8 km resolution and no variability at 16 km resolution the temperature time series exhibited no significant variability at these resolutions which is consistent with the absence of dense water colder than 0 7 c beyond 2000 m depth in these cases fig 6c 4 1 4 aabw θ s properties the θ s observations at m3 showed a sharp contrast in properties before and after day 160 with data distributed on either side of the 28 35 kg m 3 isopycnal fig 13f before day 160 the θ s properties were located along the 28 32 kg m 3 isopycnal with little dispersion after day 150 the water tended to become colder fresher and denser and the observations were more dispersed the aabw salinity ranged 34 60 to 34 66 the potential temperature ranged 0 5 c to 1 0 c and the neutral density varied between 28 35 kg m 3 and 28 42 kg m 3 the averaged properties of aabw in the cdp region referred to as cdbw in ohshima et al 2013 are a neutral density of 28 37 kg m 3 a salinity of 34 64 and a potential temperature of 0 67 c in the model the changes in water properties associated with aabw formation were only observed at resolutions of 2 km or more the increase in density decrease in temperature and salinity and widening of the θ s range after day 170 were seen in the 2 km fig 13b and 1 km fig 13a resolutions the resulting averaged between day 200 and day 300 neutral densities respectively 28 39 kg m 3 and 28 37 kg m 3 were very close to the observations the model cases at the 4 km fig 13d and 2 km smoothed fig 13c resolutions produced weaker changes in temperature and salinity leading to the averaged properties of aabw being too warm 0 53 c and not dense enough 28 32 kg m 3 at resolutions of 8 km fig 13e and 16 km fig 13f aabw properties were grossly underestimated as only minor changes in temperature and salinity occurred leading to an averaged neutral density of only 28 30 kg m 3 the differences in properties for the horizontal resolutions equal to or lower than 4 km are also illustrated in the taylor diagram taylor 2001 of daily bottom neutral density at m3 fig 14 a taylor diagram summarizes in one plot the standard deviation of each time series as well as the rms difference and cross correlation between model and observed time series the results in the taylor diagram suggest that all different vertical resolutions with a fixed horizontal resolution of 2 km yielded accurate θ s properties similar to those of fig 13b the time series at four different vertical resolutions indeed presented nearly identical values of correlation and root mean square difference vs observation and standard deviation 4 2 characteristics of the downslope flow at other mooring locations 1 km resolution in addition to m3 the model could recreate the variations of the different properties at other mooring locations where the downslope flow presented different characteristics fig 15 ohshima et al 2013 observed that the downslope flow of dsw at m2 occurred nearly two months before that at m3 they concluded that the earlier arrival of cold waters at m2 indicated a westward advection of the dsw at the beginning of the dsw production season the model captured the earlier descent of dense water at m2 fig 15b and m1 fig 15a albeit with a significant lag 25 to 30 days to the observations at m4 the model only reproduced the lower frequency variability t 20 days but not the higher frequency signal fig 15d williams et al 2016 demonstrated that in the region of the m4 mooring the water properties near the bottom are influenced by fresher modified shelf water originating from the mackenzie bay polynya the mackenzie bay polynya is located southeast and outside of our model domain and the fresher dsw produced there is transported northwards towards the cdp via the prydz channel we surmise that the discrepancies between observations and model data at m4 are due to the exclusion of this upstream source of fresher dense water from our model domain 5 discussion 5 1 horizontal and vertical resolutions required for the cape darnley region the vertical and horizontal resolutions required for accurately modeling density driven downslope flows depend on the plume thickness and the slope angle winton et al 1998 specifically for a plume of layer thickness h flowing over a slope of angle α the vertical resolution r v must be finer than h 2 and the horizontal resolution r h should satisfy r h r v α our results demonstrated that resolutions of 2 km or higher are necessary to accurately reproduce the aabw formation process whereas vertical resolution had little effect on the model performance we now reexamine our findings by calculating the critical values r v c and r h c required for modeling aabw production off cape darnley following winton et al s 1998 hypothesis to determine r h c in the cdp region we first estimated a depth plume thickness vertical profile fig 16a from the 2 km resolution case along the wild canyon section shown in fig 3 the plume thickness was defined at all points along the slope as the thickness of the layer with γ 28 27 kg m 3 and θ 0 4 c and data were averaged between day 170 and day 300 to obtain the profile the profile exhibited two local minima near the shelf break h 171 m at 300 m depth and the bottom of the continental slope h 240 m at 2300 m depth and a maximum around 1200 m depth h 505 m this vertical structure is consistent with observations of plume thickness at various points along the slope by gordon et al 2009 in the ross sea and the modeled plume thickness of 400 m at 2600 m depth fig 16a agrees with the observation based estimate by ohshima et al 2013 the general shape of the plume thickness profile followed that of the angle α fig 16b which varied strongly along the slope the vertical profile of required r h fig 16c showed little variability down to about 1300 m and had a minimum value of 2 1 km at 750 m depth we can therefore define the critical horizontal resolution in the cdp region as r h c 2 1 km this value is consistent with the results of our previous analysis suggesting the existence of a 2 km resolution threshold which validates winton et al 1998 hypothesis above the 2 km threshold excessive warming fig 6c of the water within the dsw plume likely led to a loss of density which made the bulk of the dense water stay mid depth fig 6b this intermediate water was then advected westward by the ambient current fig 9a b below the 2 km resolution threshold the properties within the dense water plume were better conserved as colder water reached the slope s bottom fig 6c through realistic paths fig 8e f allowing for aabw to be produced in reasonable amounts fig 6a and with accurate ts properties fig 13a b minor differences existed in the 1 km vs 2 km resolution time series of current velocity figs 10b c and 11 but this had little influence on aabw properties fig 13a b our previous analysis suggested that our model in the cdp region was nearly insensitive to vertical resolution fig 7 14 this is rather unsurprising because the 40 m 20 m and 10 m grids all had a vertical resolution much finer than the r v c 85 m table 3 required for this region however many models have a vertical grid with depth varying layer width such as the ecco grid we used in some of our experiments table 2 the modeled plume thickness varied between 170 m and 505 m in the cdp region and a comparison between the plume thickness and the ecco grid width fig 16a shows that even this relatively coarse grid satisfies r v h 2 at all depths above 2000 m 5 2 implications for the other aabw formation regions we estimated the slope steepness α and plume thickness h for the weddell sea the ross sea and the adelie coast we estimated α at all points along the slope from the etopo1 global relief model amante and eakins 2009 by calculating the distance separating the 500 m and 1500 m isobaths we also provided ranges and an averaged value of plume thickness for each region based on observations reported in previous works in table 3 averaged values of α and h in the cdp region were also provided for comparison the results listed in table 3 suggest that modeling the weddell sea and the ross sea would require relatively lower resolutions than in the cdp region due to the weaker slope inclination α ws 0 020 α rs 0 025 and relatively large plume thickness 300 m on average in these areas table 3 in contrast properly modeling the aabw formation process off adelie land may require higher resolutions due to the high slope inclination α 0 073 and the thinner plumes h a c 170 m observed in this region williams et al 2010 the lower horizontal resolution required for the weddell and ross seas may explain why several models with horizontal resolutions of 3 5 km newsom et al 2016 morrison et al 2020 or order 0 1 kerr et al 2012 kiss et al 2020 renner et al 2009 yielded relatively realistic dsw pathways and or estimates of downslope flow volumes or aabw formation rate in one or both of these seas in particular the densest bottom waters in newsom et al s 2016 high resolution community climate system model grid spacing 3 5 km were found in the ross sea and the weddell sea which implies that the resolution of that model was sufficient for these areas on the other hand the model by kusahara et al 2010 yielded realistic dsw production and pathways with horizontal resolution ranging between a few kilometers and 15 km in east antarctica but could not reproduce well the mixing process of the downsloping dsw this may be explained by the 2 1 km r h c for the cdp region being smaller than the resolution of this model 6 summary and conclusion aabw is an essential ocean water mass that plays a crucial role in the global thermohaline circulation however modeling the formation and downslope descent of dsw and aabw production is challenging in this study sensitivity tests with different vertical and horizontal resolutions were conducted to assess how resolution impacts dsw production and its downslope flow off the cdp the essential criterion controlling downslope flow was horizontal resolution for resolutions equal to or higher than a 2 km threshold the simulations yielded realistic downslope flow aabw properties and bottom current and hydrographic properties variability all consistent with observations in the region ohshima et al 2013 the processes leading to the formation and downslope flow in the cdp were properly captured by the model especially the periodic high frequency variability of the downslope flow in the wild canyon nakayama et al 2014 ohshima et al 2013 considering the continental slope angle and plume thickness in the cdp region the 2 km threshold we found was consistent with winton et al s 1998 hypothesis that horizontal resolution depends on these two parameters for resolutions lower than 2 km the comparison between model outputs and observations worsened with decreasing resolution for example at 4 km resolution the downslope flow was reduced by 20 compared to the 1 km and 2 km resolution and at 16 km resolution aabw density was strongly underestimated our results suggest that as the resolution was decreased increasing amounts of intermediate water were formed and advected westward to the detriment of aabw formation further we demonstrated that a bathymetric dataset with poor data density produced aabw with misestimated properties even at high horizontal resolutions when a 16 km resolution bathymetry was linearly interpolated to the 2 km resolution grid the downslope flow of dsw and properties of aabw were largely underestimated similar to the 4 km resolution results acquiring a high resolution bathymetric dataset in the four regions where aabw is formed is therefore essential to properly model bottom water formation in the polar regions our model results were mostly insensitive to vertical resolution because in most of the vertical grids tested the grid width was much smaller than half the plume thickness winton et al 1998 even with a coarse vertical grid such as that of the ecco state estimate 170 m wide at 2000 m a model with a fine horizontal resolution can reproduce the downslope flow of dsw and its volume in the cdp region as well as the main aabw characteristics our results suggest that coupled ice ocean models with a similar configuration as ours may properly model the formation and properties of aabw in other polynya regions of the world s oceans however as plume thickness and slope angle affect the resolutions needed to resolve the downslope flows differences in the resolutions required in the different aabw formation regions may exist sensitivity experiments conducted in this study clarified the crucial role of resolution and fine scale bathymetry for generating the downslope flow of dsw its pathways and the formation of aabw with properties close to observations while regional models can be conducted at high resolutions higher than 2 km at a reasonable computational cost global circulation models have to employ coarser resolutions parametrisation of topographic properties in these coarse resolution models is an essential matter e g matsumura and hasumi 2011 and our study is a step towards addressing this issue also while we found that resolutions of order 10 km are inadequate to model aabw formation parametrisation of the bottom boundary layer processes may enable to solve the issue of excessive convective mixing wang et al 2008 winton et al 1998 affecting models at these resolutions the development or improvement of such parametrisation is a topic that remains

23894,the three dimensional transport pathways the time and space scales of vertical transport and the dispersion characteristics single pair and multi particle statistics of submesoscale currents at an upper ocean front are investigated using material points tracer particles that advect with the local fluid velocity coherent vortex filaments and eddies generated and sustained during the evolution of baroclinic instability dominate submesoscale 0 1 10 km dynamics these coherent structures play a crucial role in the particle transport and dispersion which we quantify here particles in the central frontal region organize into vertically inclined lobes with anticyclonic circulation each associated with a coherent eddy with cyclonic rotation furthermore the coherent filaments associated with heavy light edges of the front transfer particles from the edges to the lobes by downwelling upwelling this flux of new particles into the central region causes the particles circulating in the lobes to adjust which leads to slumping of the front the particle motion in the vertical shows multiple time scales a fast time scale with o 10 m vertical displacement within an hour and a slower near inertial time scale comparable to the intrinsic time scale of the growing instability the fast o 1 h time scale is also seen in the decorrelation of vertical velocity and the tapering of the initial ballistic growth of relative particle dispersion the overall slumping process is slower than what one might anticipate from the large magnitude of vertical velocity in the filaments since it requires a sustained correlation over time between the lateral and the vertical motion by tracking clouds of particles we show that their centers of mass downwell upwell over 1 2 inertial time periods after which an adjustment follows with a sub inertial time scale the shape change in clusters of four particles reveals filamentogenesis i e deformation into thin needle like structures by the coherent anisotropic motions of the submesoscale which occurs as a rapid process that is complete within approximately an hour keywords submesoscale turbulence vertical transport dispersion baroclinic instability 1 introduction density fronts ubiquitous in the upper ocean are an important source of currents with submesoscale dynamics the dynamics typically occur at length scales of 0 1 10 km and the time scale of o 1 day and are characterized by o 1 values of rossby number r o u f l and richardson number r i n 2 z u 2 thomas et al 2008 mcwilliams 2016 here f is the coriolis parameter u is a characteristic horizontal velocity scale l is a characteristic horizontal length scale n g ρ 0 ρ z is the buoyancy frequency corresponding to density ρ stratification ρ 0 is a reference density and g is the gravitational constant the submesoscale plays a significant role in the restratification of the upper ocean and the vertical transport of tracers such as buoyancy salinity and carbon from the surface ocean to the interior boccaletti et al 2007 thomas et al 2008 omand et al 2015 these processes affect the upper ocean structure and impact the interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere thereby influencing the climate submesoscale currents also play a significant role in the ocean s biochemical cycle by aiding phytoplankton growth through supply of nutrients from the upper thermocline into the surface layer mahadevan 2016 many of the upper ocean processes driven by the submesoscale dynamics are possible because of their ability to develop large vertical velocity mahadevan and tandon 2006 presumably with spatial and temporal coherence this is in contrast to the small scale turbulent motions which are relevant for the local mixing or the balanced mesoscale motions in which the vertical velocity is orders of magnitude smaller the lateral transport is believed to be dominated by the mesoscale currents and eddies but the role of submesoscales can be significant as they can provide interconnections between the mesoscale transport barriers and enhance the horizontal spread haza et al 2016 the submesoscales are also important for predicting the dispersion of buoyant pollutants such as oil d asaro et al 2018 an understanding of the organization of vertical velocity and transport pathways is therefore crucial for understanding the submesoscale upper ocean transport and dispersion processes frontogenesis intensifies vertical motions a zone with horizontal buoyancy contrast can undergo frontogenesis through straining by a large scale confluent flow as well as non linear evolution of baroclinic instability bi hoskins and bretherton 1972 hoskins 1982 the initial stages of the frontogenetic development of bi at an atmospheric front have been studied in detail by mudrick 1974 recent studies have shown that a cold filament in upper ocean turbulence experiences a secondary circulation in the lateral vertical plane which is frontogenetic and which survives in the presence of boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2015 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 the ageostrophic circulation in the case of a front with strong lateral buoyancy gradient can lead to nonlinear bores pham and sarkar 2018 filament structures with cyclonic vorticity were observed in the northern gulf of mexico in an observational campaign utilizing a large number of satellite tracked surface drifters d asaro et al 2018 the structures were smaller than 1 km in width separated the dense and light water masses and were convergent attracting surface drifters into a line that wrapped into a cyclonic eddy the convergence of water mass implies downwelling and the measured vertical velocity was as large as 1 2 cm s 1 in comparison the vertical velocity at a mesoscale front typically does not exceed o 0 01 cm s 1 rudnick 1996 the evolution of bi in upper ocean density fronts is an important mechanism for generating submesoscale currents the problem has been studied extensively using large scale ocean models capet et al 2008 and turbulence resolving models skyllingstad and samelson 2012 hamlington et al 2014 stamper and taylor 2017 verma et al 2019 simulating a density front that is initially in thermal wind balance verma et al 2019 hereafter vps19 find that the evolution of bi generates long thin vortex filaments with cyclonic vorticity and downwelling vertical velocity that roll into coherent submesoscale eddies these submesoscale filaments and the large vertical velocity inside them are similar to the submesoscale filament like features observed during the surface drifter measurements of d asaro et al 2018 vps19 showed that the coherent structures i e vortex filaments and eddies provide a 3d organization to the secondary circulation whose velocity field suggests that water is transported laterally and vertically across the front although there are organized 3d structures the actual paths followed by the fluid parcels over time are not apparent from the instantaneous velocity field as the dynamics is transient the spatial pattern of the velocity field changes when the coherent structures are transported by the sheared frontal jet a lagrangian framework is better suited for a study of material transport by the submesoscale which is the subject of this paper a related problem is about the time scale of subduction and restratification of the front the vertical velocity observed in the filaments can be so large as to produce vertical displacement of o 1 km in a day if sustained in magnitude and direction however the restratification is likely to progress on the time scale of baroclinic instability which is o 2 π f stone 1966 here we show evidence of a slow restratification at the near inertial time scale emerging from relatively fast motions in the filament structures lagrangian drifters and floats have been widely used in the ocean for understanding flow properties and dynamics e g see review article lacasce 2008 single particle metrics have been used for obtaining the mean flow eddy kinetic energy eddy diffusivity and lagrangian spectra characteristic of large spatial regions and sub inertial to inertial frequencies more recently lagrangian measurements have been extended to high frequency motions of oceanic turbulence including turbulence at fronts d asaro et al 2011 single particle dispersion statistics are also a convenient tool for predicting the spread of a particle from the point of release by a velocity field that has coherent unsteady currents and turbulence the particle pair dispersion statistics on the other hand reveal the spread of particles about the center of mass com of a particle cloud batchelor 1952 particle pair statistics are often used to probe the scale dependence of dynamics in a recent analysis of the trajectories of surface drifters deployed during the grand lagrangian dynamics glad experiment in the gulf of mexico poje et al 2014 found that the second order velocity structure function showed power law behavior from 200 m to 100 km including the submesoscale range suggesting the dominance of local advective dynamics balwada et al 2016 applied a helmholtz decomposition of the second order structure function computed from the glad drifters into divergent and rotational components finding that the divergent component dominated at scales below 5 km and also computed the third order structure function from their analysis they inferred forward 3 d energy cascade below 5 km 2 d enstrophy cascade between 5 to 40 km the deformation radius and an inverse energy cascade between 40 100 km beron vera and lacasce 2016 examined pair separation statistics in the submesoscale range using synthetic drifter trajectories from data assimilated ncom simulations conducted with 1 km horizontal resolution they found that the pair separation grew exponentially in accord with non local dynamics they further attributed the discrepancy of their result with the results from glad observational drifter trajectories to the strong inertial oscillations experienced by the glad drifters and their limited number of independent samples with possibly low statistical significance in the ocean internal gravity waves are likely to further complicate the statistical measure arising due to submesoscale dynamics multiparticle studies have also been used mainly to measure flow properties such as relative vorticity and horizontal divergence molinari and kirwan 1975 multiparticle statistics using groups of four particles tetrads can be used to investigate the changes in the shape of the particle clusters which result from straining by the large scale flows and dispersion by the finescale motions as shown by pumir et al 2000 in this study we employ the model front of vps19 to investigate the transport and dispersion characteristics of the submesoscale currents including finescale turbulence during the evolution of bi the model of vps19 does not contain strong inertial motions internal gravity waves or surface forcing thus providing an ideal setup for studying the dispersion characteristics of submesoscale currents in isolation owing to the high resolution 2 m in all three directions of the simulation we are able to capture 3d turbulence generated during the evolution of bi the domain size of 4 km captures a wide range of the submesoscale but not the mesoscale the study is performed in the lagrangian framework by releasing a large number of tracer particles that move with the local fluid velocity the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the setup of the model front of vps19 is summarized in section 3 the 3d coherent structures observed in vps19 are briefly described the details about the tracer particle simulation are given in section 4 in section 5 the 3d organization of the particles the typical features of the transport pathways and the restratification of the front are examined in section 6 various time scales of the lagrangian motion are investigated and the vertical transport of tracer particles is studied by monitoring the centers of mass of particle clouds and the dispersion of particles within the clouds section 7 focuses on the dispersion characteristics of the submesoscale currents including the localized three dimensional finescale associated with the currents in this section single and pair particle dispersion statistics are investigated and shape changes following groups of four particles tetrads are reported finally in section 8 conclusions are drawn based on the results with a brief discussion about their implications 2 model setup the model which is the same as the one employed by vps19 is summarized here the problem is initialized as an upper ocean front in thermal wind balance with a surface jet the front of width l 1 2 km is confined to a surface layer of depth h 50 m situated above a strongly stratified thermocline the front is aligned with the x direction along front and the temperature variation in y cross front and z vertical coordinates sets the buoyancy contrast the value of m 2 g ρ 0 ρ y at the center y 0 is m 0 2 1 5 1 0 7 s 2 the square of buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z takes the value of n m 2 3 0 1 0 7 s 2 in the 50 m deep surface layer and n t 2 1 0 5 s 2 in the thermocline below the surface layer the frontal jet u y z is constructed from the density field by integrating the thermal wind relation u z m 2 f where f 1 4 1 0 4 s 1 is the coriolis parameter the velocity u y z is negative as shown in fig 1 the potential vorticity at the front is initially negative and the setup is unstable to symmetric perturbations the evolution of the model front is studied numerically utilizing the large eddy simulation les approach and solving the non hydrostatic navier stokes equations under the boussinesq approximation vps19 can be referred for the numerical algorithm when the navier stokes equations are scaled by the velocity scale u 0 m 0 2 h f the maximum geostrophic jet velocity at the surface and the buoyancy scale n m 2 h the following set of non dimensional parameters ensues the ekman number e k ν f h 2 2 86 1 0 6 the non dimensional lateral buoyancy gradient m 0 2 f 2 7 65 and the richardson number r i n m 2 f 2 m 0 4 0 26 the ratio m 0 2 f 2 7 65 is comparable to the values used in the studies of skyllingstad and samelson 2012 and hamlington et al 2014 the rossby number r o u 0 f l based on the initial horizontal shear is 0 32 and the reynolds number r e u 0 h ν is 2 67 1 0 6 the computational domain spans 0 x 4098 m 3073 m y 3073 m and 130 m z 0 a uniform grid with 2050 3074 66 points is employed initially providing a grid resolution of 2 m in each direction later during the evolution of baroclinic instability the solution is obtained using a grid which is the same in the horizontal but has 98 grid points in the vertical with uniform stretching such that the grid spacing changes from 0 5 m near the surface to 1 5 m near the bottom the finer grid resolution in the vertical is needed near the surface to resolve the surface intensified turbulence in the vortex filaments that develops during the nonlinear evolution of bi 3 submesoscale structures the evolution of the front which is discussed in detail in vps19 is summarized here to motivate the lagrangian studies of this paper the initial setup is unstable to symmetric instability si however as the front restratifies it becomes stable to si taylor and ferrari 2009 arobone and sarkar 2015 most of the evolution of the front is therefore controlled by baroclinic instability bi which becomes dominant after si subsides the nonlinear growth of bi spawns submesoscale coherent structures such as vortex filaments and eddies additionally the sharpest frontal features develop 3d shear instabilities that sustain turbulence arresting frontogenesis vps19 separated the submesoscale ϕ from the turbulent finescale ϕ by applying a 2d low pass lanczos filter in x and y directions with a cutoff wavelength λ c 2 π k c 157 m fig 2 shows the submesoscale vertical vorticity at 10 m figs 2a c and 30 m figs 2d f depth at different times fig 2a plotted at t 57 2 h during the initial rollup of the front reveals filaments of cyclonic vorticity which connect to the heavy edge of the front and wrap into the central coherent eddies at this time the eddies are small and only slightly larger than the filament width of o 100 m the eddies are vertically coherent and can be identified at 30 m depth in fig 2d the structures are advected by the mean flow in the negative x direction as the instabilities evolve the vorticity filaments grow in length and the eddies become larger in diameter figs 2b c isosurfaces of q fig 3 illustrate the three dimensional organization of the coherent structures here q is calculated using the submesoscale velocity fields i e q ω i j 2 s i j 2 2 where ω i j u i x j u j x i 2 and s i j u i x j u j x i 2 the regions with q 0 represent rotation dominated flow whereas those with q 0 represent strain dominated flow the vertical coherence of the submesoscale coherent eddies is evident as are the interspersed regions of strain 4 setup of particle tracking tracer particles were introduced in the flow at t 0 57 2 h to assess material transport under the influence of submesoscale currents at this time the vortex filaments have formed at the front and have begun to wrap into eddies figs 2a d the particles are placed at the nodes of a regular lattice that occupies the entire domain 0 x 4 1 km in the along front x direction 1 6 y 1 6 km in the lateral y direction and 70 z 2 m in the vertical z direction with resolution 16 m 16 m 2 m before introducing the particles the simulation run with a uniform δ z 2 m is interpolated to a grid with higher vertical resolution 0 5 m near the surface to 1 5 m near the bottom of the front at t 56 h the tracer particles are passive and by definition move with the local fluid velocity according to 1 d x p d t u f x p t where u f x p t is the fluid velocity at the particle position x p eq 1 is advanced in time with a third order runge kutta rk3 scheme and u f x p t is obtained by the fourth order lagrange interpolation of a cell centered velocity field the navier stokes solver stores the velocity components at the edge centers and cell centering is achieved by linear interpolation a cfl value smaller than one for particle advection ensures a stable numerical trajectory 5 advection of tracer particles individual particle trajectories differ considerably even for neighboring particles nevertheless there is an overall organization in their motions influenced by the coherent structures as elaborated below anticipating differences in the particle behavior in the initial frontal zone from its edges we distinguish among particle groups according to their cross front y locations of release as follows i central region 500 m y 500 m ii heavy edge y 500 m and iii light edge y 500 m 5 1 particle trajectories the trajectories of particles p1 p7 released at z 30 m and x 1490 m are shown in fig 4 the 3d trajectories in fig 4d reveal that the paths followed by the particles are strikingly different from one another however transport characteristics common to particles within a group can be identified by examining the trajectories x p t y p t and z p t figs 4a c depending on their initial y coordinates fig 4c the particles can be distinguished as the heavy edge particles p1 and p2 the central region particles p3 p5 and the light edge particles p6 and p7 particle p3 is selected such that it is located within a submesoscale eddy the vertical trajectories of the particles plotted in fig 4c reveal that the heavy edge particles p1 and p2 downwell while the light edge and central region particles p3 p7 upwell a negative correlation between lateral v p and vertical w p velocity can be observed for central region particles p4 and p5 and at late times for edge particles p2 and p6 for example p4 moves vertically downward when its lateral motion is in the positive y direction while it moves vertically upward when the lateral motion is in the negative y direction moreover the correlated y and z motions of p4 and p5 exhibit oscillations with a time period of about 25 h which is twice the inertial time period t i 12 5 h the central region particle p3 released within an eddy remains trapped inside the eddy and shows near inertial oscillations in its y coordinates the vertical trajectory of p6 shows a fast time scale event with remarkably rapid transport in the vertical this event starts at t 97 h when p6 downwells by approximately 20 m from a to b over a period of about an hour and then upwells back to the surface from b to c in the next 2 5 h the downwelling occurs when the particle gets attracted to a heavy edge filament and is followed by upwelling when it finds itself in a denser background the edge particles begin to advect vertically at different times the particles motions farther away from the central region are delayed relative to the closer ones in fig 4c the approximate start of vertical transport is marked with solid squares in the trajectories p1 starts moving vertically after p2 and p6 after p5 since p2 and p5 are closer to the central region than p1 and p6 we will show that the vertical transport of particles is initiated by coherent vortex filaments at the edges of the slumping front and those outside are transported afterwards as the front width increases slowly to reach them the along front particle displacements are generally in the negative x direction fig 4a following the mean u however a particle can acquire u p 0 especially when it reaches the bottom of the front e g p2 during t 96 105 h and p4 during t 64 72 h notice that the x trajectories of particles e g p5 and p6 which cross the left domain boundary at x 0 are continued into the negative x region considering the streamwise periodicity of the domain typically the upwelling particles p6 and p7 have larger negative x displacements compared to the downwelling particles p1 and p2 as the upwelling particles tend to spend more time near the surface where the along front speed is larger oscillations with small amplitudes can be observed in the vertical trajectories e g p4 p5 and p6 indicating the influence of the finescales however the effect of the finescales on the along front and cross front displacements is weak 5 2 coherent transport pathways section 5 1 showed particle trajectories with multiple time scales and distinctive behavior depending on the lateral particle location here we demonstrate that the coherent structures seen in the eulerian analysis of vps19 organize the particle motion in a specific manner the positions of central region particles released at z 20 m are shown in fig 5 at t 84 9 h after a flight time of 27 7 h along with their trajectories over the last 45 min particles especially those near the surface exhibit large lateral meanders the coherent submesoscale eddies in the central region impart a cyclonic circulation to the particles moreover the particles transported across the front to the light side y 0 4 km exhibit a distinct organization into additional structures that are vertically inclined reach down to the depth of up to 50 m similar to the coherent eddies and extend laterally towards the light edge of the front these structures although associated with an eddy have particles undergoing anticyclonic circulation as opposed to the cyclonic circulation imparted by the eddies we refer to these inclined anticyclonic structures as lobes two lobes lb1 and lb2 can be identified in fig 5 and are further discussed below we take a more comprehensive look at the 3d organization of particles by the submesoscale currents using particles released at 10 m and 40 m depth figs 6a f show temperature t p lateral velocity v p and vertical velocity w p of the particles at the same time as fig 5 lobes lb1 and lb2 can be observed within the front in all the figures the lobes are stratified figs 6a b having warm particles in the upper region and cold particles in the lower the particle circulations are illustrated by v p and w p figs 6c e for the 10 m depth particles and figs 6d f for the 40 m depth particles the negative correlation between v p and w p seen for some of the particle trajectories of section 5 1 are revealed to be associated with motion in the lobes for example particles at the side lbf marked by circles with dots in fig 6c of lobe lb2 have positive v p at the same time the mostly negative w p in lbf figs 6e f corresponds to downwelling eventually v p becomes negative when the particles reach side lbb marked by circles with crosses in fig 6c of lobe lb2 at lbb w p is mostly positive as seen in fig 6e and the particles climb up the lobe in general the particles circulate within the same lobe especially when the interaction between the neighboring eddies is weak it is worth noting that the correlation between v p and w p is such that the associated circulation in the lateral vertical plane follows the isopycnal slope in the present case the lateral density gradient points in the negative x direction and therefore v p and w p have negative correlation the coherent vortex filaments are crucial to transporting edge particles into the central eddy lobe circulation two light edge filaments lef1 and lef2 in fig 6b have mostly w p 0 fig 6f and lift the warm edge particles towards the upper layers of the stratified lobes although not visible in fig 6 there are coherent filaments connected to the heavy edge of the front as well the role of the filament structures on the transport is made clearer by the positions at t 84 9 h of heavy edge particles released at 10 m depth fig 7a and light edge particles released at 40 m depth fig 7b in fig 7a particles at depth are seen at y 0 as they are transported by heavy edge vortex filaments hef1 and hef2 across the front and downwell to the underside of the lobes these downwelled particles collect within the lobes and undergo the previously described circulation of the lobe the light edge filaments lef1 and lef2 in fig 7b are located between the heavy edge filaments after being lifted upwards through the light edge filament particles branch back to the bottom of the front through the downwelling limb of the lobe interestingly some particles detach from this main branch near the surface and spread laterally under the influence of the near surface circulation these particles associated with lef2 are enclosed within the rectangular box shown in fig 7b fig 8 gives a consolidated picture of lagrangian pathways at the front transport to the central region by vortex filaments stirring by the central submesoscale eddies and circulations within vertically inclined lobes the upwelling of light edge fluid through vortex filaments to the upper layers of the lobes is shown and the downwelling of heavy edge fluid through vortex filaments to the undersides of the lobes is also partially shown 1 1 a supplementary movie illustrates the coherent transport of particles utilizing those released at 20 m depth particles are released in the central region blue and red at the heavy edge cyan and the light edge green the central region particles spread vertically and organize into three lobes but eventually only two persist after a lobe merging event along front advection of the lobes along with coherent eddies and the anticyclonic circulation of the particles within the lobes can be observed the lobes are stratified with different colored particles roughly confined to different layers further the light edge green particles transferred to the lobes by vortex filaments spread on the top layers while the heavy edge cyan particles spread at the undersides the slumping of the lobes in the lateral over time indicates restratification of the front 5 3 restratification process submesoscale currents lead to bulk restratification the link between the stirring by the 3d filament eddy lobe motions to restratification of the x averaged front is elaborated here fig 9 characterizes how the particles released in the central light and heavy regions redistribute spatially as time progresses for identifying their x averaged distribution the particles are sampled in thin long cells which extend over l x 4 1 km entire x domain and have dimensions of δ s y 16 m and δ s z 2 m in the cross section as the front evolves the central region cloud slumps its stable density contrast is maintained for the most part particles from the heavy edge primarily subduct below and those from the light edge spread above the slumping central region the time scale of the bulk restratification is of interest the evolution of volume averaged n 2 t and m 2 t is shown in fig 10 a significant portion of the restratification which would lead to a final n 2 3 6 1 0 6 s 2 upon completion of frontal slumping takes place by t 100 h taking w p 1 0 3 ms 1 to characterize speeds during significant downwelling events leads to a time scale t m l 13 9 h for traversing the mixed layer of h 50 m restratification is evidently slower than that suggested by the large values of w p vps19 apply a lanczos horizontal filter of o 100 m to w to obtain the coherent submesoscale velocity w identify the downwelling regions with w 0 and define the submesoscale vertical velocity in those regions as w similarly here we define w w in regions where w 0 the average of w over the front was found to be w 1 0 4 ms 1 a ml traverse time of h w 133 h agrees better with the observed restratification time scale the horizontal buoyancy gradient m 2 t progressively decreases from its initial value of m 0 2 1 5 1 0 7 s 2 as the front collapses but remains significant at t 100 h because regions with vertical shear persist and frontogenesis continues to support regions with large local m 2 there is variability in n 2 also with larger values at the top and bottom of the considered volume 6 vertical transport in this section we investigate the collective motion of particles by tracking particle clouds lagrangian time scales are obtained and the statistics of vertical displacement are assessed the finite width clouds whose length extends across the streamwise domain are initialized with particles released at 10 m and 40 m depth figs 11a d the cloud array covers 800 y 800 m across the front such that the particles constituting any given cloud have similar density and therefore have similar buoyancy control on the dynamics at each depth fourteen clouds c1 c14 are constructed with average density temperature decreasing increasing progressively from cloud c1 to c14 each cloud has more than 1000 particles leading to reasonably converged statistics 6 1 separation of timescales different time scales involved in particle transport can be understood by examining the lagrangian energy spectra and autocorrelation functions of the particle velocity the lagrangian spectra for cloud c i are calculated as 2 s u p ω f 1 2 u ˆ p ω f 2 c i s v p ω f 1 2 v ˆ p ω f 2 c i 3 s w p ω f 1 2 w ˆ p ω f 2 c i where u ˆ p ω f v ˆ p ω f and w ˆ p ω f are the fourier transforms of the velocity time records ω f is the angular frequency and c i represents averaging over all the particles in cloud c i the velocity data over 57 2 t 105 2 h are considered the non uniform time data are interpolated to a uniform grid and the hanning window is applied the lagrangian energy spectra for the central region cloud c7 released at 10 m depth fig 12a reveal two dynamical regimes at subinertial time scales with ω f f 1 the horizontal kinetic energy is much larger than the vertical component reflecting strong submesoscale dynamics on the other hand at time scales with 10 ω f f 100 all three components have comparable energy reflecting the influence of 3d finescale dynamics furthermore unlike the horizontal components the w p spectrum shows little variability over 1 ω f 10 this suggests that finescales are likely to have a significant influence on the vertical motion whereas the horizontal motion of the particle is dominated principally by the slower subinertial submesoscale dynamics the energy spectra for the 40 m release depth in fig 12b are similar to those at 10 m release depth suggesting similarity of particles motions in the central region over the depth of the front the fast time scale in the spectra can be related to the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity in the model front with thermal wind balance the vertical shear u z m 2 f o 10 f corresponds to a time scale of about 1 h at this time scale as shown in figs 12a b the lagrangian dynamics start to behave as three dimensional the two point autocorrelation is defined for the along front velocity by 4 ρ u p t τ u p t u p t τ c i u p 2 t c i and similarly for the other two components the autocorrelation functions for u p and v p figs 13a b are dominated by subinertial time scales and do not vanish over the advection time considered here the temporal oscillations in ρ u p and ρ v p arise from particle circulation within the coherent submesoscale eddies and lobes at the front in contrast ρ w p drops from its peak to a small value 0 2 within an hour shown in the insets followed by a small amplitude oscillation dominated by slow subinertial time scales similar to that for the horizontal velocity components the short time scale in ρ w p is due to two factors motion in and near the filaments where w is large and rapidly varying and near n oscillations of w p noting that a lagrangian mean n 2 2 2 1 0 6 s 2 leads to a time scale of 1 2 h 6 2 vertical transport of particle clouds here the motion of the cloud s center of mass com and the spread of the particles about the com are examined the com of the cloud is defined by x c o m k i 1 n k x i k n k where x i k is the position of the i t h particle in a cloud with index k and n k is the total number of particles in the cloud the spread of particles in a cloud is characterized by the root mean square rms displacement about the com x r m s k i 1 n k x i k x c o m k 2 n k first we examine the clouds released at 10 m depth figs 14a b typically the clouds released over the heavy edge and the central region subduct whereas those released at the light edge upwell the trajectories of subducting clouds exhibit near inertial oscillations superposed to a mean profile two different types of behavior can be noticed for these subducting clouds clouds c2 c7 exhibit significant vertical displacements over 1 2 inertial time periods inertial period is t 12 5 h which is followed by a slow adjustment on the other hand clouds c8 c10 show continuous subduction over the time considered here among the light edge clouds c13 and c14 c13 shows a weak subduction while c14 shows upwelling the plots of z r m s fig 14b reveal vertical spread of the particles as the clouds downwell upwell at the front the z r m s values grow over 1 2 inertial time periods and saturate to constant values oscillating with near inertial frequencies the clouds released over the heavy edge and the central region c2 c10 saturate to z r m s 15 m and those released over the light edge c13 and c14 saturate to z r m s 5 7 m indicating a more compact configuration in contrast the z c o m trajectories plotted in fig 14c for the 40 m depth clouds show upwelling except for c2 released at the heavy edge an upwelling cloud typically moves upwards over 1 2 inertial time periods to reach a peak and a slow adjustment follows subsequently for the light edge clouds c13 and c14 upwelling is delayed and the peaks are reached later the z c o m trajectory of the heavy edge cloud c3 reveals upwelling and that of c2 small downwelling similar to the 10 m depth clouds the particles in 40 m depth clouds disperse vertically as they upwell downwell the vertical spread of the constituent particles in the cloud z r m s with time is shown in fig 14d the spread of the particles fig 14d in the central region clouds c3 c10 and the clouds immediately at the edges c2 and c13 reaches peak values within 1 2 inertial time periods and tends to asymptote to a constant value of about 14 m the behavior of edge clouds c2 and c14 is somewhat different since there is a time delay before the particles are put into motion by the coherent filaments the peaks in z r m s develop late for c2 and c14 their long time behavior is not clear in the present simulation the upwelling downwelling of clouds especially from the edges over near inertial time scales and subsequent adjustment of the constituent particles can be explained in terms of transport and organization of the particles by the coherent structures the coherent vortex filaments associated with the heavy and light edges of the front draw the neighboring particles into the central region over 1 2 inertial periods reaching a maximum minimum in the z c o m trajectory and transfer the particles to the lobes where they adjust to the local circulation and stratification the near inertial time scale suggests the control of submesoscale dynamics driven by bi on the vertical transport 7 dispersion 7 1 single particle dispersion single particle or absolute dispersion is the mean square displacement 5 a 2 t x t x 0 2 where x t x 0 is the displacement of a tracer particle and represents the mean taken over an ensemble of particles eq 5 can be expressed as a 2 t a x 2 t a y 2 t a z 2 t where a x 2 t a y 2 t and a z 2 t arise from the x y and z displacements respectively unlike homogeneous isotropic turbulence particle dispersion is anisotropic in this problem since the particles move in a stratified environment under the action of coherent structures and a mean downfront jet with vertical and lateral shear initially the dispersion is ballistic so that a x 2 t a y 2 t and a z 2 t in fig 15 grow as t 2 the vertical dispersion a z 2 t starts to deviate from t 2 behavior at t 0 5 h when the rms vertical displacement is about 2 m and saturates to o 10 m at late times a x 2 t and a y 2 t grow as t 2 over longer time durations the autocorrelation functions associated with the particle s x and y velocity components figs 13a b show a time scale of 10 h over which the functions drop below zero and become negative in accordance with this time scale we find that the behavior of a x 2 t and a y 2 t changes from t 2 when t 10 h subsequently a long time behavior emerges after t 35 h which is super diffusive in the x direction with a x 2 t t α where α 1 and diffusive in the y direction with a y 2 t t we calculate the exponent α using linear regression and find that its value depends on the depth at which the central zone particles are released the exponent varies as α 1 3 1 7 for the particles released between 10 m to 40 m depth for the particles released at 30 m α 1 6 the exponent α is typically larger for the particles released at depth compared to those released near the surface the reason is that the depth particles upwell e g fig 14b and tend to advect near the surface where the along front velocity is relatively larger therefore the particles spread faster with respect to their initial locations and have a higher value for the exponent α in comparison the surface particles downwell and their along front advection is slower resulting in a smaller exponent α in fig 15 the long time dispersion behavior in the x direction is compared with the nominal exponent of α 1 5 for the particles released at 10 m and 30 m depth at late times diffusive behavior is commonly anticipated in a turbulent flow as the particle performs random walk while moving under the influence of different eddies the observed super diffusive behavior in a x 2 t can be attributed to the horizontal and vertical shear of mean u simple stochastic models demonstrate that in a sheared velocity field absolute dispersion can grow as t α where 1 α 3 and the value of the exponent α depends on the shear profile lacasce 2008 for example if mean u has a constant shear along y then the random walk by advecting particles in y exhibits dispersion with a x 2 t t 3 super diffusive behavior has been observed in other flow configurations as well in stratified turbulence this behavior arises due to u z in the layers between coherent pancake eddies van aartrijk et al 2008 the behavior of a x 2 t a y 2 t and a z 2 t is qualitatively similar for the 10 m depth and 30 m depth particles one difference is that the initial increase of a x 2 t is considerably faster for the particles released at 10 m depth compared to those released at 30 m depth this behavior arises since u is strongest near the surface and decreases to zero at the bottom of the front at late times the dispersion curves tend to converge as the particles released at both depths become vertically dispersed and those advecting near the surface dominate the statistics leading to a super diffusive growth for a x 2 t the particles released at depth have a higher tendency to remain near the surface after upwelling which gives rise to relatively faster growth of a x 2 t at late times 7 2 particle pair dispersion particle pair or relative dispersion is the mean square pair separation given by 6 r 2 t x 1 t x 2 t 2 where x 1 t and x 2 t are the positions of the paired particles and represents the mean taken over all the selected pairs from eq 6 r 2 t r x 2 t r y 2 t r z 2 t with r x 2 t r y 2 t and r z 2 t arising from x y and z separations respectively the short and long time behaviors of r 2 t are easily understood for short times the difference between u 1 t and u 2 t is nearly constant since the particles are nearby and r 2 t grows ballistically as t 2 on the other hand the particles in a pair become widely separated at long times and their uncorrelated motions lead to a long time pair dispersion behavior which is similar to the single particle dispersion the time evolution of relative dispersion for the particle pairs released in the central region of the front 500 m y 500 m are shown in fig 16 different pairs are considered for calculating various components the nearest neighbors separated in y for r x 2 t in x for r y 2 t and both in x and y for r z 2 t consider the particles released at 10 m depth solid lines in fig 16a initially all three components of relative dispersion grow as t 2 and unlike absolute dispersion have similar magnitudes the vertical component starts to deviate from t 2 at t 0 4 h grows slowly and subsequently r z 2 saturates at o 10 m similar to a z 2 the late time behavior of r x 2 t and r y 2 t is not apparent in fig 16a and statistics over a longer time duration are needed however their behavior is expected to converge to the single particles statistics of a x 2 t and a y 2 t the relative dispersion of the particle pairs released at 30 m depth behaves qualitatively similar to the pairs released at 10 m depth and the dispersion curves follow closely for the two particle groups during the intermediate times r x 2 t and r y 2 t exhibit t 3 growth and the rms relative displacement is o 100 m which is comparable to the width of the vortex filaments inertial range turbulence with forward energy cascade displays t 3 behavior for the relative dispersion however there are fundamentally different flow configurations not necessarily turbulent that can also lead to similar dispersive behavior e g shear dispersion to further investigate the intermediate scale dynamics we examine the relative dispersion of the particle pairs released at the surface where they are constrained to have w p 0 in fig 16b interestingly the surface pairs also exhibit t 3 growth of r x 2 t and r y 2 t during the intermediate times however the visualization of surface particles in time reveals dispersion primarily by the horizontal shear and straining in the vortex filaments where the particles get attracted after their release it is the energetic submesoscale rather than the turbulent finescale that controls particle dispersion the surface pairs transition to the long time behavior earlier than the particles released at 10 m depth lastly we note that the submesoscale turbulence simulated here does not show any evidence of exponential growth for the relative dispersion components in x and y below the deformation radius which is comparable to the diameter of the submesoscale eddies this is consistent with the fact that the energy spectra e k k β in vps19 have β in the range 2 3 for nonlocal dispersion with exponential growth of pair separation 2d turbulent flows are required to have β 3 bennett 1984 7 3 multiparticle dispersion isotropic finescale turbulence increases the average volume of a multiparticle cluster while large scale coherent structures can lead to the cluster s deformation into flow specific geometries pumir et al 2000 introduced a statistical measure using three or more material points to probe the geometry of lagrangian dispersion here we investigate the shape changes by tracking groups of four particles following pumir et al 2000 the geometry of a tetrad is defined by the following three vectors 7 r 1 1 2 x p 1 x p 2 8 r 2 1 6 2 x p 3 x p 1 x p 2 9 r 3 1 12 3 x p 4 x p 1 x p 2 x p 3 where x p i with i 1 2 3 4 are the position vectors of the four particles at the vertices of a tetrahedron the radius of gyration of the cluster is r 2 i 1 3 r i 2 and measures the spatial extent of the tetrad the vectors involving position differences are combined into a second order tensor 10 g r r t where r r 1 r 2 r 3 is a second order tensor with r 1 r 2 and r 3 as its column vectors the eigenvalues of g g 1 g 2 g 3 characterize the cluster shape for example g 1 g 2 g 3 corresponds to an isotropic object g 1 g 2 g 3 to a pancake like object with vertical scale much smaller than horizontal and g 1 g 2 g 3 to a needle like object to compare the shapes at different times the eigenvalues are normalized by the radius of gyration r 2 trace g and denoted by i i g i r 2 the multiparticle statistical measure described above has been used to study cluster shape behavior in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and stably stratified homogeneous turbulence the present study is an application to a flow with submesoscale currents for the multiparticle study two additional particles were added for each node of the particle lattice at 10 m and 30 m depth a tetrad was formed with the nodal particle the two added particles and the particle above in the original lattice the construction of tetrads is illustrated in the inset of fig 17a and further described in the figure caption the multiparticle statistics are calculated using tetrads released in the central region 500 m y 500 m the normalized eigenvalues i 1 i 2 and i 3 averaged over the tetrads are plotted as a function of time in fig 17a the tetrads rapidly deform into flattened needle like objects within an hour after release as i 2 i 3 0 and i 1 1 subsequently i 2 plateaus during t 1 10 h and increases slightly at late times but always remains i 1 on the other hand i 3 continues to drop the fast o 1 h time scale of the initial distortion is consistent with the relative dispersion r z 2 in fig 16a which commences to flatten at about 1 h and saturates by about 20 h although the average i 1 i 2 and i 3 show the predominance of needle like objects by t 1 h other shapes may also be present after the release of the tetrads the pdfs of i 1 and i 2 in fig 17b show the shape distribution at different times within t 20 min the peak in the pdf of i 1 shifts to a value greater than 0 5 and that of i 2 to a value smaller than 0 5 however there are tetrads that can be considered pancake like after t 40 min distinct peaks appear for i 1 and i 2 close to 0 9 and 0 1 respectively as time progresses the peak at 0 9 moves towards 1 and that at 0 1 moves towards 0 most of the clusters deform into primarily flat needle like objects by t 1 2 h and remain so at late times visualization reveals that particles are attracted to the coherent filaments after they are released the high strain rates found in the filaments and at the outer edges of the submesoscale eddies act on the clusters to deform them into needle like objects the overall long time shape distribution observed in the present problem with submesoscale currents and the finescale organized in vortex filaments can be compared with that in other turbulent flows in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence the uncorrelated long time motions of the particles leads to i 1 g 0 748 i 2 g 0 222 and i 3 g 0 03 the small value of i 3 g compared to i 1 g and i 2 g suggests that the shapes are dominated by flat objects pumir et al 2000 biferale et al 2005 in stratified turbulence 1 found that i 1 becomes larger and i 2 smaller as stratification grows stronger in their study with strong stratification n100 with n 0 98 s 1 the shapes overall were needle like but the shape distribution examined by plotting the pdfs of i 1 and i 2 revealed the presence of a significant number of flat objects in the present work the pdfs of i 1 and i 2 show that most of the tetrads are deformed into needle shaped objects 8 discussion and conclusions we investigate material transport and dispersion by submesoscale turbulent currents generated during the evolution of baroclinic instability at an upper ocean front the study employs a les model and is performed in the lagrangian framework by releasing a large number of tracer particles that move with the local fluid velocity the presence of coherent structures is a typical feature of submesoscale dynamics from the lagrangian analysis we elucidate how these structures provide the primary pathways for the three dimensional transport by submesoscale currents and provide a quantitative assessment of time space scales of lagrangian motion the coherent particle motion is mediated by a filament eddy lobe framework shown in fig 8 particles experience rapid vertical motions with displacements of o 10 m over an hour in the filaments as well as slower motions at near inertial time scales while moving under the influence of coherent eddies and lobes it is possible to identify some common features that dictate the overall transport the central region particles cluster into inclined lobes each associated with a coherent eddy the lateral and vertical velocity of these particles reveals a clockwise circulation when viewed from above which is opposite to the cyclonic circulation induced by the coherent central zone eddies moreover the vortex filaments connect the heavy and light edges of the front with the central region and play a critical role in vertical and lateral transport and the restratification of the front the process can be described as follows the coherent filaments draw the edge particles into the central region and transfer them to the lobes heavy edge particles to the undersides and the light edge particles to the top layers conforming to the local stratification the flux of new edge particles into the central region causes the central region particles to adjust which leads the front to restratify a significant portion of the restratification is accomplished by 100 h which is slower than the o 10 h suggested by the events of significant downwelling with w p 1 0 3 ms 1 but is consistent with the average downwelling speed of w p 1 0 4 ms 1 we find that the lateral v p and vertical w p velocity of the particles moving through filaments and circulating in lobes have a near inertial time scale of o 2 π f and have a correlation which is consistent with the lateral buoyancy gradient for the present case where the cross front density gradient is negative the correlation is also negative the centers of mass z c o m of particle clouds subduct upwell through the vortex filaments over 1 2 inertial time periods and a slow adjustment follows after the particles are accommodated in the lobes the root mean square vertical displacement z r m s of the constituent particles with respect to the com saturates to 14 15 m lagrangian energy spectra show considerably more subinertial and inertial energy in the horizontal relative to the vertical but for super inertial ω f 10 f the components are comparable further the lagrangian autocorrelation functions of u p and v p exhibit oscillatory decay with a subinertial time scale where the oscillations reflect circulation within submesoscale eddies and lobes the vertical velocity component shows a fast timescale 1 h decorrelation corresponding to the turbulent finescale as well as a subinertial oscillatory modulation the observed subinertial timescales are consistent with the timescale of the growth of baroclinic instability the process of restratification in the present model front under bi is considerably different than the restratification process depicted in spall 1995 which assumes sliding of a fluid parcel from the heavy side of the front across to the light side in contrast the process described here is three dimensional and involves continuous stirring of the central region fluid by submesoscale coherent eddies and the injection of edge particles into the central region by the coherent vortex filaments thus after being subducted a heavy edge fluid parcel continues to move under the influence of the eddies at the front we also find that the vertical distribution of the particles released at a depth remains confined within 50 m depth from the surface over time which is also the initial depth of the front as shown in vps19 the vertical velocity in the thermocline is non zero but the particles do not subduct below the surface layer this behavior correlates with the fact that coherent structures control the vertical transport of the particles at the front since these structures are contained within the front so are the particles vertical transport below the mixed layer is possible with deeper fronts e g in observations of subduction of particulate organic matter by omand et al 2015 the simulations of gula et al 2014 which show deep penetrating cold filaments and the simulations of balwada et al 2018 which show that permitting the submesoscale enhances the transport of tracers below the mixing layer taylor et al 2020 find a modest increase of particle concentration below the mixed layer but their model has important differences with the present model e g the use of an advective diffusion equation for concentration instead of lagrangian tracers and convective forcing at the surface the near inertial oscillations observed here can be contrasted with the inertial oscillations associated with the geostrophic adjustment of an initially unbalanced fully or partial front analyzed by tandon and garrett 1994 in this system inertial oscillations are generated when the unbalanced front tries to slump by releasing potential energy but the coriolis force acts on the developed velocity field and provides a restoring tendency towards the original configuration tandon and garrett 1994 find that the oscillatory adjustment continues at inertial time scale and due to the lack of dissipation in their simplified model the system does not return to a stable stationary state in les of an initially balanced upper ocean front unstable to symmetric instabilities skyllingstad and samelson 2020 observe inertial oscillations when the geostrophic shear is disrupted due to surface wind or buoyancy forcing however the inertial currents are short lived and subside owing to vertical mixing and the onset of baroclinic instability in contrast the lagrangian near inertial oscillations in the present simulation result primarily from the circulation of the particles within the lobes and eddies furthermore the dynamics here are driven by bi the dispersion characteristics of the turbulent submesoscale currents have been studied in both single and pair particle dispersion the vertical component is restricted by the front depth and the rms of vertical displacement saturates to o 10 m at long times the along front component of single particle dispersion shows super diffusive behavior at late times and the mean square displacement increases as t α with α 1 5 0 2 the exponent α is typically larger for particles released at depth compared to those released near the surface the observed super diffusive behavior for the along front component can be related to the mean frontal jet with horizontal and vertical shear the particle pair dispersion in x and y directions show t 3 behavior at intermediate times when the rms displacement is o 100 m which is comparable to the lateral width of the vortex filaments although t 3 behavior is consistent with a kolmogorovian inertial range the role of horizontal shear on relative dispersion cannot be ruled out the multiparticle analysis reveals strong filamentogenesis as the tetrads deform into a thin needle like mean shape within a short time scale of o 1 h probability density functions of shape metrics indicate that there is a strong propensity to form needle shaped structures more so than in homogeneous stratified turbulence the filamentogenesis is associated with the strong strain field

23894,the three dimensional transport pathways the time and space scales of vertical transport and the dispersion characteristics single pair and multi particle statistics of submesoscale currents at an upper ocean front are investigated using material points tracer particles that advect with the local fluid velocity coherent vortex filaments and eddies generated and sustained during the evolution of baroclinic instability dominate submesoscale 0 1 10 km dynamics these coherent structures play a crucial role in the particle transport and dispersion which we quantify here particles in the central frontal region organize into vertically inclined lobes with anticyclonic circulation each associated with a coherent eddy with cyclonic rotation furthermore the coherent filaments associated with heavy light edges of the front transfer particles from the edges to the lobes by downwelling upwelling this flux of new particles into the central region causes the particles circulating in the lobes to adjust which leads to slumping of the front the particle motion in the vertical shows multiple time scales a fast time scale with o 10 m vertical displacement within an hour and a slower near inertial time scale comparable to the intrinsic time scale of the growing instability the fast o 1 h time scale is also seen in the decorrelation of vertical velocity and the tapering of the initial ballistic growth of relative particle dispersion the overall slumping process is slower than what one might anticipate from the large magnitude of vertical velocity in the filaments since it requires a sustained correlation over time between the lateral and the vertical motion by tracking clouds of particles we show that their centers of mass downwell upwell over 1 2 inertial time periods after which an adjustment follows with a sub inertial time scale the shape change in clusters of four particles reveals filamentogenesis i e deformation into thin needle like structures by the coherent anisotropic motions of the submesoscale which occurs as a rapid process that is complete within approximately an hour keywords submesoscale turbulence vertical transport dispersion baroclinic instability 1 introduction density fronts ubiquitous in the upper ocean are an important source of currents with submesoscale dynamics the dynamics typically occur at length scales of 0 1 10 km and the time scale of o 1 day and are characterized by o 1 values of rossby number r o u f l and richardson number r i n 2 z u 2 thomas et al 2008 mcwilliams 2016 here f is the coriolis parameter u is a characteristic horizontal velocity scale l is a characteristic horizontal length scale n g ρ 0 ρ z is the buoyancy frequency corresponding to density ρ stratification ρ 0 is a reference density and g is the gravitational constant the submesoscale plays a significant role in the restratification of the upper ocean and the vertical transport of tracers such as buoyancy salinity and carbon from the surface ocean to the interior boccaletti et al 2007 thomas et al 2008 omand et al 2015 these processes affect the upper ocean structure and impact the interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere thereby influencing the climate submesoscale currents also play a significant role in the ocean s biochemical cycle by aiding phytoplankton growth through supply of nutrients from the upper thermocline into the surface layer mahadevan 2016 many of the upper ocean processes driven by the submesoscale dynamics are possible because of their ability to develop large vertical velocity mahadevan and tandon 2006 presumably with spatial and temporal coherence this is in contrast to the small scale turbulent motions which are relevant for the local mixing or the balanced mesoscale motions in which the vertical velocity is orders of magnitude smaller the lateral transport is believed to be dominated by the mesoscale currents and eddies but the role of submesoscales can be significant as they can provide interconnections between the mesoscale transport barriers and enhance the horizontal spread haza et al 2016 the submesoscales are also important for predicting the dispersion of buoyant pollutants such as oil d asaro et al 2018 an understanding of the organization of vertical velocity and transport pathways is therefore crucial for understanding the submesoscale upper ocean transport and dispersion processes frontogenesis intensifies vertical motions a zone with horizontal buoyancy contrast can undergo frontogenesis through straining by a large scale confluent flow as well as non linear evolution of baroclinic instability bi hoskins and bretherton 1972 hoskins 1982 the initial stages of the frontogenetic development of bi at an atmospheric front have been studied in detail by mudrick 1974 recent studies have shown that a cold filament in upper ocean turbulence experiences a secondary circulation in the lateral vertical plane which is frontogenetic and which survives in the presence of boundary layer turbulence mcwilliams et al 2015 sullivan and mcwilliams 2018 the ageostrophic circulation in the case of a front with strong lateral buoyancy gradient can lead to nonlinear bores pham and sarkar 2018 filament structures with cyclonic vorticity were observed in the northern gulf of mexico in an observational campaign utilizing a large number of satellite tracked surface drifters d asaro et al 2018 the structures were smaller than 1 km in width separated the dense and light water masses and were convergent attracting surface drifters into a line that wrapped into a cyclonic eddy the convergence of water mass implies downwelling and the measured vertical velocity was as large as 1 2 cm s 1 in comparison the vertical velocity at a mesoscale front typically does not exceed o 0 01 cm s 1 rudnick 1996 the evolution of bi in upper ocean density fronts is an important mechanism for generating submesoscale currents the problem has been studied extensively using large scale ocean models capet et al 2008 and turbulence resolving models skyllingstad and samelson 2012 hamlington et al 2014 stamper and taylor 2017 verma et al 2019 simulating a density front that is initially in thermal wind balance verma et al 2019 hereafter vps19 find that the evolution of bi generates long thin vortex filaments with cyclonic vorticity and downwelling vertical velocity that roll into coherent submesoscale eddies these submesoscale filaments and the large vertical velocity inside them are similar to the submesoscale filament like features observed during the surface drifter measurements of d asaro et al 2018 vps19 showed that the coherent structures i e vortex filaments and eddies provide a 3d organization to the secondary circulation whose velocity field suggests that water is transported laterally and vertically across the front although there are organized 3d structures the actual paths followed by the fluid parcels over time are not apparent from the instantaneous velocity field as the dynamics is transient the spatial pattern of the velocity field changes when the coherent structures are transported by the sheared frontal jet a lagrangian framework is better suited for a study of material transport by the submesoscale which is the subject of this paper a related problem is about the time scale of subduction and restratification of the front the vertical velocity observed in the filaments can be so large as to produce vertical displacement of o 1 km in a day if sustained in magnitude and direction however the restratification is likely to progress on the time scale of baroclinic instability which is o 2 π f stone 1966 here we show evidence of a slow restratification at the near inertial time scale emerging from relatively fast motions in the filament structures lagrangian drifters and floats have been widely used in the ocean for understanding flow properties and dynamics e g see review article lacasce 2008 single particle metrics have been used for obtaining the mean flow eddy kinetic energy eddy diffusivity and lagrangian spectra characteristic of large spatial regions and sub inertial to inertial frequencies more recently lagrangian measurements have been extended to high frequency motions of oceanic turbulence including turbulence at fronts d asaro et al 2011 single particle dispersion statistics are also a convenient tool for predicting the spread of a particle from the point of release by a velocity field that has coherent unsteady currents and turbulence the particle pair dispersion statistics on the other hand reveal the spread of particles about the center of mass com of a particle cloud batchelor 1952 particle pair statistics are often used to probe the scale dependence of dynamics in a recent analysis of the trajectories of surface drifters deployed during the grand lagrangian dynamics glad experiment in the gulf of mexico poje et al 2014 found that the second order velocity structure function showed power law behavior from 200 m to 100 km including the submesoscale range suggesting the dominance of local advective dynamics balwada et al 2016 applied a helmholtz decomposition of the second order structure function computed from the glad drifters into divergent and rotational components finding that the divergent component dominated at scales below 5 km and also computed the third order structure function from their analysis they inferred forward 3 d energy cascade below 5 km 2 d enstrophy cascade between 5 to 40 km the deformation radius and an inverse energy cascade between 40 100 km beron vera and lacasce 2016 examined pair separation statistics in the submesoscale range using synthetic drifter trajectories from data assimilated ncom simulations conducted with 1 km horizontal resolution they found that the pair separation grew exponentially in accord with non local dynamics they further attributed the discrepancy of their result with the results from glad observational drifter trajectories to the strong inertial oscillations experienced by the glad drifters and their limited number of independent samples with possibly low statistical significance in the ocean internal gravity waves are likely to further complicate the statistical measure arising due to submesoscale dynamics multiparticle studies have also been used mainly to measure flow properties such as relative vorticity and horizontal divergence molinari and kirwan 1975 multiparticle statistics using groups of four particles tetrads can be used to investigate the changes in the shape of the particle clusters which result from straining by the large scale flows and dispersion by the finescale motions as shown by pumir et al 2000 in this study we employ the model front of vps19 to investigate the transport and dispersion characteristics of the submesoscale currents including finescale turbulence during the evolution of bi the model of vps19 does not contain strong inertial motions internal gravity waves or surface forcing thus providing an ideal setup for studying the dispersion characteristics of submesoscale currents in isolation owing to the high resolution 2 m in all three directions of the simulation we are able to capture 3d turbulence generated during the evolution of bi the domain size of 4 km captures a wide range of the submesoscale but not the mesoscale the study is performed in the lagrangian framework by releasing a large number of tracer particles that move with the local fluid velocity the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the setup of the model front of vps19 is summarized in section 3 the 3d coherent structures observed in vps19 are briefly described the details about the tracer particle simulation are given in section 4 in section 5 the 3d organization of the particles the typical features of the transport pathways and the restratification of the front are examined in section 6 various time scales of the lagrangian motion are investigated and the vertical transport of tracer particles is studied by monitoring the centers of mass of particle clouds and the dispersion of particles within the clouds section 7 focuses on the dispersion characteristics of the submesoscale currents including the localized three dimensional finescale associated with the currents in this section single and pair particle dispersion statistics are investigated and shape changes following groups of four particles tetrads are reported finally in section 8 conclusions are drawn based on the results with a brief discussion about their implications 2 model setup the model which is the same as the one employed by vps19 is summarized here the problem is initialized as an upper ocean front in thermal wind balance with a surface jet the front of width l 1 2 km is confined to a surface layer of depth h 50 m situated above a strongly stratified thermocline the front is aligned with the x direction along front and the temperature variation in y cross front and z vertical coordinates sets the buoyancy contrast the value of m 2 g ρ 0 ρ y at the center y 0 is m 0 2 1 5 1 0 7 s 2 the square of buoyancy frequency n 2 g ρ 0 ρ z takes the value of n m 2 3 0 1 0 7 s 2 in the 50 m deep surface layer and n t 2 1 0 5 s 2 in the thermocline below the surface layer the frontal jet u y z is constructed from the density field by integrating the thermal wind relation u z m 2 f where f 1 4 1 0 4 s 1 is the coriolis parameter the velocity u y z is negative as shown in fig 1 the potential vorticity at the front is initially negative and the setup is unstable to symmetric perturbations the evolution of the model front is studied numerically utilizing the large eddy simulation les approach and solving the non hydrostatic navier stokes equations under the boussinesq approximation vps19 can be referred for the numerical algorithm when the navier stokes equations are scaled by the velocity scale u 0 m 0 2 h f the maximum geostrophic jet velocity at the surface and the buoyancy scale n m 2 h the following set of non dimensional parameters ensues the ekman number e k ν f h 2 2 86 1 0 6 the non dimensional lateral buoyancy gradient m 0 2 f 2 7 65 and the richardson number r i n m 2 f 2 m 0 4 0 26 the ratio m 0 2 f 2 7 65 is comparable to the values used in the studies of skyllingstad and samelson 2012 and hamlington et al 2014 the rossby number r o u 0 f l based on the initial horizontal shear is 0 32 and the reynolds number r e u 0 h ν is 2 67 1 0 6 the computational domain spans 0 x 4098 m 3073 m y 3073 m and 130 m z 0 a uniform grid with 2050 3074 66 points is employed initially providing a grid resolution of 2 m in each direction later during the evolution of baroclinic instability the solution is obtained using a grid which is the same in the horizontal but has 98 grid points in the vertical with uniform stretching such that the grid spacing changes from 0 5 m near the surface to 1 5 m near the bottom the finer grid resolution in the vertical is needed near the surface to resolve the surface intensified turbulence in the vortex filaments that develops during the nonlinear evolution of bi 3 submesoscale structures the evolution of the front which is discussed in detail in vps19 is summarized here to motivate the lagrangian studies of this paper the initial setup is unstable to symmetric instability si however as the front restratifies it becomes stable to si taylor and ferrari 2009 arobone and sarkar 2015 most of the evolution of the front is therefore controlled by baroclinic instability bi which becomes dominant after si subsides the nonlinear growth of bi spawns submesoscale coherent structures such as vortex filaments and eddies additionally the sharpest frontal features develop 3d shear instabilities that sustain turbulence arresting frontogenesis vps19

vertical vorticity at 10 m figs 2a c and 30 m figs 2d f depth at different times fig 2a plotted at t 57 2 h during the initial rollup of the front reveals filaments of cyclonic vorticity which connect to the heavy edge of the front and wrap into the central coherent eddies at this time the eddies are small and only slightly larger than the filament width of o 100 m the eddies are vertically coherent and can be identified at 30 m depth in fig 2d the structures are advected by the mean flow in the negative x direction as the instabilities evolve the vorticity filaments grow in length and the eddies become larger in diameter figs 2b c isosurfaces of q fig 3 illustrate the three dimensional organization of the coherent structures here q is calculated using the submesoscale velocity fields i e q ω i j 2 s i j 2 2 where ω i j u i x j u j x i 2 and s i j u i x j u j x i 2 the regions with q 0 represent rotation dominated flow whereas those with q 0 represent strain dominated flow the vertical coherence of the submesoscale coherent eddies is evident as are the interspersed regions of strain 4 setup of particle tracking tracer particles were introduced in the flow at t 0 57 2 h to assess material transport under the influence of submesoscale currents at this time the vortex filaments have formed at the front and have begun to wrap into eddies figs 2a d the particles are placed at the nodes of a regular lattice that occupies the entire domain 0 x 4 1 km in the along front x direction 1 6 y 1 6 km in the lateral y direction and 70 z 2 m in the vertical z direction with resolution 16 m 16 m 2 m before introducing the particles the simulation run with a uniform δ z 2 m is interpolated to a grid with higher vertical resolution 0 5 m near the surface to 1 5 m near the bottom of the front at t 56 h the tracer particles are passive and by definition move with the local fluid velocity according to 1 d x p d t u f x p t where u f x p t is the fluid velocity at the particle position x p eq 1 is advanced in time with a third order runge kutta rk3 scheme and u f x p t is obtained by the fourth order lagrange interpolation of a cell centered velocity field the navier stokes solver stores the velocity components at the edge centers and cell centering is achieved by linear interpolation a cfl value smaller than one for particle advection ensures a stable numerical trajectory 5 advection of tracer particles individual particle trajectories differ considerably even for neighboring particles nevertheless there is an overall organization in their motions influenced by the coherent structures as elaborated below anticipating differences in the particle behavior in the initial frontal zone from its edges we distinguish among particle groups according to their cross front y locations of release as follows i central region 500 m y 500 m ii heavy edge y 500 m and iii light edge y 500 m 5 1 particle trajectories the trajectories of particles p1 p7 released at z 30 m and x 1490 m are shown in fig 4 the 3d trajectories in fig 4d reveal that the paths followed by the particles are strikingly different from one another however transport characteristics common to particles within a group can be identified by examining the trajectories x p t y p t and z p t figs 4a c depending on their initial y coordinates fig 4c the particles can be distinguished as the heavy edge particles p1 and p2 the central region particles p3 p5 and the light edge particles p6 and p7 particle p3 is selected such that it is located within a submesoscale eddy the vertical trajectories of the particles plotted in fig 4c reveal that the heavy edge particles p1 and p2 downwell while the light edge and central region particles p3 p7 upwell a negative correlation between lateral v p and vertical w p velocity can be observed for central region particles p4 and p5 and at late times for edge particles p2 and p6 for example p4 moves vertically downward when its lateral motion is in the positive y direction while it moves vertically upward when the lateral motion is in the negative y direction moreover the correlated y and z motions of p4 and p5 exhibit oscillations with a time period of about 25 h which is twice the inertial time period t i 12 5 h the central region particle p3 released within an eddy remains trapped inside the eddy and shows near inertial oscillations in its y coordinates the vertical trajectory of p6 shows a fast time scale event with remarkably rapid transport in the vertical this event starts at t 97 h when p6 downwells by approximately 20 m from a to b over a period of about an hour and then upwells back to the surface from b to c in the next 2 5 h the downwelling occurs when the particle gets attracted to a heavy edge filament and is followed by upwelling when it finds itself in a denser background the edge particles begin to advect vertically at different times the particles motions farther away from the central region are delayed relative to the closer ones in fig 4c the approximate start of vertical transport is marked with solid squares in the trajectories p1 starts moving vertically after p2 and p6 after p5 since p2 and p5 are closer to the central region than p1 and p6 we will show that the vertical transport of particles is initiated by coherent vortex filaments at the edges of the slumping front and those outside are transported afterwards as the front width increases slowly to reach them the along front particle displacements are generally in the negative x direction fig 4a following the mean u however a particle can acquire u p 0 especially when it reaches the bottom of the front e g p2 during t 96 105 h and p4 during t 64 72 h notice that the x trajectories of particles e g p5 and p6 which cross the left domain boundary at x 0 are continued into the negative x region considering the streamwise periodicity of the domain typically the upwelling particles p6 and p7 have larger negative x displacements compared to the downwelling particles p1 and p2 as the upwelling particles tend to spend more time near the surface where the along front speed is larger oscillations with small amplitudes can be observed in the vertical trajectories e g p4 p5 and p6 indicating the influence of the finescales however the effect of the finescales on the along front and cross front displacements is weak 5 2 coherent transport pathways section 5 1 showed particle trajectories with multiple time scales and distinctive behavior depending on the lateral particle location here we demonstrate that the coherent structures seen in the eulerian analysis of vps19 organize the particle motion in a specific manner the positions of central region particles released at z 20 m are shown in fig 5 at t 84 9 h after a flight time of 27 7 h along with their trajectories over the last 45 min particles especially those near the surface exhibit large lateral meanders the coherent submesoscale eddies in the central region impart a cyclonic circulation to the particles moreover the particles transported across the front to the light side y 0 4 km exhibit a distinct organization into additional structures that are vertically inclined reach down to the depth of up to 50 m similar to the coherent eddies and extend laterally towards the light edge of the front these structures although associated with an eddy have particles undergoing anticyclonic circulation as opposed to the cyclonic circulation imparted by the eddies we refer to these inclined anticyclonic structures as lobes two lobes lb1 and lb2 can be identified in fig 5 and are further discussed below we take a more comprehensive look at the 3d organization of particles by the submesoscale currents using particles released at 10 m and 40 m depth figs 6a f show temperature t p lateral velocity v p and vertical velocity w p of the particles at the same time as fig 5 lobes lb1 and lb2 can be observed within the front in all the figures the lobes are stratified figs 6a b having warm particles in the upper region and cold particles in the lower the particle circulations are illustrated by v p and w p figs 6c e for the 10 m depth particles and figs 6d f for the 40 m depth particles the negative correlation between v p and w p seen for some of the particle trajectories of section 5 1 are revealed to be associated with motion in the lobes for example particles at the side lbf marked by circles with dots in fig 6c of lobe lb2 have positive v p at the same time the mostly negative w p in lbf figs 6e f corresponds to downwelling eventually v p becomes negative when the particles reach side lbb marked by circles with crosses in fig 6c of lobe lb2 at lbb w p is mostly positive as seen in fig 6e and the particles climb up the lobe in general the particles circulate within the same lobe especially when the interaction between the neighboring eddies is weak it is worth noting that the correlation between v p and w p is such that the associated circulation in the lateral vertical plane follows the isopycnal slope in the present case the lateral density gradient points in the negative x direction and therefore v p and w p have negative correlation the coherent vortex filaments are crucial to transporting edge particles into the central eddy lobe circulation two light edge filaments lef1 and lef2 in fig 6b have mostly w p 0 fig 6f and lift the warm edge particles towards the upper layers of the stratified lobes although not visible in fig 6 there are coherent filaments connected to the heavy edge of the front as well the role of the filament structures on the transport is made clearer by the positions at t 84 9 h of heavy edge particles released at 10 m depth fig 7a and light edge particles released at 40 m depth fig 7b in fig 7a particles at depth are seen at y 0 as they are transported by heavy edge vortex filaments hef1 and hef2 across the front and downwell to the underside of the lobes these downwelled particles collect within the lobes and undergo the previously described circulation of the lobe the light edge filaments lef1 and lef2 in fig 7b are located between the heavy edge filaments after being lifted upwards through the light edge filament particles branch back to the bottom of the front through the downwelling limb of the lobe interestingly some particles detach from this main branch near the surface and spread laterally under the influence of the near surface circulation these particles associated with lef2 are enclosed within the rectangular box shown in fig 7b fig 8 gives a consolidated picture of lagrangian pathways at the front transport to the central region by vortex filaments stirring by the central submesoscale eddies and circulations within vertically inclined lobes the upwelling of light edge fluid through vortex filaments to the upper layers of the lobes is shown and the downwelling of heavy edge fluid through vortex filaments to the undersides of the lobes is also partially shown 1 1 a supplementary movie illustrates the coherent transport of particles utilizing those released at 20 m depth particles are released in the central region blue and red at the heavy edge cyan and the light edge green the central region particles spread vertically and organize into three lobes but eventually only two persist after a lobe merging event along front advection of the lobes along with coherent eddies and the anticyclonic circulation of the particles within the lobes can be observed the lobes are stratified with different colored particles roughly confined to different layers further the light edge green particles transferred to the lobes by vortex filaments spread on the top layers while the heavy edge cyan particles spread at the undersides the slumping of the lobes in the lateral over time indicates restratification of the front 5 3 restratification process submesoscale currents lead to bulk restratification the link between the stirring by the 3d filament eddy lobe motions to restratification of the x averaged front is elaborated here fig 9 characterizes how the particles released in the central light and heavy regions redistribute spatially as time progresses for identifying their x averaged distribution the particles are sampled in thin long cells which extend over l x 4 1 km entire x domain and have dimensions of δ s y 16 m and δ s z 2 m in the cross section as the front evolves the central region cloud slumps its stable density contrast is maintained for the most part particles from the heavy edge primarily subduct below and those from the light edge spread above the slumping central region the time scale of the bulk restratification is of interest the evolution of volume averaged n 2 t and m 2 t is shown in fig 10 a significant portion of the restratification which would lead to a final n 2 3 6 1 0 6 s 2 upon completion of frontal slumping takes place by t 100 h taking w p 1 0 3 ms 1 to characterize speeds during significant downwelling events leads to a time scale t m l 13 9 h for traversing the mixed layer of h 50 m restratification is evidently slower than that suggested by the large values of w p vps19 apply a lanczos horizontal filter of o 100 m to w to obtain the coherent submesoscale velocity w identify the downwelling regions with w 0 and define the submesoscale vertical velocity in those regions as w similarly here we define w w in regions where w 0 the average of w over the front was found to be w 1 0 4 ms 1 a ml traverse time of h w 133 h agrees better with the observed restratification time scale the horizontal buoyancy gradient m 2 t progressively decreases from its initial value of m 0 2 1 5 1 0 7 s 2 as the front collapses but remains significant at t 100 h because regions with vertical shear persist and frontogenesis continues to support regions with large local m 2 there is variability in n 2 also with larger values at the top and bottom of the considered volume 6 vertical transport in this section we investigate the collective motion of particles by tracking particle clouds lagrangian time scales are obtained and the statistics of vertical displacement are assessed the finite width clouds whose length extends across the streamwise domain are initialized with particles released at 10 m and 40 m depth figs 11a d the cloud array covers 800 y 800 m across the front such that the particles constituting any given cloud have similar density and therefore have similar buoyancy control on the dynamics at each depth fourteen clouds c1 c14 are constructed with average density temperature decreasing increasing progressively from cloud c1 to c14 each cloud has more than 1000 particles leading to reasonably converged statistics 6 1 separation of timescales different time scales involved in particle transport can be understood by examining the lagrangian energy spectra and autocorrelation functions of the particle velocity the lagrangian spectra for cloud c i are calculated as 2 s u p ω f 1 2 u ˆ p ω f 2 c i s v p ω f 1 2 v ˆ p ω f 2 c i 3 s w p ω f 1 2 w ˆ p ω f 2 c i where u ˆ p ω f v ˆ p ω f and w ˆ p ω f are the fourier transforms of the velocity time records ω f is the angular frequency and c i represents averaging over all the particles in cloud c i the velocity data over 57 2 t 105 2 h are considered the non uniform time data are interpolated to a uniform grid and the hanning window is applied the lagrangian energy spectra for the central region cloud c7 released at 10 m depth fig 12a reveal two dynamical regimes at subinertial time scales with ω f f 1 the horizontal kinetic energy is much larger than the vertical component reflecting strong submesoscale dynamics on the other hand at time scales with 10 ω f f 100 all three components have comparable energy reflecting the influence of 3d finescale dynamics furthermore unlike the horizontal components the w p spectrum shows little variability over 1 ω f 10 this suggests that finescales are likely to have a significant influence on the vertical motion whereas the horizontal motion of the particle is dominated principally by the slower subinertial submesoscale dynamics the energy spectra for the 40 m release depth in fig 12b are similar to those at 10 m release depth suggesting similarity of particles motions in the central region over the depth of the front the fast time scale in the spectra can be related to the vertical shear of the horizontal velocity in the model front with thermal wind balance the vertical shear u z m 2 f o 10 f corresponds to a time scale of about 1 h at this time scale as shown in figs 12a b the lagrangian dynamics start to behave as three dimensional the two point autocorrelation is defined for the along front velocity by 4 ρ u p t τ u p t u p t τ c i u p 2 t c i and similarly for the other two components the autocorrelation functions for u p and v p figs 13a b are dominated by subinertial time scales and do not vanish over the advection time considered here the temporal oscillations in ρ u p and ρ v p arise from particle circulation within the coherent submesoscale eddies and lobes at the front in contrast ρ w p drops from its peak to a small value 0 2 within an hour shown in the insets followed by a small amplitude oscillation dominated by slow subinertial time scales similar to that for the horizontal velocity components the short time scale in ρ w p is due to two factors motion in and near the filaments where w is large and rapidly varying and near n oscillations of w p noting that a lagrangian mean n 2 2 2 1 0 6 s 2 leads to a time scale of 1 2 h 6 2 vertical transport of particle clouds here the motion of the cloud s center of mass com and the spread of the particles about the com are examined the com of the cloud is defined by x c o m k i 1 n k x i k n k where x i k is the position of the i t h particle in a cloud with index k and n k is the total number of particles in the cloud the spread of particles in a cloud is characterized by the root mean square rms displacement about the com x r m s k i 1 n k x i k x c o m k 2 n k first we examine the clouds released at 10 m depth figs 14a b typically the clouds released over the heavy edge and the central region subduct whereas those released at the light edge upwell the trajectories of subducting clouds exhibit near inertial oscillations superposed to a mean profile two different types of behavior can be noticed for these subducting clouds clouds c2 c7 exhibit significant vertical displacements over 1 2 inertial time periods inertial period is t 12 5 h which is followed by a slow adjustment on the other hand clouds c8 c10 show continuous subduction over the time considered here among the light edge clouds c13 and c14 c13 shows a weak subduction while c14 shows upwelling the plots of z r m s fig 14b reveal vertical spread of the particles as the clouds downwell upwell at the front the z r m s values grow over 1 2 inertial time periods and saturate to constant values oscillating with near inertial frequencies the clouds released over the heavy edge and the central region c2 c10 saturate to z r m s 15 m and those released over the light edge c13 and c14 saturate to z r m s 5 7 m indicating a more compact configuration in contrast the z c o m trajectories plotted in fig 14c for the 40 m depth clouds show upwelling except for c2 released at the heavy edge an upwelling cloud typically moves upwards over 1 2 inertial time periods to reach a peak and a slow adjustment follows subsequently for the light edge clouds c13 and c14 upwelling is delayed and the peaks are reached later the z c o m trajectory of the heavy edge cloud c3 reveals upwelling and that of c2 small downwelling similar to the 10 m depth clouds the particles in 40 m depth clouds disperse vertically as they upwell downwell the vertical spread of the constituent particles in the cloud z r m s with time is shown in fig 14d the spread of the particles fig 14d in the central region clouds c3 c10 and the clouds immediately at the edges c2 and c13 reaches peak values within 1 2 inertial time periods and tends to asymptote to a constant value of about 14 m the behavior of edge clouds c2 and c14 is somewhat different since there is a time delay before the particles are put into motion by the coherent filaments the peaks in z r m s develop late for c2 and c14 their long time behavior is not clear in the present simulation the upwelling downwelling of clouds especially from the edges over near inertial time scales and subsequent adjustment of the constituent particles can be explained in terms of transport and organization of the particles by the coherent structures the coherent vortex filaments associated with the heavy and light edges of the front draw the neighboring particles into the central region over 1 2 inertial periods reaching a maximum minimum in the z c o m trajectory and transfer the particles to the lobes where they adjust to the local circulation and stratification the near inertial time scale suggests the control of submesoscale dynamics driven by bi on the vertical transport 7 dispersion 7 1 single particle dispersion single particle or absolute dispersion is the mean square displacement 5 a 2 t x t x 0 2 where x t x 0 is the displacement of a tracer particle and represents the mean taken over an ensemble of particles eq 5 can be expressed as a 2 t a x 2 t a y 2 t a z 2 t where a x 2 t a y 2 t and a z 2 t arise from the x y and z displacements respectively unlike homogeneous isotropic turbulence particle dispersion is anisotropic in this problem since the particles move in a stratified environment under the action of coherent structures and a mean downfront jet with vertical and lateral shear initially the dispersion is ballistic so that a x 2 t a y 2 t and a z 2 t in fig 15 grow as t 2 the vertical dispersion a z 2 t starts to deviate from t 2 behavior at t 0 5 h when the rms vertical displacement is about 2 m and saturates to o 10 m at late times a x 2 t and a y 2 t grow as t 2 over longer time durations the autocorrelation functions associated with the particle s x and y velocity components figs 13a b show a time scale of 10 h over which the functions drop below zero and become negative in accordance with this time scale we find that the behavior of a x 2 t and a y 2 t changes from t 2 when t 10 h subsequently a long time behavior emerges after t 35 h which is super diffusive in the x direction with a x 2 t t α where α 1 and diffusive in the y direction with a y 2 t t we calculate the exponent α using linear regression and find that its value depends on the depth at which the central zone particles are released the exponent varies as α 1 3 1 7 for the particles released between 10 m to 40 m depth for the particles released at 30 m α 1 6 the exponent α is typically larger for the particles released at depth compared to those released near the surface the reason is that the depth particles upwell e g fig 14b and tend to advect near the surface where the along front velocity is relatively larger therefore the particles spread faster with respect to their initial locations and have a higher value for the exponent α in comparison the surface particles downwell and their along front advection is slower resulting in a smaller exponent α in fig 15 the long time dispersion behavior in the x direction is compared with the nominal exponent of α 1 5 for the particles released at 10 m and 30 m depth at late times diffusive behavior is commonly anticipated in a turbulent flow as the particle performs random walk while moving under the influence of different eddies the observed super diffusive behavior in a x 2 t can be attributed to the horizontal and vertical shear of mean u simple stochastic models demonstrate that in a sheared velocity field absolute dispersion can grow as t α where 1 α 3 and the value of the exponent α depends on the shear profile lacasce 2008 for example if mean u has a constant shear along y then the random walk by advecting particles in y exhibits dispersion with a x 2 t t 3 super diffusive behavior has been observed in other flow configurations as well in stratified turbulence this behavior arises due to u z in the layers between coherent pancake eddies van aartrijk et al 2008 the behavior of a x 2 t a y 2 t and a z 2 t is qualitatively similar for the 10 m depth and 30 m depth particles one difference is that the initial increase of a x 2 t is considerably faster for the particles released at 10 m depth compared to those released at 30 m depth this behavior arises since u is strongest near the surface and decreases to zero at the bottom of the front at late times the dispersion curves tend to converge as the particles released at both depths become vertically dispersed and those advecting near the surface dominate the statistics leading to a super diffusive growth for a x 2 t the particles released at depth have a higher tendency to remain near the surface after upwelling which gives rise to relatively faster growth of a x 2 t at late times 7 2 particle pair dispersion particle pair or relative dispersion is the mean square pair separation given by 6 r 2 t x 1 t x 2 t 2 where x 1 t and x 2 t are the positions of the paired particles and represents the mean taken over all the selected pairs from eq 6 r 2 t r x 2 t r y 2 t r z 2 t with r x 2 t r y 2 t and r z 2 t arising from x y and z separations respectively the short and long time behaviors of r 2 t are easily understood for short times the difference between u 1 t and u 2 t is nearly constant since the particles are nearby and r 2 t grows ballistically as t 2 on the other hand the particles in a pair become widely separated at long times and their uncorrelated motions lead to a long time pair dispersion behavior which is similar to the single particle dispersion the time evolution of relative dispersion for the particle pairs released in the central region of the front 500 m y 500 m are shown in fig 16 different pairs are considered for calculating various components the nearest neighbors separated in y for r x 2 t in x for r y 2 t and both in x and y for r z 2 t consider the particles released at 10 m depth solid lines in fig 16a initially all three components of relative dispersion grow as t 2 and unlike absolute dispersion have similar magnitudes the vertical component starts to deviate from t 2 at t 0 4 h grows slowly and subsequently r z 2 saturates at o 10 m similar to a z 2 the late time behavior of r x 2 t and r y 2 t is not apparent in fig 16a and statistics over a longer time duration are needed however their behavior is expected to converge to the single particles statistics of a x 2 t and a y 2 t the relative dispersion of the particle pairs released at 30 m depth behaves qualitatively similar to the pairs released at 10 m depth and the dispersion curves follow closely for the two particle groups during the intermediate times r x 2 t and r y 2 t exhibit t 3 growth and the rms relative displacement is o 100 m which is comparable to the width of the vortex filaments inertial range turbulence with forward energy cascade displays t 3 behavior for the relative dispersion however there are fundamentally different flow configurations not necessarily turbulent that can also lead to similar dispersive behavior e g shear dispersion to further investigate the intermediate scale dynamics we examine the relative dispersion of the particle pairs released at the surface where they are constrained to have w p 0 in fig 16b interestingly the surface pairs also exhibit t 3 growth of r x 2 t and r y 2 t during the intermediate times however the visualization of surface particles in time reveals dispersion primarily by the horizontal shear and straining in the vortex filaments where the particles get attracted after their release it is the energetic submesoscale rather than the turbulent finescale that controls particle dispersion the surface pairs transition to the long time behavior earlier than the particles released at 10 m depth lastly we note that the submesoscale turbulence simulated here does not show any evidence of exponential growth for the relative dispersion components in x and y below the deformation radius which is comparable to the diameter of the submesoscale eddies this is consistent with the fact that the energy spectra e k k β in vps19 have β in the range 2 3 for nonlocal dispersion with exponential growth of pair separation 2d turbulent flows are required to have β 3 bennett 1984 7 3 multiparticle dispersion isotropic finescale turbulence increases the average volume of a multiparticle cluster while large scale coherent structures can lead to the cluster s deformation into flow specific geometries pumir et al 2000 introduced a statistical measure using three or more material points to probe the geometry of lagrangian dispersion here we investigate the shape changes by tracking groups of four particles following pumir et al 2000 the geometry of a tetrad is defined by the following three vectors 7 r 1 1 2 x p 1 x p 2 8 r 2 1 6 2 x p 3 x p 1 x p 2 9 r 3 1 12 3 x p 4 x p 1 x p 2 x p 3 where x p i with i 1 2 3 4 are the position vectors of the four particles at the vertices of a tetrahedron the radius of gyration of the cluster is r 2 i 1 3 r i 2 and measures the spatial extent of the tetrad the vectors involving position differences are combined into a second order tensor 10 g r r t where r r 1 r 2 r 3 is a second order tensor with r 1 r 2 and r 3 as its column vectors the eigenvalues of g g 1 g 2 g 3 characterize the cluster shape for example g 1 g 2 g 3 corresponds to an isotropic object g 1 g 2 g 3 to a pancake like object with vertical scale much smaller than horizontal and g 1 g 2 g 3 to a needle like object to compare the shapes at different times the eigenvalues are normalized by the radius of gyration r 2 trace g and denoted by i i g i r 2 the multiparticle statistical measure described above has been used to study cluster shape behavior in homogeneous isotropic turbulence and stably stratified homogeneous turbulence the present study is an application to a flow with submesoscale currents for the multiparticle study two additional particles were added for each node of the particle lattice at 10 m and 30 m depth a tetrad was formed with the nodal particle the two added particles and the particle above in the original lattice the construction of tetrads is illustrated in the inset of fig 17a and further described in the figure caption the multiparticle statistics are calculated using tetrads released in the central region 500 m y 500 m the normalized eigenvalues i 1 i 2 and i 3 averaged over the tetrads are plotted as a function of time in fig 17a the tetrads rapidly deform into flattened needle like objects within an hour after release as i 2 i 3 0 and i 1 1 subsequently i 2 plateaus during t 1 10 h and increases slightly at late times but always remains i 1 on the other hand i 3 continues to drop the fast o 1 h time scale of the initial distortion is consistent with the relative dispersion r z 2 in fig 16a which commences to flatten at about 1 h and saturates by about 20 h although the average i 1 i 2 and i 3 show the predominance of needle like objects by t 1 h other shapes may also be present after the release of the tetrads the pdfs of i 1 and i 2 in fig 17b show the shape distribution at different times within t 20 min the peak in the pdf of i 1 shifts to a value greater than 0 5 and that of i 2 to a value smaller than 0 5 however there are tetrads that can be considered pancake like after t 40 min distinct peaks appear for i 1 and i 2 close to 0 9 and 0 1 respectively as time progresses the peak at 0 9 moves towards 1 and that at 0 1 moves towards 0 most of the clusters deform into primarily flat needle like objects by t 1 2 h and remain so at late times visualization reveals that particles are attracted to the coherent filaments after they are released the high strain rates found in the filaments and at the outer edges of the submesoscale eddies act on the clusters to deform them into needle like objects the overall long time shape distribution observed in the present problem with submesoscale currents and the finescale organized in vortex filaments can be compared with that in other turbulent flows in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence the uncorrelated long time motions of the particles leads to i 1 g 0 748 i 2 g 0 222 and i 3 g 0 03 the small value of i 3 g compared to i 1 g and i 2 g suggests that the shapes are dominated by flat objects pumir et al 2000 biferale et al 2005 in stratified turbulence 1 found that i 1 becomes larger and i 2 smaller as stratification grows stronger in their study with strong stratification n100 with n 0 98 s 1 the shapes overall were needle like but the shape distribution examined by plotting the pdfs of i 1 and i 2 revealed the presence of a significant number of flat objects in the present work the pdfs of i 1 and i 2 show that most of the tetrads are deformed into needle shaped objects 8 discussion and conclusions we investigate material transport and dispersion by submesoscale turbulent currents generated during the evolution of baroclinic instability at an upper ocean front the study employs a les model and is performed in the lagrangian framework by releasing a large number of tracer particles that move with the local fluid velocity the presence of coherent structures is a typical feature of submesoscale dynamics from the lagrangian analysis we elucidate how these structures provide the primary pathways for the three dimensional transport by submesoscale currents and provide a quantitative assessment of time space scales of lagrangian motion the coherent particle motion is mediated by a filament eddy lobe framework shown in fig 8 particles experience rapid vertical motions with displacements of o 10 m over an hour in the filaments as well as slower motions at near inertial time scales while moving under the influence of coherent eddies and lobes it is possible to identify some common features that dictate the overall transport the central region particles cluster into inclined lobes each associated with a coherent eddy the lateral and vertical velocity of these particles reveals a clockwise circulation when viewed from above which is opposite to the cyclonic circulation induced by the coherent central zone eddies moreover the vortex filaments connect the heavy and light edges of the front with the central region and play a critical role in vertical and lateral transport and the restratification of the front the process can be described as follows the coherent filaments draw the edge particles into the central region and transfer them to the lobes heavy edge particles to the undersides and the light edge particles to the top layers conforming to the local stratification the flux of new edge particles into the central region causes the central region particles to adjust which leads the front to restratify a significant portion of the restratification is accomplished by 100 h which is slower than the o 10 h suggested by the events of significant downwelling with w p 1 0 3 ms 1 but is consistent with the average downwelling speed of w p 1 0 4 ms 1 we find that the lateral v p and vertical w p velocity of the particles moving through filaments and circulating in lobes have a near inertial time scale of o 2 π f and have a correlation which is consistent with the lateral buoyancy gradient for the present case where the cross front density gradient is negative the correlation is also negative the centers of mass z c o m of particle clouds subduct upwell through the vortex filaments over 1 2 inertial time periods and a slow adjustment follows after the particles are accommodated in the lobes the root mean square vertical displacement z r m s of the constituent particles with respect to the com saturates to 14 15 m lagrangian energy spectra show considerably more subinertial and inertial energy in the horizontal relative to the vertical but for super inertial ω f 10 f the components are comparable further the lagrangian autocorrelation functions of u p and v p exhibit oscillatory decay with a subinertial time scale where the oscillations reflect circulation within submesoscale eddies and lobes the vertical velocity component shows a fast timescale 1 h decorrelation corresponding to the turbulent finescale as well as a subinertial oscillatory modulation the observed subinertial timescales are consistent with the timescale of the growth of baroclinic instability the process of restratification in the present model front under bi is considerably different than the restratification process depicted in spall 1995 which assumes sliding of a fluid parcel from the heavy side of the front across to the light side in contrast the process described here is three dimensional and involves continuous stirring of the central region fluid by submesoscale coherent eddies and the injection of edge particles into the central region by the coherent vortex filaments thus after being subducted a heavy edge fluid parcel continues to move under the influence of the eddies at the front we also find that the vertical distribution of the particles released at a depth remains confined within 50 m depth from the surface over time which is also the initial depth of the front as shown in vps19 the vertical velocity in the thermocline is non zero but the particles do not subduct below the surface layer this behavior correlates with the fact that coherent structures control the vertical transport of the particles at the front since these structures are contained within the front so are the particles vertical transport below the mixed layer is possible with deeper fronts e g in observations of subduction of particulate organic matter by omand et al 2015 the simulations of gula et al 2014 which show deep penetrating cold filaments and the simulations of balwada et al 2018 which show that permitting the submesoscale enhances the transport of tracers below the mixing layer taylor et al 2020 find a modest increase of particle concentration below the mixed layer but their model has important differences with the present model e g the use of an advective diffusion equation for concentration instead of lagrangian tracers and convective forcing at the surface the near inertial oscillations observed here can be contrasted with the inertial oscillations associated with the geostrophic adjustment of an initially unbalanced fully or partial front analyzed by tandon and garrett 1994 in this system inertial oscillations are generated when the unbalanced front tries to slump by releasing potential energy but the coriolis force acts on the developed velocity field and provides a restoring tendency towards the original configuration tandon and garrett 1994 find that the oscillatory adjustment continues at inertial time scale and due to the lack of dissipation in their simplified model the system does not return to a stable stationary state in les of an initially balanced upper ocean front unstable to symmetric instabilities skyllingstad and samelson 2020 observe inertial oscillations when the geostrophic shear is disrupted due to surface wind or buoyancy forcing however the inertial currents are short lived and subside owing to vertical mixing and the onset of baroclinic instability in contrast the lagrangian near inertial oscillations in the present simulation result primarily from the circulation of the particles within the lobes and eddies furthermore the dynamics here are driven by bi the dispersion characteristics of the turbulent submesoscale currents have been studied in both single and pair particle dispersion the vertical component is restricted by the front depth and the rms of vertical displacement saturates to o 10 m at long times the along front component of single particle dispersion shows super diffusive behavior at late times and the mean square displacement increases as t α with α 1 5 0 2 the exponent α is typically larger for particles released at depth compared to those released near the surface the observed super diffusive behavior for the along front component can be related to the mean frontal jet with horizontal and vertical shear the particle pair dispersion in x and y directions show t 3 behavior at intermediate times when the rms displacement is o 100 m which is comparable to the lateral width of the vortex filaments although t 3 behavior is consistent with a kolmogorovian inertial range the role of horizontal shear on relative dispersion cannot be ruled out the multiparticle analysis reveals strong filamentogenesis as the tetrads deform into a thin needle like mean shape within a short time scale of o 1 h probability density functions of shape metrics indicate that there is a strong propensity to form needle shaped structures more so than in homogeneous stratified turbulence the filamentogenesis is associated with the strong strain field within the coherent vortex filaments in the evolving submesoscale front credit authorship contribution statement v verma conceptualization method software analysis writing visualization s sarkar
