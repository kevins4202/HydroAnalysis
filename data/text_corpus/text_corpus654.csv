3270,water scarcity greatly hinders sustainable development goal agenda and regional agriculture development in dryland regions as we know land use and cover changes are strongly responsible for spatial temporal evolutions of water resource however there is little explicit understanding of how spatial patterns of future dryland use will affect the water supply demand risk to answer this question this study took yulin city of china a typical dryland region as a case study area and firstly estimated its 2020 2050 land use patterns under three different scenarios covering natural increased scenario nis food security scenario fss and economic development scenario eds with the help of the path generating land use simulation plus model as well as markov chain model furthermore this study employed invest model to explicitly investigate spatial temporal evolutions of water supply water demand and water supply demand risk in all scenarios the estimated results indicated that the largest expanding shrinking land use types were grasslands croplands in nis croplands grasslands in fss and built up lands croplands in eds during 2020 2050 respectively by 2050 all projected land use changes only slightly affected regional water supply the fluctuation of 5 compared to that in 2020 but greatly increased by 57 regional water demand particularly strong land use changes would likely put nearly 90 regions of yulin city at endangered water supply demand risk in 2020 2050 ecological land and built up land would easier suffer from critically endangered water supply demand risk in view of these modeled and analyzed results some potential mitigation strategies of water resource utilization such as developing water efficient eco agriculture adjusting agricultural structures and enriching revegetation diversity were suggested to coordinate future areal human nature relationships this study could provide some valuable information for dryland agricultural development water

are sensitive to water scarcity liu et al 2010 and the dryland ecosystem is more vulnerable and less resilience especially in regions with obvious land use change yao et al 2021 segovia cardozo et al 2022 evaluating water supply and demand in semi arid and arid regions has profound significance for effective water exploration and irrigation management feng et al 2016 wang et al 2020 deihimfard et al 2022 however most studies focused on exploring the spatial temporal change of water supply in particular regions liang and liu 2014 pei et al 2021 yin et al 2021 segovia cardozo et al 2022 while ignored comprehensive analyses and forecast of spatial temporal change among water supply and water demand additionally studies rarely concerned water supply demand risk evolution and prediction

earth system coordination liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b peng et al 2020 liang et al 2021 the clue s model is widely utilized among these models because it can generate the inferred results with fine spatial resolution peng et al 2020 while it could hardly capture the spatial temporal evolution of various land use patches liang et al 2021 regardless of utilizing either model knowledge on the response of water supply demand risk evolution to future luccs under multiple scenarios in semi arid and arid regions was still limited being a great agricultural country with large populations china

yulin city is a typical dryland region in northern china with fragile ecological environment and contradiction between water supply and demand is increasingly obvious bao et al 2016 hui et al 2020 lei 2021 water scarcity not only restricts yulin economic development but also affects sustainable agricultural production and ecological environment protection and even threatens the livelihoods and well being of the entire city therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to predict spatial temporal patterns of land use in yulin city from 2020 to 2050 by utilizing patch generating land use simulation plus model under the natural increased scenario food security scenario and economic development scenario 2 to investigate water yield supply demand relationship and evaluate water supply

shannxi province during 2000 2019 2 3 simulation and analysis methods this study aimed to predict the future spatial distribution of land use and evaluate water supply demand risk under multiple scenarios which served for sustainable agriculture development in yulin city the framework of this study was illustrated in fig 2 2 3 1 the path generating land use simulation model and multi scenario design the path generating land use simulation plus model integrated by a land expansion analysis strategy module and a ca based on multi type random patch seed module that developed by liang et al 2021 was utilized to simulate spatial patterns compared with common clue s model plus model effectively improves the strategies of transformation rule mining and landscape patterns simulation the model could capture the spatio temporally evolution of multiple land use patches and reveal the underlying drivers of land use change this model was used to project the spatial distribution of land use from 2005 to 2015 and simulate the spatial distribution of land use from 2020 to 2050 under multi scenarios 1 land expansion analysis strategy module the land expansion analysis strategy module was used to generate the expansion probability of each land use type and transition rules of all land use types land use data of two periods were overlaid to extract the pixels with land use change in the later period and the changed regions of each land use type were generated training samples were then randomly selected from the change regions random forest classification rfc algorithm a decision tree based ensemble classifier was utilized to separately explore the relationship between the growth regions of each land use type and various driving factors rfc algorithm finally outputted the expansion probability of each land use type to balance the model accuracy and efficiency sampling rate and ntree were set as 0 2 and 60 peng et al 2020 mtry was set as 4 which depended on the number of driving factors li et al 2014 land expansion analysis strategy integrated the advantages of traditional transition analysis strategy and pattern analysis strategy which decreased module complexity and increased flexibility moreover land expansion analysis strategy was capable to analyze the mechanism of land use change during a certain period which increased the explanatory of expansion probability among various land use types liang et al 2021 2 ca based on multi type random patch seed module and scenario design the ca based on multi type random patch seed module was a ca model with multi type random seeds of which ca model was a scenario driven land use simulation model that integrated global land use demands and local land use competition effects liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b liang et al 2021 combined with random seed generation and threshold decreasing mechanism the ca based on multi type random patch seed module could dynamically simulate the automatic generation of spatiotemporal patches under the constraint of expansion probability in the simulation process conversion elasticity neighborhood weights conversion matrix and land use demand were inputted into the ca based on multi type random patch seed model the conversion elasticity included patch generation and expansion coefficient the patch generation measured the transformation difficulty of land use change with value of 0 easy to convert to 1 hard to convert the expansion coefficient measured the new patch generation with value of 0 easy to generate to 1 hard to generate the patch generation and expansion coefficient was set as 0 8 and 0 1 during 2005 2020 in the simulation process hereafter patch generation decreased by 0 1 and expansion coefficient increased by 0 1 in each decade since 2020 so as to reach the future land use demand conversion matrix represented whether a certain land use type can convert to other types with 0 indicating forbidden conversion and 1 indicating possible conversion based on analyzing the land use conversion during 2000 2015 in yulin city all land use conversions were possible and thus the values of six land use types in conversion matrix were defined as 1 to explore different possible modes of future regional development three scenarios were designed for predicting future land use patterns including natural increased scenario nis food security scenario fss and economic development scenario eds the description of the three scenarios were as follows scenario 1 the nis was regarded as a baseline scenario to represent the historical trend of land use changes in yulin city the future demand of land use under nis scenario were derived from markov chain based on land use maps from 2000 to 2015 lópez et al 2001 guan et al 2011 scenario 2 the fss was aimed to simulate the possible influences of cropland protection and cropland reclamation activities in the simulation process transition probability matrix of markov chain was adjusted i e the aggregate probability of croplands converting to other land use was decreased by 5 and the probability of forests grasslands built up lands water body and barren converting to croplands were increased by 10 respectively scenario 3 the eds gave priority to rapid economic growth and met the demand of larger urban space in the simulation process transition probability matrix was adjusted as follows the aggregate probability of built up lands converting to other types was reduced by 10 and the probability of other land use type converting to built up lands were separately raised by 10 neighborhood weights represented the impact of each land use type on neighborhood with value of 0 none influence to 1 great influence in the nis scenario neighborhood weight of each land use type was separately calculated by the proportion of changing area to the origin type area liang et al 2021 based on the nis scenario the neighborhood weight of croplands was increased by 50 in the fss scenario and that of other land use was decreased by different proportions which were separately calculated according to the proportion of croplands transferred to other land use type during 2000 2015 in the eds scenario the neighborhood weight of built up lands remained 1 and the weights of other types decreased by different proportions which were measured by the 1 5 times proportion of built up lands converted to other land use type during 2000 2015 the neighborhood weights of different scenarios were listed in table 3 3 estimated result validation the spatial distribution of land use in 2005 2010 and 2015 were predicted based on land use map for 2000 in plus model compared with the observed land use maps in corresponding years predicted results were validated by calculating overall accuracy oa kappa indices kappa and figure of merit fom pontius 2000 pontius et al 2008 liang et al 2021 2 3 2 calculating water supply and water demand water yield services as a vital ecosystem services plays an important role in the eco hydrological cycle and estimates the amount of available water that ecosystem could supply for human usage li et al 2017 deng et al 2021 the provision of water yield services is directly depended on precipitation and actual evapotranspiration sharp et al 2016 in this study the evaluation of water supply in yulin city was calculated by the invest water yield model the model was based on the budyko hydrothermal coupling equilibrium hypothesis which assumed that all water except evapotranspiration reached the watershed outlet sharp et al 2016 the formula for the calculation of annual water yield was as follows 1 y x 1 aet x p x p x where y x was the annual water yield mm of pixel x aet x was the actual evapotranspiration mm of pixel x and p x was the annual precipitation mm of pixel x the calculation of vegetation evapotranspiration on different land use i e aet x p x was proposed by zhang et al 2004 2 aet x p x 1 pet x p x 1 pet x p x w 1 w where pet x was the potential evapotranspiration mm of pixel x and w was an empirical parameter of natural climate and soil properties referred to liang and liu 2014 research w was set as 2 45 in this study z was a seasonal constant in water yield model which represented regional precipitation distribution and other hydrogeological characteristics the determination of z was referred to donohue et al 2012 3 z p x w 1 25 awc x 4 awc x min maxsoildepth x rootdepth x pawc x where awc x was the available water content of pixel x pawc x was the vegetation available water content of pixel x maxsoildepth x was the maximum soil depth of pixel x and rootdepth x was the root depth of pixel x the pawc x was calculated using the following formula 5 p a w c x 54 509 0 132 s a n d x 0 003 sand x 2 0 055 silt x 0 006 silt x 2 0 738 clay x 0 007 clay x 2 2 699 om x 0 501 om x 2 where s a n d x silt x clay x and om x were the soil sand content soil silt content soil clay content and soil organic matter content of pixel x respectively compared with forests croplands and grasslands generally have lower evapotranspiration and shorter roots therefore the water supply capacity of croplands and grasslands are better than that of forests the water demand of yulin city comprehensively considered the water consumption of resident demand economic development and agriculture irrigation the calculation formula was as follows li et al 2017 6 pop i j p i j j 1 n p i j pop i 7 gdp i j g i j j 1 n g i j gdp i 8 wd i j pop i j l i gdp i j m i agr i j n i where p i j and g i j were the origin population and gdp of pixel j in year i respectively pop i and gdp i were the annual population and gdp data derived from statistical yearbook in year i pop i j and gdp i j was the calibration population and gdp of pixel j in year i agr i j was the farmland area of pixel j in year i in addition l i m i and n i were per capita household water consumption water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp and per mu farmland irrigation consumption in year i respectively population and gdp in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 were calculated by linear regression method based on population and gdp data from 2000 to 2019 furthermore cropland distribution in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 were generated by plus model in multiple scenarios spatial distribution of population and gdp in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 was separately calibrated by population and gdp data in corresponding year water demand calculation of this study mainly considered the demand of resident living and production in yulin city therefore rivers where close to industries and residential areas might have large water demand because of high water consumption in these places meanwhile considering rare demands of living and production in the unused land water demand of barren land probably small 2 3 3 calculating water supply demand risk maron et al 2017 proposed a threat assessment framework of ecosystem services researchers further quantified related conceptual indexes and generated regional supply demand risk framework of ecosystem services li et al 2017 chen et al 2019 deng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the water supply demand risk was measured by water supply demand ratio trend of water supply demand ratio water supply trend and water demand trend the water supply demand ratio expressed the spatial heterogeneity of water supply demand contradiction the formula was as follows li et al 2017 9 r x wy x wd x where r x was the water supply demand ratio of pixel x wy x and wd x were the water ecosystem service provision and consumption of pixel x respectively r x equaled to 0 which indicated the regions no longer provided water yield service if r x ranged from 0 to 1 it meant regional water supply could not meet regional water demand while r x was above 1 which indicated regional water supply was adequate moreover the trend of water supply demand ratio could represent the relative change of water supply and demand which was calculated as follows 10 r tr r m r n where r tr was the difference of water supply demand ratio in year m and n r m and r n were the water supply demand ratio in year m and n respectively if r tr was lower than 0 which indicated r j k declined on the contrary it indicated r j k remained unchanged or increased additionally water supply trend and water demand trend represented the absolute change of water supply and demand wang et al 2020 which generated by the following formulas 11 s tr wy m wy n 12 d tr wd m wd n where s tr and d tr were the differences of water supply service and water demand service respectively wy m and wy n were the water supply service in year m and n wd m and wd n were the water demand service in year m and n if s tr or d tr was lower than 0 which indicated a downward trend on the contrary it indicated remained unchanged or a upward trend comprehensively considering water supply demand ratio trend of water supply demand ratio water supply trend and water demand trend the water supply demand risk was divided into 7 grades as shown in table 4 moran et al 2017 wang et al 2020 3 results 3 1 simulation results and accuracy validation the simulation results were highly consistent with the observed maps fig 3 on the basis of the initial land use map in 2000 the spatial distribution of land use in 2005 2010 and 2015 were generated by the plus model fig 3 shows the simulated maps and observation maps in 2010 and 2015 the built up lands and water body in the simulation results were in good agreement with the observed built up lands and water body the simulated croplands forests grasslands and barren exhibited similar distribution with the observation but the compactness of distribution pattern in different land use types were more affected by neighborhood weights in plus model furthermore the plus model generated results with satisfactory accuracies and could be used to simulate future land use pattern of multiple scenarios in yulin city referred to table 5 the validation indices oa kappa and fom were calculated to quantitatively evaluate the performance of plus model table 5 both oa and kappa gradually declined from 2000 to 2015 however the values of oa and kappa in 2015 were still high with 0 899 and 0 852 respectively moreover fom was calculated to measure the pixel to pixel coincidence between simulation maps and observation maps although the fom value of 11 9 in 2015 was not highly accurate we believed it was acceptable for yulin city during 2000 2015 for the following reasons 1 pontius et al 2008 suggested that fom values were positively correlated with observed net changes in this study the observed net change was 9 81 during 2000 2015 which was a relatively short period compared to researches with relatively high fom values estoque and murayama 2012 chen et al 2016 2 the fom value of 11 9 had a similar range compared with other simulation results liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b peng et al 2020 3 2 model simulation and analysis under multi scenarios fig 4 illustrates that of land use in yulin city under different scenarios during 2020 2050 performed similar spatial patterns the croplands were located in western and southeastern yulin city mainly covering dingbian jingbian suide mizhi jia and wubu county the forests and grasslands were distributed in southern and northeastern yulin city mainly covering dingbian shenmu yuyang jingbian and fugu county the built up lands were concentrated in central yulin city including yuyang shenmu hengshan and dingbian county in order to explore spatial temporal characteristics of different land use types under three scenarios their areas of different scenarios during 2020 2050 were calculated fig 5 compared with the farmland area of 14969 km2 in 2015 croplands under nis slightly decreased from 14236 km2 to 12769 km2 for the period of 2020 2050 and represented an obviously decreased trend under eds with a decrease of 2192 km2 in contrast croplands under fss expanded greatly from 16280 km2 to 17768 km2 with an increase of 1488 km2 referred to fig 6 a c cultivated lands under fss demonstrated substantial expansion especially in dingbian county central jingbian county and northwestern yuyang county by contrast cultivated land of nis mainly loss in dingbian county central jingbian county and southeastern yulin city and represented scattered expansion in eastern yulin city similarily cultivated land under fss shrank significantly in dingbian county central jingbian county and southern yuyang county but expanded more obviously in eastern yulin city the forests and grasslands under fss roughly remained stable from 2020 to 2050 separately compared with forest area of 4028 km2 grassland area of 17978 km2 in 2015 the forests and grasslands exhibited a slightly increased trend under nis fig 5b c similarly the forests and grasslands represented a greater increase trend under eds with increases of 764 km2 and 1346 km2 respectively fig 6d showed that grasslands expanded in most regions of yulin city under nis during 2020 2050 especially in the medium high altitude area of dingbian and jingbian county likewise grasslands expansion of eds in 2020 2050 exhibited similar pattern with that of nis while grasslands sporadically decreased in the eastern yulin city on the contrary grasslands change under fss was opposite to that of eds which grasslands largely decreased in the western yulin city and fragmentally expanded in the eastern yulin city in comparison to built up lands of 963 km2 in 2015 built up lands expanded with various degrees under different scenarios from 2020 to 2050 the expansion rates of built up lands under nis fss and eds were 10 9 km2 a 10 83 km2 a and 43 79 km2 a respectively fig 5d the built up land expansion under nis and fss were concentrated around the county built up areas in yuyang shenmu and hengshan county furthermore the built up land expansion under eds was substantially distributed around the county built up areas in dingbian jingbian yuyang henghshan and shenmu county fig 6 3 3 change of water yield supply and demand in yulin city according to the shannxi water resources bulletin during 2006 2019 the average amount of surface water resources in yulin city was 18 64 108 m3 http slt shaanxi gov cn as mentioned in water supply calculation section 2 3 2 z was an important seasonal constant to input water yield model in the current study when z value was set to 11 the simulated water yield of yulin city in 2015 derived from invest model was 19 26 108 m3 which was closest to the surface water resources as shown in table 6 and fig 7 water supply could hardly satisfy water demand in yulin city during the period of 2020 2050 land use change had little effect on water yield supply the supply amount simply changed from 18 74 108 18 89 108 m3 in 2020 to 17 88 108 20 53 108 m3 in 2050 the fluctuation of 5 compared to that in 2020 whereas land use change had greatly impact on water yield demand in yulin city the demand amount increased from 1835 42 108 1842 53 108 m3 in 2020 to 2883 93 108 2898 53 108 m3 in 2050 about 57 increase table 6 considering land use patterns under different scenarios a low level water yield supply was primarily distributed in northern dingbian county western yuyang county and fragmentally sourthern yulin city due to the spatial distribution of forests and barren fig 7 moreover a high level water yield demand was mainly located in southeastern yulin because of the abundant farmlands here fig 7 the water demand proportion of croplands was the highest in three scenarios even occupied more than 50 under fss scenario during 2020 2050 fig 8 while water yield supply represented declined under nis and eds during 2020 2050 fig s1 3 on the other hand skyrocketing water demand appeared in ever expanding built up lands of yulin city under all scenarios from 2020 to 2050 fig s1 3 and fig 7 the average water demand of built up lands was the largest especially in nis scenario ranging from 25 34 m3 m2 to 28 76 m3 m2 during 2020 2050 fig 8 and table s1 in terms of counties in yulin city the water supply amount of wubu county was least while the fastest decrease rate of water supply appeared in hengshan county with 0 04 107 m3 yr under eds fig 9 moreover the water supply of dingbian jingbian and yuyang county represented obvious increase trend from 2020 to 2050 on the other hand water demand of each county under all scenarios showed increasing tendency and the counties with significant increase during 2020 2050 were yuyang shenmu and hengshan county meanwhile the water demand amount of hengshan yuyang and suide county were large fig 9 3 4 change of water supply demand risk in yulin city as illustrated in fig 10 water supply demand risk converted from undersupplied to endangered in more than 90 regions of yulin city for the period of 2005 2030 furthermore areas with endangered water supply demand risk shrank lower than 90 of yulin city by 2050 built up lands under all scenarios probably faced dangerous water supply demand risk for the period of 2020 2030 and 2020 2050 under nis and eds more than 2 regions sporadically located in southeastern yulin city might under critically endangered water supply demand risk from 2020 to 2030 and these regions might expand to more than 4 areas of yulin city by 2050 under fss cultivated land which mainly located in central dingbian county and central jingbian county might under dangerous water supply demand risk by 2030 and these regions probably expanded to most dingbian county most jingbian county fragmental hengshan and yuyang county by 2050 additionally over 2 regions concentrated in eastern yulin might face critically endangered water supply demand risk under fss by 2050 compared the two periods i e 2020 2030 and 2020 2050 the regions of endangered risk iii level under different scenarios decreased from over 90 to 90 especially regions under fss shrank by 4 32 under nis the regions under critically endangered risk ii level increased from 2 22 by 2030 to 4 79 by 2050 expanded regions with critically endangered risk mainly located in grasslands 64 27 and forests 30 06 in nis and grasslands 41 94 forests 39 02 and built up lands 17 55 in eds similarly the expansion of regions with critically endangered risk under eds were similar with that of regions under nis for the two periods under fss the regions under critically endangered risk ii level and dangerous level iv level were increased by 1 6 and 3 44 regions of yulin city for the two periods respectively 3 5 mitigation strategies for water resource allocation in yulin city according to water supply demand risk and land use pattern evolution under different scenarios during 2020 2050 in yulin city various mitigation strategies were proposed to reasonable water allocation in the aspects of agriculture ecology urbanization and industrialization in the aspect of agricultural development excessive pursuit of grain production and adopting extensive agricultural management model resulted in vulnerable agricultural system and unbalancing agricultural ecosystem especially in dingbian jingbian suide mizhi and wubu county developing water efficient eco agriculture and land consolidation engineering technology improving cultivated land quality and comprehensively considering the production and ecological function of croplands were benefit to enhance agricultural system resilience and stability fig 11 a recent sandy land consolidation adopting structural consolidation concept to improve sandy land structure and cultivated land productivity was experimented in yulin city and obviously realized water and fertilizer preservation liu et al 2018 liu and wang 2019 the initial results showed that utilizing drip fertigation technique irrigation consumption could save of 70 02 51 02 and 30 87 for potato corn and soybean planting in the improved croplands respectively wang and liu 2020 moreover in the aspect of ecological environment protection revegetation greatly improved ecological environment while at the same time potential water demand conflicts appeared between ecosystem and human in the water limited yulin city foley et al 2011 reasonable matching forests and grasslands ratios and enriching landscape diversity in artificial forests and grasslands were conducive to sustainably improving ecological environment especially in northwestern shenmu yuyang fugu county particularly balancing water allocation between agricultural production and ecological protection played a crucial role in the southern qinjian suide county with interlaced forests and cultivated lands under future scenarios fig 11 in addition in the aspect of urbanization and industrialization intense industrial and domestic water consumption severe water pollution further accelerated water supply demand risk in yulin city especially in yuyang shenmu and hengshan county improving industrial water saving and reclaimed water cycling technology would be helpful in achieving efficient and optimized utilization of water resource in the industrial enterprises meanwhile establishing water conservation awareness and strengthening water pollution control would contribute to alleviate water supply demand risk and achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals in the future 4 discussion 4 1 analyses future land use changes under different scenarios in this study plus model was utilized to simulate the land use patterns of yulin city during 2020 2050 under three different scenarios the results represented that built up lands obviously expanded in the next 30 years under three scenarios figs 4 and 5 for croplands forests and grasslands they exhibited different change characteristics among different scenarios in the nis scenario forests increased from 4322 km2 in 2020 to 4860 km2 in 2050 with an increase of 12 45 and grasslands increased from 18766 km2 in 2020 to 19798 km2 in 2050 with an increase of 5 5 as shown in fig 4 and fig 6 forests and grasslands with substantial expansion were mainly concentrated in the high elevation regions of southern dingbian and jingbian county and the low elevation regions near rivers in suide zizhou and qingjian county which would ensure ecological environment safety in the ecologically fragile regions of yulin city qi et al 2012 cao et al 2018 however croplands shrank from 14236 km2 in 2020 to 12769 km2 in 2050 with a decrease of 1467 km2 and most of the loss cultivated lands were replaced by forests and grasslands which might pose restriction on efficient output of agricultural production in yulin city in the fss scenario although cultivated lands exhibited significant expansion the newly reclaimed croplands were mainly located in the regions with relatively poor natural resource such as the southern dingbian and jingbian county with medium high elevation and the northwestern yulin city with infertile soil and strong evapotranspiration consequently local government probably adopted land consolidation and land engineering to improve tillage conditions liu and wang 2019 but the agricultural production cost would be raised meanwhile substantial cropland expansion would invade massive forests and grasslands in the western yulin city fig 6 which probably had negative impact on ecological environment protection and regional soil and water conservation yin et al 2018 wang and shi 2020 in the eds scenario sprawling built up lands leaded extensive destruction of croplands forests and grasslands which threatened regional agricultural production and ecological environment protection further accelerated human land contradiction given the comprehensive comparison with the simulation results under three scenarios eds was not desirable the unlimited expansion of built up lands might have underlying problems to the local food security and ecological protection however the simple fss or nis also would not work due to difficultly reconcile agricultural production and ecological environment security therefore in the future management taking a reasonable tradeoff among agriculture production ecological construction and economic development might make breakthroughs in human land coupling development of yulin city 4 2 analyses supply demand risk of water supply service in the context of global warming and accelerated industrialization land use patterns changed dramatically and the contradiction between water supply and demand was prominent in yulin development constrained by limited water capability local government had difficulties balancing water resources allocation among production domestic and ecology water consumption hui et al 2020 yao et al 2021 as different land use patterns generated corresponding ecological processes which would affect water supply services fu et al 2013 spatial patterns of land use under multiple scenarios were simulated to explore the impact of land use changes on water supply demand risk as illustrated in fig s4 water supply demand risk in most regions of yulin converted from undersupplied by 2010 to endangered in the next 30 years in the same circumstance the water supply demand risk of mu us sand land in the northwestern yulin also changed from safe to vulnerable the need for agricultural water could not be satisfied in most regions of yulin city under multiple scenarios in the future fig 7 excessive groundwater exploitation for agricultural irrigation in the current situation already caused groundwater decline in dingbian and jingbian county and even appeared groundwater depression cones in some regions which seriously damaged local ecological environment lei 2021 in the future warming climate gave potential advantage for the northward expansion of the suitable cultivated lands in yulin liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b liu et al 2021c especially coupled with fss scenario croplands might expand significantly in the next 30 years fig 4 however most of the new expanded croplands occurred in water limited regions kong 2014 liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b liu et al 2021c water supply capacity varied greatly among cultivated lands distributed in space fig 8 and table s1 which probably further accelerated water supply demand risk and created underlying conflicts for water demand between agricultural production and ecosystem security feng et al 2016 moreover warming climate might further exacerbate drought frequencies and intensities hao et al 2017 yao et al 2021 and heighten water supply demand risk and threaten agricultural development in yulin city furthermore the enormous water demand of yulin city majorly occurred in the regions with intensive industrialization and urbanization fig 7 as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 built up lands increased continuously for the period of 2020 2050 especially in the eds scenario the unlimitedly sprawling expansion of built up lands encroached on high quality cultivated lands and forests in the surrounding countryside exacerbating water supply demand risk in yulin city bren d amour et al 2017 deng et al 2021 in addition yulin was particularly rich in energy and mineral resources but resources exploitation also consumed huge industrial water especially in the northwestern yulin city coal mining destroyed the underground water resistant layers causing imbalanced underground system and severe groundwater depression cones in local regions lei 2021 which increased water supply demand risk and destabilized ecological system 4 3 implications and suggestions of dryland agriculture development considering the ever increasing water supply demand risk in the future fig s4 water resource was the decisive agricultural factor that restricted agriculture development in yulin city liu et al 2020 moreover frequency drought and severe soil erosion aggravated soil nutrient loss of cultivated lands reducing cropland quality and agricultural production capability prodhan et al 2021 therefore the improvement of agricultural infrastructure and the applications of modern agricultural technologies were urged to sustainable agricultural development in yulin city as mentioned above the recent sandy land consolidation engineering experimented in northern yulin city significantly improved local cultivated land quality enhanced agricultural comprehensive productivity and optimized ecological environment liu et al 2018 liu and wang 2019 additionally the promotion of water efficient agriculture would greatly alleviate water supply demand risk in agricultural production the application of drip irrigation technology in xinjiang autonomous region had achieved positive effects li et al 2016 furthermore as agricultural production in china was mainly dependent on smallholder farming the cultivation habits risk preferences and interest inclines of local smallholder farmers would have significantly impact on choosing adaptive strategies to develop sustainable agriculture and safeguard ecosystem security in yulin city cui et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 therefore local farmers were greatly encouraged to master advanced agricultural techniques optimize soil structure and enhance the awareness of water saving ecological protection and disaster prevention chen et al 2021 meanwhile excessive groundwater exploitation and over fertilizing management were undesirable in agricultural practices wu et al 2014 considering that yulin was not only an energy intensive city but also an ecological fragile city it was crucial to reasonable balance the relationships among household water consumption farmland irrigation consumption and industrial water consumption for mitigating water resources shortage developing regional agriculture and improving ecological environment firstly the water saving awareness was urgently needed to enhance for all citizens in yulin city wang et al 2020 secondly if local government actively perfected water resources management system and unified supervised water resource exploitation on the basis of water resource protection and water pollution prevention the water resource allocation between surface water and underground water probably would be more reasonable lei 2021 thirdly smallholder farmers of yulin city were fully encouraged to develop water saving agriculture and adjust agriculture planting structure adjustment and improving farmland ecological compensation would improve farmers enthusiasm hao et al 2017 hui et al 2020 wen et al 2021 fourthly the water allocation of agricultural production and ecological protection was needed to balance and quantify in the process of ecological restoration feng et al 2016 pei et al 2021 yin et al 2021 finally a robust eco agricultural system which alleviated water restriction in agricultural development and reduced burden of agricultural irrigation on ecological balance was urged to establish for safeguarding efficient agricultural production in yunlin city and shannxi province 4 4 limitations and future research in this study future land use patterns under different scenarios were generated by plus model and water supply demand under multiple scenarios were evaluated however there were also some uncertainties and limitations in the process of simulating future land use patterns our study considered only the current socioeconomic and climatic factors while ignored future climate and socioeconomic drivers on land use change moreover our study approximately valued future water demand of industrial consumption and residential living while the impacts of differences and variations of industry coefficients on future water demand were not taken into account in addition the simulation process did not quantify government policies such as ecological protection agricultural structure adjustment regional economic development therefore in future studies considering the influence of future climate change and human activities on land use pattern evolution and quantifying some policies might make the simulation results more realistic moreover we did not consider ecosystem services flow in the calculation process of water supply and water demand which might have impact on evaluation results of water supply demand risk meanwhile restricted by data availability the suggestions about dryland agriculture development were not quantified and inputted into invest model to evaluate the potential impacts of these mitigation strategies thus coupling regional water resource coordination and ecosystem services flow quantifying and comparing the effects of different mitigation strategies will be helpful for providing improved references for regional decision making and sustainable agricultural development in the future 5 conclusions under three potential development scenarios of natural increased scenario nis food security scenario fss and economic development scenario eds in typical dryland regions this study estimated the spatial temporal patterns of land use in yulin city during 2020 2050 and then investigated water supply and demand under three scenarios and further evaluated the water supply demand risk in each scenario results indicated that future strong land use change had little effect on water yield supply while had greatly influence on water yield demand with about 57 increase and probably put nearly 90 regions of yulin city at endangered water supply demand risk in 2020 2050 by 2050 more than 4 areas of yulin city might bear critically endangered water supply demand risk expanded regions with critically endangered risk mainly located in grasslands and forests in nis but grasslands forests and built up lands in eds suggesting that dryland ecological land use and human development could more suffer from water resource demand risk developing water efficient eco agriculture adjusting agricultural structure enriching revegetation diversity improving industrial water saving technology controlling water pollution and various mitigation strategies were proposed to improve agricultural system stability alleviate water supply demand risk safeguard ecological environment and coordinate human earth relationships in yulin city besides coupling future climate data and regional water resource coordination will be helpful for improving our understandings of water supply demand risk evolution and proposing more comprehensively suggestions for

3270,water scarcity greatly hinders sustainable development goal agenda and regional agriculture development in dryland regions as we know land use and cover changes are strongly responsible for spatial temporal evolutions of water resource however there is little explicit understanding of how spatial patterns of future dryland use will affect the water supply demand risk to answer this question this study took yulin city of china a typical dryland region as a case study area and firstly estimated its 2020 2050 land use patterns under three different scenarios covering natural increased scenario nis food security scenario fss and economic development scenario eds with the help of the path generating land use simulation plus model as well as markov chain model furthermore this study employed invest model to explicitly investigate spatial temporal evolutions of water supply water demand and water supply demand risk in all scenarios the estimated results indicated that the largest expanding shrinking land use types were grasslands croplands in nis croplands grasslands in fss and built up lands croplands in eds during 2020 2050 respectively by 2050 all projected land use changes only slightly affected regional water supply the fluctuation of 5 compared to that in 2020 but greatly increased by 57 regional water demand particularly strong land use changes would likely put nearly 90 regions of yulin city at endangered water supply demand risk in 2020 2050 ecological land and built up land would easier suffer from critically endangered water supply demand risk in view of these modeled and analyzed results some potential mitigation strategies of water resource utilization such as developing water efficient eco agriculture adjusting agricultural structures and enriching revegetation diversity were suggested to coordinate future areal human nature relationships this study could provide some valuable information for dryland agricultural development water

and human life especially for semi arid and arid regions where water contradiction between human and water is prominent feng et al 2016 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2021 yao et al 2021 meanwhile climatic

al 2021c whereas the new expanded croplands generally appear in water limited and temperature limited regions liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b liu et al 2021c most crops in semi arid and arid regions are sensitive to water scarcity liu et al 2010 and the dryland ecosystem is more vulnerable and less resilience especially in regions with obvious land use change yao et al 2021 segovia cardozo et al 2022 evaluating water supply and demand in semi arid and arid regions has profound significance for effective water exploration and irrigation management feng et al 2016 wang et al 2020 deihimfard et al 2022 however most studies focused on exploring the spatial temporal change of water supply in particular regions liang and liu 2014 pei et al 2021 yin et al 2021 segovia cardozo et al 2022 while ignored comprehensive analyses and forecast of spatial temporal change among water supply and water demand additionally studies rarely concerned water supply demand risk evolution and prediction furthermore land use and land cover change lucc one of the primary driving factors has great influence on spatial temporal revolution of water supply and demand feng et al 2016 liu and li 2017c dou et al 2019 on the one hand lucc will change the hydrological cycle in the basins affect the processes of evapotranspiration infiltration and water retention and further result in water yield supply alternation sharp et al 2016 yao et al 2021 on the other hand lucc will has obvious impact on spatial allocation of water demand among production ecology and living li et al 2017 the process of human involved luccs including ecosystem service evaluation agricultural reclamation and intensification deforestation and urban expansion had attracted plenty of scholars attention foley et al 2005 bren d amour et al 2017 chen et al 2020 peng et al 2021 meanwhile various future lucc simulation models such as the ca model the clue s model and the plus model were developed and applied to predict future landscape dynamics related to socio economic and natural environmental driving factors under different designed scenarios thus providing some suggestions for regional substantial development and human earth system coordination liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b peng et al 2020 liang et al 2021 the clue s model is widely utilized among these models because it can generate the inferred results with fine spatial resolution peng et al 2020 while it could hardly capture the spatial temporal evolution of various land use patches liang et al 2021 regardless of utilizing either model knowledge on the response of water supply demand risk evolution to future luccs under multiple scenarios in semi arid and arid regions was still limited being a great agricultural country with large populations china feeds 20 of the world s population based on only 9 of the world s cultivated land liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b liu et al 2021c the northward shift of grain gravity center and the northern expansion of cultivated lands further complicated water food energy relationships in the context of climate warming and land use change faostat 2012 fu et al 2021 liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b liu et al 2021c yulin city is a typical dryland region in northern china with fragile ecological environment and contradiction between water supply and demand is increasingly obvious bao et al 2016 hui et al 2020 lei 2021 water scarcity not only restricts yulin economic development but also affects sustainable agricultural production and ecological environment protection and even threatens the livelihoods and well being of the entire city therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to predict spatial temporal patterns of land use in yulin city from 2020 to 2050 by utilizing patch generating land use simulation plus model under the natural increased scenario food security scenario and economic development scenario 2 to investigate water yield supply demand relationship and evaluate water supply demand risk in yulin city under three scenarios during 2020 2050 3 to explore possible impacts of future luccs on water supply demand risk and provide some potential suggestions and mitigations for

shannxi province during 2000 2019 2 3 simulation and analysis methods this study aimed to predict the future spatial distribution of land use and evaluate water supply demand risk under multiple scenarios which served for sustainable agriculture development in yulin city the framework of this study was illustrated in fig 2 2 3 1 the path generating land use simulation model and multi scenario design the path generating land use simulation plus model integrated by a land expansion analysis strategy module and a ca based on multi type random patch seed module that developed by liang et al 2021 was utilized to simulate spatial patterns compared with common clue s model plus model effectively improves the strategies of transformation rule mining and landscape patterns simulation the model could capture the spatio temporally evolution of multiple land use patches and reveal the underlying drivers of land use change this model was used to project the spatial distribution of land use from 2005 to 2015 and simulate the spatial distribution of land use from 2020 to 2050 under multi scenarios 1 land expansion analysis strategy module the land expansion analysis strategy module was used to generate the expansion probability of each land use type and transition rules of all land use types land use data of two periods were overlaid to extract the pixels with land use change in the later period and the changed regions of each land use type were generated training samples were then randomly selected from the change regions random forest classification rfc algorithm a decision tree based ensemble classifier was utilized to separately explore the relationship between the growth regions of each land use type and various driving factors rfc algorithm finally outputted the expansion probability of each land use type to balance the model accuracy and efficiency sampling rate and ntree were set as 0 2 and 60 peng et al 2020 mtry was set as 4 which depended on the number of driving factors li et al 2014 land expansion analysis strategy integrated the advantages of traditional transition analysis strategy and pattern analysis strategy which decreased module complexity and increased flexibility moreover land expansion analysis strategy was capable to analyze the mechanism of land use change during a certain period which increased the explanatory of expansion probability among various land use types liang et al 2021 2 ca based on multi type random patch seed module and scenario design the ca based on multi type random patch seed module was a ca model with multi type random seeds of which ca model was a scenario driven land use simulation model that integrated global land use demands and local land use competition effects liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b liang et al 2021 combined with random seed generation and threshold decreasing mechanism the ca based on multi type random patch seed module could dynamically simulate the automatic generation of spatiotemporal patches under the constraint of expansion probability in the simulation process conversion elasticity neighborhood weights conversion matrix and land use demand were inputted into the ca based on multi type random patch seed model the conversion elasticity included patch generation and expansion coefficient the patch generation measured the transformation difficulty of land use change with value of 0 easy to convert to 1 hard to convert the expansion coefficient measured the new patch generation with value of 0 easy to generate to 1 hard to generate the patch generation and expansion coefficient was set as 0 8 and 0 1 during 2005 2020 in the simulation process hereafter patch generation decreased by 0 1 and expansion coefficient increased by 0 1 in each decade since 2020 so as to reach the future land use demand conversion matrix represented whether a certain land use type can convert to other types with 0 indicating forbidden conversion and 1 indicating possible conversion based on analyzing the land use conversion during 2000 2015 in yulin city all land use conversions were possible and thus the values of six land use types in conversion matrix were defined as 1 to explore different possible modes of future regional development three scenarios were designed for predicting future land use patterns including natural increased scenario nis food security scenario fss and economic development scenario eds the description of the three scenarios were as follows scenario 1 the nis was regarded as a baseline scenario to represent the historical trend of land use changes in yulin city the future demand of land use under nis scenario were derived from markov chain based on land use maps from 2000 to 2015 lópez et al 2001 guan et al 2011 scenario 2 the fss was aimed to simulate the possible influences of cropland protection and cropland reclamation activities in the simulation process transition probability matrix of markov chain was adjusted i e the aggregate probability of croplands converting to other land use was decreased by 5 and the probability of forests grasslands built up lands water body and barren converting to croplands were increased by 10 respectively scenario 3 the eds gave priority to rapid economic growth and met the demand of larger urban space in the simulation process transition probability matrix was adjusted as follows the aggregate probability of built up lands converting to other types was reduced by 10 and the probability of other land use type converting to built up lands were separately raised by 10 neighborhood weights represented the impact of each land use type on neighborhood with value of 0 none influence to 1 great influence in the nis scenario neighborhood weight of each land use type was separately calculated by the proportion of changing area to the origin type area liang et al 2021 based on the nis scenario the neighborhood weight of croplands was increased by 50 in the fss scenario and that of other land use was decreased by different proportions which were separately calculated according to the proportion of croplands transferred to other land use type during 2000 2015 in the eds scenario the neighborhood weight of built up lands remained 1 and the weights of other types decreased by different proportions which were measured by the 1 5 times proportion of built up lands converted to other land use type during 2000 2015 the neighborhood weights of different scenarios were listed in table 3 3 estimated result validation the spatial distribution of land use in 2005 2010 and 2015 were predicted based on land use map for 2000 in plus model compared with the observed land use maps in corresponding years predicted results were validated by calculating overall accuracy oa kappa indices kappa and figure of merit fom pontius 2000 pontius et al 2008 liang et al 2021 2 3 2 calculating water supply and water demand water yield services as a vital ecosystem services plays an important role in the eco hydrological cycle and estimates the amount of available water that ecosystem could supply for human usage li et al 2017 deng et al 2021 the provision of water yield services is directly depended on precipitation and actual evapotranspiration sharp et al 2016 in this study the evaluation of water supply in yulin city was calculated by the invest water yield model the model was based on the budyko hydrothermal coupling equilibrium hypothesis which assumed that all water except evapotranspiration reached the watershed outlet sharp et al 2016 the formula for the calculation of annual water yield was as follows 1 y x 1 aet x p x p x where y x was the annual water yield mm of pixel x aet x was the actual evapotranspiration mm of pixel x and p x was the annual precipitation mm of pixel x the calculation of vegetation evapotranspiration on different land use i e aet x p x was proposed by zhang et al 2004 2 aet x p x 1 pet x p x 1 pet x p x w 1 w where pet x was the potential evapotranspiration mm of pixel x and w was an empirical parameter of natural climate and soil properties referred to liang and liu 2014 research w was set as 2 45 in this study z was a seasonal constant in water yield model which represented regional precipitation distribution and other hydrogeological characteristics the determination of z was referred to donohue et al 2012 3 z p x w 1 25 awc x 4 awc x min maxsoildepth x rootdepth x pawc x where awc x was the available water content of pixel x pawc x was the vegetation available water content of pixel x maxsoildepth x was the maximum soil depth of pixel x and rootdepth x was the root depth of pixel x the pawc x was calculated using the following formula 5 p a w c x 54 509 0 132 s a n d x 0 003 sand x 2 0 055 silt x 0 006 silt x 2 0 738 clay x 0 007 clay x 2 2 699 om x 0 501 om x 2 where s a n d x silt x clay x and om x were the soil sand content soil silt content soil clay content and soil organic matter content of pixel x respectively compared with forests croplands and grasslands generally have lower evapotranspiration and shorter roots therefore the water supply capacity of croplands and grasslands are better than that of forests the water demand of yulin city comprehensively considered the water consumption of resident demand economic development and agriculture irrigation the calculation formula was as follows li et al 2017 6 pop i j p i j j 1 n p i j pop i 7 gdp i j g i j j 1 n g i j gdp i 8 wd i j pop i j l i gdp i j m i agr i j n i where p i j and g i j were the origin population and gdp of pixel j in year i respectively pop i and gdp i were the annual population and gdp data derived from statistical yearbook in year i pop i j and gdp i j was the calibration population and gdp of pixel j in year i agr i j was the farmland area of pixel j in year i in addition l i m i and n i were per capita household water consumption water consumption per 10 000 yuan gdp and per mu farmland irrigation consumption in year i respectively population and gdp in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 were calculated by linear regression method based on population and gdp data from 2000 to 2019 furthermore cropland distribution in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 were generated by plus model in multiple scenarios spatial distribution of population and gdp in 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 was separately calibrated by population and gdp data in corresponding year water demand calculation of this study mainly considered the demand of resident living and production in yulin city therefore rivers where close to industries and residential areas might have large water demand because of high water consumption in these places meanwhile considering rare demands of living and production in the unused land water demand of barren land probably small 2 3 3 calculating water supply demand risk maron et al 2017 proposed a threat assessment framework of ecosystem services researchers further quantified related conceptual indexes and generated regional supply demand risk framework of ecosystem services li et al 2017 chen et al 2019 deng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the water supply demand risk was measured by water supply demand ratio trend of water supply demand ratio water supply trend and water demand trend the water supply demand ratio expressed the spatial heterogeneity of water supply demand contradiction the formula was as follows li et al 2017 9 r x wy x wd x where r x was the water supply demand ratio of pixel x wy x and wd x were the water ecosystem service provision and consumption of pixel x respectively r x equaled to 0 which indicated the regions no longer provided water yield service if r x ranged from 0 to 1 it meant regional water supply could not meet regional water demand while r x was above 1 which indicated regional water supply was adequate moreover the trend of water supply demand ratio could represent the relative change of water supply and demand which was calculated as follows 10 r tr r m r n where r tr was the difference of water supply demand ratio in year m and n r m and r n were the water supply demand ratio in year m and n respectively if r tr was lower than 0 which indicated r j k declined on the contrary it indicated r j k remained unchanged or increased additionally water supply trend and water demand trend represented the absolute change of water supply and demand wang et al 2020 which generated by the following formulas 11 s tr wy m wy n 12 d tr wd m wd n where s tr and d tr were the differences of water supply service and water demand service respectively wy m and wy n were the water supply service in year m and n wd m and wd n were the water demand service in year m and n if s tr or d tr was lower than 0 which indicated a downward trend on the contrary it indicated remained unchanged or a upward trend comprehensively considering water supply demand ratio trend of water supply demand ratio water supply trend and water demand trend the water supply demand risk was divided into 7 grades as shown in table 4 moran et al 2017 wang et al 2020 3 results 3 1 simulation results and accuracy validation the simulation results were highly consistent with the observed maps fig 3 on the basis of the initial land use map in 2000 the spatial distribution of land use in 2005 2010 and 2015 were generated by the plus model fig 3 shows the simulated maps and observation maps in 2010 and 2015 the built up lands and water body in the simulation results were in good agreement with the observed built up lands and water body the simulated croplands forests grasslands and barren exhibited similar distribution with the observation but the compactness of distribution pattern in different land use types were more affected by neighborhood weights in plus model furthermore the plus model generated results with satisfactory accuracies and could be used to simulate future land use pattern of multiple scenarios in yulin city referred to table 5 the validation indices oa kappa and fom were calculated to quantitatively evaluate the performance of plus model table 5 both oa and kappa gradually declined from 2000 to 2015 however the values of oa and kappa in 2015 were still high with 0 899 and 0 852 respectively moreover fom was calculated to measure the pixel to pixel coincidence between simulation maps and observation maps although the fom value of 11 9 in 2015 was not highly accurate we believed it was acceptable for yulin city during 2000 2015 for the following reasons 1 pontius et al 2008 suggested that fom values were positively correlated with observed net changes in this study the observed net change was 9 81 during 2000 2015 which was a relatively short period compared to researches with relatively high fom values estoque and murayama 2012 chen et al 2016 2 the fom value of 11 9 had a similar range compared with other simulation results liu et al 2017a liu et al 2017b peng et al 2020 3 2 model simulation and analysis under multi scenarios fig 4 illustrates that of land use in yulin city under different scenarios during 2020 2050 performed similar spatial patterns the croplands were located in western and southeastern yulin city mainly covering dingbian jingbian suide mizhi jia and wubu county the forests and grasslands were distributed in southern and northeastern yulin city mainly covering dingbian shenmu yuyang jingbian and fugu county the built up lands were concentrated in central yulin city including yuyang shenmu hengshan and dingbian county in order to explore spatial temporal characteristics of different land use types under three scenarios their areas of different scenarios during 2020 2050 were calculated fig 5 compared with the farmland area of 14969 km2 in 2015 croplands under nis slightly decreased from 14236 km2 to 12769 km2 for the period of 2020 2050 and represented an obviously decreased trend under eds with a decrease of 2192 km2 in contrast croplands under fss expanded greatly from 16280 km2 to 17768 km2 with an increase of 1488 km2 referred to fig 6 a c cultivated lands under fss demonstrated substantial expansion especially in dingbian county central jingbian county and northwestern yuyang county by contrast cultivated land of nis mainly loss in dingbian county central jingbian county and southeastern yulin city and represented scattered expansion in eastern yulin city similarily cultivated land under fss shrank significantly in dingbian county central jingbian county and southern yuyang county but expanded more obviously in eastern yulin city the forests and grasslands under fss roughly remained stable from 2020 to 2050 separately compared with forest area of 4028 km2 grassland area of 17978 km2 in 2015 the forests and grasslands exhibited a slightly increased trend under nis fig 5b c similarly the forests and grasslands represented a greater increase trend under eds with increases of 764 km2 and 1346 km2 respectively fig 6d showed that grasslands expanded in most regions of yulin city under nis during 2020 2050 especially in the medium high altitude area of dingbian and jingbian county likewise grasslands expansion of eds in 2020 2050 exhibited similar pattern with that of nis while grasslands sporadically decreased in the eastern yulin city on the contrary grasslands change under fss was opposite to that of eds which grasslands largely decreased in the western yulin city and fragmentally expanded in the eastern yulin city in comparison to built up lands of 963 km2 in 2015 built up lands expanded with various degrees under different scenarios from 2020 to 2050 the expansion rates of built up lands under nis fss and eds were 10 9 km2 a 10 83 km2 a and 43 79 km2 a respectively fig 5d the built up land expansion under nis and fss were concentrated around the county built up areas in yuyang shenmu and hengshan county furthermore the built up land expansion under eds was substantially distributed around the county built up areas in dingbian jingbian yuyang henghshan and shenmu county fig 6 3 3 change of water yield supply and demand in yulin city according to the shannxi water resources bulletin during 2006 2019 the average amount of surface water resources in yulin city was 18 64 108 m3 http slt shaanxi gov cn as mentioned in water supply calculation section 2 3 2 z was an important seasonal constant to input water yield model in the current study when z value was set to 11 the simulated water yield of yulin city in 2015 derived from invest model was 19 26 108 m3 which was closest to the surface water resources as shown in table 6 and fig 7 water supply could hardly satisfy water demand in yulin city during the period of 2020 2050 land use change had little effect on water yield supply the supply amount simply changed from 18 74 108 18 89 108 m3 in 2020 to 17 88 108 20 53 108 m3 in 2050 the fluctuation of 5 compared to that in 2020 whereas land use change had greatly impact on water yield demand in yulin city the demand amount increased from 1835 42 108 1842 53 108 m3 in 2020 to 2883 93 108 2898 53 108 m3 in 2050 about 57 increase table 6 considering land use patterns under different scenarios a low level water yield supply was primarily distributed in northern dingbian county western yuyang county and fragmentally sourthern yulin city due to the spatial distribution of forests and barren fig 7 moreover a high level water yield demand was mainly located in southeastern yulin because of the abundant farmlands here fig 7 the water demand proportion of croplands was the highest in three scenarios even occupied more than 50 under fss scenario during 2020 2050 fig 8 while water yield supply represented declined under nis and eds during 2020 2050 fig s1 3 on the other hand skyrocketing water demand appeared in ever expanding built up lands of yulin city under all scenarios from 2020 to 2050 fig s1 3 and fig 7 the average water demand of built up lands was the largest especially in nis scenario ranging from 25 34 m3 m2 to 28 76 m3 m2 during 2020 2050 fig 8 and table s1 in terms of counties in yulin city the water supply amount of wubu county was least while the fastest decrease rate of water supply appeared in hengshan county with 0 04 107 m3 yr under eds fig 9 moreover the water supply of dingbian jingbian and yuyang county represented obvious increase trend from 2020 to 2050 on the other hand water demand of each county under all scenarios showed increasing tendency and the counties with significant increase during 2020 2050 were yuyang shenmu and hengshan county meanwhile the water demand amount of hengshan yuyang and suide county were large fig 9 3 4 change of water supply demand risk in yulin city as illustrated in fig 10 water supply demand risk converted from undersupplied to endangered in more than 90 regions of yulin city for the period of 2005 2030 furthermore areas with endangered water supply demand risk shrank lower than 90 of yulin city by 2050 built up lands under all scenarios probably faced dangerous water supply demand risk for the period of 2020 2030 and 2020 2050 under nis and eds more than 2 regions sporadically located in southeastern yulin city might under critically endangered water supply demand risk from 2020 to 2030 and these regions might expand to more than 4 areas of yulin city by 2050 under fss cultivated land which mainly located in central dingbian county and central jingbian county might under dangerous water supply demand risk by 2030 and these regions probably expanded to most dingbian county most jingbian county fragmental hengshan and yuyang county by 2050 additionally over 2 regions concentrated in eastern yulin might face critically endangered water supply demand risk under fss by 2050 compared the two periods i e 2020 2030 and 2020 2050 the regions of endangered risk iii level under different scenarios decreased from over 90 to 90 especially regions under fss shrank by 4 32 under nis the regions under critically endangered risk ii level increased from 2 22 by 2030 to 4 79 by 2050 expanded regions with critically endangered risk mainly located in grasslands 64 27 and forests 30 06 in nis and grasslands 41 94 forests 39 02 and built up lands 17 55 in eds similarly the expansion of regions with critically endangered risk under eds were similar with that of regions under nis for the two periods under fss the regions under critically endangered risk ii level and dangerous level iv level were increased by 1 6 and 3 44 regions of yulin city for the two periods respectively 3 5 mitigation strategies for water resource allocation in yulin city according to water supply demand risk and land use pattern evolution under different scenarios during 2020 2050 in yulin city various mitigation strategies were proposed to reasonable water allocation in the aspects of agriculture ecology urbanization and industrialization in the aspect of agricultural development excessive pursuit of grain production and adopting extensive agricultural management model resulted in vulnerable agricultural system and unbalancing agricultural ecosystem especially in dingbian jingbian suide mizhi and wubu county developing water efficient eco agriculture and land consolidation engineering technology improving cultivated land quality and comprehensively considering the production and ecological function of croplands were benefit to enhance agricultural system resilience and stability fig 11 a recent sandy land consolidation adopting structural consolidation concept to improve sandy land structure and cultivated land productivity was experimented in yulin city and obviously realized water and fertilizer preservation liu et al 2018 liu and wang 2019 the initial results showed that utilizing drip fertigation technique irrigation consumption could save of 70 02 51 02 and 30 87 for potato corn and soybean planting in the improved croplands respectively wang and liu 2020 moreover in the aspect of ecological environment protection revegetation greatly improved ecological environment while at the same time potential water demand conflicts appeared between ecosystem and human in the water limited yulin city foley et al 2011 reasonable matching forests and grasslands ratios and enriching landscape diversity in artificial forests and grasslands were conducive to sustainably improving ecological environment especially in northwestern shenmu yuyang fugu county particularly balancing water allocation between agricultural production and ecological protection played a crucial role in the southern qinjian suide county with interlaced forests and cultivated lands under future scenarios fig 11 in addition in the aspect of urbanization and industrialization intense industrial and domestic water consumption severe water pollution further accelerated water supply demand risk in yulin city especially in yuyang shenmu and hengshan county improving industrial water saving and reclaimed water cycling technology would be helpful in achieving efficient and optimized utilization of water resource in the industrial enterprises meanwhile establishing water conservation awareness and strengthening water pollution control would contribute to alleviate water supply demand risk and achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals in the future 4 discussion 4 1 analyses future land use changes under different scenarios in this study plus model was utilized to simulate the land use patterns of yulin city during 2020 2050 under three different scenarios the results represented that built up lands obviously expanded in the next 30 years under three scenarios figs 4 and 5 for croplands forests and grasslands they exhibited different change characteristics among different scenarios in the nis scenario forests increased from 4322 km2 in 2020 to 4860 km2 in 2050 with an increase of 12 45 and grasslands increased from 18766 km2 in 2020 to 19798 km2 in 2050 with an increase of 5 5 as shown in fig 4 and fig 6 forests and grasslands with substantial expansion were mainly concentrated in the high elevation regions of southern dingbian and jingbian county and the low elevation regions near rivers in suide zizhou and qingjian county which would ensure ecological environment safety in the ecologically fragile regions of yulin city qi et al 2012 cao et al 2018 however croplands shrank from 14236 km2 in 2020 to 12769 km2 in 2050 with a decrease of 1467 km2 and most of the loss cultivated lands were replaced by forests and grasslands which might pose restriction on efficient output of agricultural production in yulin city in the fss scenario although cultivated lands exhibited significant expansion the newly reclaimed croplands were mainly located in the regions with relatively poor natural resource such as the southern dingbian and jingbian county with medium high elevation and the northwestern yulin city with infertile soil and strong evapotranspiration consequently local government probably adopted land consolidation and land engineering to improve tillage conditions liu and wang 2019 but the agricultural production cost would be raised meanwhile substantial cropland expansion would invade massive forests and grasslands in the western yulin city fig 6 which probably had negative impact on ecological environment protection and regional soil and water conservation yin et al 2018 wang and shi 2020 in the eds scenario sprawling built up lands leaded extensive destruction of croplands forests and grasslands which threatened regional agricultural production and ecological environment protection further accelerated human land contradiction given the comprehensive comparison with the simulation results under three scenarios eds was not desirable the unlimited expansion of built up lands might have underlying problems to the local food security and ecological protection however the simple fss or nis also would not work due to difficultly reconcile agricultural production and ecological environment security therefore in the future management taking a reasonable tradeoff among agriculture production ecological construction and economic development might make breakthroughs in human land coupling development of yulin city 4 2 analyses supply demand risk of water supply service in the context of global warming and accelerated industrialization land use patterns changed dramatically and the contradiction between water supply and demand was prominent in yulin development constrained by limited water capability local government had difficulties balancing water resources allocation among production domestic and ecology water consumption hui et al 2020 yao et al 2021 as different land use patterns generated corresponding ecological processes which would affect water supply services fu et al 2013 spatial patterns of land use under multiple scenarios were simulated to explore the impact of land use changes on water supply demand risk as illustrated in fig s4 water supply demand risk in most regions of yulin converted from undersupplied by 2010 to endangered in the next 30 years in the same circumstance the water supply demand risk of mu us sand land in the northwestern yulin also changed from safe to vulnerable the need for agricultural water could not be satisfied in most regions of yulin city under multiple scenarios in the future fig 7 excessive groundwater exploitation for agricultural irrigation in the current situation already caused groundwater decline in dingbian and jingbian county and even appeared groundwater depression cones in some regions which seriously damaged local ecological environment lei 2021 in the future warming climate gave potential advantage for the northward expansion of the suitable cultivated lands in yulin liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b liu et al 2021c especially coupled with fss scenario croplands might expand significantly in the next 30 years fig 4 however most of the new expanded croplands occurred in water limited regions kong 2014 liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b liu et al 2021c water supply capacity varied greatly among cultivated lands distributed in space fig 8 and table s1 which probably further accelerated water supply demand risk and created underlying conflicts for water demand between agricultural production and ecosystem security feng et al 2016 moreover warming climate might further exacerbate drought frequencies and intensities hao et al 2017 yao et al 2021 and heighten water supply demand risk and threaten agricultural development in yulin city furthermore the enormous water demand of yulin city majorly occurred in the regions with intensive industrialization and urbanization fig 7 as illustrated in figs 4 and 5 built up lands increased continuously for the period of 2020 2050 especially in the eds scenario the unlimitedly sprawling expansion of built up lands encroached on high quality cultivated lands and forests in the surrounding countryside exacerbating water supply demand risk in yulin city bren d amour et al 2017 deng et al 2021 in addition yulin was particularly rich in energy and mineral resources but resources exploitation also consumed huge industrial water especially in the northwestern yulin city coal mining destroyed the underground water resistant layers causing imbalanced underground system and severe groundwater depression cones in local regions lei 2021 which increased water supply demand risk and destabilized ecological system 4 3 implications and suggestions of dryland agriculture development considering the ever increasing water supply demand risk in the future fig s4 water resource was the decisive agricultural factor that restricted agriculture development in yulin city liu et al 2020 moreover frequency drought and severe soil erosion aggravated soil nutrient loss of cultivated lands reducing cropland quality and agricultural production capability prodhan et al 2021 therefore the improvement of agricultural infrastructure and the applications of modern agricultural technologies were urged to sustainable agricultural development in yulin city as mentioned above the recent sandy land consolidation engineering experimented in northern yulin city significantly improved local cultivated land quality enhanced agricultural comprehensive productivity and optimized ecological environment liu et al 2018 liu and wang 2019 additionally the promotion of water efficient agriculture would greatly alleviate water supply demand risk in agricultural production the application of drip irrigation technology in xinjiang autonomous region had achieved positive effects li et al 2016 furthermore as agricultural production in china was mainly dependent on smallholder farming the cultivation habits risk preferences and interest inclines of local smallholder farmers would have significantly impact on choosing adaptive strategies to develop sustainable agriculture and safeguard ecosystem security in yulin city cui et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 therefore local farmers were greatly encouraged to master advanced agricultural techniques optimize soil structure and enhance the awareness of water saving ecological protection and disaster prevention chen et al 2021 meanwhile excessive groundwater exploitation and over fertilizing management were undesirable in agricultural practices wu et al 2014 considering that yulin was not only an energy intensive city but also an ecological fragile city it was crucial to reasonable balance the relationships among household water consumption farmland irrigation consumption and industrial water consumption for mitigating water resources shortage developing regional agriculture and improving ecological environment firstly the water saving awareness was urgently needed to enhance for all citizens in yulin city wang et al 2020 secondly if local government actively perfected water resources management system and unified supervised water resource exploitation on the basis of water resource protection and water pollution prevention the water resource allocation between surface water and underground water probably would be more reasonable lei 2021 thirdly smallholder farmers of yulin city were fully encouraged to develop water saving agriculture and adjust agriculture planting structure adjustment and improving farmland ecological compensation would improve farmers enthusiasm hao et al 2017 hui et al 2020 wen et al 2021 fourthly the water allocation of agricultural production and ecological protection was needed to balance and quantify in the process of ecological restoration feng et al 2016 pei et al 2021 yin et al 2021 finally a robust eco agricultural system which alleviated water restriction in agricultural development and reduced burden of agricultural irrigation on ecological balance was urged to establish for safeguarding efficient agricultural production in yunlin city and shannxi province 4 4 limitations and future research in this study future land use patterns under different scenarios were generated by plus model and water supply demand under multiple scenarios were evaluated however there were also some uncertainties and limitations in the process of simulating future land use patterns our study considered only the current socioeconomic and climatic factors while ignored future climate and socioeconomic drivers on land use change moreover our study approximately valued future water demand of industrial consumption and residential living while the impacts of differences and variations of industry coefficients on future water demand were not taken into account in addition the simulation process did not quantify government policies such as ecological protection agricultural structure adjustment regional economic development therefore in future studies considering the influence of future climate change and human activities on land use pattern evolution and quantifying some policies might make the simulation results more realistic moreover we did not consider ecosystem services flow in the calculation process of water supply and water demand which might have impact on evaluation results of water supply demand risk meanwhile restricted by data availability the suggestions about dryland agriculture development were not quantified and inputted into invest model to evaluate the potential impacts of these mitigation strategies thus coupling regional water resource coordination and ecosystem services flow quantifying and comparing the effects of different mitigation strategies will be helpful for providing improved references for regional decision making and sustainable agricultural development in the future 5 conclusions under three potential development scenarios of natural increased scenario nis food security scenario fss and economic development scenario eds in typical dryland regions this study estimated the spatial temporal patterns of land use in yulin city during 2020 2050 and then investigated water supply and demand under three scenarios and further evaluated the water supply demand risk in each scenario results indicated that future strong land use change had little effect on water yield supply while had greatly influence on water yield demand with about 57 increase and probably put nearly 90 regions of yulin city at endangered water supply demand risk in 2020 2050 by 2050 more than 4 areas of yulin city might bear critically endangered water supply demand risk expanded regions with critically endangered risk mainly located in grasslands and forests in nis but grasslands forests and built up lands in eds suggesting that dryland ecological land use and human development could more suffer from water resource demand risk developing water efficient eco agriculture adjusting agricultural structure enriching revegetation diversity improving industrial water saving technology controlling water pollution and various mitigation strategies were proposed to improve agricultural system stability alleviate water supply demand risk safeguard ecological environment and coordinate human earth relationships in yulin city besides coupling future climate data and regional water resource coordination will be helpful for improving our understandings of water supply demand risk evolution and proposing more comprehensively suggestions for sustainably outlook of agricultural development credit authorship contribution statement xueqi liu conceptualization resources methodology software writing original draft yansui liu conceptualization

3271,water processes in the tienshan mountains have undergone great changes under the impacts of climate warming and human activities here based on the budyko framework we investigated the respective contributions of climate change and human activities to decadal runoff changes 1982 2014 in two contrary watersheds i e the humid kashi watershed in the yili river valley and the arid boertala watershed in the ebinur lake basin in the tienshan mountains where closing the water balance is difficult due to the scarcity of precipitation gauges to achieve closure of the decadal water balance of the study watersheds we estimated evapotranspiration from a complementary relationship model and snow ice melt using the degree day method with the remote sensing snow cover product we found that the increase of rainfall 61 6 mm and snow ice melt 57 3 mm dominated the increase of runoff 87 2 mm from 398 2 mm in 1982 1992 to 485 4 mm in 1993 2014 in the kashi watershed contributing 47 1 mm 54 8 and 43 8 mm 51 0 respectively to the increase of runoff unlike the kashi watershed human activities contributed 13 8 mm 103 7 to the runoff 13 9 mm from 61 4 mm in 1982 1997 to 75 3 mm in 1998 2014 in the boertala watershed most of the increase in rainfall 62 5 mm and snow ice melt 13 6 mm was consumed by the increase of et 64 0 mm instead of runoff further analysis showed that most of the increases in snow ice melt and et were contributed from the high 2500 m and low 1500 m elevation regions respectively snowmelt showed a decreasing trend in low elevation regions our study highlighted the importance of snow ice melt and et in understanding decadal changes in runoff in the tienshan mountains keywords water balance snowmelt evapotranspiration climate change tienshan mountains 1 introduction the region of the tienshan mountains which serve as water sources for most of the major rivers in central asia is sensitive to climate changes and human activities hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 as the climate warms most of the snow cover and glaciers in the high mountain regions of asia hma including the tienshan mountains are projected to melt at an accelerated rate in the next few decades khanal et al 2021 because meltwater from snow and ice takes up a large portion 45 77 to the streamflow in the hma armstrong et al 2019 guo and li 2015 wulf et al 2016 global warming will pose serious flooding threats in the mountainous areas moreover in the long run as the glaciers in the hma deplete in the global warming context shean et al 2020 drought frequencies may increase and water shortages are projected to be more severe at the end of the 21st century khanal et al 2021 the climate of the tienshan mountains has become warmer and wetter during the last several decades wang and qin 2017 the air temperature has increased at a rate of 0 22 per decade in northwestern china ren and yang 2006 which is nearly two times the global mean increase rate ipcc 2013 among the northwestern regions of china air temperature increases at the fastest rate in the eastern region of the tienshan mountains and the yili river valley in the center of the tienshan mountains yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2006 li et al 2016b found that the air temperature in the aksu river basin that located on the south slope of the tienshan mountains increased at a rate of 0 28 per decade and this rise in the air temperature has contributed 45 to the increase of the runoff through snow ice melt precipitation in the tienshan mountains has also shown an increasing trend during the last 50 years li et al 2016a for example the precipitation increased at a rate of 10 5 mm per decade in the kaidu river basin in the south slope of the tienshan mountains chen et al 2013 which is the dominant cause for the increase 8 4 mm per decade in the runoff of the basin although climate variability is the dominant factor in runoff variations in the southern slope of the tienshan mountains chen et al 2013 li et al 2016b changes in the underlying surface have also been significant in the tienshan mountains because of the intensive human activities for example due to overgrazing 46 2 of the grassland in the yili river valley has been degraded during the 2001 2015 period yan et al 2018 as the population grows cultivated land area has increased at least 3 times in the ebinur lake basin on the northern slope of the tienshan mountains during the last 50 years wang et al 2017 overall human activities have contributed 53 1 and 41 1 to the runoff changes during the period of 1961 2015 respectively at the jinghe and wenquan stations in the ebinur lake basin wang et al 2021 under the background of global changes numerous studies have been devoted to characterizing the responses of basin scale water balances to climate warming and human activity using hydrological models unlike the process based models that need large numbers of parameters shen et al 2013 the budyko models budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 provide a robust and transparent tool in studying the joint impacts of climate and underlying surface on watershed water balances gan et al 2021b in recent years the budyko model has also been extended to evaluate the effect of snow melting on watershed water balances wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 using the budyko framework the water resource changes in the upper region of the yarlung zangbo river basin was found to be dominated by the snowmelt runoff increase and the underlying surface changes which accounted for 49 18 and 59 61 respectively to the increase of runoff xin et al 2021 human activities exerted great impacts in some areas of hma e g in the amu darya river basin which originates from the tienshan and pamir alai mountains hu et al 2021 the impacts of human activities in this basin exceeded 100 from 1960 to 2017 compared to the 14 25 to 5 43 impact of climate change to the decrease in runoff hu et al 2021 despite the above mentioned progress the characterization of the water balance of the tienshan mountains is still difficult due to the uncertainty in the estimation of evapotranspiration et and snow ice melt et is a major term in the water balance and affects streamflow strongly in arid regions however it was not explicitly estimated in most of the previous studies wang et al 2018 xin et al 2021 moreover snowmelt is elevation dependent because snowfall and the air temperature are highly elevation dependent however snowmelt is usually not explicitly considered hu et al 2021 li et al 2016b in previous studies in this paper we study the long term water balance in two contrasting watersheds in the center and the northern slope of the tienshan mountains i e the kashi watershed with a large 0 5 runoff coefficient and higher elevation 2309 m on average in the upstream of the yili valley and the boertala watershed with a small 0 2 runoff coefficient and lower elevation 1993 m on average in the ebinur lake basin to estimate the long term snow ice melt we used a state of art global snow cover product hori et al 2017 in this study we used a complementary relationship model brutsaert 2015 that has been tested at global scales recently gan et al 2021a to estimate the regional distribution in et the purpose of this paper is threefold 1 analyze the long term 1982 2014 trend of streamflow and detect change points in streamflow in the study watersheds 2 analyze the long term changes in snow ice melt and et at different elevation ranges and quantify their impacts on water balances 3 quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to the long term changes in streamflow in the study watersheds 2 study area and data 2 1 topography of the study watersheds we study the kashi river basin in the upper reaches of the yili river valley and the boertala river basin in the ebinur lake basin fig 1 digital elevation data with a resolution of 90 m from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 were used to extract river networks and delineate watershed extent fig 1 the elevation ranges from 874 m to 4274 m and from 500 to 3943 m respectively in the kashi river and the boertala river basins the hydrological process of the mountainous areas is elevation dependent therefore we divided each study watershed into 3 zones 1 zone 1 dem 1500 m 2 zone 2 1500 m dem 2500 m and 3 zone 3 dem 2500 m the ratios of grids that fall into zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 are 22 39 and 39 respectively in the kashi river basin and 38 31 and 31 in the boertala river basin 2 2 data description and processing 2 2 1 in situ precipitation and runoff data daily measurements of precipitation at 12 in situ meteorological sites fig 1 were obtained in this study https data cma cn annual runoff data at the tuohai station in the kashi river basin and bole station in the boertala river basin were used information of all in situ sites was summarized in table 1 2 2 2 regional meteorological forcing to estimate the spatial distribution of et and snow ice melt we need grided meteorological forcing data including the incoming shortwave radiation rs incoming longwave radiation rl air temperature ta air humidity relative humidity rh wind speed u and precipitation p in this study we used a newly released dataset the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 for regional climate forcing which is at the spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal resolution of hourly daily and monthly the cmfd used remote sensing dataset such as the trmm satellite precipitation analysis data 3b42 and reanalysis dataset such as the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 forcing data as the backbone and merged them with weather station observation data from the china meteorological administration he et al 2020 as wang et al 2016 showed the gldas 1 version 1 precipitation data has a discontinuity problem and the gldas 2 version 2 precipitation data has relatively large mean absolute errors therefore we further corrected the precipitation data of cmfd using the in situ precipitation through the method of he et al 2020 2 2 3 snow ice cover data long term snow cover datasets at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are available in recent years hori et al 2017 muhammad and thapa 2020 peters et al 2015 in this study we used a state of art global snow cover product i e the jasmes product hori et al 2017 https kuroshio eorc jaxa jp jasmes to estimate the long term snow ice melt in our study area the jasmes product 1978 2015 was derived using the avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer data from the noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration satellite during the 1978 2001 period and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data from the terra and aqua satellites during the 2000 2015 period the accuracy of the jasmes product is higher than the snow cover product from the noaa climate data record hori et al 2017 the spatial resolution of the product is 0 05 and the temporal resolution is daily weekly and half monthly to estimate monthly snowmelt we used the half monthly product to determine the snow cover frequency scf at each month i e the temporal ratio of snow cover within a month for example if snow ice is detected in 12 days within 30 days the scf is 40 2 2 4 albedo albedo is a key property of land surface in governing the radiation balance of the land we used the 8 day 0 05 resolution albedo data from the global land surface satellite glass products http www geodata cn liu et al 2013a qu et al 2014 in this study the glass albedo product is a long term 1981 2015 continuous and gapless dataset liu et al 2013a which was produced using the noaa avhrr data for the 1981 1999 period and the modis data for the 2000 2015 period the accuracy of the glass albedo product is found similar to that of the widely acknowledged modis mcd43 product liu et al 2013b however the glass albedo dataset covers a much longer period 1981 2015 than the modis product 2 2 5 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to indicate the long term vegetative fraction of the study area we used the global inventory modeling and mapping studies normalized difference vegetation index version 3 gimms ndvi3g datasets pinzon and tucker 2014 https glam1 gsfc nasa gov in this study also ndvi was used to estimate the land surface emissivity as shown in section 3 2 this ndvi dataset covers the period of 1982 2015 and has a half month interval and spatial resolution of approximately 0 08 the ndvi data were resampled to a 0 05 scale all gridded data including atmospheric forcing albedo ndvi and snow cover frequency were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 05 and a temporal resolution of a month 3 methods 3 1 degree day method for estimating melt from snow ice melt from snow or ice is usually estimated using energy balance models or the degree day melting models hock 2003 that only require air temperature despite its empirical origin and simple model structure the degree day method has been proved as accurate as of the physically based models because snow ice melt is mainly driven by longwave radiation and sensible heat flux which is highly dependent on air temperature the basic form of the degree day model is shown in equation 1 the water equivalence of snow ice melt for a snow covered or ice covered surface during a period of n days is estimated by the product of a degree day factor d mm day and the accumulated air temperature when the air temperature is higher than the temperature threshold tr tr is usually taken as 0 1 melt i n d t i t r i f t i t r worth noting at a monthly time scale because snow may not be available every day of a month monthly snowmelt here is estimated by scaling equation 1 by multiplying the temporal frequency scf of the corresponding month scf is retrieved from the jasmes snow cover product the degree day factor varies significantly across space and time it depends on many factors such as the density of the snow ice and the characteristic of the underlying surface most of the values of the degree day factor reported from the in situ measurements fall into a wide range of 2 5 14 mm day kayastha et al 2003 xu et al 2017 in this study we estimated the degree day factor and therefore the snowmelt of each watershed by forcing closure of the decadal basin scale water balance as shown in section 3 3 3 2 complementary relationship model for estimating et evapotranspiration et is a major consumption term of water for arid regions as a complicated land surface process et is controlled by the interaction among the atmospheric condition net radiation and vegetation growth at the land surface at the diurnal bu et al 2021 gan and gao 2015 gan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 and daily gan et al 2021c time scales however at a monthly scale et can be estimated using emergent methods that do not need detailed parameterizations of the land surface among the emergent methods the complementary relationship bouchet 1963 models provide a simple but sound framework in estimating et using only routine meteorological data ma et al 2019 wang et al 2020 we used a recently proposed generalized complementary relationship gcr model brutsaert 2015 to estimate monthly et in this study the gcr model estimates et as follows 2 e t a e t po e r pa 2 2 e t pa e t po where etpo is the potential evaporation estimated using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 as shown in equation 3 etpo refers to the evaporation rate of a large uniform saturated surface etpa is the apparent potential evaporation estimated using the penman equation penman 1948 as shown in equation 4 etpa refers to the evaporation rate of a small saturated surface that is surrounded by a non saturated environment 3 e t po α e δ δ γ r n g 4 e t pa δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ f u 2 v p d where rn and g are the net

emissivity which is estimated using ndvi valor and caselles 1996 and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 wm 2k 4 due to the large albedo of snow and the fact that land surface emissivity is usually larger than that of the air the net radiation of land surface in many snow covered pixels may be smaller than zero currently the mechanism of evaporation under negative rn conditions is not fully understood in this paper et was therefore set as 0 when rn is smaller than 0 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure to the air temperature hpa k γ is the psychrometric constant hpa k and vpd is the vapor pressure deficit hpa the wind function f u2 in equation 4 is formulated as f u2 7 43 1 0 54u2 in units of w m2 shuttleworth 1993 where u2 is the wind speed m s at the height of 2 m αe is the sole paramter of the gcr model note that although the pt coefficient of the saturated surfaces is widely accepted as 1 26 on average assouline et al 2016 gan and liu 2020 gan et al 2020 also it is related to special humidity and air temperature in theory liu and yang 2021 the parameter αe in the gcr model is just a weak analog to the priestley taylor pt coefficient priestley and taylor 1972 αe is usually smaller than 1 26 and exhibits substantial variations temporally and spatially gan et al 2021a yang et al 2009 studies have found that αe is negatively related to the climate index ai defined as the ratio between the annual etpa and the precipitation in china liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and across the globe gan et al 2021a we run the gcr model at the monthly scales in this study with αe determined as αe 1 024ai 0 164 gan et al 2021a for more details about the gcr model please refer to the works of brutsaert 2015 and gan et al 2021a 2019b 3 3 closing the water balance the water balance of a watershed can be written as in equation 5 where precipitation p is balanced by runoff r et and water storage δs which is mainly consisted of changes in the groundwater and the water stored in the soil layers 5 p r e t δ s precipitation includes both rainfall and snowfall precipitation in the form of snowfall in the mountainous areas is expected to be underestimated in our study area because most of the precipitation gauges locate in the relatively low elevation regions table 1 where precipitation is usually lower than that at higher elevations for example in the kashi watershed although the precipitation field from cmfd was corrected using gauge data the multi year mean r is close to p as shown in table 2 indicating that p was underestimated to close the water balance we used snow ice melt from the degree day method to approximate the input of snowfall as shown in equation 1 we rearranged the water balance equation as follows equation 6 the total water input to a watershed i e pe which was termed as the effective precipitation is consisted of rainfall rain and snow ice melt melt where rain refers to the precipitation when the air temperature is higher than 0 rain is derived from the gauge corrected cmfd 6 p e r a i n m e l t r e t δ s at a decadal time scale δs is approximated as 0 et is estimated as in section 3 2 therefore the degree day factor is tuned to minimize the residue term rain melt r et in equation 6 3 4 trend detection and change point detection the mann kendall mk method kendall 1948 mann 1945 which has been recommended by the world meteorological organization in trend analysis was used to detect trends and change points in the time series of runoff in this study unlike the parametric trend tests that usually assume normal distribution in the data the mk method detects trends only based on the ranks of the observations due to such distribution free advantage the mk method has been widely used in hydrological applications ahmad et al 2015 hamed 2008 in which the distribution in precipitation and runoff are usually skewed we first used the mk method to determine the change points in the runoff time series and then divided the runoff data into two periods i e the pre change period and the after change period 3 5 separating the contribution of climate change and human activities using the budyko framework the change in the runoff δr between the pre change period and the after change period can be separated into the contribution from climate change δrc and that from human activities δrh based on the elasticity method dooge et al 1999 the contribution of factor x e g the precipitation p to δr can be approximated as the product of δx the difference in x between the two periods and the sensitivity coefficient of x to r in this study the sensitivity coefficient of climate change and human activities were analytically solved based on a budyko type equation i e the choudhury yang model choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 as shown in equation 7 where precipitation in the original formula is surrogated by the effective precipitation defined above there is only one parameter in the choudhury yang equation i e n which comprehensively reflects the control of the underlying surface on the allocation of the effective precipitation into runoff and et the contribution of δn can be viewed as the impacts of underlying surface changes that are due to human activities 7 et p e 1 1 p e e t 0 n 1 n the sensitivity coefficients of et to rain melt et0 and n are expressed as in the following equations 8a 8d therefore δr can be partitioned into the contribution from the changes in rain melt et0 and n as shown in equation 9 for more details of the budyko type models please refer

in annual runoff the annual runoff at the tuohai station and the bole station was shown in fig 2 as indicated by the mk test runoff at the tuohai station showed a significant α 0 05 increasing trend in 1982 2014 at a rate of 31 2 mm per decade runoff at the bole station also showed a significant α 0 01 increasing trend at a much lower rate of 5 1 mm per decade the mk test has detected two change points in the time series of runoff at the tuohai station in 1988 and 1993 runoff increased from 1982 to 1987 and decreased during the 1988 1992 period and then exhibited an increasing trend since 1993 in contrast there is only one change point in the time series at the bole station therefore we divided the runoff data at the bole station into two periods i e the pre change period 1982 1997 and the after change period 1998 2014 the tuohai data was also divided into two periods i e 1982 1992 and 1993 2014 as shown in fig 2 4 2 estimation of monthly et and snow ice melt to close the annual water balance and explain decadal changes in the runoff in the two study watersheds we first estimated monthly et and snow ice melt using remote sensing data and then upscale them to an annual scale mean monthly et was 30 9 mm month and 27 8 mm month during 1982 2014 in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively et exhibited smooth seasonal variations in both watersheds fig 3 from november to february due to the high snow cover fig s1 net radiation was small because the snow cover reflects most of the incoming solar radiation with the highest albedo reaching over 0 80 fig s2 therefore et was close to 0 from november to february because of the small net radiation and the low air temperature the monthly et was largest in july in both watersheds with the peak values in all years ranging from 80 to 115 mm month and 60 105 mm month in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively fig 3 due to low air temperature snow ice melt was quite small from december to february fig 4 although snow cover frequency was highest in winter which was higher than 90 in most grids in both watersheds as shown in fig s1 snow ice cover extent and frequency decreased quickly from march and reached their minimum in july or august fig s1 correspondingly snow ice melt began to increase rapidly since march figs 3 and 4 for example most of the grids are contributing snow ice melt in april in the kashi watershed and only the grids that are at relatively high altitudes were contributing meltwater in july and august similarly snow in grids that are at relatively low altitudes began to melt in march in the boertala watershed and only the grids that are at relatively high altitudes were contributing meltwater in august in august meltwater from the grids with snow ice cover was 84 2 mm month and 31 7 mm month on average in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively at the watershed scale compared to et the monthly snow ice melt exhibited much larger seasonal variations with two peaks throughout the year fig 3 snow ice melt at the watershed scale reached its first peak in april or may and then drops to low values in july and august although a small fraction of grids with high snow ice coverage at the high altitude can contribute to melting water of 1000 mm month fig 4 snow ice melt reached its second peak in september or october fig 3 4 3 annual water balance and the attribution of decadal changes in runoff with et and snow ice melt determined annual water balances in both watersheds are shown in fig 5 after considering the term of snow ice melt the effective precipitation rain melt is much larger than precipitation that was derived from the cmfd and in situ datasets in the kashi watershed although the increase of the effective precipitation was generally consistent with that of the precipitation table 2 the multi year averaged snow ice melt was 614 5 mm year and 239 8 mm year in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively compared to the 214 3 mm year and 163 7 mm year rainfall respectively in these two watersheds snow ice melt make a great contribution to annual runoff in the kashi watershed for example rainfall and the original precipitation in 2010 was not the largest in all years fig 5a however the runoff peaked in 2010 fig 5b because the largest snow ice melt occurred in 2010 at the decadal time scale compared to period 1 multi year runoff and et in period 2 increased 87 2 mm and 32 3 mm respectively in the kashi watershed correspondingly compared to period 1 rainfall and snow ice melt in period 2 increased 61 6 mm and 57 3 mm respectively and the potential evaporation et0 increased 47 3 mm the n value of a period was calculated by inverting the choudhury yang equation with the mean runoff p et0 in the corresponding period the values of n were 0 902 and 0 883 in period 1 and period 2 respectively in the kashi watershed and the values of n were 1 274 and 1 418 in period 1 and period 2 respectively in the boertala watershed the contribution of each factor rainfall snow ice melt potential evaporation and human activity to the total change in runoff was determined using the elastic method as shown in table 2 sensitivity coefficients of rainfall snow ice melt et0 and n were obtained through equation 8 the impact of snow ice melt was close to that of rainfall in the kashi watershed the increase in rainfall and snow ice melt contributed the most to the total increase 87 2 mm in the runoff i e 47 1 mm and 43 8 mm respectively in contrast the increase of et0 caused a decrease in the runoff at the magnitude of 10 7 mm compared to the natural causes rainfall snow ice melt and potential evaporation the impacts of human activities only contributed 6 6 to the total change in runoff in the kashi watershed in the boertala watershed compared to period 1 the multi year runoff increased 13 9 mm whereas the multi year et increased 64 0 mm in period 2 correspondingly compared to period 1 rainfall and snow ice melt in period 2 increased 62 5 mm and 13 6 mm respectively and the et0 decreased 15 0 mm the elastic method shows that the increase in rainfall has dominated the increase in the runoff table 2 causing an increase of 21 5 mm in the runoff which was much larger than the contribution of snow ice melt 4 7 mm and et0 0 9 mm unlike the kashi watershed human activities have significant negative impacts on decadal runoff causing a decrease of 13 8 mm in the multi year runoff which was close to the increase 13 9 mm of multi year runoff table 2 due to the huge negative impacts of n runoff in the boertala was even decreasing since 2004 although rainfall and snow ice melt have been increasing since 2004 fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 closing decadal water balance and uncertainty analysis precipitation in the mountainous area is usually difficult to estimate due to the scarcity of precipitation gauges and the high heterogeneity of precipitation in both horizontal and vertical directions in our study area precipitation gauges are located in relatively low altitudes 2500 m which may result in the underestimation of regional precipitation because precipitation in the high altitudes is expected to be underestimated for example the multi year 1982 2014 average precipitation that was derived from the gauge corrected cmfd in the kashi watershed is 398 3 mm which is underestimated because it is even smaller than the multi year averaged runoff 456 3 mm compared to the kashi watershed the elevation of the boertala watershed is lower 1993 m v s 2309 m on average therefore the sum of runoff and et was close to the precipitation that was derived from the gauge corrected cmfd in the boertala watershed and the difference between precipitation and effective precipitation was smaller in the boertala watershed compared to that in the kashi watershed table 2 in this study to close the water balance we estimated the long term regional et using a generalized complementary relationship gcr model brutsaert 2015 that only requires routine meteorological measurements after relating its sole parameter αe with the climate index the gcr model has been successfully applied in china liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and across the globe gan et al 2021a our estimation of et is consistent with other studies that derived et using remote sensing models for example based on the modis et product mod16a2 mu et al 2011 yan et al 2019 reported that the multi year average of grassland et was 395 mm year for the yili river valley in 2001 2015 which is close to our estimation table 2 wei 2015 estimated et distribution of the boertala watershed from april to october in 2013 using the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 with modis and landsat 8 data and found that et in most of the areas was lower than 0 5 mm day in april and larger than 2 mm day in july which was consistent with our estimates fig 4 also because the water imbalance of the boertala watershed was relatively small and because the runoff only takes up a small proportion of the precipitation which implies that most of the precipitation is consumed by et we can deduce that the magnitude of the estimated et 330 mm year on average is quite reasonable for this watershed with et determined we then closed the decadal water balance table 2 by estimating snow ice melt based on the degree day method and the observation of snow ice cover from remote sensing products the degree day factor was calibrated as 16 04 mm day and 13 1 mm day in the two periods respectively in the kashi watershed and calibrated as 7 5 mm day and 5 8 mm day in the two periods respectively in the boertala watershed the residue of annual water balance i e rain melt runoff et was close to 0 mm on average in each period in both watersheds table 2 the effective precipitation is highly correlated with the sum of runoff and et fig s3 when compared to the sum of runoff and et rmse in effective precipitation was 171 1 mm and 222 6 mm in the two periods respectively in the kashi watershed and was 90 6 mm and 77 7 mm in the two periods respectively in the boertala watershed fig s3 at the annual scales the imbalance between rain melt and runoff et existed due to water storage terms such as the groundwater and the water stored in the soil layers worth noting the degree day factor was expected to be elevation dependent therefore different values are suggested to be taken for different dem zones in the snowmelt runoff models for example in the srm model martinec and rango 1986 also the degree day factor is expected to be different for snow and ice where the values for ice are usually much larger than the former armstrong et al 2019 in this study we do not have enough data to calibrate the degree day factor in each dem zone or discriminate the values of snow from ice however the degree day factors in our study area generally fell into the ranges from other similar studies for example xu et al 2017 found that the degree day factor ranged from 3 6 mm day to 13 0 mm day at the southern slope of the tienshan mountains kayastha et al 2003 reported that the degree day factor ranged from 5 5 mm day to 14 2 mm day in the glacier in central nepal and the qinghai tibetan plateau note that the calibrated degree day factor in period 1 in the kashi watershed was a little larger than the reported maximum value at the southern slope of the tienshan mountains xu et al 2017 to further discuss the validity of the snowmelt estimates we compared our results with the in situ measurements of snowmelt in a small watershed that is also located in the upper reaches of the yili river valley hanati et al 2019 hanati et al 2019 reported that snow in the upper reach of the yili river valley began to melt at a temperature far below the 0 threshold for example on sunny days snow even began to melt when the air temperature was higher than 12 therefore it is expected that if the air temperature threshold was set as 0 as in the case of our study a relatively large degree day factor would be resulted because the effect of solar radiation in melting snow was not considered it is difficult to determine the intra annual variations in the effective values of the air temperature threshold and the degree day factor due to such an uncertainty we recognized that uncertainty may exist in seasonal modeling of snow ice melt however we argue that the snow ice melt estimates at the annual scales are reasonable by forcing the clousure of decadal water balances for example in situ measurements in the upper reaches of the yili river valley hanati et al 2019 showed that the annual rainfall and snowfall were 130 mm and 900 mm respectively hanati et al 2019 in which the ratio of snow 79 6 to the total precipitation is close to our result 74 1 in the kashi watershed and the total amount of precipitation is close to our estimation of effective precipitation in the kashi watershed 828 8 mm year on average 5 2 the impacts of et and snow ice melt on decadal water balance the estimation of et proves to be useful in explaining the decadal changes in the runoff for example the runoff of the boertala watershed only increased 13 9 mm between the two periods although the increase of precipitation in the boertala watershed 103 4 mm is comparable to that of the kashi watershed 118 3 mm such a result can be partly explained by the result that most of the increase in precipitation is converted into et because unlike the kashi watershed et0 in the boertala watershed decreased which indicates an additional increase in et at given conditions according to the complementary relationship meltwater from snow and ice has been shown as a major water source for mountainous areas in asia for example snowmelt and ice melt contributed to 35 and 10 respectively to the streamflow of the sutlej valley western himalaya wulf et al 2016 armstrong et al 2019 quantified the meltwater sources in river flow in 5 major river basins in the hma and found that snowmelt and ice melt contribute to 48 to the runoff in the ganges river basin and over 70 in the syr darya amu darya indus and brahmaputra river basins in comparison meltwater from snow and ice contributed to 74 1 and 59 4 to the effective precipitation in kashi and boertala watersheds respectively which is consistent with the above mentioned studies in the hma studies have found that the ratio between snowfall and the total precipitation denoted as rs has huge impacts on the annual average berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and inter annual variability liu et al 2022 in the runoff as the climate continues to be warmer less precipitation will fall as snow reducing rs which will pose serious challenges to the water resources for the snow dependent watersheds rs in our study watersheds are quite different from each other i e 0 74 in the kashi watershed which is larger than the value of 0 59 in the boertala watershed correspondingly the runoff coefficient r p is much larger in the kashi watershed than that in the boertala watershed 0 55 v s 0 17 as shown in table 3 which is consistent with the discovery of previous studies that the annual mean runoff is larger with larger rs berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 moreover the inter annual variability in the runoff which is normalized by the variability in precipitation σp denoted as σr σp was found to be larger with larger rs in the two study watersheds table 3 σr σp in the kashi watershed is 0 39 which is much larger than the value of 0 11 in the boertala watershed indicating that inter annual variability in runoff would be larger if more precipitation is consisted of snow which is consistent with the discovery of liu et al 2022 snow cover has a huge impact on the available energy of the land surface the albedo of snow cover 0 8 is significantly larger than the non snow covered land 0 2 as shown in fig s2 indicating that the snow covered land reflected most of the solar radiation resulting in low values of net radiation and therefore low values of available energy and potential et in our paper we have considered such an effect by incorporating remotely sensed albedo the glass albedo product in estimating the net radiation of the land surface moreover available energy of land surface and therefore the potential et may be further reduced due to the snow cover because the warming of the snow before it is melted or evaporated will consume a certain amount of energy rm as highlighted by the work of zhang et al 2015 the impact of rm on the potential et can be accounted for using the following equation where l is the latent heat of evaporation 10 e t 0 e e t 0 r m l e t 0 0 14 r s p when applying equation 7 to decompose the variation in the runoff the effect of rm on et0 was considered as shown in table 4 et0 in the kashi watershed was reduced to 684 6 mm and 723 8 mm in period 1 and period 2 respectively compared to the values of 765 2 mm and 812 5 mm before correction et0 in the boertala watershed was reduced to 1001 2 mm and 984 1 mm in period 1 and period 2 respectively compared to the values of 1033 8 mm and 1018 6 mm before correction the contributions of each factor to the decadal changes in runoff were shown in table 4 results are similar to those in table 2 indicating that rm only poses a marginal impact on decadal runoff 5 3 impacts of environmental factors at different elevations on runoff environmental factors such as air temperature precipitation vegetation coverage etc and their trends are elevation dependent therefore how environmental factors at different elevations impact the decadal runoff needs to be analyzed rainfall at higher elevations is increasing faster than that in lower elevation areas in both the kashi and boertala watersheds for example precipitation in the form of rainfall increased at rates of 2 93 mm year and 2 46 mm year in dem zones 2 and 3 respectively nearly twice the increase rate 1 52 mm year of rainfall in dem zone 1 of the kashi watershed similarly rainfall in the boertala watershed increased at rates larger than 3 0 mm year in dem zones 2 and 3 much larger than that in dem zone 1 which was 1 63 mm year our result is consistent with the report of li et al 2013 that precipitation in the mountainous area increased at a much faster rate than that in the oasis zones in the arid region of northwest china unlike rainfall snow ice melt showed a decreasing trend in dem zone 1 in both watersheds fig 6 c d although the air temperature was increasing fig s4 which was probably due to the decreasing of snow cover frequency in both watersheds fig s4 snow ice melt in regions higher than 2500 m dme zone 3 increased significantly i e 12 29 mm year and 9 03 mm year respectively in the kashi and boertala watersheds because both the snow cover frequency and the air temperature increased in dem zone 3 fig s4 although the elevation of most of the study area over 95 is lower than the snowline 3700 mm the ice is an important source for melting water especially in july and august fig 4 snow cover frequency was relatively stable for the area above 3700 m in both watersheds fig s5 however the melting water in the boertala watershed showed an increasing trend indicating that ice in this area may be shrinking under the climate warming condition it can be concluded that most of the increase in the decadal runoff comes from the increase in effective precipitation in the high elevation regions et increased at a much faster rate in the boertala watershed than that in the kashi watershed fig 6 as indicated in the last section the increase in et consumed most of the increase in rainfall and snow ice melt in the boertala watershed especially in dem zone 1 where et increased at a fast rate as high as 5 06 mm year as reported by wang et al 2017 farmland most of which locates in the low elevation regions increased at least three times during the 1960 2010 period in the ebinur lake watershed the increase of farmland area is an important factor for explaining the fast increasing rate of et in the low elevation regions in the boertala watershed vegetation coverage as indicated by ndvi increased with the fastest rate in dem zone 1 than that in higher regions in the boertala watershed fig s4 which is consistent with the fastest increasing rate in et in dem zone 1 in comparison ndvi showed a decreasing trend in dem zones 1 and 2 in the kashi watershed fig s4 which is probably due to overgrazing as reported by yan et al 2018 such a result helps to explain that the increase of et in the kashi watershed is only half of that in the boertala watershed table 2 although the increase rate in air temperature and precipitation was comparable in these two watersheds our study shows that the inclusion of actual evapotranspiration in different elevation ranges other than only potential evaporation plays a key role in explaining decadal changes in runoff 6 conclusion closing water balances is usually difficult because of the uncertainty in precipitation in mountainous areas our study demonstrated that decadal water balances in two contrasting watersheds i e the humid kashi watershed in the upstream of the yili river valley and the arid boertala watershed in the ebinur lake basin in the tienshan mountains can be closed when the actual evapotranspiration and snow ice melt were derived from remote sensing models et was derived from a complementary relationship model that combined with remotely sensed albedo and ndvi snow ice melt was derived from the degree day method with a remotely sensed snow ice coverage dataset our study shows that the changes in snow ice melt and et are keys to explaining decadal changes in runoff in both watersheds the much larger increasing rate of snow ice melt at higher elevation regions than that at lower elevation regions is the major contributor for the increase of runoff in contrast the much larger increasing rate of et at lower elevation regions than that at lower elevation regions is the major reason for the decreasing of runoff credit authorship contribution statement guojing gan conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft jinglu wu

3271,water processes in the tienshan mountains have undergone great changes under the impacts of climate warming and human activities here based on the budyko framework we investigated the respective contributions of climate change and human activities to decadal runoff changes 1982 2014 in two contrary watersheds i e the humid kashi watershed in the yili river valley and the arid boertala watershed in the ebinur lake basin in the tienshan mountains where closing the water balance is difficult due to the scarcity of precipitation gauges to achieve closure of the decadal water balance of the study watersheds we estimated evapotranspiration from a complementary relationship model and snow ice melt using the degree day method with the remote sensing snow cover product we found that the increase of rainfall 61 6 mm and snow ice melt 57 3 mm dominated the increase of runoff 87 2 mm from 398 2 mm in 1982 1992 to 485 4 mm in 1993 2014 in the kashi watershed contributing 47 1 mm 54 8 and 43 8 mm 51 0 respectively to the increase of runoff unlike the kashi watershed human activities contributed 13 8 mm 103 7 to the runoff 13 9 mm from 61 4 mm in 1982 1997 to 75 3 mm in 1998 2014 in the boertala watershed most of the increase in rainfall 62 5 mm and snow ice melt 13 6 mm was consumed by the increase of et 64 0 mm instead of runoff further analysis showed that most of the increases in snow ice melt and et were contributed from the high 2500 m and low 1500 m elevation regions respectively snowmelt showed a decreasing trend in low elevation regions our study highlighted the importance of snow ice melt and et in understanding decadal changes in runoff in the tienshan mountains keywords water balance snowmelt evapotranspiration climate change tienshan mountains 1 introduction the region of the tienshan mountains which serve as water sources for most of the major rivers in central asia is sensitive to climate changes and human activities hu et al 2021 wang et al 2021 as the climate warms most of the snow cover and glaciers in the high mountain regions of asia hma including the tienshan mountains are projected to melt at an accelerated rate in the next few decades khanal et al 2021 because meltwater from snow and ice takes up a large portion 45 77 to the streamflow in the hma armstrong et al 2019 guo and li 2015 wulf et al 2016 global warming will pose serious flooding threats in the mountainous areas moreover in the long run as the glaciers in the hma deplete in the global warming context shean et al 2020 drought frequencies may increase and water shortages are projected to be more severe at the end of the 21st century khanal et al 2021 the climate of the tienshan mountains has become warmer and wetter during the last several decades wang and qin 2017 the air temperature has increased at a rate of 0 22 per decade in northwestern china ren and yang 2006 which is nearly two times the global mean increase rate ipcc 2013 among the northwestern regions of china air temperature increases at the fastest rate in the eastern region of the tienshan mountains and the yili river valley in the center of the tienshan mountains yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2006 li et al 2016b found that the air temperature in the aksu river basin that located on the south slope of the tienshan mountains increased at a rate of 0 28 per decade and this rise in the air temperature has contributed 45 to the increase of the runoff through snow ice melt precipitation in the tienshan mountains has also shown an increasing trend during the last 50 years li et al 2016a for example the precipitation increased at a rate of 10 5 mm per decade in the kaidu river basin in the south slope of the tienshan mountains chen et al 2013 which is the dominant cause for the increase 8 4 mm per decade in the runoff of the basin although climate variability is the dominant factor in runoff variations in the southern slope of the tienshan mountains chen et al 2013 li et al 2016b changes in the underlying surface have also been significant in the tienshan mountains because of the intensive human activities for example due to overgrazing 46 2 of the grassland in the yili river valley has been degraded during the 2001 2015 period yan et al 2018 as the population grows cultivated land area has increased at least 3 times in the ebinur lake basin on the northern slope of the tienshan mountains during the last 50 years wang et al 2017 overall human activities have contributed 53 1 and 41 1 to the runoff changes during the period of 1961 2015 respectively at the jinghe and wenquan stations in the ebinur lake basin wang et al 2021 under the background of global changes numerous studies have been devoted to characterizing the responses of basin scale water balances to climate warming and human activity using hydrological models unlike the process based models that need large numbers of parameters shen et al 2013 the budyko models budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 provide a robust and transparent tool in studying the joint impacts of climate and underlying surface on watershed water balances gan et al 2021b in recent years the budyko model has also been extended to evaluate the effect of snow melting on watershed water balances wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 using the budyko framework the water resource changes in the upper region of the yarlung zangbo river basin was found to be dominated by the snowmelt runoff increase and the underlying surface changes which accounted for 49 18 and 59 61 respectively to the increase of runoff xin et al 2021 human activities exerted great impacts in some areas of hma e g in the amu darya river basin which originates from the tienshan and pamir alai mountains hu et al 2021 the impacts of human activities in this basin exceeded 100 from 1960 to 2017 compared to the 14 25 to 5 43 impact of climate change to the decrease in runoff hu et al 2021 despite the above mentioned progress the characterization of the water balance of the tienshan mountains is still difficult due to the uncertainty in the estimation of evapotranspiration et and snow ice melt et is a major term in the water balance and affects streamflow strongly in arid regions however it was not explicitly estimated in most of the previous studies wang et al 2018 xin et al 2021 moreover snowmelt is elevation dependent because snowfall and the air temperature are highly elevation dependent however snowmelt is usually not explicitly considered hu et al 2021 li et al 2016b in previous studies in this paper we study the long term water balance in two contrasting watersheds in the center and the northern slope of the tienshan mountains i e the kashi watershed with a large 0 5 runoff coefficient and higher elevation 2309 m on average in the upstream of the yili valley and the boertala watershed with a small 0 2 runoff coefficient and lower elevation 1993 m on average in the ebinur lake basin to estimate the long term snow ice melt we used a state of art global snow cover product hori et al 2017 in this study we used a complementary relationship model brutsaert 2015 that has been tested at global scales recently gan et al 2021a to estimate the regional distribution in et the purpose of this paper is threefold 1 analyze the long term 1982 2014 trend of streamflow and detect change points in streamflow in the study watersheds 2 analyze the long term changes in snow ice melt and et at different elevation ranges and quantify their impacts on water balances 3 quantify the contributions of climate change and human activities to the long term changes in streamflow in the study watersheds 2 study area and data 2 1 topography of the study watersheds we study the kashi river basin in the upper reaches of the yili river valley and the boertala river basin in the ebinur lake basin fig 1 digital elevation data with a resolution of 90 m from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 were used to extract river networks and delineate watershed extent fig 1 the elevation ranges from 874 m to 4274 m and from 500 to 3943 m respectively in the kashi river and the boertala river basins the hydrological process of the mountainous areas is elevation dependent therefore we divided each study watershed into 3 zones 1 zone 1 dem 1500 m 2 zone 2 1500 m dem 2500 m and 3 zone 3 dem 2500 m the ratios of grids that fall into zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 are 22 39 and 39 respectively in the kashi river basin and 38 31 and 31 in the boertala river basin 2 2 data description and processing 2 2 1 in situ precipitation and runoff data daily measurements of precipitation at 12 in situ meteorological sites fig 1 were obtained in this study https data cma cn annual runoff data at the tuohai station in the kashi river basin and bole station in the boertala river basin were used information of all in situ sites was summarized in table 1 2 2 2 regional meteorological forcing to estimate the spatial distribution of et and snow ice melt we need grided meteorological forcing data including the incoming shortwave radiation rs incoming longwave radiation rl air temperature ta air humidity relative humidity rh wind speed u and precipitation p in this study we used a newly released dataset the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 for regional climate forcing which is at the spatial resolution of 0 1 and temporal resolution of hourly daily and monthly the cmfd used remote sensing dataset such as the trmm satellite precipitation analysis data 3b42 and reanalysis dataset such as the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 forcing data as the backbone and merged them with weather station observation data from the china meteorological administration he et al 2020 as wang et al 2016 showed the gldas 1 version 1 precipitation data has a discontinuity problem and the gldas 2 version 2 precipitation data has relatively large mean absolute errors therefore we further corrected the precipitation data of cmfd using the in situ precipitation through the method of he et al 2020 2 2 3 snow ice cover data long term snow cover datasets at fine spatial and temporal resolutions are available in recent years hori et al 2017 muhammad and thapa 2020 peters et al 2015 in this study we used a state of art global snow cover product i e the jasmes product hori et al 2017 https kuroshio eorc jaxa jp jasmes to estimate the long term snow ice melt in our study area the jasmes product 1978 2015 was derived using the avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer data from the noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration satellite during the 1978 2001 period and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data from the terra and aqua satellites during the 2000 2015 period the accuracy of the jasmes product is higher than the snow cover product from the noaa climate data record hori et al 2017 the spatial resolution of the product is 0 05 and the temporal resolution is daily weekly and half monthly to estimate monthly snowmelt we used the half monthly product to determine the snow cover frequency scf at each month i e the temporal ratio of snow cover within a month for example if snow ice is detected in 12 days within 30 days the scf is 40 2 2 4 albedo albedo is a key property of land surface in governing the radiation balance of the land we used the 8 day 0 05 resolution albedo data from the global land surface satellite glass products http www geodata cn liu et al 2013a qu et al 2014 in this study the glass albedo product is a long term 1981 2015 continuous and gapless dataset liu et al 2013a which was produced using the noaa avhrr data for the 1981 1999 period and the modis data for the 2000 2015 period the accuracy of the glass albedo product is found similar to that of the widely acknowledged modis mcd43 product liu et al 2013b however the glass albedo dataset covers a much longer period 1981 2015 than the modis product 2 2 5 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to indicate the long term vegetative fraction of the study area we used the global inventory modeling and mapping studies normalized difference vegetation index version 3 gimms ndvi3g datasets pinzon and tucker 2014 https glam1 gsfc nasa gov in this study also ndvi was used to estimate the land surface emissivity as shown in section 3 2 this ndvi dataset covers the period of 1982 2015 and has a half month interval and spatial resolution of approximately 0 08 the ndvi data were resampled to a 0 05 scale all gridded data including atmospheric forcing albedo ndvi and snow cover frequency were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 05 and a temporal resolution of a month 3 methods 3 1 degree day method for estimating melt from snow ice melt from snow or ice is usually estimated using energy balance models or the degree day melting models hock 2003 that only require air temperature despite its empirical origin and simple model structure the degree day method has been proved as accurate as of the physically based models because snow ice melt is mainly driven by longwave radiation and sensible heat flux which is highly dependent on air temperature the basic form of the degree day model is shown in equation 1 the water equivalence of snow ice melt for a snow covered or ice covered surface during a period of n days is estimated by the product of a degree day factor d mm day and the accumulated air temperature when the air temperature is higher than the temperature threshold tr tr is usually taken as 0 1 melt i n d t i t r i f t i t r worth noting at a monthly time scale because snow may not be available every day of a month monthly snowmelt here is estimated by scaling equation 1 by multiplying the temporal frequency scf of the corresponding month scf is retrieved from the jasmes snow cover product the degree day factor varies significantly across space and time it depends on many factors such as the density of the snow ice and the characteristic of the underlying surface most of the values of the degree day factor reported from the in situ measurements fall into a wide range of 2 5 14 mm day kayastha et al 2003 xu et al 2017 in this study we estimated the degree day factor and therefore the snowmelt of each watershed by forcing closure of the decadal basin scale water balance as shown in section 3 3 3 2 complementary relationship model for estimating et evapotranspiration et is a major consumption term of water for arid regions as a complicated land surface process et is controlled by the interaction among the atmospheric condition net radiation and vegetation growth at the land surface at the diurnal bu et al 2021 gan and gao 2015 gan et al 2019 gao et al 2016 and daily gan et al 2021c time scales however at a monthly scale et can be estimated using emergent methods that do not need detailed parameterizations of the land surface among the emergent methods the complementary relationship bouchet 1963 models provide a simple but sound framework in estimating et using only routine meteorological data ma et al 2019 wang et al 2020 we used a recently proposed generalized complementary relationship gcr model brutsaert 2015 to estimate monthly et in this study the gcr model estimates et as follows 2 e t a e t po e r pa 2 2 e t pa e t po where etpo is the potential evaporation estimated using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 as shown in equation 3 etpo refers to the evaporation rate of a large uniform saturated surface etpa is the apparent potential evaporation estimated using the penman equation penman 1948 as shown in equation 4 etpa refers to the evaporation rate of a small saturated surface that is surrounded by a non saturated environment 3 e t po α e δ δ γ r n g 4 e t pa δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ f u 2 v p d where rn and g are the net radiation w m2 and soil heat flux w m2 respectively rn was estimated as rn 1 α rs εs rl rl where α is the albedo that is retrieved from the glass albedo product rs and rl are the incoming shortwave and longwave radiation w m2 respectively which are derived from the cmfd rl is the outgoing longwave radiation which is estimated as rl σεs ts 4 ts is approximated by ta εs is the land surface emissivity which is estimated using ndvi valor and caselles 1996 and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 wm 2k 4 due to the large albedo of snow and the fact that land surface emissivity is usually larger than that of the air the net radiation of land surface in many snow covered pixels may be smaller than zero currently the mechanism of evaporation under negative rn conditions is not fully understood in this paper et was therefore set as 0 when rn is smaller than 0 δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure to the air temperature hpa k γ is the psychrometric constant hpa k and vpd is the vapor pressure deficit hpa the wind function f u2 in equation 4 is formulated as f u2 7 43 1 0 54u2 in units of w m2 shuttleworth 1993 where u2 is the wind speed m s at the height of 2 m αe is the sole paramter of the gcr model note that although the pt coefficient of the saturated surfaces is widely accepted as 1 26 on average assouline et al 2016 gan and liu 2020 gan et al 2020 also it is related to special humidity and air temperature in theory liu and yang 2021 the parameter αe in the gcr model is just a weak analog to the priestley taylor pt coefficient priestley and taylor 1972 αe is usually smaller than 1 26 and exhibits substantial variations temporally and spatially gan et al 2021a yang et al 2009 studies have found that αe is negatively related to the climate index ai defined as the ratio between the annual etpa and the precipitation in china liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and across the globe gan et al 2021a we run the gcr model at the monthly scales in this study with αe determined as αe 1 024ai 0 164 gan et al 2021a for more details about the gcr model please refer to the works of brutsaert 2015 and gan et al 2021a 2019b 3 3 closing the water balance the water balance of a watershed can be written as in equation 5 where precipitation p is balanced by runoff r et and water storage δs which is mainly consisted of changes in the groundwater and the water stored in the soil layers 5 p r e t δ s precipitation includes both rainfall and snowfall precipitation in the form of snowfall in the mountainous areas is expected to be underestimated in our study area because most of the precipitation gauges locate in the relatively low elevation regions table 1 where precipitation is usually lower than that at higher elevations for example in the kashi watershed although the precipitation field from cmfd was corrected using gauge data the multi year mean r is close to p as shown in table 2 indicating that p was underestimated to close the water balance we used snow ice melt from the degree day method to approximate the input of snowfall as shown in equation 1 we rearranged the water balance equation as follows equation 6 the total water input to a watershed i e pe which was termed as the effective precipitation is consisted of rainfall rain and snow ice melt melt where rain refers to the precipitation when the air temperature is higher than 0 rain is derived from the gauge corrected cmfd 6 p e r a i n m e l t r e t δ s at a decadal time scale δs is approximated as 0 et is estimated as in section 3 2 therefore the degree day factor is tuned to minimize the residue term rain melt r et in equation 6 3 4 trend detection and change point detection the mann kendall mk method kendall 1948 mann 1945 which has been recommended by the world meteorological organization in trend analysis was used to detect trends and change points in the time series of runoff in this study unlike the parametric trend tests that usually assume normal distribution in the data the mk method detects trends only based on the ranks of the observations due to such distribution free advantage the mk method has been widely used in hydrological applications ahmad et al 2015 hamed 2008 in which the distribution in precipitation and runoff are usually skewed we first used the mk method to determine the change points in the runoff time series and then divided the runoff data into two periods i e the pre change period and the after change period 3 5 separating the contribution of climate change and human activities using the budyko framework the change in the runoff δr between the pre change period and the after change period can be separated into the contribution from climate change δrc and that from human activities δrh based on the elasticity method dooge et al 1999 the contribution of factor x e g the precipitation p to δr can be approximated as the product of δx the difference in x between the two periods and the sensitivity coefficient of x to r in this study the sensitivity coefficient of climate change and human activities were analytically solved based on a budyko type equation i e the choudhury yang model choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 as shown in equation 7 where precipitation in the original formula is surrogated by the effective precipitation defined above there is only one parameter in the choudhury yang equation i e n which comprehensively reflects the control of the underlying surface on the allocation of the effective precipitation into runoff and et the contribution of δn can be viewed as the impacts of underlying surface changes that are due to human activities 7 et p e 1 1 p e e t 0 n 1 n the sensitivity coefficients of et to rain melt et0 and n are expressed as in the following equations 8a 8d therefore δr can be partitioned into the contribution from the changes in rain melt et0 and n as shown in equation 9 for more details of the budyko type models please refer

in annual runoff the annual runoff at the tuohai station and the bole station was shown in fig 2 as indicated by the mk test runoff at the tuohai station showed a significant α 0 05 increasing trend in 1982 2014 at a rate of 31 2 mm per decade runoff at the bole station also showed a significant α 0 01 increasing trend at a much lower rate of 5 1 mm per decade the mk test has detected two change points in the time series of runoff at the tuohai station in 1988 and 1993 runoff increased from 1982 to 1987 and decreased during the 1988 1992 period and then exhibited an increasing trend since 1993 in contrast there is only one change point in the time series at the bole station therefore we divided the runoff data at the bole station into two periods i e the pre change period 1982 1997 and the after change period 1998 2014 the tuohai data was also divided into two periods i e 1982 1992 and 1993 2014 as shown in fig 2 4 2 estimation of monthly et and snow ice melt to close the annual water balance and explain decadal changes in the runoff in the two study watersheds we first estimated monthly et and snow ice melt using remote sensing data and then upscale them to an annual scale mean monthly et was 30 9 mm month and 27 8 mm month during 1982 2014 in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively et exhibited smooth seasonal variations in both watersheds fig 3 from november to february due to the high snow cover fig s1 net radiation was small because the snow cover reflects most of the incoming solar radiation with the highest albedo reaching over 0 80 fig s2 therefore et was close to 0 from november to february because of the small net radiation and the low air temperature the monthly et was largest in july in both watersheds with the peak values in all years ranging from 80 to 115 mm month and 60 105 mm month in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively fig 3 due to low air temperature snow ice melt was quite small from december to february fig 4 although snow cover frequency was highest in winter which was higher than 90 in most grids in both watersheds as shown in fig s1 snow ice cover extent and frequency decreased quickly from march and reached their minimum in july or august fig s1 correspondingly snow ice melt began to increase rapidly since march figs 3 and 4 for example most of the grids are contributing snow ice melt in april in the kashi watershed and only the grids that are at relatively high altitudes were contributing meltwater in july and august similarly snow in grids that are at relatively low altitudes began to melt in march in the boertala watershed and only the grids that are at relatively high altitudes were contributing meltwater in august in august meltwater from the grids with snow ice cover was 84 2 mm month and 31 7 mm month on average in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively at the watershed scale compared to et the monthly snow ice melt exhibited much larger seasonal variations with two peaks throughout the year fig 3 snow ice melt at the watershed scale reached its first peak in april or may and then drops to low values in july and august although a small fraction of grids with high snow ice coverage at the high altitude can contribute to melting water of 1000 mm month fig 4 snow ice melt reached its second peak in september or october fig 3 4 3 annual water balance and the attribution of decadal changes in runoff with et and snow ice melt determined annual water balances in both watersheds are shown in fig 5 after considering the term of snow ice melt the effective precipitation rain melt is much larger than precipitation that was derived from the cmfd and in situ datasets in the kashi watershed although the increase of the effective precipitation was generally consistent with that of the precipitation table 2 the multi year averaged snow ice melt was 614 5 mm year and 239 8 mm year in the kashi and boertala watersheds respectively compared to the 214 3 mm year and 163 7 mm year rainfall respectively in these two watersheds snow ice melt make a great contribution to annual runoff in the kashi watershed for example rainfall and the original precipitation in 2010 was not the largest in all years fig 5a however the runoff peaked in 2010 fig 5b because the largest snow ice melt occurred in 2010 at the decadal time scale compared to period 1 multi year runoff and et in period 2 increased 87 2 mm and 32 3 mm respectively in the kashi watershed correspondingly compared to period 1 rainfall and snow ice melt in period 2 increased 61 6 mm and 57 3 mm respectively and the potential evaporation et0 increased 47 3 mm the n value of a period was calculated by inverting the choudhury yang equation with the mean runoff p et0 in the corresponding period the values of n were 0 902 and 0 883 in period 1 and period 2 respectively in the kashi watershed and the values of n were 1 274 and 1 418 in period 1 and period 2 respectively in the boertala watershed the contribution of each factor rainfall snow ice melt potential evaporation and human activity to the total change in runoff was determined using the elastic method as shown in table 2 sensitivity coefficients of rainfall snow ice melt et0 and n were obtained through equation 8 the impact of snow ice melt was close to that of rainfall in the kashi watershed the increase in rainfall and snow ice melt contributed the most to the total increase 87 2 mm in the runoff i e 47 1 mm and 43 8 mm respectively in contrast the increase of et0 caused a decrease in the runoff at the magnitude of 10 7 mm compared to the natural causes rainfall snow ice melt and potential evaporation the impacts of human activities only contributed 6 6 to the total change in runoff in the kashi watershed in the boertala watershed compared to period 1 the multi year runoff increased 13 9 mm whereas the multi year et increased 64 0 mm in period 2 correspondingly compared to period 1 rainfall and snow ice melt in period 2 increased 62 5 mm and 13 6 mm respectively and the et0 decreased 15 0 mm the elastic method shows that the increase in rainfall has dominated the increase in the runoff table 2 causing an increase of 21 5 mm in the runoff which was much larger than the contribution of snow ice melt 4 7 mm and et0 0 9 mm unlike the kashi watershed human activities have significant negative impacts on decadal runoff causing a decrease of 13 8 mm in the multi year runoff which was close to the increase 13 9 mm of multi year runoff table 2 due to the huge negative impacts of n runoff in the boertala was even decreasing since 2004 although rainfall and snow ice melt have been increasing since 2004 fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 closing decadal water balance and uncertainty analysis precipitation in the mountainous area is usually difficult to estimate due to the scarcity of precipitation gauges and the high heterogeneity of precipitation in both horizontal and vertical directions in our study area precipitation gauges are located in relatively low altitudes 2500 m which may result in the underestimation of regional precipitation because precipitation in the high altitudes is expected to be underestimated for example the multi year 1982 2014 average precipitation that was derived from the gauge corrected cmfd in the kashi watershed is 398 3 mm which is underestimated because it is even smaller than the multi year averaged runoff 456 3 mm compared to the kashi watershed the elevation of the boertala watershed is lower 1993 m v s 2309 m on average therefore the sum of runoff and et was close to the precipitation that was derived from the gauge corrected cmfd in the boertala watershed and the difference between precipitation and effective precipitation was smaller in the boertala watershed compared to that in the kashi watershed table 2 in this study to close the water balance we estimated the long term regional et using a generalized complementary relationship gcr model brutsaert 2015 that only requires routine meteorological measurements after relating its sole parameter αe with the climate index the gcr model has been successfully applied in china liu et al 2016 liu et al 2018 and across the globe gan et al 2021a our estimation of et is consistent with other studies that derived et using remote sensing models for example based on the modis et product mod16a2 mu et al 2011 yan et al 2019 reported that the multi year average of grassland et was 395 mm year for the yili river valley in 2001 2015 which is close to our estimation table 2 wei 2015 estimated et distribution of the boertala watershed from april to october in 2013 using the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998 with modis and landsat 8 data and found that et in most of the areas was lower than 0 5 mm day in april and larger than 2 mm day in july which was consistent with our estimates fig 4 also because the water imbalance of the boertala watershed was relatively small and because the runoff only takes up a small proportion of the precipitation which implies that most of the precipitation is consumed by et we can deduce that the magnitude of the estimated et 330 mm year on average is quite reasonable for this watershed with et determined we then closed the decadal water balance table 2 by estimating snow ice melt based on the degree day method and the observation of snow ice cover from remote sensing products the degree day factor was calibrated as 16 04 mm day and 13 1 mm day in the two periods respectively in the kashi watershed and calibrated as 7 5 mm day and 5 8 mm day in the two periods respectively in the boertala watershed the residue of annual water balance i e rain melt runoff et was close to 0 mm on average in each period in both watersheds table 2 the effective precipitation is highly correlated with the sum of runoff and et fig s3 when compared to the sum of runoff and et rmse in effective precipitation was 171 1 mm and 222 6 mm in the two periods respectively in the kashi watershed and was 90 6 mm and 77 7 mm in the two periods respectively in the boertala watershed fig s3 at the annual scales the imbalance between rain melt and runoff et existed due to water storage terms such as the groundwater and the water stored in the soil layers worth noting the degree day factor was expected to be elevation dependent therefore different values are suggested to be taken for different dem zones in the snowmelt runoff models for example in the srm model martinec and rango 1986 also the degree day factor is expected to be different for snow and ice where the values for ice are usually much larger than the former armstrong et al 2019 in this study we do not have enough data to calibrate the degree day factor in each dem zone or discriminate the values of snow from ice however the degree day factors in our study area generally fell into the ranges from other similar studies for example xu et al 2017 found that the degree day factor ranged from 3 6 mm day to 13 0 mm day at the southern slope of the tienshan mountains kayastha et al 2003 reported that the degree day factor ranged from 5 5 mm day to 14 2 mm day in the glacier in central nepal and the qinghai tibetan plateau note that the calibrated degree day factor in period 1 in the kashi watershed was a little larger than the reported maximum value at the southern slope of the tienshan mountains xu et al 2017 to further discuss the validity of the snowmelt estimates we compared our results with the in situ measurements of snowmelt in a small watershed that is also located in the upper reaches of the yili river valley hanati et al 2019 hanati et al 2019 reported that snow in the upper reach of the yili river valley began to melt at a temperature far below the 0 threshold for example on sunny days snow even began to melt when the air temperature was higher than 12 therefore it is expected that if the air temperature threshold was set as 0 as in the case of our study a relatively large degree day factor would be resulted because the effect of solar radiation in melting snow was not considered it is difficult to determine the intra annual variations in the effective values of the air temperature threshold and the degree day factor due to such an uncertainty we recognized that uncertainty may exist in seasonal modeling of snow ice melt however we argue that the snow ice melt estimates at the annual scales are reasonable by forcing the clousure of decadal water balances for example in situ measurements in the upper reaches of the yili river valley hanati et al 2019 showed that the annual rainfall and snowfall were 130 mm and 900 mm respectively hanati et al 2019 in which the ratio of snow 79 6 to the total precipitation is close to our result 74 1 in the kashi watershed and the total amount of precipitation is close to our estimation of effective precipitation in the kashi watershed 828 8 mm year on average 5 2 the impacts of et and snow ice melt on decadal water balance the estimation of et proves to be useful in explaining the decadal changes in the runoff for example the runoff of the boertala watershed only increased 13 9 mm between the two periods although the increase of precipitation in the boertala watershed 103 4 mm is comparable to that of the kashi watershed 118 3 mm such a result can be partly explained by the result that most of the increase in precipitation is converted into et because unlike the kashi watershed et0 in the boertala watershed decreased which indicates an additional increase in et at given conditions according to the complementary relationship meltwater from snow and ice has been shown as a major water source for mountainous areas in asia for example snowmelt and ice melt contributed to 35 and 10 respectively to the streamflow of the sutlej valley western himalaya wulf et al 2016 armstrong et al 2019 quantified the meltwater sources in river flow in 5 major river basins in the hma and found that snowmelt and ice melt contribute to 48 to the runoff in the ganges river basin and over 70 in the syr darya amu darya indus and brahmaputra river basins in comparison meltwater from snow and ice contributed to 74 1 and 59 4 to the effective precipitation in kashi and boertala watersheds respectively which is consistent with the above mentioned studies in the hma studies have found that the ratio between snowfall and the total precipitation denoted as rs has huge impacts on the annual average berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 and inter annual variability liu et al 2022 in the runoff as the climate continues to be warmer less precipitation will fall as snow reducing rs which will pose serious challenges to the water resources for the snow dependent watersheds rs in our study watersheds are quite different from each other i e 0 74 in the kashi watershed which is larger than the value of 0 59 in the boertala watershed correspondingly the runoff coefficient r p is much larger in the kashi watershed than that in the boertala watershed 0 55 v s 0 17 as shown in table 3 which is consistent with the discovery of previous studies that the annual mean runoff is larger with larger rs berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 moreover the inter annual variability in the runoff which is normalized by the variability in precipitation σp denoted as σr σp was found to be larger with larger rs in the two study watersheds table 3 σr σp in the kashi watershed is 0 39 which is much larger than the value of 0 11 in the boertala watershed indicating that inter annual variability in runoff would be larger if more precipitation is consisted of snow which is consistent with the discovery of liu et al 2022 snow cover has a huge impact on the available energy of the land surface the albedo of snow cover 0 8 is significantly larger than the non snow covered land 0 2 as shown in fig s2 indicating that the snow covered land reflected most of the solar radiation resulting in low values of net radiation and therefore low values of available energy and potential et in our paper we have considered such an effect by incorporating remotely sensed albedo the glass albedo product in estimating the net radiation of the land surface moreover available energy of land surface and therefore the potential et may be further reduced due to the snow cover because the warming of the snow before it is melted or evaporated will consume a certain amount of energy rm as highlighted by the work of zhang et al 2015 the impact of rm on the potential et can be accounted for using the following equation where l is the latent heat of evaporation 10 e t 0 e e t 0 r m l e t 0 0 14 r s p when applying equation 7 to decompose the variation in the runoff the effect of rm on et0 was considered as shown in table 4 et0 in the kashi watershed was reduced to 684 6 mm and 723 8 mm in period 1 and period 2 respectively compared to the values of 765 2 mm and 812 5 mm before correction et0 in the boertala watershed was reduced to 1001 2 mm and 984 1 mm in period 1 and period 2 respectively compared to the values of 1033 8 mm and 1018 6 mm before correction the contributions of each factor to the decadal changes in runoff were shown in table 4 results are similar to those in table 2 indicating that rm only poses a marginal impact on decadal runoff 5 3 impacts of environmental factors at different elevations on runoff environmental factors such as air temperature precipitation vegetation coverage etc and their trends are elevation dependent therefore how environmental factors at different elevations impact the decadal runoff needs to be analyzed rainfall at higher elevations is increasing faster than that in lower elevation areas in both the kashi and boertala watersheds for example precipitation in the form of rainfall increased at rates of 2 93 mm year and 2 46 mm year in dem zones 2 and 3 respectively nearly twice the increase rate 1 52 mm year of rainfall in dem zone 1 of the kashi watershed similarly rainfall in the boertala watershed increased at rates larger than 3 0 mm year in dem zones 2 and 3 much larger than that in dem zone 1 which was 1 63 mm year our result is consistent with the report of li et al 2013 that precipitation in the mountainous area increased at a much faster rate than that in the oasis zones in the arid region of northwest china unlike rainfall snow ice melt showed a decreasing trend in dem zone 1 in both watersheds fig 6 c d although the air temperature was increasing fig s4 which was probably due to the decreasing of snow cover frequency in both watersheds fig s4 snow ice melt in regions higher than 2500 m dme zone 3 increased significantly i e 12 29 mm year and 9 03 mm year respectively in the kashi and boertala watersheds because both the snow cover frequency and the air temperature increased in dem zone 3 fig s4 although the elevation of most of the study area over 95 is lower than the snowline 3700 mm the ice is an important source for melting water especially in july and august fig 4 snow cover frequency was relatively stable for the area above 3700 m in both watersheds fig s5 however the melting water in the boertala watershed showed an increasing trend indicating that ice in this area may be shrinking under the climate warming condition it can be concluded that most of the increase in the decadal runoff comes from the increase in effective precipitation in the high elevation regions et increased at a much faster rate in the boertala watershed than that in the kashi watershed fig 6 as indicated in the last section the increase in et consumed most of the increase in rainfall and snow ice melt in the boertala watershed especially in dem zone 1 where et increased at a fast rate as high as 5 06 mm year as reported by wang et al 2017 farmland most of which locates in the low elevation regions increased at least three times during the 1960 2010 period in the ebinur lake watershed the increase of farmland area is an important factor for explaining the fast increasing rate of et in the low elevation regions in the boertala watershed vegetation coverage as indicated by ndvi increased with the fastest rate in dem zone 1 than that in higher regions in the boertala watershed fig s4 which is consistent with the fastest increasing rate in et in dem zone 1 in comparison ndvi showed a decreasing trend in dem zones 1 and 2 in the kashi watershed fig s4 which is probably due to overgrazing as reported by yan et al 2018 such a result helps to explain that the increase of et in the kashi watershed is only half of that in the boertala watershed table 2 although the increase rate in air temperature and precipitation was comparable in these two watersheds our study shows that the inclusion of actual evapotranspiration in different elevation ranges other than only potential evaporation plays a key role in explaining decadal changes in runoff 6 conclusion closing water balances is usually difficult because of the uncertainty in precipitation in mountainous areas our study demonstrated that decadal water balances in two contrasting watersheds i e the humid kashi watershed in the upstream of the yili river valley and the arid boertala watershed in the ebinur lake basin in the tienshan mountains can be closed when the actual evapotranspiration and snow ice melt were derived from remote sensing models et was derived from a complementary relationship model that combined with remotely sensed albedo and ndvi snow ice melt was derived from the degree day method with a remotely sensed snow ice coverage dataset our study shows that the changes in snow ice melt and et are keys to explaining decadal changes in runoff in both watersheds the much larger increasing rate of snow ice melt at higher elevation regions than that at lower elevation regions is the major contributor for the increase of runoff in contrast the much larger increasing rate of et at lower elevation regions than that at lower elevation regions is the major reason for the decreasing of runoff credit authorship contribution statement guojing gan conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft jinglu wu

3272,snow and ice melted water flow over thawed soil cause severe soil erosion the application of straw mulch has long been considered as an effective measure to reduce soil erosion but the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on thawed soil erosion remain uncertain this study conducted detailed laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on soil erosion and sediment transport of thawed soil the median particle size d50 of transported sediment flow velocity and sediment concentration for thawed soil were compared with that of unfrozen and frozen soil models based on random forest rf support vector machine svm back propagation neural network bp and stepwise regression sr were implemented to simulate the key parameters of thawed soil erosion and the accuracy of the developed models was evaluated the results showed that the sediment yield increased significantly in thawed soil compared with that in unfrozen soil the maximum flow velocity over thawed soil decreased by 20 7 compared with that over frozen soil the d50 of transported sediment decreased by 29 4 after the soil suffered the effects of freeze thaw and the finer sizes were more likely to be entrained the straw mulch effectively reduced the d50 of transported sediment flow velocity and sediment concentration in addition the rf model showed a better result to predict the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of transported sediment nse 0 849 rrmse 0 493 than the bp svm and sr models comparing the performance of the rf model with the models reported in previous studies the rf model showed the best performance in general the results of this study provide important information for soil erosion in thawed soil keywords thawed soil straw mulch flow velocity sediment concentration median particle size random forest 1 introduction soil erosion causes land degradation and further threatens the sustainable development of the environment under global warming wang et al 2020 rickson 2014 global temperatures have already risen by about 1 c since the beginning of the 20th century and are almost certain to rise another 0 5 to 1 0 c by 2050 even under highly ambitious climate mitigation scenarios ippc 2021 ipcc 2019 the increased temperature results in the melting of snow and ice and more frequent freeze thaw cycles groffman et al 2011 freppaz et al 2010 wang et al 2020 reported that the thawed soil strata are highly susceptible to meltwater erosion these melted strata usually produce abundant runoff from glacial meltwater runoff or snowmelt li and fan 2014 which can cause a further increase in soil erosion risk in cold regions ban et al 2017a 2017b 2017c zeng et al 2013 wang et al 2012 harris 2010 therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of thawed soil erosion and identify the key factors for soil erosion and develop suitable soil erosion models returning crop straws to the field is an effective way for resource utilization of crop residues liu et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that the straw returning can improve soil quality yin et al 2018 wakindiki and danga 2011 soil erosion and hydrological of sloping farmland liu et al 2019 rahma et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2015 shen et al 2012 for example mandal et al 2004 reported that returning crop straws to the field can improve soil bulk density hydraulic conductivity temperature moisture and aggregate formation omidvar et al 2019 and rahma et al 2013 found that straw mulching significantly reduces flow velocity liu et al 2020 suggested that straw incorporation into the soil can reduce flow velocity rainfall and runoff erosivity although the advantageous effects of the straw returning are known further work is needed to quantify these effects on thawed soil rainfall simulation and water scouring are essential methods to study hillslope erosion in laboratory and field conditions lin et al 2022 polyakov et al 2020 wang et al 2018 2019a zhang et al 2020 previous studies suggested that the flow velocity sediment concentration and median particle diameter d50 of transported sediment are important parameters since they are not only directly related to soil detachment sediment transport and deposition zhuang et al 2018 yang et al 2018a 2018b rahma et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 but also the basis for establishing soil erosion models for example the shear stress flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration are the key parameters in the water erosion prediction project wepp european soil erosion model eurosem and hairsine rose hr model hairsine and rose 1992b wagenbrenner et al 2010 foster et al 1984 govers et al 1990 hairsine and rose 1991 hairsine and rose 1992a nearing et al 1989 accurately obtaining hydraulic parameters unit stream power shear stress and flow velocity and soil loss parameters d50 sediment concentration and sediment load is a crucial prerequisite for applying these models however the freezing and thawing processes are complex and usually lead to changes in soil structure cheng et al 2021 cruse et al 2001 edwards 2013 edwards and burney 1991 1992 wang et al 2020 which then affect the process of soil erosion frame et al 1992 furthermore straw mulch increases the hydraulic roughness of the thawed soil surface thereby affecting flow velocity liu et al 2020 which makes it difficult to predict these parameters accurately in thawed soil liu et al 2016 therefore additional detailed studies are necessary on the key parameters e g sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of thawed soil erosion with different straw management practices straw mulching and straw incorporation modeling is an important method of soil erosion parameters estimation and the selection of a prediction model may largely affect the results zhao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 several studies have developed empirical models to predict sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 wang et al 2019a b yang et al 2018a liu et al 2017 ban et al 2020 ban et al 2017a 2016 however soil erosion caused by rainfall events is random and complex guo et al 2010 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 soil erosion is a dynamic and intricate process zhang et al 2008 yang et al 2018a involving soil detachment sediment transport and deposition yang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2018 zhang and wang 2017 rahma et al 2013 among these soil loss parameters d50 sediment concentration and flow velocity are the crucial parameters throughout the whole soil erosion process and play an essential role in soil erosion research the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 determine how much the eroded sediments were transported and deposited on the hillslope especially at the end of the rill yang et al 2018a these parameters usually have a certain degree of nonlinear features due to the dynamic and intricate soil erosion process zhang et al 2019 jiménez hornero et al 2005 the traditional regression models were commonly used to predict soil erosion parameters in previous studies ban et al 2017a 2016 zhang et al 2018 however traditional soil erosion models require different types of input variables and an understanding of the mechanisms of erosion intensity levels in addition the linear regression model assumes that the relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear zhao et al 2019 were et al 2015 which may reduce the applicability and prediction accuracy of the model therefore the traditional models based on linear regression cannot sufficiently describe the soil erosion process in recent years a growing interest in models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence e g breiman 2001 as an alternative to statistical modeling in the areas of soil and ecology harrison et al 2020 hengl et al 2015 by comparison machine learning and artificial intelligence models usually allow predictions by easily accessible variables and these models usually have higher prediction accuracy than the traditional regression model chen et al 2018 li et al 2021 machine learning and artificial intelligence models avoid overfitting and can depict nonlinear features which makes these models usually show better prediction accuracy and applicability than traditional regression models srinet et al 2019 deiss et al 2020 li et al 2021 busch et al 2021 several researchers have been developed models using machine learning techniques in the areas of soil and ecology harrison et al 2020 these machine learning tools include artificial neural networks ann ebteha 2013 feng et al 2018 kim and gilley 2008 maier et al 2010 support vector machines svm guevara et al 2018 were et al 2015 quantile regression forests qrr meinshausen 2006 extreme gradient boosting egb chen et al 2015 and random forest rf montes et al 2021 breiman 2001 several studies have reported that neural network models can directly predict soil properties and show high accuracy including for the spatial distribution of nutrients environmental factors physical properties gully erosion intensity and soil management hao et al 2021 li et al 2016 halecki et al 2017 rahmati et al 2017 the back propagation bp neural network is one of the most effective for such analyses feng et al 2018 kim and gilley 2008 svm is a supervised statistical machine learning technique deiss et al 2020 vapnik 1999 which achieves a sufficient balance between the prediction ability and the generalization ability of the model deiss et al 2020 ghorbanzadeh 2020 furthermore the rf is an ensemble model based on the regression tree rt algorithm breiman 2001 which can improve prediction accuracy and address the issues of model overfitting montes et al 2021 several scholars suggested that the rf model had high accuracy in the researches of soil science arabameri et al 2019a arabameri et al 2019b arabameri et al 2018 such as simulation of soil infiltration pahlavan rad et al 2020 sihang et al 2019 digital

nonlinearity of the soil erosion process wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 selecting an inappropriate model may cause a sizeable error in soil erosion research due to the advantages of the interpretability of the results as well as its good characteristics nonlinear features and easy application montes et al 2021 the rf bp and svm models appear to have the potential of the optimal model was implemented to simulate soil loss and flow velocity therefore the main goals of this study were i to evaluate the performance of sediment transport on thawed soil with straw mulching and straw incorporation ii to evaluate the performance of soil erosion and sediment transport over frozen nonfrozen and thawed black soil slopes iii to develop new models for simulating the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of transported sediment for thawed soil with straw mulching and straw incorporation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental equipment system consists of a peristaltic pump as well as water supply pipes experimental flumes and buckets the flow was supplied and controlled by a three channel peristaltic pump 2 l min 1 the three channel peristaltic pump was tuned for each run to achieve the designed flow discharge the flow rate in the flume outlet was measured during each experiment the experimental flume segments were composed of three flumes that were 1 m long 0 2 m wide and 0 15 m high fig 1 there are several drainage holes at the bottom of each flume allowing excess water to drain out each experiment was carried out simultaneously in three flumes so that each trial could be repeated three times the soil samples were collected from abandoned farmland in yichun 129 00 e 47 59 n located in heilongjiang province china the region has typical freeze thaw black soil which was subjected to erosion by rain generating runoff and snow melting chen et al 2021 the bulk density of the undisturbed soil in the field ranges from 1 1 to 1 3 g cm 3 the sampling depth was approximately 0 2 m and the physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 referring to the previous study chen et al 2021 2017 gao et al 2018 the soil samples were air dried 10 gravimetric moisture content and passed through a 10 mm sieve to remove plant residuals and stones and then packed uniformly into the experimental flume in two continuous 0 05 m thick layers to obtain a bulk density of 1 2 g cm 3 after the soil samples were packed in the flumes the packed soil was saturated 34 gravimetric moisture content and allowed to equilibrate for 12 h before each experimental run then the soil filled flumes were placed in a temperature adjustable facility at a temperature between 15 c and 20 c for more than 24 h the soil filled flumes were removed from the temperature adjustable facility when the soil and water were completely frozen and placed on a platform to thaw at room temperature about 10 c to 15 c in addition the thawed depth of the frozen soil was continuously measured with needles to check on the thawed depth reached soil should be completely thawed 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments involved four mulch cover rates 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 and four straw incorporation rates 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 for thawed soil to simulate the process of thawed soil erosion of straw returning in early spring the straw was collected from the cornfield the corn straw was air dried and cut into sections with a length of about 5 cm to simulate the situations in the field of straw returning for the treatment of straw mulch the soil surface was uniformly covered with assigned straw mulch 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 after packing for the treatment of straw incorporation the straw and soil were thoroughly mixed according to the designed incorporation rate 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 subsequently the method reported by liu et al 2020 was used in this study to pack the soil straw mixture with a specially manufactured funnel furthermore frozen and unfrozen soil treatments were conducted to analyse the effect of different soil conditions on sediment transport and flow velocity because the main goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of straw returning on thawed soil erosion in early spring the straw mulching and straw incorporation were not considered in frozen and unfrozen soil the slope gradient of 10 was selected in this research to represent the gradient of the severe soil erosion region of northeast china lu et al 2016 wen et al 2015 the duration of each trial was 20 min the sampling interval of runoff and sediment was 2 min for each run two hundred millilitres of runoff and sediment were collected in the beaker for subsequent analysis of the sediment size distribution as soon as runoff and sediment samples collection were completed in the experiment the remaining runoff and sediment were collected in a bucket to measure the amount of runoff and sediment then the runoff and sediment samples were immediately analysed by a laser diffraction device malvern mastersizer 2000 uk to obtain the particle size distribution of the sediments the power spectral density of the sediment before and after dispersion was obtained by two measurements of each sample wang et al 2017 2019a the samples without dispersion treatment were first analysed to obtain the nondispersive particle size distribution of sediments and the samples were then treated with hydrogen peroxide and dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the organic matter and calcium carbonate afterward a sodium hexametaphosphate solution was added to disperse the samples and then the samples were ultrasonically dispersed to obtain their primary particle size distribution in addition the original uneroded soil samples were measured nondispersed and dispersed particle size distribution by the same method used to measure the particle size distribution of the eroded sediments table 1 in the experiments the dye tracer method kmno4 was used to measure the surface velocity in 1 min intervals throughout the entire experiment ali et al 2012 li et al 2020 for each measurement the same observer used a digital stopwatch to record the travel time required for the leading edge of the dye cloud to move 0 5 m above the flume at a distance of 0 25 m from the water inlet of the flume yang et al 2020 the surface velocity measurement was repeated three times and the same observer measured each measurement to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the experiment furthermore the development of rills was recorded by photography the rill length width and depth were measured with a calibrated ruler 3 data treatments and model construction 3 1 back propagation neural network model the bp model usually includes input output and hidden layers the hidden layer can be one layer or contain multiple layers in addition the neurons of the neural network are interconnected qiu et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that any nonlinear problem can be approximately simulated by a three layer network model qiu et al 2021 mends et al 2002 therefore a three layer neural network with a single hidden layer is usually employed in such studies qiu et al 2021 fig 2 b the r package neuralnet was used to build the bp model the training dataset 70 of the data was used to build the bp model and the testing dataset 30 of the data was used to verify the results 3 2 support vector machine model the svm is a model based on a kernel machine learning algorithm zhao et al 2021 for svm four kernels were tested including gaussian radial basis function sigmoid hyperbolic tangent kernel and linear kernel meyer et al 2015 the best performing kernel the gaussian radial basis function was selected through several tests on the model details of the svm model were described in previous publications leng et al 2018 ren et al 2020 li et al 2021 the same training dataset 70 of the data used for the bp model was used to build the svm model and the testing dataset 30 of the data was used to verify the results 3 3 random forest model the rf method is an ensemble model based on the regression tree rt algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 rf is a low variance method because the rf model randomly divides input variable predictors and the training data to build a set of b decision trees bt montes et al 2021 the result y x is the average of all the decision tree outputs eq 1 which reduces model variation and the risk of overfitting an illustration and simplified schematic of the rf method is shown in fig 2 1 y x 1 b t b 1 b t t x θ b fig 2 shows that the rf contains a series of trees like a forest nguyen et al 2019 each forest is built using the cart classification and regression trees algorithm breiman 2001 and the training data of each node has a random subset breiman et al 2003 merghadi et al 2020 the average of all regression trees is used as the final result which shows the most accurate division between all classification trees merghadi et al 2020 fig 2a in this study the r package randomforest was used to build the rf model liaw and wiener 2002 from the combinations of various influential factors a total of three models were trained to predict the d50 sediment concentration and flow velocity take flow velocity as an example and the dataset of flow velocity was first analysed by the correlation analyses to select the important variables for modeling moreover the same training dataset 70 of the data used for the bp and svm models was used to build the rf model referring to the previous study merghadi et al 2020 wang et al 2018 the mtry and ntree were set to m and 500 respectively to build the training model subsequently several tunable hyperparameters mtry ntree and nodesize were tested to determine the best parameters for the rf model and the formal model was established with the best parameters the testing dataset 30 of the data was used to test the accuracy of the model the k fold cross validation was used for the verification of models the k fold cross validation is a resampling method that randomly divides the training data into k groups of approximately equal size wong 2015 rodríguez 2010 saud 2020 wong 2015 the model is fit on k 1 folds and then the remaining fold is used to compute model performance wong 2015 this procedure is repeated k times for each time a different fold is treated as the validation set which leads to k estimates of the generalization error wong 2015 ling et al 2019 therefore the k fold cv estimate is computed by averaging the k test errors which provides an approximation of the error on unseen data wong 2015 3 4 statistical analysis three performance indicators were used to evaluate the performance of models these are the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the relative root mean square error rrmse and the mean relative error mre defined as follows 2 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 rrmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o 4 mre 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i 100 where oi is the measured data o is the mean measured data and pi is the predicted data the nse reflects the correlation between predicted and measured values nse 0 7 indicated a good performance values 0 4 but 0 7 indicated a satisfactory performance and values 0 4 indicated an unacceptable performance ahmad et al 2011 4 results 4 1 variation in the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 in this study the total erosion was 1168 5 g 1459 9 g and 1322 8 g under unfrozen soil frozen soil and thawed soil conditions respectively the total erosion of thawed soil increased by 20 compared with that of unfrozen soil furthermore the erosion rate of thawed soil exhibited the same trend as that of unfrozen soil the erosion rate decreased with increasing time fig 3 the rate of decrease in the erosion rate became weaker with increasing time however there were significant differences between the soil erosion rates of frozen soil and thawed soil the soil erosion rate of frozen soil increased with increasing time until it reached a maximum value 5 min and then the soil erosion rate decreased gradually with increasing time 6 20 min fig 3 the sediment yield and the soil erosion rate on the slopes with straw mulch were significantly slowed down especially in the earlier stage of the experiment 1 3 min fig 3b although the straw incorporation affected the sediment yield and soil erosion rate fig 3 it was not dominant when compared with the influence of straw mulch in addition the correlation analyses showed that the sediment concentration was negatively correlated with time and straw mulch p 0 01 but positively correlated with flow velocity and unit stream power p 0 01 fig 4 the flow velocity ranged from 0 05 to 0 41 m s 1 with a mean value of 0 21 m s 1 table 2 the maximum flow velocity over thawed soil decreased by 20 7 compared with that over frozen soil furthermore the flow velocity over frozen soil increased by 38 0 compared with that over unfrozen soil at the earlier stage of this experiment and the maximum flow velocity in this experiment was observed over frozen soil fig 5 the flow velocity of frozen soil was much higher than that of nonfrozen and thawed soil due to the existence of a frozen layer in the frozen soil during the experiment most of the water flow was used to generate runoff rather than infiltrate the soil the flow velocity of all combinations decreased with increasing time but this trend became weaker and then became steady at the later stage of this experiment fig 5 for example when the time increased from 1 min to 5 min 5 min to 10 min 10 min to 15 min and 15 min to 20 min flow velocity decreased by 12 6 5 9 10 6 and 0 1 respectively in addition the straw mulch and straw incorporation can significantly affect the flow velocity the flow velocity decreased with increasing straw incorporation and mulch cover rates p 0 01 however the flow velocity was not particularly sensitive to straw incorporation as compared with straw mulch for instance when the mulch cover rate is 0 4 kg m 2 the flow velocity decreases by 78 5 compared with that without cover when the straw incorporation rate is 0 4 kg m 2 the flow velocity decreases by 19 9 compared with that without incorporation the decrease rate of the flow velocity under mulch cover rate of 0 4 kg m 2 was far greater than that under straw incorporation rate of 0 4 kg m 2 correlation analyses between the flow velocity and other variables showed that the straw mulch sediment yield d50 of transported sediment and straw incorporation were important influential factors of flow velocity the nondispersed d50 variation of transported sediment at different time points under different treatments is shown in fig 6 the d50 of eroded sediment under thawed soil conditions was lower than that under nonfrozen soil conditions fig 6 the d50 of eroded sediment after the soil suffered freezing and thawing processes decreased by 29 4 in addition the d50 of transported sediment on thawed soil with straw mulching was lower than that without cover the percentage content of clay and silt in eroded sediment significantly increased with mulch cover rate fig 6e correlation analyses of the d50 and the influential factors indicated that the d50 of transported sediment was significantly positively correlated with runoff and negatively correlated with mulch cover rate p 0 01 fig 4 there were no obvious changes in the d50 values of nondispersed sediment with time indicating that time had no effect on d50 of transported sediment 4 2 models of sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 under thawed soil the minimum maximum and mean values of flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 of transported sediment decreased with increasing mulch cover rate and the standard deviation std and the coefficients of variation cv also increased with increasing mulch cover rate indicating that the straw mulch had a great effect on flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 of transported sediment table 2 to further analyse the straw mulch and straw incorporation on flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 of transported sediment the best fitting equations sr model of sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 was established by stepwise regression analyses table 3 in addition the r packages randomforest e1071 and neuralnet montes et al 2021 liaw and wiener 2002 were used to construct sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 models rf svm and bp models for comparison with the models of prior studies the hydraulic parameters e g shear stress stream power and unit stream power reported in previous studies were used for further analysis several tunable hyperparameters mtry ntree and nodesize were tested to determine the best parameters for the rf model the rf model was implemented with the optimal parameters defined in table 3 for svm the best performing kernel the gaussian radial basis function was selected through several tests on the model as shown in table 4 the accuracy of the sediment concentration and flow velocity for the training dataset predicted by the rf and svm models were higher than that predicted by the sr and bp models there was a large gap between the sediment concentration and flow velocity for the training dataset predicted by the sr model and the measured values some data points plotted quite far from the 1 1 line fig 7 which indicated that sediment concentration and flow velocity values for the training dataset were underestimated or overestimated the rrmse mre and re values calculated by the rf model were lower than those of the sr and bp models table 4 and the nse was greater than 0 849 indicating that the rf model showed a higher prediction accuracy for the sediment concentration and flow velocity of the training dataset when the rf and sr models were used to predict the sediment concentration and velocity for the testing dataset the accuracy of the sr model quickly decreased nse 0 461 rmse 0 930 and mre 10 039 the rf model still showed good performance for predicting the sediment concentration and flow velocity nse 0 849 rmse 0 493 and mre 39 633 the accuracy of d50 for the testing dataset predicted by the rf model was slightly higher than that predicted by the sr model and all data points agreed with the 1 1 line fig 7f the nse was greater than 0 924 and the re rrmse and mre were also small rf model prediction accuracy of d50 for the testing dataset decreased slightly nse 0 866 rrmse 0 122 and mre 7 148 and the performance for predicting d50 by the rf model is close to that by the sr and svm models indicating that the rf svm and sr models were the best models for determining the d50 in conclusion rf was considered the best model for sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 which outperformed sr svm and bp on both measures of agreement and accuracy the variable importance of the rf model implied that the straw mulch 47 sediment yield 36 9 and straw incorporation 20 5 were the important influential factors of flow velocity fig 8 the flow velocity over thawed soil with straw mulching was significantly lower than that with straw incorporation in addition the straw mulch was an important influential factor affecting the sediment concentration fig 8 the variable importance of factors influenced the sediment concentration in the following order time 23 4 unit stream power 18 2 straw mulch 10 2 straw incorporation 1 4 the variable importance of time unit stream power and straw mulch were greater than 10 and the variable importance of time was the highest among all factors furthermore the straw mulch also has a certain influence on d50 of transported sediment fig 8 and the variable importance was greater than 15 the most important parameter for predicting d50 is shear stress 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration under different conditions in this study the total erosion of thawed and frozen soil increased significantly compared with that of unfrozen soil similar results were found in previous studies wang et al 2020 wei et al 2018 for example wang et al 2018 reported that shallow thawed slope showed stronger sediment yield capacity than that on the frozen slope under 4 l min 1 flow rate wei et al 2018 also found that the soil loss under the f t cycle was higher than that of the control treatment in addition the rill depth and width of thawed soil effectively increased the possible explanation is that more runoff energy was available to drive the rill horizontal evolution towards sidewalls and vertical evolution downward for thawed soil which caused the rill depth and width of thawed soil to increase by 38 9 and 6 7 respectively compared with that of unfrozen soil barnes et al 2016 and ferrick and gatto 2010 also reported that the rill depth width cross sectional area and soil erosion after the soil suffered the effects of freeze thaw were significantly greater than those of unfrozen soil a possible explanation is that the expansion of ice reduces the stability of soil aggregates during the freezing period and the soil aggregates were broken into fine particles altun et al 2009 therefore more sediments were easily detached and transported along with thawed soil during the process of erosion compared with that on unfrozen soil under the same conditions wang et al 2020 wang et al 2017 furthermore the difference in soil erodibility is another possible reason the effects of freeze thaw decreased the soil erodibility and critical shear stress leading to the increase of soil erosion rate wang et al 2020 liu et al 2017 the soil erosion rate sediment concentration and flow velocity decreased with increasing time figs 3 4 and 5 the decrease rate of the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 became weaker with increasing time at the later stage of the experiment the reason for this trend may be explained by the relatively steady state of rill flow at the later stage and the rill channel has gradually transited from the rapid development of rills to the mature rill previous studies have demonstrated that water flow gradually transitions from shallow flow to rill flow with increasing time throughout the process of rill erosion yang et al 2020 this trend was also found in this study yang et al 2020 suggested that this trend was related to the variations in flow velocity with time and the variations in bed roughness caused by rill erosion at the earlier stage of the experiment there was no significant difference between the bed surface roughness and that before the experiment additionally the flow velocity was higher at the earlier stage of the experiment because less flow energy needed to be consumed to overcome the resistance the rill width and depth gradually increased as time increased the formation of rill sidewalls led to an increase in the hydraulic resistance which consumed more flow energy furthermore the detachment of soil particles and the transport of sediment also consumed the flow energy wang et al 2020 wei et al 2018 the 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 kg m 2 mulch cover rates reduced d50 of transported sediment by 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 respectively however there were no significant differences in d50 of transported sediment between the slopes with straw incorporation and those without straw incorporation the results showed that the straw mulch effectively retarded surface runoff and intercepted macroaggregate the finer sizes are more likely to be entrained furthermore liu et al 2020 reported that the flow velocity decreased with the exponential function and the straw incorporation can reduce the flow velocity by more than 50 although similar trends were found in our study the interception efficiency of straw mulch on flow velocity and soil erosion was better than that of straw incorporation a possible explanation is that the freezing and thawing processes alter the connection modes of soil particles and cause soil structural deterioration wang et al 2020 soil structural deterioration canceled out that positive effect of straw incorporation for soil and water conservations the straw mulch reduces erosion much more effectively than straw incorporation 5 2 comparison of sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 new model with other models according to the results shown in table 4 the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of the training and testing datasets could be sufficiently estimated by the machine learning rf model and the prediction accuracy of the rf model was much higher than that of the sr svm and bp models the superior performance of rf was expected because it was often the best model among multiple machine learning methods which has been reported in previous studies zhou et al 2020 nussbaum et al 2018 fernández delgado et al 2014 rf has a better performance for estimating flow velocity and sediment concentration because many regression trees are ensembled in rf models the instability of the single tree model is minimized by aggregating multiple trees breiman 1996 each single regression tree variable is randomly selected which reduces the potential model bias when several variables are more frequently used to decide node splitting rules than other variables breiman 2001 variable importance analysis showed that the straw mulch was the essential factor of flow velocity it was easy to see that the plant covering increased the soil surface roughness and more flow energy was consumed by overcoming resistance indicating that the flow velocity change is closely related to the straw mulch liu et al 2020 rahma et al 2013 rahma et al 2019 the variable importance of time was the highest among all factors for sediment concentration this trend was attributed to the high soil erosion rate at the earlier stage of the experiment and the soil erosion rate consistently decreased with increasing time fig 2 for example when the mulch cover rate was 0 2 kg m 2 the soil erosion rate decreased from 0 27 kg m 2 min 1 in the first minute to 0 02 kg m 2 min 1 in the 20 min comparing the performance of the rf model based on the regression tree algorithm and sr model based on the stepwise regression analyses with the models reported in previous studies ban et al 2017a govers 1992 lei et al 2001 luo et al 2020 nearing et al 1999 the rf model showed better performance nse 0 909 rrmse 0 303 table 5 when the models reported by govers 1992 and nearing et al 1999 were used to calculate the flow velocity the re ranged from 67 619 to 74 968 and from 229 819 to 50 745 respectively table 5 these results suggest that all flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration values were underestimated considering this significant effect of straw mulch on flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration the models reported in previous studies seem impossible to be suitable for calculating flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 on slopes with straw mulching when the rf model was used to predict sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 respectively the mre decreased from 3322 190 42 990 and 79 466 to 18 005 0 813 and 2 607 respectively furthermore the rf algorithm builds the model by considering the importance of data unlike the models reported in previous studies which use the most correlated data the rf model can better capture complex interactions between features in the data compared to other regression models which makes the rf model show an excellent bias variance for predicting flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 overall the rf model could accurately predict the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 6 conclusions in this study the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on soil erosion and sediment transport were investigated the flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration of thawed soil were compared with that of unfrozen and frozen soil the results showed that the d50 of transported sediment and flow velocity of thawed soil decreased significantly compared with those of unfrozen soil while the soil erosion rate increased significantly the maximum flow velocity over thawed soil decreased by 20 7 compared with that over frozen soil the maximum flow velocity in this experiment was observed over frozen soil the sediment yield and the soil erosion rate on the slopes with straw mulch were significantly slowed down the interception efficiency of straw mulch on flow velocity and soil erosion was better than that of straw incorporation the d50 of transported sediment on thawed soil with straw mulching was lower than that without cover and the flow velocity decreased with increasing straw incorporation and mulch cover rates although the straw incorporation affected the sediment yield soil erosion rate and flow velocity it was not dominant compared with the influence of straw mulch in addition the rf and sr models were developed for predicting the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 the rf model can predict the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 with high accuracy in general the machine learning model has avoided the error caused by overfitting the rf model can facilitate the prediction of flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration which establishes a foundation for further research this technique can estimate d50 flow velocities and sediment concentration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

3272,snow and ice melted water flow over thawed soil cause severe soil erosion the application of straw mulch has long been considered as an effective measure to reduce soil erosion but the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on thawed soil erosion remain uncertain this study conducted detailed laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on soil erosion and sediment transport of thawed soil the median particle size d50 of transported sediment flow velocity and sediment concentration for thawed soil were compared with that of unfrozen and frozen soil models based on random forest rf support vector machine svm back propagation neural network bp and stepwise regression sr were implemented to simulate the key parameters of thawed soil erosion and the accuracy of the developed models was evaluated the results showed that the sediment yield increased significantly in thawed soil compared with that in unfrozen soil the maximum flow velocity over thawed soil decreased by 20 7 compared with that over frozen soil the d50 of transported sediment decreased by 29 4 after the soil suffered the effects of freeze thaw and the finer sizes were more likely to be entrained the straw mulch effectively reduced the d50 of transported sediment flow velocity and sediment concentration in addition the rf model showed a better result to predict the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of transported sediment nse 0 849 rrmse 0 493 than the bp svm and sr models comparing the performance of the rf model with the models reported in previous studies the rf model showed the best performance in general the results of this study provide important information for soil erosion in thawed soil keywords thawed soil straw mulch flow velocity sediment concentration median particle size random forest 1 introduction soil erosion causes land degradation and further threatens the sustainable development of the environment under global warming wang et al 2020 rickson 2014 global temperatures have already risen by about 1 c since the beginning of the 20th century and are almost certain to rise another 0 5 to 1 0 c by 2050 even under highly ambitious climate mitigation scenarios ippc 2021 ipcc 2019 the increased temperature results in the melting of snow and ice and more frequent freeze thaw cycles groffman et al 2011 freppaz et al 2010 wang et al 2020 reported that the thawed soil strata are highly susceptible to meltwater erosion these melted strata usually produce abundant runoff from glacial meltwater runoff or snowmelt li and fan 2014 which can cause a further increase in soil erosion risk in cold regions ban et al 2017a 2017b 2017c zeng et al 2013 wang et al 2012 harris 2010 therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of thawed soil erosion and identify the key factors for soil erosion and develop suitable soil erosion models returning crop straws to the field is an effective way for resource utilization of crop residues liu et al 2020 previous studies have demonstrated that the straw returning can improve soil quality yin et al 2018 wakindiki and danga 2011 soil erosion and hydrological of sloping farmland liu et al 2019 rahma et al 2019 sadeghi et al 2015 shen et al 2012 for example mandal et al 2004 reported that returning crop straws to the field can improve soil bulk density hydraulic conductivity temperature moisture and aggregate formation omidvar et al 2019 and rahma et al 2013 found that straw mulching significantly reduces flow velocity liu et al 2020 suggested that straw incorporation into the soil can reduce flow velocity rainfall and runoff erosivity although the advantageous effects of the straw returning are known further work is needed to quantify these effects on thawed soil rainfall simulation and water scouring are essential methods to study hillslope erosion in laboratory and field conditions lin et al 2022 polyakov et al 2020 wang et al 2018 2019a zhang et al 2020 previous studies suggested that the flow velocity sediment concentration and median particle diameter d50 of transported sediment are important parameters since they are not only directly related to soil detachment sediment transport and deposition zhuang et al 2018 yang et al 2018a 2018b rahma et al 2013 zhang et al 2008 but also the basis for establishing soil erosion models for example the shear stress flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration are the key parameters in the water erosion prediction project wepp european soil erosion model eurosem and hairsine rose hr model hairsine and rose 1992b wagenbrenner et al 2010 foster et al 1984 govers et al 1990 hairsine and rose 1991 hairsine and rose 1992a nearing et al 1989 accurately obtaining hydraulic parameters unit stream power shear stress and flow velocity and soil loss parameters d50 sediment concentration and sediment load is a crucial prerequisite for applying these models however the freezing and thawing processes are complex and usually lead to changes in soil structure cheng et al 2021 cruse et al 2001 edwards 2013 edwards and burney 1991 1992 wang et al 2020 which then affect the process of soil erosion frame et al 1992 furthermore straw mulch increases the hydraulic roughness of the thawed soil surface thereby affecting flow velocity liu et al 2020 which makes it difficult to predict these parameters accurately in thawed soil liu et al 2016 therefore additional detailed studies are necessary on the key parameters e g sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of thawed soil erosion with different straw management practices straw mulching and straw incorporation modeling is an important method of soil erosion parameters estimation and the selection of a prediction model may largely affect the results zhao et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 several studies have developed empirical models to predict sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 wang et al 2019a b yang et al 2018a liu et al 2017 ban et al 2020 ban et al 2017a 2016 however soil erosion caused by rainfall events is random and complex guo et al 2010 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 soil erosion is a dynamic and intricate process zhang et al 2008 yang et al 2018a involving soil detachment sediment transport and deposition yang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2018 zhang and wang 2017 rahma et al 2013 among these soil loss parameters d50 sediment concentration and flow velocity are the crucial parameters throughout the whole soil erosion process and play an essential role in soil erosion research the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 determine how much the eroded sediments were transported and deposited on the hillslope especially at the end of the rill yang et al 2018a these parameters usually have a certain degree of nonlinear features due to the dynamic and intricate soil erosion process zhang et al 2019 jiménez hornero et al 2005 the traditional regression models were commonly used to predict soil erosion parameters in previous studies ban et al 2017a 2016 zhang et al 2018 however traditional soil erosion models require different types of input variables and an understanding of the mechanisms of erosion intensity levels in addition the linear regression model assumes that the relationship between independent and dependent variables is linear zhao et al 2019 were et al 2015 which may reduce the applicability and prediction accuracy of the model therefore the traditional models based on linear regression cannot sufficiently describe the soil erosion process in recent years a growing interest in models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence e g breiman 2001 as an alternative to statistical modeling in the areas of soil and ecology harrison et al 2020 hengl et al 2015 by comparison machine learning and artificial intelligence models usually allow predictions by easily accessible variables and these models usually have higher prediction accuracy than the traditional regression model chen et al 2018 li et al 2021 machine learning and artificial intelligence models avoid overfitting and can depict nonlinear features which makes these models usually show better prediction accuracy and applicability than traditional regression models srinet et al 2019 deiss et al 2020 li et al 2021 busch et al 2021 several researchers have been developed models using machine learning techniques in the areas of soil and ecology harrison et al 2020 these machine learning tools include artificial neural networks ann ebteha 2013 feng

2015 and random forest rf montes et al 2021 breiman 2001 several studies have reported that neural network models can directly predict soil properties and show high accuracy including for the spatial distribution of nutrients environmental factors physical properties gully erosion intensity and soil management hao et al 2021 li et al 2016 halecki et al 2017 rahmati et al 2017 the back propagation bp neural network is one of the most effective for such analyses feng et al 2018 kim and gilley 2008 svm is a supervised statistical machine learning technique deiss et al 2020 vapnik 1999 which achieves a sufficient balance between the prediction ability and the generalization ability of the model deiss et al 2020 ghorbanzadeh 2020 furthermore the rf is an ensemble model based on the regression tree rt algorithm breiman 2001 which can improve prediction accuracy and address the issues of model overfitting montes et al 2021 several scholars suggested that the rf model had high accuracy in the researches of soil science arabameri et al 2019a arabameri et al 2019b arabameri et al 2018 such as simulation of soil infiltration pahlavan rad et al 2020 sihang et al 2019 digital

nonlinearity of the soil erosion process wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 selecting an inappropriate model may cause a sizeable error in soil erosion research due to the advantages of the interpretability of the results as well as its good characteristics nonlinear features and easy application montes et al 2021 the rf bp and svm models appear to have the potential of the optimal model was implemented to simulate soil loss and flow velocity therefore the main goals of this study were i to evaluate the performance of sediment transport on thawed soil with straw mulching and straw incorporation ii to evaluate the performance of soil erosion and sediment transport over frozen nonfrozen and thawed black soil slopes iii to develop new models for simulating the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of transported sediment for thawed soil with straw mulching and straw incorporation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental equipment system consists of a peristaltic pump as well as water supply pipes experimental flumes and buckets the flow was supplied and controlled by a three channel peristaltic pump 2 l min 1 the three channel peristaltic pump was tuned for each run to achieve the designed flow discharge the flow rate in the flume outlet was measured during each experiment the experimental flume segments were composed of three flumes that were 1 m long 0 2 m wide and 0 15 m high fig 1 there are several drainage holes at the bottom of each flume allowing excess water to drain out each experiment was carried out simultaneously in three flumes so that each trial could be repeated three times the soil samples were collected from abandoned farmland in yichun 129 00 e 47 59 n located in heilongjiang province china the region has typical freeze thaw black soil which was subjected to erosion by rain generating runoff and snow melting chen et al 2021 the bulk density of the undisturbed soil in the field ranges from 1 1 to 1 3 g cm 3 the sampling depth was approximately 0 2 m and the physical and chemical properties of the soil are shown in table 1 referring to the previous study chen et al 2021 2017 gao et al 2018 the soil samples were air dried 10 gravimetric moisture content and passed through a 10 mm sieve to remove plant residuals and stones and then packed uniformly into the experimental flume in two continuous 0 05 m thick layers to obtain a bulk density of 1 2 g cm 3 after the soil samples were packed in the flumes the packed soil was saturated 34 gravimetric moisture content and allowed to equilibrate for 12 h before each experimental run then the soil filled flumes were placed in a temperature adjustable facility at a temperature between 15 c and 20 c for more than 24 h the soil filled flumes were removed from the temperature adjustable facility when the soil and water were completely frozen and placed on a platform to thaw at room temperature about 10 c to 15 c in addition the thawed depth of the frozen soil was continuously measured with needles to check on the thawed depth reached soil should be completely thawed 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments involved four mulch cover rates 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 and four straw incorporation rates 0 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 for thawed soil to simulate the process of thawed soil erosion of straw returning in early spring the straw was collected from the cornfield the corn straw was air dried and cut into sections with a length of about 5 cm to simulate the situations in the field of straw returning for the treatment of straw mulch the soil surface was uniformly covered with assigned straw mulch 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 after packing for the treatment of straw incorporation the straw and soil were thoroughly mixed according to the designed incorporation rate 0 1 0 2 0 4 kg m 2 subsequently the method reported by liu et al 2020 was used in this study to pack the soil straw mixture with a specially manufactured funnel furthermore frozen and unfrozen soil treatments were conducted to analyse the effect of different soil conditions on sediment transport and flow velocity because the main goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of straw returning on thawed soil erosion in early spring the straw mulching and straw incorporation were not considered in frozen and unfrozen soil the slope gradient of 10 was selected in this research to represent the gradient of the severe soil erosion region of northeast china lu et al 2016 wen et al 2015 the duration of each trial was 20 min the sampling interval of runoff and sediment was 2 min for each run two hundred millilitres of runoff and sediment were collected in the beaker for subsequent analysis of the sediment size distribution as soon as runoff and sediment samples collection were completed in the experiment the remaining runoff and sediment were collected in a bucket to measure the amount of runoff and sediment then the runoff and sediment samples were immediately analysed by a laser diffraction device malvern mastersizer 2000 uk to obtain the particle size distribution of the sediments the power spectral density of the sediment before and after dispersion was obtained by two measurements of each sample wang et al 2017 2019a the samples without dispersion treatment were first analysed to obtain the nondispersive particle size distribution of sediments and the samples were then treated with hydrogen peroxide and dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the organic matter and calcium carbonate afterward a sodium hexametaphosphate solution was added to disperse the samples and then the samples were ultrasonically dispersed to obtain their primary particle size distribution in addition the original uneroded soil samples were measured nondispersed and dispersed particle size distribution by the same method used to measure the particle size distribution of the eroded sediments table 1 in the experiments the dye tracer method kmno4 was used to measure the surface velocity in 1 min intervals throughout the entire experiment ali et al 2012 li et al 2020 for each measurement the same observer used a digital stopwatch to record the travel time required for the leading edge of the dye cloud to move 0 5 m above the flume at a distance of 0 25 m from the water inlet of the flume yang et al 2020 the surface velocity measurement was repeated three times and the same observer measured each measurement to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the experiment furthermore the development of rills was recorded by photography the rill length width and depth were measured with a calibrated ruler 3 data treatments and model construction 3 1 back propagation neural network model the bp model usually includes input output and hidden layers the hidden layer can be one layer or contain multiple layers in addition the neurons of the neural network are interconnected qiu et al 2021 previous studies have demonstrated that any nonlinear problem can be approximately simulated by a three layer network model qiu et al 2021 mends et al 2002 therefore a three layer neural network with a single hidden layer is usually employed in such studies qiu et al 2021 fig 2 b the r package neuralnet was used to build the bp model the training dataset 70 of the data was used to build the bp model and the testing dataset 30 of the data was used to verify the results 3 2 support vector machine model the svm is a model based on a kernel machine learning algorithm zhao et al 2021 for svm four kernels were tested including gaussian radial basis function sigmoid hyperbolic tangent kernel and linear kernel meyer et al 2015 the best performing kernel the gaussian radial basis function was selected through several tests on the model details of the svm model were described in previous publications leng et al 2018 ren et al 2020 li et al 2021 the same training dataset 70 of the data used for the bp model was used to build the svm model and the testing dataset 30 of the data was used to verify the results 3 3 random forest model the rf method is an ensemble model based on the regression tree rt algorithm proposed by breiman 2001 rf is a low variance method because the rf model randomly divides input variable predictors and the training data to build a set of b decision trees bt montes et al 2021 the result y x is the average of all the decision tree outputs eq 1 which reduces model variation and the risk of overfitting an illustration and simplified schematic of the rf method is shown in fig 2 1 y x 1 b t b 1 b t t x θ b fig 2 shows that the rf contains a series of trees like a forest nguyen et al 2019 each forest is built using the cart classification and regression trees algorithm breiman 2001 and the training data of each node has a random subset breiman et al 2003 merghadi et al 2020 the average of all regression trees is used as the final result which shows the most accurate division between all classification trees merghadi et al 2020 fig 2a in this study the r package randomforest was used to build the rf model liaw and wiener 2002 from the combinations of various influential factors a total of three models were trained to predict the d50 sediment concentration and flow velocity take flow velocity as an example and the dataset of flow velocity was first analysed by the correlation analyses to select the important variables for modeling moreover the same training dataset 70 of the data used for the bp and svm models was used to build the rf model referring to the previous study merghadi et al 2020 wang et al 2018 the mtry and ntree were set to m and 500 respectively to build the training model subsequently several tunable hyperparameters mtry ntree and nodesize were tested to determine the best parameters for the rf model and the formal model was established with the best parameters the testing dataset 30 of the data was used to test the accuracy of the model the k fold cross validation was used for the verification of models the k fold cross validation is a resampling method that randomly divides the training data into k groups of approximately equal size wong 2015 rodríguez 2010 saud 2020 wong 2015 the model is fit on k 1 folds and then the remaining fold is used to compute model performance wong 2015 this procedure is repeated k times for each time a different fold is treated as the validation set which leads to k estimates of the generalization error wong 2015 ling et al 2019 therefore the k fold cv estimate is computed by averaging the k test errors which provides an approximation of the error on unseen data wong 2015 3 4 statistical analysis three performance indicators were used to evaluate the performance of models these are the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the relative root mean square error rrmse and the mean relative error mre defined as follows 2 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 3 rrmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 o 4 mre 1 n i 1 n o i p i o i 100 where oi is the measured data o is the mean measured data and pi is the predicted data the nse reflects the correlation between predicted and measured values nse 0 7 indicated a good performance values 0 4 but 0 7 indicated a satisfactory performance and values 0 4 indicated an unacceptable performance ahmad et al 2011 4 results 4 1 variation in the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 in this study the total erosion was 1168 5 g 1459 9 g and 1322 8 g under unfrozen soil frozen soil and thawed soil conditions respectively the total erosion of thawed soil increased by 20 compared with that of unfrozen soil furthermore the erosion rate of thawed soil exhibited the same trend as that of unfrozen soil the erosion rate decreased with increasing time fig 3 the rate of decrease in the erosion rate became weaker with increasing time however there were significant differences between the soil erosion rates of frozen soil and thawed soil the soil erosion rate of frozen soil increased with increasing time until it reached a maximum value 5 min and then the soil erosion rate decreased gradually with increasing time 6 20 min fig 3 the sediment yield and the soil erosion rate on the slopes with straw mulch were significantly slowed down especially in the earlier stage of the experiment 1 3 min fig 3b although the straw incorporation affected the sediment yield and soil erosion rate fig 3 it was not dominant when compared with the influence of straw mulch in addition the correlation analyses showed that the sediment concentration was negatively correlated with time and straw mulch p 0 01 but positively correlated with flow velocity and unit stream power p 0 01 fig 4 the flow velocity ranged from 0 05 to 0 41 m s 1 with a mean value of 0 21 m s 1 table 2 the maximum flow velocity over thawed soil decreased by 20 7 compared with that over frozen soil furthermore the flow velocity over frozen soil increased by 38 0 compared with that over unfrozen soil at the earlier stage of this experiment and the maximum flow velocity in this experiment was observed over frozen soil fig 5 the flow velocity of frozen soil was much higher than that of nonfrozen and thawed soil due to the existence of a frozen layer in the frozen soil during the experiment most of the water flow was used to generate runoff rather than infiltrate the soil the flow velocity of all combinations decreased with increasing time but this trend became weaker and then became steady at the later stage of this experiment fig 5 for example when the time increased from 1 min to 5 min 5 min to 10 min 10 min to 15 min and 15 min to 20 min flow velocity decreased by 12 6 5 9 10 6 and 0 1 respectively in addition the straw mulch and straw incorporation can significantly affect the flow velocity the flow velocity decreased with increasing straw incorporation and mulch cover rates p 0 01 however the flow velocity was not particularly sensitive to straw incorporation as compared with straw mulch for instance when the mulch cover rate is 0 4 kg m 2 the flow velocity decreases by 78 5 compared with that without cover when the straw incorporation rate is 0 4 kg m 2 the flow velocity decreases by 19 9 compared with that without incorporation the decrease rate of the flow velocity under mulch cover rate of 0 4 kg m 2 was far greater than that under straw incorporation rate of 0 4 kg m 2 correlation analyses between the flow velocity and other variables showed that the straw mulch sediment yield d50 of transported sediment and straw incorporation were important influential factors of flow velocity the nondispersed d50 variation of transported sediment at different time points under different treatments is shown in fig 6 the d50 of eroded sediment under thawed soil conditions was lower than that under nonfrozen soil conditions fig 6 the d50 of eroded sediment after the soil suffered freezing and thawing processes decreased by 29 4 in addition the d50 of transported sediment on thawed soil with straw mulching was lower than that without cover the percentage content of clay and silt in eroded sediment significantly increased with mulch cover rate fig 6e correlation analyses of the d50 and the influential factors indicated that the d50 of transported sediment was significantly positively correlated with runoff and negatively correlated with mulch cover rate p 0 01 fig 4 there were no obvious changes in the d50 values of nondispersed sediment with time indicating that time had no effect on d50 of transported sediment 4 2 models of sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 under thawed soil the minimum maximum and mean values of flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 of transported sediment decreased with increasing mulch cover rate and the standard deviation std and the coefficients of variation cv also increased with increasing mulch cover rate indicating that the straw mulch had a great effect on flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 of transported sediment table 2 to further analyse the straw mulch and straw incorporation on flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 of transported sediment the best fitting equations sr model of sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 was established by stepwise regression analyses table 3 in addition the r packages randomforest e1071 and neuralnet montes et al 2021 liaw and wiener 2002 were used to construct sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 models rf svm and bp models for comparison with the models of prior studies the hydraulic parameters e g shear stress stream power and unit stream power reported in previous studies were used for further analysis several tunable hyperparameters mtry ntree and nodesize were tested to determine the best parameters for the rf model the rf model was implemented with the optimal parameters defined in table 3 for svm the best performing kernel the gaussian radial basis function was selected through several tests on the model as shown in table 4 the accuracy of the sediment concentration and flow velocity for the training dataset predicted by the rf and svm models were higher than that predicted by the sr and bp models there was a large gap between the sediment concentration and flow velocity for the training dataset predicted by the sr model and the measured values some data points plotted quite far from the 1 1 line fig 7 which indicated that sediment concentration and flow velocity values for the training dataset were underestimated or overestimated the rrmse mre and re values calculated by the rf model were lower than those of the sr and bp models table 4 and the nse was greater than 0 849 indicating that the rf model showed a higher prediction accuracy for the sediment concentration and flow velocity of the training dataset when the rf and sr models were used to predict the sediment concentration and velocity for the testing dataset the accuracy of the sr model quickly decreased nse 0 461 rmse 0 930 and mre 10 039 the rf model still showed good performance for predicting the sediment concentration and flow velocity nse 0 849 rmse 0 493 and mre 39 633 the accuracy of d50 for the testing dataset predicted by the rf model was slightly higher than that predicted by the sr model and all data points agreed with the 1 1 line fig 7f the nse was greater than 0 924 and the re rrmse and mre were also small rf model prediction accuracy of d50 for the testing dataset decreased slightly nse 0 866 rrmse 0 122 and mre 7 148 and the performance for predicting d50 by the rf model is close to that by the sr and svm models indicating that the rf svm and sr models were the best models for determining the d50 in conclusion rf was considered the best model for sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 which outperformed sr svm and bp on both measures of agreement and accuracy the variable importance of the rf model implied that the straw mulch 47 sediment yield 36 9 and straw incorporation 20 5 were the important influential factors of flow velocity fig 8 the flow velocity over thawed soil with straw mulching was significantly lower than that with straw incorporation in addition the straw mulch was an important influential factor affecting the sediment concentration fig 8 the variable importance of factors influenced the sediment concentration in the following order time 23 4 unit stream power 18 2 straw mulch 10 2 straw incorporation 1 4 the variable importance of time unit stream power and straw mulch were greater than 10 and the variable importance of time was the highest among all factors furthermore the straw mulch also has a certain influence on d50 of transported sediment fig 8 and the variable importance was greater than 15 the most important parameter for predicting d50 is shear stress 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration under different conditions in this study the total erosion of thawed and frozen soil increased significantly compared with that of unfrozen soil similar results were found in previous studies wang et al 2020 wei et al 2018 for example wang et al 2018 reported that shallow thawed slope showed stronger sediment yield capacity than that on the frozen slope under 4 l min 1 flow rate wei et al 2018 also found that the soil loss under the f t cycle was higher than that of the control treatment in addition the rill depth and width of thawed soil effectively increased the possible explanation is that more runoff energy was available to drive the rill horizontal evolution towards sidewalls and vertical evolution downward for thawed soil which caused the rill depth and width of thawed soil to increase by 38 9 and 6 7 respectively compared with that of unfrozen soil barnes et al 2016 and ferrick and gatto 2010 also reported that the rill depth width cross sectional area and soil erosion after the soil suffered the effects of freeze thaw were significantly greater than those of unfrozen soil a possible explanation is that the expansion of ice reduces the stability of soil aggregates during the freezing period and the soil aggregates were broken into fine particles altun et al 2009 therefore more sediments were easily detached and transported along with thawed soil during the process of erosion compared with that on unfrozen soil under the same conditions wang et al 2020 wang et al 2017 furthermore the difference in soil erodibility is another possible reason the effects of freeze thaw decreased the soil erodibility and critical shear stress leading to the increase of soil erosion rate wang et al 2020 liu et al 2017 the soil erosion rate sediment concentration and flow velocity decreased with increasing time figs 3 4 and 5 the decrease rate of the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 became weaker with increasing time at the later stage of the experiment the reason for this trend may be explained by the relatively steady state of rill flow at the later stage and the rill channel has gradually transited from the rapid development of rills to the mature rill previous studies have demonstrated that water flow gradually transitions from shallow flow to rill flow with increasing time throughout the process of rill erosion yang et al 2020 this trend was also found in this study yang et al 2020 suggested that this trend was related to the variations in flow velocity with time and the variations in bed roughness caused by rill erosion at the earlier stage of the experiment there was no significant difference between the bed surface roughness and that before the experiment additionally the flow velocity was higher at the earlier stage of the experiment because less flow energy needed to be consumed to overcome the resistance the rill width and depth gradually increased as time increased the formation of rill sidewalls led to an increase in the hydraulic resistance which consumed more flow energy furthermore the detachment of soil particles and the transport of sediment also consumed the flow energy wang et al 2020 wei et al 2018 the 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 kg m 2 mulch cover rates reduced d50 of transported sediment by 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 respectively however there were no significant differences in d50 of transported sediment between the slopes with straw incorporation and those without straw incorporation the results showed that the straw mulch effectively retarded surface runoff and intercepted macroaggregate the finer sizes are more likely to be entrained furthermore liu et al 2020 reported that the flow velocity decreased with the exponential function and the straw incorporation can reduce the flow velocity by more than 50 although similar trends were found in our study the interception efficiency of straw mulch on flow velocity and soil erosion was better than that of straw incorporation a possible explanation is that the freezing and thawing processes alter the connection modes of soil particles and cause soil structural deterioration wang et al 2020 soil structural deterioration canceled out that positive effect of straw incorporation for soil and water conservations the straw mulch reduces erosion much more effectively than straw incorporation 5 2 comparison of sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 new model with other models according to the results shown in table 4 the sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 of the training and testing datasets could be sufficiently estimated by the machine learning rf model and the prediction accuracy of the rf model was much higher than that of the sr svm and bp models the superior performance of rf was expected because it was often the best model among multiple machine learning methods which has been reported in previous studies zhou et al 2020 nussbaum et al 2018 fernández delgado et al 2014 rf has a better performance for estimating flow velocity and sediment concentration because many regression trees are ensembled in rf models the instability of the single tree model is minimized by aggregating multiple trees breiman 1996 each single regression tree variable is randomly selected which reduces the potential model bias when several variables are more frequently used to decide node splitting rules than other variables breiman 2001 variable importance analysis showed that the straw mulch was the essential factor of flow velocity it was easy to see that the plant covering increased the soil surface roughness and more flow energy was consumed by overcoming resistance indicating that the flow velocity change is closely related to the straw mulch liu et al 2020 rahma et al 2013 rahma et al 2019 the variable importance of time was the highest among all factors for sediment concentration this trend was attributed to the high soil erosion rate at the earlier stage of the experiment and the soil erosion rate consistently decreased with increasing time fig 2 for example when the mulch cover rate was 0 2 kg m 2 the soil erosion rate decreased from 0 27 kg m 2 min 1 in the first minute to 0 02 kg m 2 min 1 in the 20 min comparing the performance of the rf model based on the regression tree algorithm and sr model based on the stepwise regression analyses with the models reported in previous studies ban et al 2017a govers 1992 lei et al 2001 luo et al 2020 nearing et al 1999 the rf model showed better performance nse 0 909 rrmse 0 303 table 5 when the models reported by govers 1992 and nearing et al 1999 were used to calculate the flow velocity the re ranged from 67 619 to 74 968 and from 229 819 to 50 745 respectively table 5 these results suggest that all flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration values were underestimated considering this significant effect of straw mulch on flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration the models reported in previous studies seem impossible to be suitable for calculating flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 on slopes with straw mulching when the rf model was used to predict sediment concentration flow velocity and d50 respectively the mre decreased from 3322 190 42 990 and 79 466 to 18 005 0 813 and 2 607 respectively furthermore the rf algorithm builds the model by considering the importance of data unlike the models reported in previous studies which use the most correlated data the rf model can better capture complex interactions between features in the data compared to other regression models which makes the rf model show an excellent bias variance for predicting flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 overall the rf model could accurately predict the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 6 conclusions in this study the effects of straw mulch and straw incorporation on soil erosion and sediment transport were investigated the flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration of thawed soil were compared with that of unfrozen and frozen soil the results showed that the d50 of transported sediment and flow velocity of thawed soil decreased significantly compared with those of unfrozen soil while the soil erosion rate increased significantly the maximum flow velocity over thawed soil decreased by 20 7 compared with that over frozen soil the maximum flow velocity in this experiment was observed over frozen soil the sediment yield and the soil erosion rate on the slopes with straw mulch were significantly slowed down the interception efficiency of straw mulch on flow velocity and soil erosion was better than that of straw incorporation the d50 of transported sediment on thawed soil with straw mulching was lower than that without cover and the flow velocity decreased with increasing straw incorporation and mulch cover rates although the straw incorporation affected the sediment yield soil erosion rate and flow velocity it was not dominant compared with the influence of straw mulch in addition the rf and sr models were developed for predicting the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 the rf model can predict the flow velocity sediment concentration and d50 with high accuracy in general the machine learning model has avoided the error caused by overfitting the rf model can facilitate the prediction of flow velocity d50 and sediment concentration which establishes a foundation for further research this technique can estimate d50 flow velocities and sediment concentration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

3273,rainfall is a key driver of geomorphological processes ranging from impacting drops that lead to the small scale dislodgement of soil particles to large scale morphogenic floods and rainfall induced hillslope processes although rainfall has been identified in seismic records the associated power spectral density and its quantitative relation to the underlying physical processes have not yet been studied here we analyze nearly 2 years of combined seismic and optical disdrometer measurements where the latter enables the drop based quantification of rainfall physical properties our measurements confirm the broadband observation of ground velocity power spectral density due to rainfall allowing the seismic identification of rainfall at intensities as low as 1 mm h seismic power p shows a power law scaling with rainfall intensity i and kinetic energy e p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 the observed scaling relations are consistent between the three monitored sites although there are absolute differences in seismic power of about 1 order of magnitude which are likely due to variability in landcover and subsurface seismic properties with a physical model we demonstrate that the observed power law relations are set by an underlying linear relation between seismic power and rainfall impulse power and that the associated exponent values of i and e are due to the covariance of the raindrop size distribution with the total number of drops the largest raindrop fractions whose relative contribution increases with rainfall intensity dominate the seismic signal where in our case 90 of the seismic power is attributed to drops larger than 3 mm using our model we estimate the contributing area of rainfall to seismic observations to be within a radial distance of 5 25 m the spatially integrated nature of the seismic measurements and their sensitivity to large raindrops which control the disaggregation and the mobilization of soil particles make seismic records well suited for the investigation of soil erosion processes more generally our work provides a basis for the temporally resolved seismic quantification of rainfall that drives the dynamics of various hydro

rainfall was actually detected depended on the local landcover dietze et al 2017a and substrate burtin et al 2011 2013 but also on the relative contributions of other sources of ground vibrations including anthropogenic noise e g d alessandro et al 2021 or river flow gimbert et al 2014 roth et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies devoted to evaluating the relation between seismic power spectral density and rainfall physical properties this is the objective of the present study we present temporally resolved measurements of seismic power and raindrop size and velocity distributions which we obtain using an optical disdrometer löffler mang joss 2000 we relate observed seismic power to rainfall intensity kinetic energy and impulse power and explain the obtained scaling relations using a seismic physical framework adapted from tsai et al 2012 through applying this framework we quantitatively assess the seismic power spectral density generated by raindrops that hit the ground surrounding a seismic instrument with this work we seek to provide a fundamental basis for the application of seismic records ranging from dedicated field experiments to readily available long term network station measurements to study rainfall dynamics soil erosion and rainfall induced hydro geomorphological processes 2 theory 2 1 physical measures of rainfall bulk physical measures of rainfall can be derived from the observation of individual raindrops using a disdrometer typical measures are rainfall intensity i in mm h and rainfall kinetic energy e in j m2 h which are quantified based on the number of drops that are registered for a range of drop diameter and velocity categories which we refer to with subscripts i and j respectively e g angulo martínez et al 2018 1a i 4 3 π c i i n i d i 0 5 d i 3 1b e 2 3 π ρ w c e i j n i j d i 0 5 d i 3 v j 2 where d i is the mean equivalent drop diameter of category i and v j is the mean vertical drop velocity for category j and n i j d i n i j a d i t is the number of drops per category n i j divided by the effective surface area a d i and temporal resolution t of monitoring lastly c i and c e are unit conversion factors of respectively 3 6 106 mm m s h and 3600 s h and ρ w is the density of water 1000 kg m3 note that n i j d i is a flux based measure and not a volume based measure as often used in studies addressing radar reflectivity e g uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 and i and e are effectively measures for the volume flux density where 4 3 π 0 5 d i 3 is the volume v of a spherical drop and kinetic energy flux density since they are quantified per unit area and time when parametrizing rainfall the relevance of raindrop diameter d is evident from equations 1a and 1b even more so when considering that v typically depends on d e g beard 1976 if we assume terminal velocity is reached v v t d and the absence of vertical wind effects e g erpul et al 2003 montero martínez garcía garcía 2016 then v may be quantified as a function of d using a simple power law relation atlas ulbrich 1977 2 v t d 3 78 10 3 d 0 67 we now introduce the raindrop flux density per unit drop diameter n d d

vibrations due to raindrop impacts we adopt a seismic framework that was developed for the quantification of bedload transport gimbert et al 2019 tsai et al 2012 we consider a force time series f t d due to the impact of a single raindrop with diameter d on a bare ground surface assuming an instantaneous impact the force integrated over the impact duration corresponds to a change of momentum which is equal to the drop impulse j d johnson 1987 tsai et al 2012 3a 3b f t d j d δ t j d 4 3 π ρ w γ 0 5 d 3 v where δ is a dirac delta function for which t δ t d t 1 we assume a fully inelastic impact γ 1 where the drop kinetic energy is expended during the splash e g guigon et al 2008 in equation 3b we express j d as a function of d because we can estimate v with v t d using equation 2 the assumption of an impact that is instantaneous relative to our seismic observations may be justified as we typically consider ground vibrations in the range 5 200 hz which corresponds to time intervals of 5 200 ms that are longer than the expected drop impact duration on a rigid surface which is typically of the order of 1 ms or less e g li et al 2014 nearing et al 1986 schmid et al 2021 for simplicity here we do not account for different types of surface properties e g soil type near surface vegetation etc or the development of a thin water layer at the surface nouhou bako et al 2016 yu hopkins 2018 which will affect both the impact duration and mechanics at any location the absolute vertical ground velocity in the frequency domain u d f r where f is frequency can be related to the force spectrum of an impact f d which is the fourier transform of f t and the fourier transform of a displacement green s function g f r which converts the force into a displacement and describes the frequency dependent attenuation of the displacement with radial distance r from the impact location aki richards 2002 tsai et al 2012 4 u d f r 2 π f f d g f r in order to obtain the power spectral density of the vertical ground motion p f u f 2 t 1 we first need to calculate the force power spectrum of raindrop impacts per unit area and time f a 2 by integrating f a 2 d over the impacts from drops of all sizes when we assume the temporally random occurrence of impacts we can derive gimbert et al 2019 tsai et al 2012 5 f a 2 d n d d j 2 d d d substituting equation 3b into equation 5 and discretizing drop diameter into categories i and j we define the impulse power density flux j p that can be calculated from disdrometer measurements as 6 j p 4 3 π ρ w 2 γ i j n i j d 0 5 d i 6 v j 2 similar to rainfall intensity and kinetic energy we can express the impulse power j p as a function of the total raindrop flux density the drop size distribution and the drop diameter as j p n tot p d d 7 34 to obtain the power spectral density p f at any location we subsequently integrate the impulse power contributions over all source to receiver distances r using g 2 f r here we assume uniformly distributed raindrop impacts over an infinitely large rain field which allows us to derive 7 p f 8 π 3 f 2 r j p g 2 f r r d r in section 5 2 we will discuss the displacement green s function for rayleigh waves g f r i e waves that travel along the surface and lead to vertical and longitudinal ground motion and how this function affects the magnitude of the observed seismic power and the spatial contribution of rainfall to seismic power 2 3 scaling of seismic power with rainfall based on our seismic framework we expect a linear scaling relation between rainfall induced seismic power and the impulse power due to impacting drops p j p n tot p d d 7 33 this scaling should always be obtained regardless of whether p d varies systematically or not with n tot for the relation of p vs i and p vs e which are more common bulk measures for rainfall no unique scaling relation can be given as there is no unique relation between p d and n tot nonetheless we explore the scaling of p vs i and p vs e based on three idealized cases following uijlenhoet et al 2003 1 number controlled rainfall in this case we assume that all changes in i and e are due to changes in the number of drops thus we consider a constant drop diameter d and therefore also a constant p d and v d which leads to i n tot e n tot and p n tot this implies that seismic power would scale linearly with rainfall intensity but also with kinetic energy or other measures such as momentum p i and p e 2 size controlled rainfall in this case we assume that all changes in i and e are due to changes in drop size and consider a constant drop density n tot and drop size distribution p d this leads to a scaling of i d 3 e d 4 33 and p d 7 33 through combining the former two scaling relations with the latter we obtain the power law scaling relations p i 2 4 and p e 1 7 3 intermediate rainfall in this case we assume equal proportions of the endmember cases of size and number controlled rainfall to cope with the dependency of p d on n tot we follow the method of uijlenhoet et al 2003 which is based on a scaling law framework developed by sempere torres et al 1994 1998 for details on the method and derivation see appendix a this allows us to obtain the power law scaling relations with exponents that are only slightly smaller than for size controlled rainfall namely p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 3 methods 3 1 study area we study the seismic record of rainfall in a mountainous mesoscale catchment the galabre in the southeast of france 679 1909 m fig 1 a which is part of the draix bléone long term critical zone observatory legout et al 2021 the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1000 mm and falls mostly during the spring and autumn with occasional high intensity and short duration 1 2 h convectional thunderstorms in the summer and autumn navratil et al 2012 the catchment is covered mostly with forests and shrublands but also contains relatively small but highly erodible badlands nearly 10 of the surface area e g visible in the top center of fig 1d that yield large amounts of suspended sediment at the basin outlet esteves et al 2019 legout et al 2013 poulenard et al 2012 two locations within the galabre catchment are studied ainac in the upstream part of the catchment and robine sur galabre r s g in the downstream part of the catchment fig 1a we first address the rainfall induced seismic power using a dedicated set of colocated measurements for rainfall events at ainac 1170 m in the period march april 2021 fig 1e we subsequently verify our findings with a longer dataset february 2019 december 2020 that encompasses year round rainfall events for two geophones near r s g upstream 731 m fig 1f and downstream 679 m fig 1g these seismic measurements are not colocated with the disdrometer in the village of robine sur galabre fig 1d but lie at a distance of respectively 500 m and 2 15 km from the disdrometer 3 2 meteorological measurements meteorological data were obtained from the meteorological stations at ainac and r s g fig 1a details on the data acquisition and availability are provided in legout et al 2021 in this study we use 1 min resolution data of rainfall intensity and the distributions of equivalent drop diameter and vertical fall velocity obtained by ott parsivel2 optical disdrometers e g angulo martínez et al 2018 tokay et al 2014 the disdrometers function based on a horizontal plane of light that is set up between a transmitter and receiver a is schematically added to the image in fig 1b the instrument registers the reduction in transmitted light as a drop passes through this plane which is a measure for the drop size and the duration of the reduced transmission which is a measure for the vertical velocity of the drop löffler mang joss 2000 to account for edge effects where particularly large drops are only partly registered battaglia et al 2010 the effective sampling area to determine n i j d i is estimated as a d i 0 18 0 03 d i 2 following tokay et al 2014 the number of drops per minute are counted for 32 diameter classes and 32 velocity classes 1024 classes in total that progressively increase in bin size e g the larger the drop diameter the larger the range of drop diameters that are included in the class we consider only 20 diameter classes excluding drop counts for d i 0 25 mm as drops of this size are near or below the limit of instrument detection tokay et al 2014 and drop counts for d i 7 mm as they exceed the maximum expected size of raindrops pruppacher klett 2010 and are prone to erroneous detection hachani et al 2017 jaffrain et al 2011 we present i e and j p values that we calculate using equations 1a 1b and 6 rather than for i and e the values that are directly provided by the parsivel2 disdrometer following an undisclosed proprietary routine we note that the values marginally differ between the two approaches with differences of less than 0 1 mm h for more than 95 of the non zero rainfall measurements 3 3 seismic measurements we performed seismic measurements with geophones that were installed for the long term monitoring of flow and bedload transport near the upstream esteves et al 2019 navratil et al 2011 and downstream measurement station nord et al 2020 at r s g the geophones are located approximately 30 40 m from the galabre river fig 1f and g in addition to river generated seismic power we observe the contributions of traffic as the geophones are located at a distance of 10 m from the road fig 1f and g for this study we also placed a geophone at the meteorological station ainac fig 1c and e where anthropogenic and river contributions are considered minimal we installed the 3 sensor pe 6 b geophones at a depth of approximately 25 cm into the ground fig 1c which consists of quaternary sedimentary deposits although bedrock is present in the near subsurface the geophones measure the vertical ground velocity which is recorded on a digos data cube logger we recorded the data with a temporal resolution of 400 hz for the r s g upstream and downstream sites and a resolution of 800 hz at ainac at this site we measure only in the vertical direction not in the horizontal directions as in r s g allowing a higher acquisition rate we derived the power spectral density p f in m s 2 hz for 3 second time periods using the method of welch 1967 for frequencies from 5 hz lower limit associated with instrument response to 200 hz for the r s g sites and in the case of ainac up to 400 hz upper limit associated with the temporal resolution of the measurements we aggregated the 3 second p f values to 1 minute periods the temporal resolution of the rainfall data by determining the 10th percentile to eliminate short lived but potentially large magnitude seismic power contributions from anthropogenic noise operation of machinery passing cars human footsteps etc e g d alessandro et al 2021 or due to the occasional occurrence of small earthquakes during the study period 4 earthquakes of ml 1 6 2 3 were registered in the region for more details on the seismic data processing we refer to bakker et al 2020 3 4 scaling analysis to assess the power law scaling of seismic power with bulk rainfall parameters theoretical scaling relations in section 2 3 we use major axis regression that accounts for uncertainties in both axes through minimizing the sum of squares of the perpendicular distances between each point and the regression line e g bakker et al 2020 this typically leads to a steeper scaling than ordinary least squares approaches mcardle 1988 further we use spearman s rank correlation to assess the correlation strength because we use non linear axes 10log10 scale with seismic power in db to constrain the uncertainties in the scaling analysis we discard data for time steps where 1 temperatures are smaller than or equal to 0 c thus avoiding albeit but not entirely excluding precipitation in the form of snow and 2 the calculated rainfall intensity based on the drop size distribution equation 1a is not within a factor 2 of the value directly provided by the disdrometer we verified that the magnitude of this factor does not affect the scaling results for the non colocated datasets at r s g we also remove the first and last 5 min of each rainfall period to avoid outliers associated with the presence or absence of rainfall 4 results 4 1 rainfall physical parameters from disdrometer measurements before comparing seismic power with rainfall parameters we first establish the relation between raindrop diameter d and velocity v the relation between drop size distribution p d and rainfall intensity i and the relations amongst the integral rainfall parameters intensity i kinetic energy e and impulse power j p for the period february 2019 to december 2020 at r s g ainac station shows similar trends these are not shown because of the limited amount of data only april may 2021 which leads us to consider that the meteorological conditions at the two sites with 5 km distance and 430 m elevation difference between them did not differ significantly during the study period consistent with previous studies see section 2 1 we find that vertical raindrop velocity strongly depends on raindrop diameter fig 2 the observed velocities are accurately predicted using the terminal velocity power law model of atlas and ulbrich 1977 equation 2 up to a maximum velocity of approximately 9 5 m s carollo ferro 2015 near d 4 mm as the drop diameter increases the bin size of the measurements increases and velocities become more scattered velocities smaller than 4 m s may be due to the presence of snow at temperatures just above 0 c which results in larger uncertainties in the derived physical parameters i e and j p the raindrop size distribution evolves with rainfall intensity at a 1 minute resolution where the average drop diameter increases and the distribution becomes wider at higher rainfall intensities fig 3 a this coarsening trend is most prominent for rainfall intensities up to circa 60 mm h when the drop size distribution stabilizes which is in line with observations from carollo et al 2016 kinnell 1981 and rosewell 1986 the coarse tail of the distribution where d is larger than 2 3 mm which corresponds to less than 1 of the raindrops shows a scaling comparable to p d d 7 33 given that j p n tot p d d 7 33 section 2 3 this would imply for j p d that a decrease in the number of drops n tot p d with increasing d may be more than compensated by the increase in impulse of those drops due to the increase in d the drops in the large size classes may therefore provide the largest contribution to j p despite their relatively infrequent occurrence fig 3b this effect is prominent for rainfall intensities from 1 mm h and higher where the largest drops d of circa 5 mm contribute the most unfortunately the registration of these large drops in disdrometer measurements is subject to considerable uncertainties the potential implications for seismic measurements are considerable where circa 90 of the impulse power which is expected to set the seismic power j p p is due to drops of d 3 mm which represent only 0 2 of the total number of drops and 15 of the total rainfall volume inset fig 3b as a result of deviations in the proposed raindrop diameter vs velocity scaling above and below d 4 mm fig 2 and a changing drop size distribution with rainfall intensity above and below i 60 mm h fig 3a it may not be possible to capture the scaling of j p with i and e in a single power law we would rather expect a change from partly drop size dominated rainfall with scaling exponents associated with j p vs i and j p vs e that are well above 1 but below respectively 2 4 and 1 7 for rainfall intensities below 60 mm h to number dominated rainfall at higher rainfall intensities where p i and p e section 2 3 in practice however the observed scaling exponents are relatively constant the j p vs i dataset shows a scaling with an exponent of circa 2 1 while the j p vs e dataset which exhibits considerably less scatter shows a scaling exponent of circa 1 6 fig 4 these values correspond to the predicted values for intermediate rainfall section 2 3 a decrease in the scaling exponents at rainfall intensities above 60 mm h is not evident although the number of observations at these high intensities are limited for low amounts of rainfall a change in scaling is observed near 0 3 mm h and 0 6 j m2 h fig 4 but this is likely associated with limitations of the disdrometer to adequately register these low numbers of small raindrops following our seismic framework where p j p section 2 2 the same scaling exponents as found for impulse power j p i 2 1 and j p e 1 6 are expected for seismic power p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 4 2 colocated seismic and disdrometer measurements of rainfall events for the colocated measurements at ainac rainfall events can be identified in the spectrogram that shows the seismic power per frequency over time at frequencies above 50 hz fig 5 the registered seismic power due to rainfall spans multiple orders of magnitude reaching values up to 140 db the color scale in fig 5a is limited to 150 db for visualization purposes the rainfall events can be readily distinguished from intermittent noise effects at this site presumably due to human activities or livestock that are typically lower in frequency prominent in the range 20 35 hz but present up to 80 hz and lower in seismic power fig 5a the onset phases of low and high intensity rainfall and the end of rainfall events are directly captured in the seismic signal showing no evidence of lag effects example in fig 5c and 5d for a detailed view of all rainfall events in the period 10 23 april see rain events ainac avi in the supplementary materials for the colocated measurements at ainac rainfall events can be identified in the spectrogram that shows the seismic power per frequency over time at frequencies above 50 hz fig 5 the registered seismic power due to rainfall spans multiple orders of magnitude reaching values up to 140 db the color scale in fig 5a is limited to 150 db for visualization purposes the rainfall events can be readily distinguished from intermittent noise effects at this site presumably due to human activities or livestock that are typically

directly captured in the seismic signal showing no evidence of lag effects example in fig 5c and d for a detailed view of all rainfall events in the period 10 23 april see rain events ainac avi in the supplementary materials there is a strong correlation between seismic power on one hand and the disdrometer based measures of rainfall intensity kinetic energy and impulse power on the other hand fig 6 at this particular site ainac rainfall can be detected at seismic power as low as circa 175 db given that the contributions of background noise sources are limited as indicated with the mean μ and standard deviations σ of seismic power in the absence of rainfall fig 6 we estimate the lower detection limit for rainfall intensity to be 0 7 mm h which is slightly higher than the break in scaling in fig 4 the corresponding detection limits for kinetic energy and impulse power are respectively 5 8 j m2 h and 5 10 9 n2s m2 to describe seismic power as a function of the rainfall physical parameters at ainac we fit power law scaling relations to nearly 10 h of minute based data where p is larger than one standard deviation above the mean noise level and where the rainfall parameters are larger than the limit of detection data included in the boxed areas in fig 6 which is 43 of the total dataset we find the linear scaling of seismic power with impulse power p j p fig 6c as expected based on our seismic framework section 2 2 the scaling exponents of p vs i and e are very similar to the values for intermediate rainfall section 2 3 and the exponents we established based on nearly 2 years of disdrometer data at r s g fig 4 for values below the identified thresholds of the rainfall parameters the data deviates from the established trends due to both the relatively large contributions of noise effects and limitations of the disdrometer measurements fig 4 the scaling relations in fig 6 are derived for a chosen frequency range of 80 120 hz and may vary with frequency fig 7 a for lower frequencies the seismic power associated with rainfall is relatively low and noise effects are dominant fig 5 which leads to lower and sometimes negative scaling exponents not shown and weaker correlation particularly for f 40 hz fig 7 for higher frequencies f 100 hz the effect of rainfall is clearly present although the scaling exponent slowly reduces with frequency which we relate to residual noise effects these are not entirely excluded when using the mean plus 1 standard deviation threshold that are more prominent at high frequencies where there is a lower signal to noise ratio fig 5c at these higher frequencies however good correlation values are maintained fig 7b differences in spearman s r values obtained with i e and j p are relatively small fig 7b and do not reflect the differences in scatter that we observed with the disdrometer fig 4 4 3 non colocated seismic and disdrometer measurements of year round rainfall at the r s g upstream and downstream sites the effect of rainfall on seismic power is visible for frequencies in the range 50 175 hz fig 8 the rainfall induced power spectral density is similar for both sites indicating that the differences in rainfall between the sites are relatively small and that the seismic wave propagation characteristics are comparable directly following rainfall events river generated seismic power is observed in the frequency range 10 50 hz fig 8e g and in the case of the upstream site also at higher frequencies in the range 100 150 hz this is possibly due to contributions of plunging flow aeration etc and or lower seismic attenuation that are specific to the bedrock nature of the channel here for these sites the spectrogram could only be determined up to 200 hz the rate of acquisition is lower than at ainac but we do expect that at higher frequencies up to 400 hz the seismic power is strongly dominated by rainfall similar to ainac fig 5 and that the contribution of river flow is strongly attenuated gimbert et al 2014 besides rainfall and river generated seismic power we observe a relatively constant diurnal pattern in seismic noise at both sites for frequencies up to 60 hz the observed seismic power during the day is typically 5 db higher than at night fig 8a and b most likely due to daytime traffic and human activities fig 1f and g the scaling relations between seismic power and the rainfall physical measures found for the r s g upstream and downstream sites fig 9 are very similar to those observed at ainac regression lines derived in fig 6 are added as a reference to fig 9 in the fitting we only consider data with river discharge below 0 2 m3 s to eliminate the contribution of river generated seismic power a 40 minute time delay is considered for the application of the upstream discharge data to the downstream station alternatively if we were to only consider data with discharge above 0 2 m3 s this would only lead to a very minor change in the p vs j p scaling exponents of less than 0 1 although the effect of river flow may be 15 db at the limit of rainfall detection in the case of the upstream site this effect is no longer noticeable at rainfall intensities of 10 mm h while at the downstream site the effect of river flow on the observed seismic power is insignificant in the considered frequency range fig 9 the absolute values of seismic power associated with the fitted power law functions are circa 5 db upstream and 10 db downstream lower than at ainac this applies to both rainfall induced seismic power as background noise indicating that these values are site specific rather than related to the rainfall i e the drop size distribution the differences in seismic power between the sites may be related to differences in the nature and structure of the subsurface that affect seismic wave attenuation the geophones were installed in a shallow soil at ainac fig 1b and in thicker alluvial deposits at the r s g sites which are particularly coarse cobble gravel at the downstream site see section 5 2 the scaling exponents at frequencies higher than 80 hz are more or less constant for the three sites signifying the extensive frequency range over which seismic observations are sensitive to rainfall fig 10 a and c for these frequencies the strength of the correlation is also relatively constant and varies little amongst the rainfall physical parameters fig 10b and d for the r s g upstream and downstream sites rainfall can be observed in the seismic measurements down to frequencies as low as 65 hz while at lower frequencies the correlation rapidly weakens at ainac this transition is lower near 40 hz likely due to lower contributions of noise from anthropogenic sources and from the river indicating that these effects could not be entirely eliminated at r s g despite the filtering of seismic data section 3 3 and only considering data where q 0 2 m3 s the 80 120 hz range that we use to illustrate the observations in figs 6 and 9 is suitable for the set of sites that we studied note that this range is not unique and that slightly lower or higher values could have also been considered but this may not generally be the case making it important to consider the scaling across the entire frequency range as done in figs 7 and 10 for the sites that we consider we also observe a general decrease in maximum correlation with distance between the geophones and disdrometer an r value of circa 0 8 for the colocated instruments at ainac a value of 0 6 0 7 with a distance of 500 m for the upstream geophone and a value of 0 5 0 6 with a distance of 2 15 km for the downstream geophone 5 discussion 5 1 scaling of seismic power with rainfall physical measures in this study we directly relate observations of seismic power spectral density to independently measured rainfall intensity kinetic energy and impulse power detecting rainfall at intensities as low as 1 mm h fig 5 the large bandwidth of rainfall induced seismic vibrations allows these to be readily distinguished from other sources such as diurnal fluctuations in anthropogenic noise or local river processes that follow rainfall events fig 8 at the sites we investigated we observed a strong correlation between seismic power p and impulse power j p figs 6 and 9 more critically we find that p scales linearly with j p providing convincing evidence that the seismic modelling framework adapted from tsai et al 2012 is applicable i e that ground vibrations are set by the impulse power of instantaneous and randomly occurring raindrop impacts in addition our dataset provides an independent confirmation of the same physical principles that are extensively applied to study bedload transport bakker et al 2020 chao et al 2015 lagarde et al 2021 and debris flows allstadt et al 2020 farin et al 2019 kean et al 2015 lai et al 2018 where field measurements of particle size distributions and fluxes are more difficult the impulse power of raindrops depends strongly on the drop diameter j p n tot p d d 7 33 and it is therefore expected that the seismic power is very sensitive to the largest impacting drops despite their relatively small abundance in our case approximately 90 of the impulse power that sets the seismic power was attributed to drops larger than 3 mm corresponding to 15 of the rainfall volume but these large drops occur considerably more frequently with above average rainfall intensities fig 3b a similar size dependency is also found for the seismic power due to bedload transport e g lagarde et al 2021 where p n tot p d d 6 5 and d in this case reflects the diameter of a saltating bed particle bakker et al 2020 and radar reflectivity factor z where z n tot p d d 5 33 e g uijlenhoet stricker 1999 wexler atlas 1963 for the application of all these measurements it is therefore critical to constrain p d and spatiotemporal changes in p d when studying fluxes such as rainfall intensity for rainfall observations the sensitivity to the largest drops fig 3b and strong correlation with kinetic energy fig 4b make seismic measurements more suitable to study soil erosion in particular to study soil particle detachment and transport by raindrop splash on a dry surface i e during the onset of the storm and in interrill areas and to a lesser extent where raindrops penetrate surface water and dislodge soil particles we do not account for the effect of surface water in our model that may then be readily transported in the flow kinnell 2005 in addition to the linear scaling of seismic power p with impulse power j p we found relatively constant power law scaling relations with the more commonly used measures of rainfall intensity i and kinetic energy e for rainfall intensities up to circa 50 100 mm h due to temporal changes in drop size distributions during rainfall events e g chapon et al 2008 lee zawadzki 2005 and on seasonal timescales e g seela et al 2018 smith et al 2009 the correlations of p vs i and to a lesser extent p vs e are expected to be weaker than that of p vs j p fig 4 in practice the observed differences were not discernable figs 7 and 10 and likely fall within the general uncertainty range associated with the measurements the exponents associated with the p vs i and p vs e power law relations are not unique and depend on the covariance of the total drop density flux n tot and the drop size distribution p d the scaling relations we obtained correspond to the intermediate rainfall case see section 2 3 where p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 when combining available records of seismic power and rainfall intensity from a rain gauge disdrometer or any other type of instrument scaling analysis may provide new insights into the spatio temporal variability of rainfall drop size distributions through changes in the scaling exponent and thus changes in meteorological conditions in addition such a p vs i scaling analysis will indirectly also provide insight into the scaling of p vs e through their relative dependencies on d if we make the parallel between seismic power and disdrometer based estimates of radar reflectivity

which may be due to concurrent orographic effects and the continental vs maritime character of rainfall hazenberg et al 2011 whereas we found negligible differences in scaling exponents between our sites fig 9 there are uncertainties associated with the measurement techniques and fitting and we may expect p vs i and p vs e scaling exponents to vary per climatic setting with at least 0 2 with maximum values of respectively 2 4 and 1 7 as set by size controlled rainfall at rainfall intensities higher than 50 100 mm h the obtained p vs i and p vs e scaling exponents are expected to decrease due to the emergence of a relatively constant drop size distribution fig 3 although we did not find evidence for such a transition in our seismic data figs 6 and 9 based on our scaling analysis the scaling exponent should decrease and may approach 1 in number controlled rainfall similar to the radar reflectivity factor z assouline 2020 uijlenhoet et al 2003 in theory scaling exponents of less

power seismic records provide an integrative measure of the raindrop impulse power over the ground surface area near the instrument equation 7 here we explore the spatial contribution of rainfall to

quantified with a function that describes the exponential decay with distance r to explore the extent of the surface area that contributes to the measured seismic observations we calculated the seismic power associated with the fundamental wave mode in a uniform generic bedrock subsurface following tsai et al 2012 details on the derivation of p rel and the used values of w p w g and k are provided in appendix b our calculations indicate that the largest seismic power contribution may be expected at a radial distance of the order of 0 1 1 m where lower frequencies will be susceptible to drop impacts from larger distances fig 11 a the cumulative seismic power reaches about half of the total expected power within a distance of the order of 1 10 m fig 11b while 90 of the total is expected to come from within 5 25 m from a seismic instrument due to the spatial distribution of rainfall impacts all around the instrument and at all distances from the instrument we expect rainfall to be prominent in the power spectral density over a large frequency range and in particular also at high frequencies this is also generally visible in the spectrograms figs 5 and 8 and the observed scaling with frequency figs 7 and 10 the spatial distribution of rainfall and the associated large frequency range for seismic observation contrast with more localized and distant sources such as river turbulence or bedload induced contributions in our case the river is at 30 40 m distance which are prominent at low frequencies due to the stronger attenuation at high frequencies near 20 m in

of magnitude differences in seismic power we observed amongst the sites fig 9 may be considered relatively modest although such order of magnitude differences in seismic power may lead to absolute differences of up to 2 orders of magnitude when deriving rainfall kinetic energy and intensity from the seismic record these may be easily constrained with independent measures of rainfall amounts and most importantly the characteristic scaling relations are maintained fig 9 in the future individual effects of surface and subsurface properties on the seismic observation of rainfall will need to be addressed using specifically designed field experiments our green s function modelling exercise provides a general spatial constraint on the contribution of rainfall impacts on seismic records the monitored surface area of 100 2000 m2 is up to 4 5 orders of magnitude larger than the surface area monitored with the disdrometer 0 0054 m2 where the spatial variability in rainfall may be

the scale of hillslopes to small mesoscale watersheds 6 conclusions our study provides a foundation for the seismic observation of rainfall whose effects have been previously identified but which have not been studied in detail we adapted a seismic framework for bedload transport tsai et al 2012 to assess the seismic power generated by impacting raindrops this enabled us to explain the observed linear relation between measured seismic power typically at frequencies well above 50 hz and the impulse power of raindrops calculated from disdrometer measurements p j p equation 8 figs 6 and 9 the scaling of seismic power with rainfall intensity and kinetic energy that we observed p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 were consistent between the studied sites fig 9 and conform to intermediate rainfall predictions equal proportions of size and number controlled rainfall uijlenhoet et al 2003 we could not discern systematic temporal changes in scaling e g event or seasonally based but do expect scaling exponents to vary with geographical setting and weather systems of particular importance is the contribution of the largest raindrop fractions where in our case 90 of the seismic power may be attributed to drops larger than 3 mm that correspond to only 15 of the rainfall volume fig 3b seismic measurements are most suitable to study rainfall with high intensities and relatively abundant large drops where high signal to noise ratios ensure reliable seismic measurements while disdrometer measurements are prone to uncertainty under such conditions the application of seismic measurements

3273,rainfall is a key driver of geomorphological processes ranging from impacting drops that lead to the small scale dislodgement of soil particles to large scale morphogenic floods and rainfall induced hillslope processes although rainfall has been identified in seismic records the associated power spectral density and its quantitative relation to the underlying physical processes have not yet been studied here we analyze nearly 2 years of combined seismic and optical disdrometer measurements where the latter enables the drop based quantification of rainfall physical properties our measurements confirm the broadband observation of ground velocity power spectral density due to rainfall allowing the seismic identification of rainfall at intensities as low as 1 mm h seismic power p shows a power law scaling with rainfall intensity i and kinetic energy e p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 the observed scaling relations are consistent between the three monitored sites although there are absolute differences in seismic power of about 1 order of magnitude which are likely due to variability in landcover and subsurface seismic properties with a physical model we demonstrate that the observed power law relations are set by an underlying linear relation between seismic power and rainfall impulse power and that the associated exponent values of i and e are due to the covariance of the raindrop size distribution with the total number of drops the largest raindrop fractions whose relative contribution increases with rainfall intensity dominate the seismic signal where in our case 90 of the seismic power is attributed to drops larger than 3 mm using our model we estimate the contributing area of rainfall to seismic observations to be within a radial distance of 5 25 m the spatially integrated nature of the seismic measurements and their sensitivity to large raindrops which control the disaggregation and the mobilization of soil particles make seismic records well suited for the investigation of soil erosion processes more generally our work provides a basis for the temporally resolved seismic quantification of rainfall that drives the dynamics of various hydro

lead to changes in surface microtopography planchon mouche 2010 and near surface compaction and clogging which affect the capacity of rainwater to infiltrate into the ground e g assouline mualem 1997 helalia et al 1988 these processes condition the availability and size of particles at the ground surface which can subsequently be entrained by surface runoff gabet dunne 2003 neave rayburg 2007 zhou

rainfall was actually detected depended on the local landcover dietze et al 2017a and substrate burtin et al 2011 2013 but also on the relative contributions of other sources of ground vibrations including anthropogenic noise e g d alessandro et al 2021 or river flow gimbert et al 2014 roth et al 2016 however to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies devoted to evaluating the relation between seismic power spectral density and rainfall physical properties this is the objective of the present study we present temporally resolved measurements of seismic power and raindrop size and velocity distributions which we obtain using an optical disdrometer löffler mang joss 2000 we relate observed seismic power to rainfall intensity kinetic energy and impulse power and explain the obtained scaling relations using a seismic physical framework adapted from tsai et al 2012 through applying this framework we quantitatively assess the seismic power spectral density generated by raindrops that hit the ground surrounding a seismic instrument with this work we seek to provide a fundamental basis for the application of seismic records ranging from dedicated field experiments to readily available long term network station measurements to study rainfall dynamics soil erosion and rainfall induced hydro geomorphological processes 2 theory 2 1 physical measures of rainfall bulk physical measures of rainfall can be derived from the observation of individual raindrops using a disdrometer typical measures are rainfall intensity i in mm h and rainfall kinetic energy e in j m2 h which are quantified based on the number of drops that are registered for a range of drop diameter and velocity categories which we refer to with subscripts i and j respectively e g angulo martínez et al 2018 1a i 4 3 π c i i n i d i 0 5 d i 3 1b e 2 3 π ρ w c e i j n i j d i 0 5 d i 3 v j 2 where d i is the mean equivalent drop diameter of category i and v j is the mean vertical drop velocity for category j and n i j d i n i j a d i t is the number of drops per category n i j divided by the effective surface area a d i and temporal resolution t of monitoring lastly c i and c e are unit conversion factors of respectively 3 6 106 mm m s h and 3600 s h and ρ w is the density of water 1000 kg m3 note that n i j d i is a flux based measure and not a volume based measure as often used in studies addressing radar reflectivity e g uijlenhoet and stricker 1999 and i and e are effectively measures for the volume flux density where 4 3 π 0 5 d i 3 is the volume v of a spherical drop and kinetic energy flux density since they are quantified per unit area and time when parametrizing rainfall the relevance of raindrop diameter d is evident from equations 1a and 1b even more so when considering that v typically depends on d e g beard 1976 if we assume terminal velocity is reached v v t d and the absence of vertical wind effects e g erpul et al 2003 montero martínez garcía garcía 2016 then v may be quantified as a function of d using a simple power law relation atlas ulbrich 1977 2 v t d 3 78 10 3 d 0 67 we now introduce the raindrop flux density per unit drop diameter n d d that is quantified as n d d n tot p d where n tot is the total number of drops n tot per unit area and time and p d is the drop size distribution for the entire distribution i j n i j d i d n d d d d various functions have been proposed to describe drop size distributions e g weibull log normal etc for review see serio et al 2019 that typically vary with geographical setting continental vs maritime and orography e g hachani et al 2017 rosenfeld ulbrich 2003 and vary with weather systems typically stratiform vs convective rainfall e g kirsch et al 2019 tokay short 1996 the raindrop size distribution depends on mechanisms of drop formation and the subsequent interaction between drops i e the coalescence and breakup of drops assouline mualem 1989 hu srivastava 1995 low list 1982 where p d may be expressed as a power law function of n tot sempere torres et al 1994 for the scaling analysis in section 2 3 we express rainfall intensity and kinetic energy as a function of the total raindrop flux density the drop size distribution and the drop diameter i n tot p d d 3 and e n tot p d d 4 33 e g uijlenhoet stricker 1999 2 2 seismic framework of raindrop impacts to assess ground vibrations due to raindrop impacts we adopt a seismic framework that was developed for the quantification of bedload transport gimbert et al 2019 tsai et al 2012 we consider a force time series f t d due to the impact of a single raindrop with diameter d on a bare ground surface assuming an instantaneous impact the force integrated over the impact duration corresponds to a change of momentum which is equal to the drop impulse j d johnson 1987 tsai et al 2012 3a 3b f t d j d δ t j d 4 3 π ρ w γ 0 5 d 3 v where δ is a dirac delta function for which t δ t d t 1 we assume a fully inelastic impact γ 1 where the drop kinetic energy is expended during the splash e g guigon et al 2008 in equation 3b we express j d as a function of d because we can estimate v with v t d using equation 2 the assumption of an impact that is instantaneous relative to our seismic observations may be justified as we typically consider ground vibrations in the range 5 200 hz which corresponds to time intervals of 5 200 ms that are longer than the expected drop impact duration on a rigid surface which is typically of the order of 1 ms or less e g li et al 2014 nearing et al 1986 schmid et al 2021 for simplicity here we do not account for different types of surface properties e g soil type near surface vegetation etc or the development of a thin water layer at the surface nouhou bako et al 2016 yu hopkins 2018 which will affect both the impact duration and mechanics at any location the absolute vertical ground velocity in the frequency domain u d f r where f is frequency can be related to the force spectrum of an impact f d which is the fourier transform of f t and the fourier transform of a displacement green s function g f r which converts the force into a displacement and describes the frequency dependent attenuation of the displacement with radial distance r from the impact location aki richards 2002 tsai et al 2012 4 u d f r 2 π f f d g f r in order to obtain the power spectral density of the vertical ground motion p f u f 2 t 1 we first need to calculate the force power spectrum of raindrop impacts per unit area and time f a 2 by integrating f a 2 d over the impacts from drops of all sizes when we assume the temporally random occurrence of impacts we can derive gimbert et al 2019 tsai et al 2012 5 f a 2 d n d d j 2 d d d substituting equation 3b into equation 5 and discretizing drop diameter into categories i and j we define the impulse power density flux j p that can be calculated from disdrometer measurements as 6 j p 4 3 π ρ w 2 γ i j n i j d 0 5 d i 6 v j 2 similar to rainfall intensity and kinetic energy we can express the impulse power j p as a function of the total raindrop flux density the drop size distribution and the drop diameter as j p n tot p d d 7 34 to obtain the power spectral density p f at any location we subsequently integrate the impulse power contributions over all source to receiver distances r using g 2 f r here we assume uniformly distributed raindrop impacts over an infinitely large rain field which allows us to derive 7 p f 8 π 3 f 2 r j p g 2 f r r d r in section 5 2 we will discuss the displacement green s function for rayleigh waves g f r i e waves that travel along the surface and lead to vertical and longitudinal ground motion and how this function affects the magnitude of the observed seismic power and the spatial contribution of rainfall to seismic power 2 3 scaling of seismic power with rainfall based on our seismic framework we expect a linear scaling relation between rainfall induced seismic power and the impulse power due to impacting drops p j p n tot p d d 7 33 this scaling should always be obtained regardless of whether p d varies systematically or not with n tot for the relation of p vs i and p vs e which are more common bulk measures for rainfall no unique scaling relation can be given as there is no unique relation between p d and n tot nonetheless we explore the scaling of p vs i and p vs e based on three idealized cases following uijlenhoet et al 2003 1 number controlled rainfall in this case we assume that all changes in i and e are due to changes in the number of drops thus we consider a constant drop diameter d and therefore also a constant p d and v d which leads to i n tot e n tot and p n tot this implies that seismic power would scale linearly with rainfall intensity but also with kinetic energy or other measures such as momentum p i and p e 2 size controlled rainfall in this case we assume that all changes in i and e are due to changes in drop size and consider a constant drop density n tot and drop size distribution p d this leads to a scaling of i d 3 e d 4 33 and p d 7 33 through combining the former two scaling relations with the latter we obtain the power law scaling relations p i 2 4 and p e 1 7 3 intermediate rainfall in this case we assume equal proportions of the endmember cases of size and number controlled rainfall to cope with the dependency of p d on n tot we follow the method of uijlenhoet et al 2003 which is based on a scaling law framework developed by sempere torres et al 1994 1998 for details on the method and derivation see appendix a this allows us to obtain the power law scaling relations with exponents that are only slightly smaller than for size controlled rainfall namely p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 3 methods 3 1 study area we study the seismic record of rainfall in a mountainous mesoscale catchment the galabre in the southeast of france 679 1909 m fig 1 a which is part of the draix bléone long term critical zone observatory legout et al 2021 the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1000 mm and falls mostly during the spring and autumn with occasional high intensity and short duration 1 2 h convectional thunderstorms in the summer and autumn navratil et al 2012 the catchment is covered mostly with forests and shrublands but also contains relatively small but highly erodible badlands nearly 10 of the surface area e g visible in the top center of fig 1d that yield large amounts of suspended sediment at the basin outlet esteves et al 2019 legout et al 2013 poulenard et al 2012 two locations within the galabre catchment are studied ainac in the upstream part of the catchment and robine sur galabre r s g in the downstream part of the catchment fig 1a we first address the rainfall induced seismic power using a dedicated set of colocated measurements for rainfall events at ainac 1170 m in the period march april 2021 fig 1e we subsequently verify our findings with a longer dataset february 2019 december 2020 that encompasses year round rainfall events for two geophones near r s g upstream 731 m fig 1f and downstream 679 m fig 1g these seismic measurements are not colocated with the disdrometer in the village of robine sur galabre fig 1d but lie at a distance of respectively 500 m and 2 15 km from the disdrometer 3 2 meteorological measurements meteorological data were obtained from the meteorological stations at ainac and r s g fig 1a details on the data acquisition and availability are provided in legout et al 2021 in this study we use 1 min resolution data of rainfall intensity and the distributions of equivalent drop diameter and vertical fall velocity obtained by ott parsivel2 optical disdrometers e g angulo martínez et al 2018 tokay et al 2014 the disdrometers function based on a horizontal plane of light that is set up between a transmitter and receiver a is schematically added to the image in fig 1b the instrument registers the reduction in transmitted light as a drop passes through this plane which is a measure for the drop size and the duration of the reduced transmission which is a measure for the vertical velocity of the drop löffler mang joss 2000 to account for edge effects where particularly large drops are only partly registered battaglia et al 2010 the effective sampling area to determine n i j d i is estimated as a d i 0 18 0 03 d i 2 following tokay et al 2014 the number of drops per minute are counted for 32 diameter classes and 32 velocity classes 1024 classes in total that progressively increase in bin size e g the larger the drop diameter the larger the range of drop diameters that are included in the class we consider only 20 diameter classes excluding drop counts for d i 0 25 mm as drops of this size are near or below the limit of instrument detection tokay et al 2014 and drop counts for d i 7 mm as they exceed the maximum expected size of raindrops pruppacher klett 2010 and are prone to erroneous detection hachani et al 2017 jaffrain et al 2011 we present i e and j p values that we calculate using equations 1a 1b and 6 rather than for i and e the values that are directly provided by the parsivel2 disdrometer following an undisclosed proprietary routine we note that the values marginally differ between the two approaches with differences of less than 0 1 mm h for more than 95 of the non zero rainfall measurements 3 3 seismic measurements we performed seismic measurements with geophones that were installed for the long term monitoring of flow and bedload transport near the upstream esteves et al 2019 navratil et al 2011 and downstream measurement station nord et al 2020 at r s g the geophones are located approximately 30 40 m from the galabre river fig 1f and g in addition to river generated seismic power we observe the contributions of traffic as the geophones are located at a distance of 10 m from the road fig 1f and g for this study we also placed a geophone at the meteorological station ainac fig 1c and e where anthropogenic and river contributions are considered minimal we installed the 3 sensor pe 6 b geophones at a depth of approximately 25 cm into the ground fig 1c which consists of quaternary sedimentary deposits although bedrock is present in the near subsurface the geophones measure the vertical ground velocity which is recorded on a digos data cube logger we recorded the data with a temporal resolution of 400 hz for the r s g upstream and downstream sites and a resolution of 800 hz at ainac at this site we measure only in the vertical direction not in the horizontal directions as in r s g allowing a higher acquisition rate we derived the power spectral density p f in m s 2 hz for 3 second time periods using the method of welch 1967 for frequencies from 5 hz lower limit associated with instrument response to 200 hz for the r s g sites and in the case of ainac up to 400 hz upper limit associated with the temporal resolution of the measurements we aggregated the 3 second p f values to 1 minute periods the temporal resolution of the rainfall data by determining the 10th percentile to eliminate short lived but potentially large magnitude seismic power contributions from anthropogenic noise operation of machinery passing cars human footsteps etc e g d alessandro et al 2021 or due to the occasional occurrence of small earthquakes during the study period 4 earthquakes of ml 1 6 2 3 were registered in the region for more details on the seismic data processing we refer to bakker et al 2020 3 4 scaling analysis to assess the power law scaling of seismic power with bulk rainfall parameters theoretical scaling relations in section 2 3 we use major axis regression that accounts for uncertainties in both axes through minimizing the sum of squares of the perpendicular distances between each point and the regression line e g bakker et al 2020 this typically leads to a steeper scaling than ordinary least squares approaches mcardle 1988 further we use spearman s rank correlation to assess the correlation strength because we use non linear axes 10log10 scale with seismic power in db to constrain the uncertainties in the scaling analysis we discard data for time steps where 1 temperatures are smaller than or equal to 0 c thus avoiding albeit but not entirely excluding precipitation in the form of snow and 2 the calculated rainfall intensity based on the drop size distribution equation 1a is not within a factor 2 of the value directly provided by the disdrometer we verified that the magnitude of this factor does not affect the scaling results for the non colocated datasets at r s g we also remove the first and last 5 min of each rainfall period to avoid outliers associated with the presence or absence of rainfall 4 results 4 1 rainfall physical parameters from disdrometer measurements before comparing seismic power with rainfall parameters we first establish the relation between raindrop diameter d and velocity v the relation between drop size distribution p d and rainfall intensity i and the relations amongst the integral rainfall parameters intensity i kinetic energy e and impulse power j p for the period february 2019 to december 2020 at r s g ainac station shows similar trends these are not shown because of the limited amount of data only april may 2021 which leads us to consider that the meteorological conditions at the two sites with 5 km distance and 430 m elevation difference between them did not differ significantly during the study period consistent with previous studies see section 2 1 we find that vertical raindrop velocity strongly depends on raindrop diameter fig 2 the observed velocities are accurately predicted using the terminal velocity power law model of atlas and ulbrich 1977 equation 2 up to a maximum velocity of approximately 9 5 m s carollo ferro 2015 near d 4 mm as the drop diameter increases the bin size of the measurements increases and velocities become more scattered velocities smaller than 4 m s may be due to the presence of snow at temperatures just above 0 c which results in larger uncertainties in the derived physical parameters i e and j p the raindrop size distribution evolves with rainfall intensity at a 1 minute resolution where the average drop diameter increases and the distribution becomes wider at higher rainfall intensities fig 3 a this coarsening trend is most prominent for rainfall intensities up to circa 60 mm h when the drop size distribution stabilizes which is in line with observations from carollo et al 2016 kinnell 1981 and rosewell 1986 the coarse tail of the distribution where d is larger than 2 3 mm which corresponds to less than 1 of the raindrops shows a scaling comparable to p d d 7 33 given that j p n tot p d d 7 33 section 2 3 this would imply for j p d that a decrease in the number of drops n tot p d with increasing d may be more than compensated by the increase in impulse of those drops due to the increase in d the drops in the large size classes may therefore provide the largest contribution to j p despite their relatively infrequent occurrence fig 3b this effect is prominent for rainfall intensities from 1 mm h and higher where the largest drops d of circa 5 mm contribute the most unfortunately the registration of these large drops in disdrometer measurements is subject to considerable uncertainties the potential implications for seismic measurements are considerable where circa 90 of the impulse power which is expected to set the seismic power j p p is due to drops of d 3 mm which represent only 0 2 of the total number of drops and 15 of the total rainfall volume inset fig 3b as a result of deviations in the proposed raindrop diameter vs velocity scaling above and below d 4 mm fig 2 and a changing drop size distribution with rainfall intensity above and below i 60 mm h fig 3a it may not be possible to capture the scaling of j p with i and e in a single power law we would rather expect a change from partly drop size dominated rainfall with scaling exponents associated with j p vs i and j p vs e that are well above 1 but below respectively 2 4 and 1 7 for rainfall intensities below 60 mm h to number dominated rainfall at higher rainfall intensities where p i and p e section 2 3 in practice however the observed scaling exponents are relatively constant the j p vs i dataset shows a scaling with an exponent of circa 2 1 while the j p vs e dataset which exhibits considerably less scatter shows a scaling exponent of circa 1 6 fig 4 these values correspond to the predicted values for intermediate rainfall section 2 3 a decrease in the scaling exponents at rainfall intensities above 60 mm h is not evident although the number of observations at these high intensities are limited for low amounts of rainfall a change in scaling is observed near 0 3 mm h and 0 6 j m2 h fig 4 but this is likely associated with limitations of the disdrometer to adequately register these low numbers of small raindrops following our seismic framework where p j p section 2 2 the same scaling exponents as found for impulse power j p i 2 1 and j p e 1 6 are expected for seismic power p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 4 2 colocated seismic and disdrometer measurements of rainfall events for the colocated measurements at ainac rainfall events can be identified in the spectrogram that shows the seismic power per frequency over time at frequencies above 50 hz fig 5 the registered seismic power due to rainfall spans multiple orders of magnitude reaching values up to 140 db the color scale in fig 5a is limited to 150 db for visualization purposes the rainfall events can be readily distinguished from intermittent noise effects at this site presumably due to human activities or livestock that are typically lower in frequency prominent in the range 20 35 hz but present up to 80 hz and lower in seismic power fig 5a the onset phases of low and high intensity rainfall and the end of rainfall events are directly captured in the seismic signal showing no evidence of lag effects example in fig 5c and 5d for a detailed view of all rainfall events in the period 10 23 april see rain events ainac avi in the supplementary materials for the colocated measurements at ainac rainfall events can be identified in the spectrogram that shows the seismic power per frequency over time at frequencies above 50 hz fig 5 the registered seismic power due to rainfall spans multiple orders of magnitude reaching values up to 140 db the color scale in fig 5a is limited to 150 db for visualization purposes the rainfall events can be readily distinguished from intermittent noise effects at this site presumably due to human activities or livestock that are typically

directly captured in the seismic signal showing no evidence of lag effects example in fig 5c and d for a detailed view of all rainfall events in the period 10 23 april see rain events ainac avi in the supplementary materials there is a strong correlation between seismic power on one hand and the disdrometer based measures of rainfall intensity kinetic energy and impulse power on the other hand fig 6 at this particular site ainac rainfall can be detected at seismic power as low as circa 175 db given that the contributions of background noise sources are limited as indicated with the mean μ and standard deviations σ of seismic power in the absence of rainfall fig 6 we estimate the lower detection limit for rainfall intensity to be 0 7 mm h which is slightly higher than the break in scaling in fig 4 the corresponding detection limits for kinetic energy and impulse power are respectively 5 8 j m2 h and 5 10 9 n2s m2 to describe seismic power as a function of the rainfall physical parameters at ainac we fit power law scaling relations to nearly 10 h of minute based data where p is larger than one standard deviation above the mean noise level and where the rainfall parameters are larger than the limit of detection data included in the boxed areas in fig 6 which is 43 of the total dataset we find the linear scaling of seismic power with impulse power p j p fig 6c as expected based on our seismic framework section 2 2 the scaling exponents of p vs i and e are very similar to the values for intermediate rainfall section 2 3 and the exponents we established based on nearly 2 years of disdrometer data at r s g fig 4 for values below the identified thresholds of the rainfall parameters the data deviates from the established trends due to both the relatively large contributions of noise effects and limitations of the disdrometer measurements fig 4 the scaling relations in fig 6 are derived for a chosen frequency range of 80 120 hz and may vary with frequency fig 7 a for lower frequencies the seismic power associated with rainfall is relatively low and noise effects are dominant fig 5 which leads to lower and sometimes negative scaling exponents not shown and weaker correlation particularly for f 40 hz fig 7 for higher frequencies f 100 hz the effect of rainfall is clearly present although the scaling exponent slowly reduces with frequency which we relate to residual noise effects these are not entirely excluded when using the mean plus 1 standard deviation threshold that are more prominent at high frequencies where there is a lower signal to noise ratio fig 5c at these higher frequencies however good correlation values are maintained fig 7b differences in spearman s r values obtained with i e and j p are relatively small fig 7b and do not reflect the differences in scatter that we observed with the disdrometer fig 4 4 3 non colocated seismic and disdrometer measurements of year round rainfall at the r s g upstream and downstream sites the effect of rainfall on seismic power is visible for frequencies in the range 50 175 hz fig 8 the rainfall induced power spectral density is similar for both sites indicating that the differences in rainfall between the sites are relatively small and that the seismic wave propagation characteristics are comparable directly following rainfall events river generated seismic power is observed in the frequency range 10 50 hz fig 8e g and in the case of the upstream site also at higher frequencies in the range 100 150 hz this is possibly due to contributions of plunging flow aeration etc and or lower seismic attenuation that are specific to the bedrock nature of the channel here for these sites the spectrogram could only be determined up to 200 hz the rate of acquisition is lower than at ainac but we do expect that at higher frequencies up to 400 hz the seismic power is strongly dominated by rainfall similar to ainac fig 5 and that the contribution of river flow is strongly attenuated gimbert et al 2014 besides rainfall and river generated seismic power we observe a relatively constant diurnal pattern in seismic noise at both sites for frequencies up to 60 hz the observed seismic power during the day is typically 5 db higher than at night fig 8a and b most likely due to daytime traffic and human activities fig 1f and g the scaling relations between seismic power and the rainfall physical measures found for the r s g upstream and downstream sites fig 9 are very similar to those observed at ainac regression lines derived in fig 6 are added as a reference to fig 9 in the fitting we only consider data with river discharge below 0 2 m3 s to eliminate the contribution of river generated seismic power a 40 minute time delay is considered for the application of the upstream discharge data to the downstream station alternatively if we were to only consider data with discharge above 0 2 m3 s this would only lead to a very minor change in the p vs j p scaling exponents of less than 0 1 although the effect of river flow may be 15 db at the limit of rainfall detection in the case of the upstream site this effect is no longer noticeable at rainfall intensities of 10 mm h while at the downstream site the effect of river flow on the observed seismic power is insignificant in the considered frequency range fig 9 the absolute values of seismic power associated with the fitted power law functions are circa 5 db upstream and 10 db downstream lower than at ainac this applies to both rainfall induced seismic power as background noise indicating that these values are site specific rather than related to the rainfall i e the drop size distribution the differences in seismic power between the sites may be related to differences in the nature and structure of the subsurface that affect seismic wave attenuation the geophones were installed in a shallow soil at ainac fig 1b and in thicker alluvial deposits at the r s g sites which are particularly coarse cobble gravel at the downstream site see section 5 2 the scaling exponents at frequencies higher than 80 hz are more or less constant for the three sites signifying the extensive frequency range over which seismic observations are sensitive to rainfall fig 10 a and c for these frequencies the strength of the correlation is also relatively constant and varies little amongst the rainfall physical parameters fig 10b and d for the r s g upstream and downstream sites rainfall can be observed in the seismic measurements down to frequencies as low as 65 hz while at lower frequencies the correlation rapidly weakens at ainac this transition is lower near 40 hz likely due to lower contributions of noise from anthropogenic sources and from the river indicating that these effects could not be entirely eliminated at r s g despite the filtering of seismic data section 3 3 and only considering data where q 0 2 m3 s the 80 120 hz range that we use to illustrate the observations in figs 6 and 9 is suitable for the set of sites that we studied note that this range is not unique and that slightly lower or higher values could have also been considered but this may not generally be the case making it important to consider the scaling across the entire frequency range as done in figs 7 and 10 for the sites that we consider we also observe a general decrease in maximum correlation with distance between the geophones and disdrometer an r value of circa 0 8 for the colocated instruments at ainac a value of 0 6 0 7 with a distance of 500 m for the upstream geophone and a value of 0 5 0 6 with a distance of 2 15 km for the downstream geophone 5 discussion 5 1 scaling of seismic power with rainfall physical measures in this study we directly relate observations of seismic power spectral density to independently measured rainfall intensity kinetic energy and impulse power detecting rainfall at intensities as low as 1 mm h fig 5 the large bandwidth of rainfall induced seismic vibrations allows these to be readily distinguished from other sources such as diurnal fluctuations in anthropogenic noise or local river processes that follow rainfall events fig 8 at the sites we investigated we observed a strong correlation between seismic power p and impulse power j p figs 6 and 9 more critically we find that p scales linearly with j p providing convincing evidence that the seismic modelling framework adapted from tsai et al 2012 is applicable i e that ground vibrations are set by the impulse power of instantaneous and randomly occurring raindrop impacts in addition our dataset provides an independent confirmation of the same physical principles that are extensively applied to study bedload transport bakker et al 2020 chao et al 2015 lagarde et al 2021 and debris flows allstadt et al 2020 farin et al 2019 kean et al 2015 lai et al 2018 where field measurements of particle size distributions and fluxes are more difficult the impulse power of raindrops depends strongly on the drop diameter j p n tot p d d 7 33 and it is therefore expected that the seismic power is very sensitive to the largest impacting drops despite their relatively small abundance in our case approximately 90 of the impulse power that sets the seismic power was attributed to drops larger than 3 mm corresponding to 15 of the rainfall volume but these large drops occur considerably more frequently with above average rainfall intensities fig 3b a similar size dependency is also found for the seismic power due to bedload transport e g lagarde et al 2021 where p n tot p d d 6 5 and d in this case reflects the diameter of a saltating bed particle bakker et al 2020 and radar reflectivity factor z where z n tot p d d 5 33 e g uijlenhoet stricker 1999 wexler atlas 1963 for the application of all these measurements it is therefore critical to constrain p d and spatiotemporal changes in p d when studying fluxes such as rainfall intensity for rainfall observations the sensitivity to the largest drops fig 3b and strong correlation with kinetic energy fig 4b make seismic measurements more suitable to study soil erosion in particular to study soil particle detachment and transport by raindrop splash on a dry surface i e during the onset of the storm and in interrill areas and to a lesser extent where raindrops penetrate surface water and dislodge soil particles we do not account for the effect of surface water in our model that may then be readily transported in the flow kinnell 2005 in addition to the linear scaling of seismic power p with impulse power j p we found relatively constant power law scaling relations with the more commonly used measures of rainfall intensity i and kinetic energy e for rainfall intensities up to circa 50 100 mm h due to temporal changes in drop size distributions during rainfall events e g chapon et al 2008 lee zawadzki 2005 and on seasonal timescales e g seela et al 2018 smith et al 2009 the correlations of p vs i and to a lesser extent p vs e are expected to be weaker than that of p vs j p fig 4 in practice the observed differences were not discernable figs 7 and 10 and likely fall within the general uncertainty range associated with the measurements the exponents associated with the p vs i and p vs e power law relations are not unique and depend on the covariance of the total drop density flux n tot and the drop size distribution p d the scaling relations we obtained correspond to the intermediate rainfall case see section 2 3 where p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 when combining available records of seismic power and rainfall intensity from a rain gauge disdrometer or any other type of instrument scaling analysis may provide new insights into the spatio temporal variability of rainfall drop size distributions through changes in the scaling exponent and thus changes in meteorological conditions in addition such a p vs i scaling analysis will indirectly also provide insight into the scaling of p vs e through their relative dependencies on d if we make the parallel between seismic power and disdrometer based estimates of radar reflectivity

uijlenhoet stricker 1999 yu et al 2012 may provide an indication for the expected variability of scaling relations with p p vs i and p vs e smaller exponents for i and e may be expected for convective

which may be due to concurrent orographic effects and the continental vs maritime character of rainfall hazenberg et al 2011 whereas we found negligible differences in scaling exponents between our sites fig 9 there are uncertainties associated with the measurement techniques and fitting and we may expect p vs i and p vs e scaling exponents to vary per climatic setting with at least 0 2 with maximum values of respectively 2 4 and 1 7 as set by size controlled rainfall at rainfall intensities higher than 50 100 mm h the obtained p vs i and p vs e scaling exponents are expected to decrease due to the emergence of a relatively constant drop size distribution fig 3 although we did not find evidence for such a transition in our seismic data figs 6 and 9 based on our scaling analysis the scaling exponent should decrease and may approach 1 in number controlled rainfall similar to the radar reflectivity factor z assouline 2020 uijlenhoet et al 2003 in theory scaling exponents of less

quantified with a function that describes the exponential decay with distance r to explore the extent of the surface area that contributes to the measured seismic observations we calculated the seismic power associated with the fundamental wave mode in a uniform generic bedrock subsurface following tsai et al 2012 details on the derivation of p rel and the used values of w p w g and k are provided in appendix b our calculations indicate that the largest seismic power contribution may be expected at a radial distance of the order of 0 1 1 m where lower frequencies will be susceptible to drop impacts from larger distances fig 11 a the cumulative seismic power reaches about half of the total expected power within a distance of the order of 1 10 m fig 11b while 90 of the total is expected to come from within 5 25 m from a seismic instrument due to the spatial distribution of rainfall impacts all around the instrument and at all distances from the instrument we expect rainfall to be prominent in the power spectral density over a large frequency range and in particular also at high frequencies this is also generally visible in the spectrograms figs 5 and 8 and the observed scaling with frequency figs 7 and 10 the spatial distribution of rainfall and the associated large frequency range for seismic observation contrast with more localized and distant sources such as river turbulence or bedload induced contributions in our case the river is at 30 40 m distance which are prominent at low frequencies due to the stronger attenuation at high frequencies near 20 m in fig 11a we evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated seismic attenuation on ground properties by considering seismic wave propagation values derived for river gravel bed deposits bakker et al 2020 and overbank deposits lagarde et al 2021 for details on the underlying values see appendix b the expected seismic power varies per frequency between a factor of 0 4 to 4 fig 11c relative to that derived

al 2012 ainac lies on an inclined hillslope r s g upstream on a flat surface and r s g downstream directly beside a steep road embankment considering all potential site specific differences the order of magnitude differences in seismic power we observed amongst the sites fig 9 may be considered relatively modest although such order of magnitude differences in seismic power may lead to absolute differences of up to 2 orders of magnitude when deriving rainfall kinetic energy and intensity from the seismic record these may be easily constrained with independent measures of rainfall amounts and most importantly the characteristic scaling relations are maintained fig 9 in the future individual effects of surface and subsurface properties on the seismic observation of rainfall will need to be addressed using specifically designed field experiments our green s function modelling exercise provides a general spatial constraint on the contribution of rainfall impacts on seismic records the monitored surface area of 100 2000 m2 is up to 4 5 orders of magnitude larger than the surface area monitored with the disdrometer 0 0054 m2 where the spatial variability in rainfall may be insufficiently captured jaffrain berne 2011 tapiador et al 2017 the use of temporally resolved seismic field observations is therefore expected to be suitable for the monitoring of spatiotemporally

the scale of hillslopes to small mesoscale watersheds 6 conclusions our study provides a foundation for the seismic observation of rainfall whose effects have been previously identified but which have not been studied in detail we adapted a seismic framework for bedload transport tsai et al 2012 to assess the seismic power generated by impacting raindrops this enabled us to explain the observed linear relation between measured seismic power typically at frequencies well above 50 hz and the impulse power of raindrops calculated from disdrometer measurements p j p equation 8 figs 6 and 9 the scaling of seismic power with rainfall intensity and kinetic energy that we observed p i 2 1 and p e 1 6 were consistent between the studied sites fig 9 and conform to intermediate rainfall predictions equal proportions of size and number controlled rainfall uijlenhoet et al 2003 we could not discern systematic temporal changes in scaling e g event or seasonally based but do expect scaling exponents to vary with geographical setting and weather systems of particular importance is the contribution of the largest raindrop fractions where in our case 90 of the seismic power may be attributed to drops larger than 3 mm that correspond to only 15 of the rainfall volume fig 3b seismic measurements are most suitable to study rainfall with high intensities and relatively abundant large drops where high signal to noise ratios ensure reliable seismic measurements while disdrometer measurements are prone to uncertainty under such conditions the application of seismic measurements is particularly promising in soil erosion studies where they may provide a record of rainfall erosivity and splash erosion that is temporally resolved e g fig 5c and 5d and spatially integrated over a

the scaling law equation a1a into equation 1a for rainfall intensity which leads to the self consistency constraint of α 4 β 1 that is required to ensure i i note that the constraint differs from uijlenhoet et al 2003 because we consider n i j d i as the drop density as a flux based density and not as a volume based density similarly if we use e as the reference variable we obtain a self consistency constraint of α 5 34 β 1 using equation 1b with the exponents α and β a range of dependencies between the drop size distribution and the reference variable i or e in our case can be

3274,considering the driving mechanism of agricultural soil water resource composite system aswrs resilience the jiansanjiang branch of china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd is selected as the research object a projection pursuit pp model improved by the sparrow search algorithm ssa was proposed to measure the key drivers of resilience and the driving mechanism of resilience was analysed in combination with the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi the performance of the built model and the rationality of the results were verified thus providing a new horizon for the healthy and sustainable development of agricultural water and soil resources and the environment the results indicated that the ssa pp model constructed in this paper was superior to pp models based on genetic algorithm ga optimization ga pp and particle swarm optimization pso pp in regard to the solution speed and optimization ability and these three models yielded similar conclusions compared with those of the entropy weight ew method the driving results of the ssa pp model are more significant and the screened key driving factors are more reasonable it was finally determined that the impact on the resilience of the aswrs was the result of the joint action of economic and agricultural systems the key driving factors included the per capita gross domestic product gdp paddy field proportion per capita net income and grain output per unit area according to the lmdi results the economic level grain output and paddy field proportion increased which played a positive role in driving resilience with the use of the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model to simulate the future evolution of the key driving factors it was predicted that the resilience level will increase year by year in the future it was found that accelerating the economic development process increasing the grain output implementing rational planning and adjusting the agricultural planting structure are effective ways to enhance resilience keywords resilience agricultural soil water resource composite system sparrow search algorithm projection pursuit driving mechanism logarithmic mean divisia index 1 introduction china is a large developing agricultural country with a population of 1 4 billion people agriculture has always been regarded as a strategic industry in china that can promote food security and social stability water and soil resources are the core resources of agricultural production jiang 2011 it is of practical significance to regard the agricultural water and soil resource system as a composite system during sustainable agricultural development holling first proposed the concept of resilience in the ecological field in 1973 holling 1973 resilience reflects the stability of a system and the ability to maintain normal system operation in today s deteriorating ecological environment resilience has been used to measure the ability of agricultural soil water resources to adapt and respond to environmental changes which has become a new concept in sustainable environmental development exploring the driving mechanism of resilience is necessary to analyse the characteristics of resilience changes by screening key driving factors the effects of different factors on resilience have been studied and the mechanism of resilience has been analysed to fundamentally explain the corresponding variation characteristics with the identification of driving factors multiple schemes have been designed from multiple perspectives to improve aswrs resilience thus providing a theoretical basis for the optimization of the agricultural planting structure from the perspective of resilience current academic research on the driving mechanism of resilience is rich in content and diverse in methods zhang et al 2020b liu et al 2020a selected the flood disaster resilience of jiansanjiang farm as an example and adopted the driver pressure state impact and response dpsir conceptual model to construct an evaluation index system the whale optimization algorithm was combined with the random forest regression algorithm and applied to determine the key driving factors of flood disaster resilience precipitation per capita gross domestic product gdp tertiary industry output population density and the proportions of the young and middle aged populations li et al 2020a employed the dragonfly algorithm to optimize a random forest model and analyse the driving factors of a composite agricultural water and soil resource system the key driving factors were the per capita gdp per capita food production reclamation rate water utilization rate and fertilizer application per unit area qin et al 2018 applied set pair analysis combined with the entropy weight method to evaluate the poverty ecosystem resilience of forest areas in heilongjiang province and analysed the driving system of resilience in different periods the results showed that 12 indicators such as total forestry output value and proportion of displaced people in poverty system and 10 indicators such as pest and disease disaster index and forest coverage rate in forest ecosystem had a nonlinear effect on resilience liu 2019 used factor and interaction detector models as geographic detector models to analyse the spatial and temporal patterns of ecological vulnerability based on the sensitivity recovery and pressure srp evaluation system model the results revealed that the vulnerability of the ecological environment was affected by a combination of multiple driving forces among which vegetation coverage was the largest driving force from 2005 to 2015 zhang et al 2020a selected china as the research object and constructed a national scale ecological resilience evaluation index system to assess the ecological resilience level in 1434 ecological functional areas the results demonstrated that the natural condition index obtained by superimposing a topographic index rainfall and the soil organic matter content was the most important index affecting elasticity additionally the resilience level in china was negatively correlated with ecological sensitivity and ecological vulnerability chagaris et al 2020 developed an integrated ecosystem model of florida bay in ecosim and ecopath software to fully assess its structure and resilience to environmental disturbances the results indicated that the bay was stabilized through debris channels and freshwater flow was the key driving factor enhancing the overall resilience of the bay in addition the provision of a low salinity and low nutrient enrichment system environment was necessary to improve resilience in general abundant research results have been obtained regarding the driving mechanisms of resilience in different research areas however in qualitative analysis of nondeterministic issues such as indicator selection and driving measurement methods there are certain disadvantages such as notable subjectivity and difficulty in the formulation of accurate standards however reliable and stable mathematical models currently lacking in quantitative analysis could provide theoretical support for research on the driving mechanism of resilience moreover the lack of identification and analysis of resilience mechanisms may reduce the research integrity thus in this study the capacity of the projection pursuit pp model in regard to multi dimensional non deterministic problems combined with a factor analysis model to analyse the resilience driving mechanism of the jiansanjiang branch of beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd the pp model is a combination of mathematics computer programming and statistical theory employed to calculate and analyse multidimensional data and is especially suitable for nonlinear and nonnormal high dimensional data analysis tang et al 2021 the pp model can reduce the dimension of the data in the high dimensional space to perform evaluations in the low dimensional space thus providing a way to use the one dimensional method to solve high dimensional problems the pp model is completely data driven not limited by sample size or data structure and not influenced by interference from subjective factors moreover the results are objective and reasonable thus attracting widespread attention when using the pp model to solve practical problems the key is to determine the best projection direction the determination of the best projection direction involves a high dimensional and complex nonlinear problem optimization process and swarm intelligence algorithms have generally been adopted to determine the optimal projection direction wang et al 2021 a swarm intelligence algorithm seeks the optimal solution within a certain range by simulating specific rules for objects or organisms in nature wan et al 2021 these algorithms include ant colony optimization aco jing et al 2020 ramachandranpillai and arock 2020 grey wolf optimization gwo liu et al 2020b jing et al 2021 and the dragonfly algorithm da hammouri et al 2020 meraihi et al 2020 xue proposed a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm namely the sparrow search algorithm ssa in 2020 xue and shen 2020 compared to other swarm intelligence algorithms this method exhibits the advantages of good stability and excellent search ability and it requires few parameters li et al 2020b in terms of factor analysis the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi can decompose dependent variables into a few factors to facilitate intrinsic influence analysis moreover the remainder of the decomposition results can be further divided so that the dominant driving factors can be quantitatively identified and the direction of the effect of influential factors on the overall trend can be determined zhu et al 2020 with agricultural water and soil resources treated as a coordinated and unified system a new diagnostic method for regional agricultural water and soil resources driven by resilience was proposed based on an existing evaluation indicator system the difficulty of this paper is to combine the advantages of ssa the pp model and the lmdi to carry out appropriate combination so as to screen the main driving factors and analyse the corresponding driving mechanisms sadorsky 2021 the key problem to be solved urgently is to seek the most suitable resilience driving evaluation model therefore through comparisons with the traditional method and other combined intelligence algorithms the rationality of the model and the accuracy of the results are verified and the main evolution characteristics of each key driving factor are analysed the objectives are to enhance the resilience of the aswrs promote the regional sustainable development of the jiansanjiang branch and provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the allocation of regional agricultural planting resources the research objectives of this paper are as follows 1 an analysis model is constructed to determine the driving mechanism of regional aswrs resilience based on ssa pp lmdi theory 2 the key driving factors of aswrs resilience are identified and the corresponding effects are analysed 3 the model performance and reliability of the evaluation results are verified and the trends of the key driving factors and resilience are predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jiansanjiang branch of china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd is located between 132 31 26 134 22 26 east longitude and 46 49 42 48 13 58 north latitude this branch is the interriver zone where the heilong river songhua river and wusuli river converge and is located in the cold temperate humid monsoon climate zone the area includes 15 farms fig 1 with a total area of 12 400 km2 accounting for 22 of the entire reclamation area in heilongjiang province the annual grain production capacity exceeds 15 billion kg and the commercial grain production rate is higher than 80 the jiansanjiang branch is the core grain production area in heilongjiang province li et al 2020a however due to the blind pursuit of economic benefits and yields long term and excessive application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides unreasonable cultivation of swamps wetlands woodlands and grasslands and other poor practices have led to negative effects such as increased agricultural nonpoint source pollution soil impoverishment and insufficient agricultural flood and drought prevention capacities li et al 2014 therefore the corresponding effect on aswrs resilience in this region must be analysed immediately 2 2 data sources the data sources in this study included the statistical yearbook of heilongjiang state farms 1997 2020 the statistical yearbook of the jiansanjiang administration 1996 2016 and the jiansanjiang agricultural reclamation water conservancy annual report 1996 2019 of the jiansanjiang branch of china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki statistical data on economic and social development such as precipitation land use efficiency and per capita gdp were extracted and analysed for follow up research on the drivers of resilience 2 3 methods 2 3 1 projection pursuit model the basic objective of the pp model is to transform multidimensional data into low dimensional data and resolve practical problems by determining the best projection that can reflect the structure and characteristics of the original multidimensional data this method performs well in dimensionality reduction and stability zhou 2013 the basic steps are as follows 2 3 1 1 data standardization to avoid the impact of different indicators data dimensions on the results the data are standardized suppose the sample set is x i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n which indicates that there are m samples and n indicators for a positive indicator bigger is better and the standardized formula is 1 x i j x i j x min j x max j x min j for a negative indicator smaller is better and the standardized formula is 2 x i j x max j x i j x max j x min j where x i j is the normalized value and x max j and x min j are the maximum and minimum values respectively of indicator j 2 3 1 2 projection index function construction the n indicator data x i j are integrated into a one dimensional projection with projection direction a a 1 a 2 a n and the projection value is z i 3 z i j 1 n a j x i j i 1 2 m the projection index function q a is as follows 4 q a s z d z 5 s z i 1 m z i e z 2 m 1 6 d z i 1 m j 1 m r r i j μ r r i j where s z is the standard deviation of projection value z i d z is the local density of projection value z i e z is the mean value of z i i 1 2 m r is the window radius of the local density r i j is the distance between the projection values with r i j z i z j and μ r r i j is the unit step function when r r i j 0 μ r r i j 1 and when r r i j 0 μ r r i j 0 2 3 1 3 projection index function optimization since the projection index function q a changes due to the variation in projection direction a the change in the data structure affects the change in the projection direction and the optimal projection direction vector can reflect the structural characteristics of the high dimensional data to the highest degree possible therefore the optimal projection direction a is calculated by solving the maximum projection index function problem i e the maximum objective function is 7 m a x q a s z d z the constraint condition is 8 s t j 1 p a 2 j 1 2 3 2 sparrow search algorithm the ssa is based on the foraging and anti predation behaviour patterns of the sparrow sparrows are divided into two categories discoverers and joiners the identities of the sparrow joiners and discoverers are interchangeable but the proportion of individuals in each category remains unchanged when sparrows sense danger they move to safety to obtain a better hunting position xue 2019 the calculation process is as follows the location updating equation for the discoverers pd is 9 x i j t 1 x i j t e x p i α i t e r m a x i f r 2 s t x i j t q l i f r 2 s t where t denotes the number of current iterations and i 1 2 3 d moreover itemmax denotes the maximum number of iterations x i j t denotes the position of the i th sparrow in the j th dimension α 0 1 is a random number r 2 0 1 and s t 0 5 1 denote the warning and safety values respectively q is a random number that obeys a normal distribution and l is a 1 d matrix where each matrix element is 1 for r 2 s t the sparrow foraging environment is safe there are no predators and the discoverers can search a wide area for r 2 s t the sparrows have encountered a predator and the other sparrows are warned at this time all sparrows move to a safe area the location updating equation for the joiners is 10 x i j t 1 q e x p x w o r s t x i j t i 2 i f i n 2 x p t 1 x i j t x p t 1 a l o t h e r w i s e where xp is the current best position of the discoverer and xworst is the worst position a is an 1 d matrix where the value of each element is 1 or 1 and a a t a a t 1 for i n 2 the i th joiner with a low fitness value finds no food and must fly to a more favourable location for food assuming that the sparrows in danger sd account for 10 20 of the total number of sparrows the initial positions of these sparrows are randomly generated and can be expressed as 11 x i j t 1 x best t β x i j t x best t i f f i f g x i j t k x i j t x worst t f i f w ε i f f i f g where xbest is the current optimal position and β is the compensation control parameter which is a normally distributed random number with a mean value of 0 and a variance of 1 k 1 1 is a random number fi is the fitness value of the individual sparrow and fg and fw are the global best and worst fitness values respectively ε is a constant set to the smallest value possible to avoid zero in the denominator for f i f g the sparrows at the edge of the population are vulnerable to attacks by predators for f i f g the sparrows in the population are aware of the danger and need to get close to other sparrows to reduce their own risk of predation k is the direction in which the sparrow moves and further functions as a step length control parameter 2 3 3 sparrow search algorithm optimized projection pursuit ssa pp model the ssa pp model can improve the search performance of the algorithm notably the pp model does not readily converge to a local optimal solution and the reliability of the algorithm is enhanced the calculation steps are as follows step 1 program initialization memory clearing and parameter and population initialization the population is set to n the number of iterations is set to t the number of discoverers defined as a percentage is pd the percentage of sparrows who are aware of danger is sd and the safety value is st liu et al 2021a song et al 2016 step 2 the indicator data for the evaluation indicator system are read and eqs 1 and 2 are applied to standardize the sample data step 3 the ssa is employed to determine the optimal projection direction since the ssa must calculate the minimum value the reciprocal of eq 7 is chosen as the objective function i e eq 14 is used as the fitness function 12 m i n q a 1 s z d z the specific steps are as follows step 3 1 eq 8 is adopted as the constraint condition to generate the population step 3 2 fitness values are calculated according to eq 14 and the values are sorted step 3 3 eq 11 is employed to update the locations of the discoverers step 3 4 eq 12 is employed to update the locations of the joiners step 3 5 eq 13 is used to update the positions of the guards step 3 6 the fitness value is calculated and the sparrow positions are updated step 3 7 it is determined whether the termination conditions have been met if so the algorithm is exited and the result is output otherwise steps 3 2 to 3 6 are repeated step 4 the best projection direction and projection value are output i e the driving factor and resilience index respectively are determined simultaneously the resilience level is obtained according to the index grading standard and the aswrs resilience is evaluated and analysed 2 3 4 lmdi decomposition index decomposition analysis ida and structural decomposition analysis sda are applied to decompose the relevant influential factors zhang et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the lmdi model based on ida is chosen to evaluate the influence of a certain factor on resilience during any period and is not limited by zero values xie and li 2017 the specific expression is 13 δ c p w t w o ln w t ln w o ln p t p 0 where δ c p is the effect of driving factor p on resilience and wt and w0 are the resilience index values at time t and the initial time respectively pt and p0 are the actual values of the driving factor at time t and the initial time respectively in this model the effect of each driving factor on resilience is calculated separately when the calculation result is positive the driving factor promotes resilience and vice versa zhang et al 2018 2 3 5 multiple linear regression analysis multiple linear regression analysis is a statistical method used to quantitatively express the relationship between multiple independent and dependent variables via a mathematical expression liao et al 2020 rahman 2014 since resilience is influenced by multiple factors a multiple linear regression model is established to analyse the correlation between the key driving factors and resilience the general form of the multiple linear regression model is 14 y α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α n x n β γ where y is the dependent variable x1 x2 xn are the n independent variables α 1 α 2 α n are the regression parameters β is the regression constant and γ is the random error term 2 3 6 arima model the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model is a time series prediction method that was proposed by boques and jenkins in the 1970 s it is a model that transforms a nonstationary time series into a stationary time series after d differences generally no more than 3 differences performs a regression analysis of the lag value of the dependent variable and the present error and lag values and predicts future changes wang et al 2021 liu et al 2021b the model comprises an autoregressive ar process a moving average ma process an autoregressive moving average arma process and an arima process this model considers not only the dependence of data but also the influence of random changes on the prediction results thus the model is highly suitable for short term prediction can achieve high accuracy and has been widely applied park et al 2021 the expression of the arima model is 15 y t φ 1 y t 1 φ 2 y t 2 φ p y t p θ 1 ε t 1 θ 2 ε t 2 θ q ε t q ε t where y is the time series φ p is the autoregression coefficient θ q is the ma coefficient ε t is a white noise sequence p is the autoregressive order and q is the ma order the specific operation steps are shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 architecture of the resilience evaluation index based on the connotation and characteristics of aswrs resilience referring to previous research results and considering the actual conditions in the study area jing 2010 zhao 2009 liu et al 2020c shang 2010 liu et al 2018 wang 2014 liu et al 2019 31 indicators were selected from many evaluation indicators xu et al 2021 the specific indicators are shown in fig 3 according to the resilience evaluation indicator system each farm was associated with 31 indicator data points namely 31 dimensional data points occurred with the use of data for 15 farms obtained from 1996 to 2019 as samples a total of 360 31 dimensional datasets were established according to the correlations of the indicators these datasets were standardized according to eqs 1 and 2 and substituted into the ssa pp model the specific parameters were set as follows population number n 50 maximum number of iterations t 1000 proportion of finders pd 20 proportion of sparrows aware of danger sd 10 and safety value st 0 8 mao and zhang 2020 du et al 2021 the best projection direction was a 0 1325 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0550 0 0010 0 0010 0 0188 0 0371 0 4383 0 3121 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0191 0 0537 0 4377 0

indicator with a projection direction greater than 0 3 was considered an important indicator of resilience i e these indicators were key driving factors an indicator with a projection direction ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 was a general indicator of resilience and an indicator with a projection direction ranging from 0 to 0 1 was an unimportant indicator of resilience li et al 2021 liu et al 2020a the order of importance of some indicators is shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the most important factors that influence aswrs resilience include the per capita net income es3 and per capita gdp es1 in the economic system es and the paddy field proportion as4 and grain output per unit area as3 in the agricultural system as the importance of these four driving factors is higher than 0 3 so they can be regarded as key driving factors of resilience the per capita green area ees4 and crop area affected rate ees5 in the ecological environment system ees annual gdp growth rate es2 in the es and precipitation wrs1 in the water resource system wrs are general driving factors the remaining factors with contributions to resilience smaller than 0 1 are considered unimportant driving factors the key driving factors indicate that es indicators contribute the most to resilience followed by as indicators improving the overall economic level increasing the paddy field proportion reducing the area of dry land increasing greening focusing on disaster prevention and mitigation and protecting the environment are key measures to improve resilience 3 2 calculation of the resilience index projection value the sample data for the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 were standardized according to the obtained processed results and best projection direction the above constructed ssa pp model was introduced to determine the projection value of the resilience index of the jiansanjiang branch in each year the results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the projected value of the resilience index of the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 exhibited an overall upward trend with an increase of 11 in 2002 the lowest projection value of the resilience index was 0 3497 after which the value steadily increased until a peak value of 2 2709 was reached in 2012 the index value slightly decreased thereafter the projected values of the resilience index from 1996 to 2006 were all lower than 1 and the overall resilience level was low which was mainly restricted by the low level of economic development however in one interval the resilience index revealed a steady increase from 1996 to 2000 during china s ninth five year plan resilience increased by 1 76 from 2001 to 2005 during china s 10th five year plan resilience increased by 12 4 which was the fastest increase in the five years in 2002 es1 and es3 for the jiansanjiang branch were the lowest in recent years and as3 was only higher than that in 1996 low values of the three key driving factors were the main reasons for the minimum projected resilience index value in 2002 from 2006 to 2010 during china s 11th five year plan resilience rapidly improved to 17 93 and the first peak was reached this trend was closely related to the rapid economic development requirements established during the 11th five year plan from 2011 to 2015 during the 12th five year plan of china resilience increased by 2 01 in 2012 as3 and es1 for the jiansanjiang administration bureau reached their highest values at that time these two key factors ensured that the resilience reached a first peak subsequently the resilience index fluctuated with a slight downward trend but the overall resilience index still maintained a high level until it reached a peak value of 2 427 in 2019 the key driving factors identified based on the ssa pp model play decisive roles in the calculation of the resilience index and it was further determined that the key driving factor screening results are reasonable increasing economic development and food production levels are necessary for enhancing resilience 3 3 analysis of the resilience driving effect based on the data for the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 and referring to the lmdi model described above the driving effect of resilience was decomposed and cumulatively assessed year by year considering the four key driving factors obtained with the ssa pp model furthermore the indicator driving effect based on the ssa pp lmdi model was obtained according to the results the cumulative driving effect values of es1 es3 as4 and as3 in relation to the resilience of the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 were 2 7534 2 4080 1 0510 and 0 4902 respectively these results indicated that the four key driving factors were all positive driving factors of resilience and the order of the magnitude of these effects was es1 es3 as4 as3 a comparison of the key driving factor indicator values and growth rates is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the driving effect varied with the growth rate of each indicator and the trend remained relatively consistent as shown in fig 6 a in 1997 1999 2002 and 2015 the driving effect of es3 was negative under the influence of negative income growth and the value was positive during the remaining 20 years therefore the driving effect of es3 on resilience was positive in 2002 es3 reached a minimum value which indicated negative growth so the driving effect was negative affected by the decrease in es3 in 2015 the growth rate was 0 15 hence the driving effect of es3 on resilience in 2015 reached a negative minimum as shown in fig 6 b the driving effect of es1 on resilience was positive except in 1999 2002 2013 2014 and 2018 and the driving effect exhibited a steady upward trend before 2013 in 2002 es1 reached a minimum value and the growth rate was 0 0665 as a factor that positively influences the driving effect the driving effect decreased and became negative in 1999 2013 2014 and 2018 es1 also declined leading to a negative driving effect as shown in fig 6 c the trend of the driving effect for as4 on resilience was highly consistent with that of the indicator growth rate revealing an overall fluctuating trend in 2000 2001 2003 2005 2008 2014 2015 and 2019 as4 had an inhibitory effect on resilience combined with the interannual variation and growth rate the paddy field proportion in these years exhibited a negative growth trend and the driving effect was therefore negative based on the overall driving effect as4 promoted increased resilience indicating that adjusting the planting structure increasing the paddy field proportion and reducing the planting area of dry fields were effective measures for improving resilience as shown in fig 6 d as3 had a negative effect on resilience in 1997 2000 2002 2008 2009 2013 2015 2017 and 2019 considering interannual changes the lowest value of as3 was observed in 2002 and the growth rate reached the lowest negative trend moreover 2013 was the year with the largest decline after the peak attained in 2012 therefore as3 imposed an inhibitory effect on resilience indicating a negative driving result es3 and es1 are important indicators used to measure the regional economic level and are closely related to both social stability and development as4 is an important indicator reflecting the characteristics of the planting structure and as3 is the embodiment of the optimization result of the planting structure therefore increasing the per capita net income and improving the living standards of residents are the only ways to enhance resilience it is recommended that under the premise of ensuring steady improvement in the economic level considering the healthy development of the ecological environment grain production should be increased the planting structure should be rationally optimized and a steady improvement in aswrs resilience should be achieved 4 discussion 4 1 performance verification of the ssa pp model to verify the rationality and accuracy of the calculation results the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm yang et al 2021 and genetic algorithm ga luo et al 2021 were adopted pp models based on pso pso pp and ga optimization ga pp were established to solve the objective function the data and constraint conditions were consistent with those mentioned above and both models were implemented in matlab r2016a software the algorithm parameter settings are listed in table 1 the convergence curves of the three algorithms in solving the objective function were compared and the results are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the convergence curve of the ssa pp model is smooth and starts to converge and eventually reaches a stable state near the 30th iteration the pso pp model starts to converge at approximately the 40th iteration and the final optimal convergence value is relatively large indicating that the convergence speed and optimization capability of the pso pp model greatly differ from those of the ssa pp model the ga pp model gradually converges near the 200th iteration to a value close to but slightly greater than the optimal value of the ssa pp model in conclusion compared to the pso pp and ga pp models the ssa pp model achieves obvious competitive advantages in terms of its comprehensive optimization ability and convergence performance 4 2 comparative analysis of the recognition results of the different models the optimal projection direction is obtained by solving the objective functions of the three models and the weight of the indicators affecting resilience are calculated by using the traditional entropy weight ew method the results of the entropy weight method and intelligent algorithms are compared to measure the degrees of influence of the driving factors the results are shown in fig 8 which reveals that the optimal projection direction for each factor calculated by the three intelligent algorithms is slightly different but the overall order is very similar notably it can be observed that the best projection directions for es3 es1 as4 and as3 are higher than those for the other factors such as fifth ranking ees4 and the results obtained with the three algorithms only differ slightly compared with the ew method in this approach the difference in the degree of influence of the identified indicators is small and it is difficult to select several key factors from the 31 indicators the five indicators with the highest impacts were the proportion of water conservancy employees annual gdp growth rate inland water area proportion per capita arable land area and per capita green area the most influential indicator was the proportion of water conservancy employees which is significantly more influential than the other indicators however from a practical perspective improving the proportion of water conservancy employees cannot fundamentally change the resilience of the aswrs the change in the inland water area proportion from 1996 to 2019 was very small and the proportion of the inland water area will not change significantly in the future so it will not affect resilience therefore this result is considered inconsistent with the actual situation however both the annual gdp growth rate and per capita arable land area are indicators reflecting the economic system and agricultural system and the findings are similar to the screening results of the ssa pp model but the key driving factors of resilience determined by the ssa pp model are more reasonable in previous research liu et al 2019 proposed that as3 and es1 are the key driving factors of resilience in a study of the resilience of the agricultural water and soil resources of the jiansanjiang administration es3 was considered a key driving factor in research on the resilience of the agricultural water resource system of the jiansanjiang administration ding 2017 as4 was considered the key driving factor in a study of the resilience of irrigated areas in heilongjiang and a risk characteristic analysis of the agricultural water and soil resources of the jiansanjiang administration li 2018 liu et al 2020b because the evaluation indicators and research methods adopted in previous resilience studies in different regions varied the screening results of the driving factors differed however the key driving factors selected in this paper are similar to those in other studies it can be concluded that the key driving factors identified based on the ssa pp model are highly reliable which verifies that these four indicators are key driving factors of resilience 4 3 analysis of the future evolution trend of resilience actual data for the four key driving factors in recent years were combined and the arima model was applied to predict the changes in the key driving factors and analyse the future resilience evolution trend under the actions of these drivers data from 1996 to 2016 were chosen as the training sample set and data from 2017 to 2019 were reserved as the test sample set to verify the rationality of the model first the data for the four key driving factors were converted into a stationary time series via differential processing and the value of the number of differences d was determined then spss software was employed to adjust the parameters p and q and the parameter combination yielding the largest stable r2 value was selected to establish the arima model liu et al 2021b then predicted values of the key driving factors were obtained and the 95 confidence interval was determined the optimal models of es3 es1 as4 and as3 were the arima 3 2 3 arima 3 2 3 arima 2 2 3 and arima 3 2 1 models respectively the error results are summarized in table 2 table 2 reveals that the average absolute error percentages of es3 and as3 for the training and test sets are both lower than 10 which indicates that the model constructed above is reliable the average absolute error percentage of es1 for the test set is high and is mainly affected by the sharp decline in es1 in 2018 es1 in 2018 was 79 600 yuan which is only 1 000 yuan higher than that in 2011 and 11 800 yuan lower than that in 2017 therefore the model error for the test set is affected but given the average absolute error for the training set 7 77 the model is considered reasonable the average absolute error percentage of as4 for the training set is 12 82 mainly due to the large fluctuations in this factor from 2002 to 2007 the average absolute error for the training set is 8 03 excluding the years of abnormal fluctuation therefore the large error for the training set is affected by the abnormal fluctuations in the specific gravity of paddy fields because the average absolute error of the test set reaches only 4 65 the model is considered reasonable and the prediction results of the key driving factors are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a es3 exhibited a fluctuating trend from 2017 to 2020 after which the value rose significantly with an expected increase of 17 by 2025 es3 is expected to reach 38 154 yuan as shown in fig 9 b es1 showed a steady upwards trend after 2017 with an expected increase of 9 4 by 2025 es1 is expected to reach 171 741 yuan this suggests that the upward economic trend is obvious which is consistent with the goal of achieving new levels of economic development and sustained and healthy economic development on the basis of notable improvements in quality and efficiency during the 14th five year plan thus conforming to the established standards as shown in fig 9 c as4 exhibited a slight fluctuating downward trend after 2017 with an expected decline of 0 75 and the paddy field proportion is expected to reach 79 34 by 2025 in the jiansanjiang branch area the primary focus is rice planting which produces a high yield and good economic benefits and will remain the mainstream crop in the future however the current proportion of rice planting is relatively high and is expected to be maintained based on current conditions in the area as shown in fig 9 d as3 displayed an upward trend after 2017 with an expected increase of 8 4 by 2025 as3 is expected to reach 9477 kg hm2 with the popularization of high yield and high quality crops agricultural modernization and improvements in the cultivation rate as3 for the jiansanjiang branch will inevitably increase year by year therefore the expected steady increase in as3 objectively reflects the actual conditions in the area adopting the aswrs resilience for the jiansanjiang branch as the dependent variable and the key driving factors as the independent variables a multiple linear regression equation was constructed to determine the functional relationship between the independent and dependent variables liu 2018 spss software was employed to conduct a multiple regression analysis of the resilience index and key driving factors and the following regression equation was obtained y 0 3421 x 1 0 1525 x 2 0 0648 x 3 0 0001 x 4 0 3967 in the above equation x1 x2 x3 and x4 denote es3 as4 es1 and as3 respectively in regard to the linear regression model r2 0 995 and sig 0 00895 0 05 indicating that the 95 test of significance is passed the independent and dependent variables display an obvious linear relationship and the multiple linear regression equation can be established the functional relationship and the predicted values of the key driving factors are used to estimate the future evolution trend of resilience and the results are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 the estimated resilience based on the changes in the above four key drivers will exhibit an upward trend in the future with an estimated increase of 9 37 and resilience is expected to reach 3 26 in 2025 notably 1996 2002 2003 2008 2009 2013 and 2014 2017 are high volatility cycles for resilience and each cycle lasts approximately 5 years indicating that resilience experiences cyclical fluctuations similar to the cyclical fluctuations in the grain output per unit area the steady improvement in resilience is a manifestation of the effectiveness of socioecological development a more rational allocation of resources sustained reductions in the total emission of major pollutants sustained improvements in the ecological environment and strong ecological security barriers are the societal development trends and goals in the future therefore increase in the level of resilience should support the practical needs of the population in the area 5 conclusions 1 the ssa pp lmdi model constructed showed that the key driving factors affecting the resilience of the aswrs were es1 es3 as3 and as4 from 1996 to 2019 the order of the cumulative driving effect was es1 es3 as4 as3 these factors were all positive driving factors of resilience 2 based on the arima model it was predicted that es1 es3 and as3 will increase while as4 will slightly decrease multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that resilience will experience an increasingly volatile evolution trend in the future 3 in the future it is necessary to steadily improve the resilience of agricultural water and soil resources by developing different scenario analysis sets for key driving factors reasonably optimizing the planting structure improving the grain yield and considering the healthy development

3274,considering the driving mechanism of agricultural soil water resource composite system aswrs resilience the jiansanjiang branch of china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd is selected as the research object a projection pursuit pp model improved by the sparrow search algorithm ssa was proposed to measure the key drivers of resilience and the driving mechanism of resilience was analysed in combination with the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi the performance of the built model and the rationality of the results were verified thus providing a new horizon for the healthy and sustainable development of agricultural water and soil resources and the environment the results indicated that the ssa pp model constructed in this paper was superior to pp models based on genetic algorithm ga optimization ga pp and particle swarm optimization pso pp in regard to the solution speed and optimization ability and these three models yielded similar conclusions compared with those of the entropy weight ew method the driving results of the ssa pp model are more significant and the screened key driving factors are more reasonable it was finally determined that the impact on the resilience of the aswrs was the result of the joint action of economic and agricultural systems the key driving factors included the per capita gross domestic product gdp paddy field proportion per capita net income and grain output per unit area according to the lmdi results the economic level grain output and paddy field proportion increased which played a positive role in driving resilience with the use of the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model to simulate the future evolution of the key driving factors it was predicted that the resilience level will increase year by year in the future it was found that accelerating the economic development process increasing the grain output implementing rational planning and adjusting the agricultural planting structure are effective ways to enhance resilience keywords resilience agricultural soil water resource composite system sparrow search algorithm projection pursuit driving mechanism logarithmic mean divisia index 1 introduction china is a large developing agricultural country with a population of 1 4 billion people agriculture has always been regarded as a strategic industry in china that can promote food security and social stability water and soil resources are the core resources of agricultural production jiang 2011 it is of practical significance to regard the agricultural water and soil resource system as a composite system during sustainable agricultural development holling first proposed the concept of resilience in the ecological field in 1973 holling 1973 resilience reflects the stability of a system and the ability to maintain normal system operation in today s deteriorating ecological environment resilience has been used to measure the ability of agricultural soil water resources to adapt and respond to environmental changes which has become a new concept in sustainable environmental development exploring the driving mechanism of resilience is necessary to analyse the characteristics of resilience changes by screening key driving factors the effects of different factors on resilience have been studied and the mechanism of resilience has been analysed to fundamentally explain the corresponding variation characteristics with the identification of driving factors multiple schemes have been designed from multiple perspectives to improve aswrs resilience thus providing a theoretical basis for the optimization of the agricultural planting structure from the perspective of resilience current academic research on the driving mechanism of resilience is rich in content and diverse in methods zhang et al 2020b liu et al 2020a selected the flood disaster resilience of jiansanjiang farm as an example and adopted the driver pressure state impact and response dpsir conceptual model to construct an evaluation index system the whale optimization algorithm was combined with the random forest regression algorithm and applied to determine the key driving factors of flood disaster resilience precipitation per capita gross domestic product gdp tertiary industry output population density and the proportions of the young and middle aged populations li et al 2020a employed the dragonfly algorithm to optimize a random forest model and analyse the driving factors of a composite agricultural water and soil resource system the key driving factors were the per capita gdp per capita food production reclamation rate water utilization rate and fertilizer application per unit area qin et al 2018 applied set pair analysis combined with the entropy weight method to evaluate the poverty ecosystem resilience of forest areas in heilongjiang province and analysed the driving system of resilience in different periods the results showed that 12 indicators such as total forestry output value and proportion of displaced people in poverty system and 10 indicators such as pest and disease disaster index and forest coverage rate in forest ecosystem had a nonlinear effect on resilience liu 2019 used factor and interaction detector models as geographic detector models to analyse the spatial and temporal patterns of ecological vulnerability based on the sensitivity recovery and pressure srp evaluation system model the results revealed that the vulnerability of the ecological environment was affected by a combination of multiple driving forces among which vegetation coverage was the largest driving force from 2005 to 2015 zhang et al 2020a selected china as the research object and constructed a national scale ecological resilience evaluation index system to assess the ecological resilience level in 1434 ecological functional areas the results demonstrated that the natural condition index obtained by superimposing a topographic index rainfall and the soil organic matter content was the most important index affecting elasticity additionally the resilience level in china was negatively correlated with ecological sensitivity and ecological vulnerability chagaris et al 2020 developed an integrated ecosystem model of florida bay in ecosim and ecopath software to fully assess its structure and resilience to environmental disturbances the results indicated that the bay was stabilized through debris channels and freshwater flow was the key driving factor enhancing the overall resilience of the bay in addition the provision of a low salinity and low nutrient enrichment system environment was necessary to improve resilience in general abundant research results have been obtained regarding the driving mechanisms of resilience in different research areas however in qualitative analysis of nondeterministic issues such as indicator selection and driving measurement methods there are certain disadvantages such as notable subjectivity and difficulty in the formulation of accurate standards however reliable and stable mathematical models currently lacking in quantitative analysis could provide theoretical support for research on the driving mechanism of resilience moreover the lack of identification and analysis of resilience mechanisms may reduce the research integrity thus in this study the capacity of the projection pursuit pp model in regard to multi dimensional non deterministic problems combined with a factor analysis model to analyse the resilience driving mechanism of the jiansanjiang branch of beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd the pp model is a combination of mathematics computer programming and statistical theory employed to calculate and analyse multidimensional data and is especially suitable for nonlinear and nonnormal high dimensional data analysis tang et al 2021 the pp model can reduce the dimension of the data in the high dimensional space to perform evaluations in the low dimensional space thus providing a way to use the one dimensional method to solve high dimensional problems the pp model is completely data driven not limited by sample size or data structure and not influenced by interference from subjective factors moreover the results are objective and reasonable thus attracting widespread attention when using the pp model to solve practical problems the key is to determine the best projection direction the determination of the best projection direction involves a high dimensional and complex nonlinear problem optimization process and swarm intelligence algorithms have generally been adopted to determine the optimal projection direction wang et al 2021 a swarm intelligence algorithm seeks the optimal solution within a certain range by simulating specific rules for objects or organisms in nature wan et al 2021 these algorithms include ant colony optimization aco jing et al 2020 ramachandranpillai and arock 2020 grey wolf optimization gwo liu et al 2020b jing et al 2021 and the dragonfly algorithm da hammouri et al 2020 meraihi et al 2020 xue proposed a new swarm intelligence optimization algorithm namely the sparrow search algorithm ssa in 2020 xue and shen 2020 compared to other swarm intelligence algorithms this method exhibits the advantages of good stability and excellent search ability and it requires few parameters li et al 2020b in terms of factor analysis the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi can decompose dependent variables into a few factors to facilitate intrinsic influence analysis moreover the remainder of the decomposition results can be further divided so that the dominant driving factors can be quantitatively identified and the direction of the effect of influential factors on the overall trend can be determined zhu et al 2020 with agricultural water and soil resources treated as a coordinated and unified system a new diagnostic method for regional agricultural water and soil resources driven by resilience was proposed based on an existing evaluation indicator system the difficulty of this paper is to combine the advantages of ssa the pp model and the lmdi to carry out appropriate combination so as to screen the main driving factors and analyse the corresponding driving mechanisms sadorsky 2021 the key problem to be solved urgently is to seek the most suitable resilience driving evaluation model therefore through comparisons with the traditional method and other combined intelligence algorithms the rationality of the model and the accuracy of the results are verified and the main evolution characteristics of each key driving factor are analysed the objectives are to enhance the resilience of the aswrs promote the regional sustainable development of the jiansanjiang branch and provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the allocation of regional agricultural planting resources the research objectives of this paper are as follows 1 an analysis model is constructed to determine the driving mechanism of regional aswrs resilience based on ssa pp lmdi theory 2 the key driving factors of aswrs resilience are identified and the corresponding effects are analysed 3 the model performance and reliability of the evaluation results are verified and the trends of the key driving factors and resilience are predicted 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jiansanjiang branch of china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd is located between 132 31 26 134 22 26 east longitude and 46 49 42 48 13 58 north latitude this branch is the interriver zone where the heilong river songhua river and wusuli river converge and is located in the cold temperate humid monsoon climate zone the area includes 15 farms fig 1 with a total area of 12 400 km2 accounting for 22 of the entire reclamation area in heilongjiang province the annual grain production capacity exceeds 15 billion kg and the commercial grain production rate is higher than 80 the jiansanjiang branch is the core grain production area in heilongjiang province li et al 2020a however due to the blind pursuit of economic benefits and yields long term and excessive application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides unreasonable cultivation of swamps wetlands woodlands and grasslands and other poor practices have led to negative effects such as increased agricultural nonpoint source pollution soil impoverishment and insufficient agricultural flood and drought prevention capacities li et al 2014 therefore the corresponding effect on aswrs resilience in this region must be analysed immediately 2 2 data sources the data sources in this study included the statistical yearbook of heilongjiang state farms 1997 2020 the statistical yearbook of the jiansanjiang administration 1996 2016 and the jiansanjiang agricultural reclamation water conservancy annual report 1996 2019 of the jiansanjiang branch of china beidahuang agricultural reclamation group co ltd and the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki statistical data on economic and social development such as precipitation land use efficiency and per capita gdp were extracted and analysed for follow up research on the drivers of resilience 2 3 methods 2 3 1 projection pursuit model the basic objective of the pp model is to transform multidimensional data into low dimensional data and resolve practical problems by determining the best projection that can reflect the structure and characteristics of the original multidimensional data this method performs well in dimensionality reduction and stability zhou 2013 the basic steps are as follows 2 3 1 1 data standardization to avoid the impact of different indicators data dimensions on the results the data are standardized suppose the sample set is x i j i 1 2 m j 1 2 n which indicates that there are m samples and n indicators for a positive indicator bigger is better and the standardized formula is 1 x i j x i j x min j x max j x min j for a negative indicator smaller is better and the standardized formula is 2 x i j x max j x i j x max j x min j where x i j is the normalized value and x max j and x min j are the maximum and minimum values respectively of indicator j 2 3 1 2 projection index function construction the n indicator data x i j are integrated into a one dimensional projection with projection direction a a 1 a 2 a n and the projection value is z i 3 z i j 1 n a j x i j i 1 2 m the projection index function q a is as follows 4 q a s z d z 5 s z i 1 m z i e z 2 m 1 6 d z i 1 m j 1 m r r i j μ r r i j where s z is the standard deviation of projection value z i d z is the local density of projection value z i e z is the mean value of z i i 1 2 m r is the window radius of the local density r i j is the distance between the projection values with r i j z i z j and μ r r i j is the unit step function when r r i j 0 μ r r i j 1 and when r r i j 0 μ r r i j 0 2 3 1 3 projection index function optimization since the projection index function q a changes due to the variation in projection direction a the change in the data structure affects the change in the projection direction and the optimal projection direction vector can reflect the structural characteristics of the high dimensional data to the highest degree possible therefore the optimal projection direction a is calculated by solving the maximum projection index function problem i e the maximum objective function is 7 m a x q a s z d z the constraint condition is 8 s t j 1 p a 2 j 1 2 3 2 sparrow search algorithm the ssa is based on the foraging and anti predation behaviour patterns of the sparrow sparrows are divided into two categories discoverers and joiners the identities of the sparrow joiners and discoverers are interchangeable but the proportion of individuals in each category remains unchanged when sparrows sense danger they move to safety to obtain a better hunting position xue 2019 the calculation process is as follows the location updating equation for the discoverers pd is 9 x i j t 1 x i j t e x p i α i t e r m a x i f r 2 s t x i j t q l i f r 2 s t where t denotes the number of current iterations and i 1 2 3 d moreover itemmax denotes the maximum number of iterations x i j t denotes the position of the i th sparrow in the j th dimension α 0 1 is a random number r 2 0 1 and s t 0 5 1 denote the warning and safety values respectively q is a random number that obeys a normal distribution and l is a 1 d matrix where each matrix element is 1 for r 2 s t the sparrow foraging environment is safe there are no predators and the discoverers can search a wide area for r 2 s t the sparrows have encountered a predator and the other sparrows are warned at this time all sparrows move to a safe area the location updating equation for the joiners is 10 x i j t 1 q e x p x w o r s t x i j t i 2 i f i n 2 x p t 1 x i j t x p t 1 a l o t h e r w i s e where xp is the current best position of the discoverer and xworst is the worst position a is an 1 d matrix where the value of each element is 1 or 1 and a a t a a t 1 for i n 2 the i th joiner with a low fitness value finds no food and must fly to a more favourable location for food assuming that the sparrows in danger sd account for 10 20 of the total number of sparrows the initial positions of these sparrows are randomly generated and can be expressed as 11 x i j t 1 x best t β x i j t x best t i f f i f g x i j t k x i j t x worst t f i f w ε i f f i f g where xbest is the current optimal position and β is the compensation control parameter which is a normally distributed random number with a mean value of 0 and a variance of 1 k 1 1 is a random number fi is the fitness value of the individual sparrow and fg and fw are the global best and worst fitness values respectively ε is a constant set to the smallest value possible to avoid zero in the denominator for f i f g the sparrows at the edge of the population are vulnerable to attacks by predators for f i f g the sparrows in the population are aware of the danger and need to get close to other sparrows to reduce their own risk of predation k is the direction in which the sparrow moves and further functions as a step length control parameter 2 3 3 sparrow search algorithm optimized projection pursuit ssa pp model the ssa pp model can improve the search performance of the algorithm notably the pp model does not readily converge to a local optimal solution and the reliability of the algorithm is enhanced the calculation steps are as follows step 1 program initialization memory clearing and parameter and population initialization the population is set to n the number of iterations is set to t the number of discoverers defined as a percentage is pd the percentage of sparrows who are aware of danger is sd and the safety value is st liu et al 2021a song et al 2016 step 2 the indicator data for the evaluation indicator system are read and eqs 1 and 2 are applied to standardize the sample data step 3 the ssa is employed to determine the optimal projection direction since the ssa must calculate the minimum value the reciprocal of eq 7 is chosen as the objective function i e eq 14 is used as the fitness function 12 m i n q a 1 s z d z the specific steps are as follows step 3 1 eq 8 is adopted as the constraint condition to generate the population step 3 2 fitness values are calculated according to eq 14 and the values are sorted step 3 3 eq 11 is employed to update the locations of the discoverers step 3 4 eq 12 is employed to update the locations of the joiners step 3 5 eq 13 is used to update the positions of the guards step 3 6 the fitness value is calculated and the sparrow positions are updated step 3 7 it is determined whether the termination conditions have been met if so the algorithm is exited and the result is output otherwise steps 3 2 to 3 6 are repeated step 4 the best projection direction and projection value are output i e the driving factor and resilience index respectively are determined simultaneously the resilience level is obtained according to the index grading standard and the aswrs resilience is evaluated and analysed 2 3 4 lmdi decomposition index decomposition analysis ida and structural decomposition analysis sda are applied to decompose the relevant influential factors zhang et al 2018 yang et al 2020 the lmdi model based on ida is chosen to evaluate the influence of a certain factor on resilience during any period and is not limited by zero values xie and li 2017 the specific expression is 13 δ c p w t w o ln w t ln w o ln p t p 0 where δ c p is the effect of driving factor p on resilience and wt and w0 are the resilience index values at time t and the initial time respectively pt and p0 are the actual values of the driving factor at time t and the initial time respectively in this model the effect of each driving factor on resilience is calculated separately when the calculation result is positive the driving factor promotes resilience and vice versa zhang et al 2018 2 3 5 multiple linear regression analysis multiple linear regression analysis is a statistical method used to quantitatively express the relationship between multiple independent and dependent variables via a mathematical expression liao et al 2020 rahman 2014 since resilience is influenced by multiple factors a multiple linear regression model is established to analyse the correlation between the key driving factors and resilience the general form of the multiple linear regression model is 14 y α 1 x 1 α 2 x 2 α n x n β γ where y is the dependent variable x1 x2 xn are the n independent variables α 1 α 2 α n are the regression parameters β is the regression constant and γ is the random error term 2 3 6 arima model the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model is a time series prediction method that was proposed by boques and jenkins in the 1970 s it is a model that transforms a nonstationary time series into a stationary time series after d differences generally no more than 3 differences performs a regression analysis of the lag value of the dependent variable and the present error and lag values and predicts future changes wang et al 2021 liu et al 2021b the model comprises an autoregressive ar process a moving average ma process an autoregressive moving average arma process and an arima process this model considers not only the dependence of data but also the influence of random changes on the prediction results thus the model is highly suitable for short term prediction can achieve high accuracy and has been widely applied park et al 2021 the expression of the arima model is 15 y t φ 1 y t 1 φ 2 y t 2 φ p y t p θ 1 ε t 1 θ 2 ε t 2 θ q ε t q ε t where y is the time series φ p is the autoregression coefficient θ q is the ma coefficient ε t is a white noise sequence p is the autoregressive order and q is the ma order the specific operation steps are shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 architecture of the resilience evaluation index based on the connotation and characteristics of aswrs resilience referring to previous research results and considering the actual conditions in the study area jing 2010 zhao 2009 liu et al 2020c shang 2010 liu et al 2018 wang 2014 liu et al 2019 31 indicators were selected from many evaluation indicators xu et al 2021 the specific indicators are shown in fig 3 according to the resilience evaluation indicator system each farm was associated with 31 indicator data points namely 31 dimensional data points occurred with the use of data for 15 farms obtained from 1996 to 2019 as samples a total of 360 31 dimensional datasets were established according to the correlations of the indicators these datasets were standardized according to eqs 1 and 2 and substituted into the ssa pp model the specific parameters were set as follows population number n 50 maximum number of iterations t 1000 proportion of finders pd 20 proportion of sparrows aware of danger sd 10 and safety value st 0 8 mao and zhang 2020 du et al 2021 the best projection direction was a 0 1325 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0550 0 0010 0 0010 0 0188 0 0371 0 4383 0 3121 0 0010 0 0010 0 0010 0 0191 0 0537 0 4377 0

indicator with a projection direction greater than 0 3 was considered an important indicator of resilience i e these indicators were key driving factors an indicator with a projection direction ranging from 0 1 to 0 3 was a general indicator of resilience and an indicator with a projection direction ranging from 0 to 0 1 was an unimportant indicator of resilience li et al 2021 liu et al 2020a the order of importance of some indicators is shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the most important factors that influence aswrs resilience include the per capita net income es3 and per capita gdp es1 in the economic system es and the paddy field proportion as4 and grain output per unit area as3 in the agricultural system as the importance of these four driving factors is higher than 0 3 so they can be regarded as key driving factors of resilience the per capita green area ees4 and crop area affected rate ees5 in the ecological environment system ees annual gdp growth rate es2 in the es and precipitation wrs1 in the water resource system wrs are general driving factors the remaining factors with contributions to resilience smaller than 0 1 are considered unimportant driving factors the key driving factors indicate that es indicators contribute the most to resilience followed by as indicators improving the overall economic level increasing the paddy field proportion reducing the area of dry land increasing greening focusing on disaster prevention and mitigation and protecting the environment are key measures to improve resilience 3 2 calculation of the resilience index projection value the sample data for the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 were standardized according to the obtained processed results and best projection direction the above constructed ssa pp model was introduced to determine the projection value of the resilience index of the jiansanjiang branch in each year the results are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the projected value of the resilience index of the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 exhibited an overall upward trend with an increase of 11 in 2002 the lowest projection value of the resilience index was 0 3497 after which the value steadily increased until a peak value of 2 2709 was reached in 2012 the index value slightly decreased thereafter the projected values of the resilience index from 1996 to 2006 were all lower than 1 and the overall resilience level was low which was mainly restricted by the low level of economic development however in one interval the resilience index revealed a steady increase from 1996 to 2000 during china s ninth five year plan resilience increased by 1 76 from 2001 to 2005 during china s 10th five year plan resilience increased by 12 4 which was the fastest increase in the five years in 2002 es1 and es3 for the jiansanjiang branch were the lowest in recent years and as3 was only higher than that in 1996 low values of the three key driving factors were the main reasons for the minimum projected resilience index value in 2002 from 2006 to 2010 during china s 11th five year plan resilience rapidly improved to 17 93 and the first peak was reached this trend was closely related to the rapid economic development requirements established during the 11th five year plan from 2011 to 2015 during the 12th five year plan of china resilience increased by 2 01 in 2012 as3 and es1 for the jiansanjiang administration bureau reached their highest values at that time these two key factors ensured that the resilience reached a first peak subsequently the resilience index fluctuated with a slight downward trend but the overall resilience index still maintained a high level until it reached a peak value of 2 427 in 2019 the key driving factors identified based on the ssa pp model play decisive roles in the calculation of the resilience index and it was further determined that the key driving factor screening results are reasonable increasing economic development and food production levels are necessary for enhancing resilience 3 3 analysis of the resilience driving effect based on the data for the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 and referring to the lmdi model described above the driving effect of resilience was decomposed and cumulatively assessed year by year considering the four key driving factors obtained with the ssa pp model furthermore the indicator driving effect based on the ssa pp lmdi model was obtained according to the results the cumulative driving effect values of es1 es3 as4 and as3 in relation to the resilience of the jiansanjiang branch from 1996 to 2019 were 2 7534 2 4080 1 0510 and 0 4902 respectively these results indicated that the four key driving factors were all positive driving factors of resilience and the order of the magnitude of these effects was es1 es3 as4 as3 a comparison of the key driving factor indicator values and growth rates is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows that the driving effect varied with the growth rate of each indicator and the trend remained relatively consistent as shown in fig 6 a in 1997 1999 2002 and 2015 the driving effect of es3 was negative under the influence of negative income growth and the value was positive during the remaining 20 years therefore the driving effect of es3 on resilience was positive in 2002 es3 reached a minimum value which indicated negative growth so the driving effect was negative affected by the decrease in es3 in 2015 the growth rate was 0 15 hence the driving effect of es3 on resilience in 2015 reached a negative minimum as shown in fig 6 b the driving effect of es1 on resilience was positive except in 1999 2002 2013 2014 and 2018 and the driving effect exhibited a steady upward trend before 2013 in 2002 es1 reached a minimum value and the growth rate was 0 0665 as a factor that positively influences the driving effect the driving effect decreased and became negative in 1999 2013 2014 and 2018 es1 also declined leading to a negative driving effect as shown in fig 6 c the trend of the driving effect for as4 on resilience was highly consistent with that of the indicator growth rate revealing an overall fluctuating trend in 2000 2001 2003 2005 2008 2014 2015 and 2019 as4 had an inhibitory effect on resilience combined with the interannual variation and growth rate the paddy field proportion in these years exhibited a negative growth trend and the driving effect was therefore negative based on the overall driving effect as4 promoted increased resilience indicating that adjusting the planting structure increasing the paddy field proportion and reducing the planting area of dry fields were effective measures for improving resilience as shown in fig 6 d as3 had a negative effect on resilience in 1997 2000 2002 2008 2009 2013 2015 2017 and 2019 considering interannual changes the lowest value of as3 was observed in 2002 and the growth rate reached the lowest negative trend moreover 2013 was the year with the largest decline after the peak attained in 2012 therefore as3 imposed an inhibitory effect on resilience indicating a negative driving result es3 and es1 are important indicators used to measure the regional economic level and are closely related to both social stability and development as4 is an important indicator reflecting the characteristics of the planting structure and as3 is the embodiment of the optimization result of the planting structure therefore increasing the per capita net income and improving the living standards of residents are the only ways to enhance resilience it is recommended that under the premise of ensuring steady improvement in the economic level considering the healthy development of the ecological environment grain production should be increased the planting structure should be rationally optimized and a steady improvement in aswrs resilience should be achieved 4 discussion 4 1 performance verification of the ssa pp model to verify the rationality and accuracy of the calculation results the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm yang et al 2021 and genetic algorithm ga luo et al 2021 were adopted pp models based on pso pso pp and ga optimization ga pp were established to solve the objective function the data and constraint conditions were consistent with those mentioned above and both models were implemented in matlab r2016a software the algorithm parameter settings are listed in table 1 the convergence curves of the three algorithms in solving the objective function were compared and the results are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the convergence curve of the ssa pp model is smooth and starts to converge and eventually reaches a stable state near the 30th iteration the pso pp model starts to converge at approximately the 40th iteration and the final optimal convergence value is relatively large indicating that the convergence speed and optimization capability of the pso pp model greatly differ from those of the ssa pp model the ga pp model gradually converges near the 200th iteration to a value close to but slightly greater than the optimal value of the ssa pp model in conclusion compared to the pso pp and ga pp models the ssa pp model achieves obvious competitive advantages in terms of its comprehensive optimization ability and convergence performance 4 2 comparative analysis of the recognition results of the different models the optimal projection direction is obtained by solving the objective functions of the three models and the weight of the indicators affecting resilience are calculated by using the traditional entropy weight ew method the results of the entropy weight method and intelligent algorithms are compared to measure the degrees of influence of the driving factors the results are shown in fig 8 which reveals that the optimal projection direction for each factor calculated by the three intelligent algorithms is slightly different but the overall order is very similar notably it can be observed that the best projection directions for es3 es1 as4 and as3 are higher than those for the other factors such as fifth ranking ees4 and the results obtained with the three algorithms only differ slightly compared with the ew method in this approach the difference in the degree of influence of the identified indicators is small and it is difficult to select several key factors from the 31 indicators the five indicators with the highest impacts were the proportion of water conservancy employees annual gdp growth rate inland water area proportion per capita arable land area and per capita green area the most influential indicator was the proportion of water conservancy employees which is significantly more influential than the other indicators however from a practical perspective improving the proportion of water conservancy employees cannot fundamentally change the resilience of the aswrs the change in the inland water area proportion from 1996 to 2019 was very small and the proportion of the inland water area will not change significantly in the future so it will not affect resilience therefore this result is considered inconsistent with the actual situation however both the annual gdp growth rate and per capita arable land area are indicators reflecting the economic system and agricultural system and the findings are similar to the screening results of the ssa pp model but the key driving factors of resilience determined by the ssa pp model are more reasonable in previous research liu et al 2019 proposed that as3 and es1 are the key driving factors of resilience in a study of the resilience of the agricultural water and soil resources of the jiansanjiang administration es3 was considered a key driving factor in research on the resilience of the agricultural water resource system of the jiansanjiang administration ding 2017 as4 was considered the key driving factor in a study of the resilience of irrigated areas in heilongjiang and a risk characteristic analysis of the agricultural water and soil resources of the jiansanjiang administration li 2018 liu et al 2020b because the evaluation indicators and research methods adopted in previous resilience studies in different regions varied the screening results of the driving factors differed however the key driving factors selected in this paper are similar to those in other studies it can be concluded that the key driving factors identified based on the ssa pp model are highly reliable which verifies that these four indicators are key driving factors of resilience 4 3 analysis of the future evolution trend of resilience actual data for the four key driving factors in recent years were combined and the arima model was applied to predict the changes in the key driving factors and analyse the future resilience evolution trend under the actions of these drivers data from 1996 to 2016 were chosen as the training sample set and data from 2017 to 2019 were reserved as the test sample set to verify the rationality of the model first the data for the four key driving factors were converted into a stationary time series via differential processing and the value of the number of differences d was determined then spss software was employed to adjust the parameters p and q and the parameter combination yielding the largest stable r2 value was selected to establish the arima model liu et al 2021b then predicted values of the key driving factors were obtained and the 95 confidence interval was determined the optimal models of es3 es1 as4 and as3 were the arima 3 2 3 arima 3 2 3 arima 2 2 3 and arima 3 2 1 models respectively the error results are summarized in table 2 table 2 reveals that the average absolute error percentages of es3 and as3 for the training and test sets are both lower than 10 which indicates that the model constructed above is reliable the average absolute error percentage of es1 for the test set is high and is mainly affected by the sharp decline in es1 in 2018 es1 in 2018 was 79 600 yuan which is only 1 000 yuan higher than that in 2011 and 11 800 yuan lower than that in 2017 therefore the model error for the test set is affected but given the average absolute error for the training set 7 77 the model is considered reasonable the average absolute error percentage of as4 for the training set is 12 82 mainly due to the large fluctuations in this factor from 2002 to 2007 the average absolute error for the training set is 8 03 excluding the years of abnormal fluctuation therefore the large error for the training set is affected by the abnormal fluctuations in the specific gravity of paddy fields because the average absolute error of the test set reaches only 4 65 the model is considered reasonable and the prediction results of the key driving factors are shown in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a es3 exhibited a fluctuating trend from 2017 to 2020 after which the value rose significantly with an expected increase of 17 by 2025 es3 is expected to reach 38 154 yuan as shown in fig 9 b es1 showed a steady upwards trend after 2017 with an expected increase of 9 4 by 2025 es1 is expected to reach 171 741 yuan this suggests that the upward economic trend is obvious which is consistent with the goal of achieving new levels of economic development and sustained and healthy economic development on the basis of notable improvements in quality and efficiency during the 14th five year plan thus conforming to the established standards as shown in fig 9 c as4 exhibited a slight fluctuating downward trend after 2017 with an expected decline of 0 75 and the paddy field proportion is expected to reach 79 34 by 2025 in the jiansanjiang branch area the primary focus is rice planting which produces a high yield and good economic benefits and will remain the mainstream crop in the future however the current proportion of rice planting is relatively high and is expected to be maintained based on current conditions in the area as shown in fig 9 d as3 displayed an upward trend after 2017 with an expected increase of 8 4 by 2025 as3 is expected to reach 9477 kg hm2 with the popularization of high yield and high quality crops agricultural modernization and improvements in the cultivation rate as3 for the jiansanjiang branch will inevitably increase year by year therefore the expected steady increase in as3 objectively reflects the actual conditions in the area adopting the aswrs resilience for the jiansanjiang branch as the dependent variable and the key driving factors as the independent variables a multiple linear regression equation was constructed to determine the functional relationship between the independent and dependent variables liu 2018 spss software was employed to conduct a multiple regression analysis of the resilience index and key driving factors and the following regression equation was obtained y 0 3421 x 1 0 1525 x 2 0 0648 x 3 0 0001 x 4 0 3967 in the above equation x1 x2 x3 and x4 denote es3 as4 es1 and as3 respectively in regard to the linear regression model r2 0 995 and sig 0 00895 0 05 indicating that the 95 test of significance is passed the independent and dependent variables display an obvious linear relationship and the multiple linear regression equation can be established the functional relationship and the predicted values of the key driving factors are used to estimate the future evolution trend of resilience and the results are shown in fig 10 according to fig 10 the estimated resilience based on the changes in the above four key drivers will exhibit an upward trend in the future with an estimated increase of 9 37 and resilience is expected to reach 3 26 in 2025 notably 1996 2002 2003 2008 2009 2013 and 2014 2017 are high volatility cycles for resilience and each cycle lasts approximately 5 years indicating that resilience experiences cyclical fluctuations similar to the cyclical fluctuations in the grain output per unit area the steady improvement in resilience is a manifestation of the effectiveness of socioecological development a more rational allocation of resources sustained reductions in the total emission of major pollutants sustained improvements in the ecological environment and strong ecological security barriers are the societal development trends and goals in the future therefore increase in the level of resilience should support the practical needs of the population in the area 5 conclusions 1 the ssa pp lmdi model constructed showed that the key driving factors affecting the resilience of the aswrs were es1 es3 as3 and as4 from 1996 to 2019 the order of the cumulative driving effect was es1 es3 as4 as3 these factors were all positive driving factors of resilience 2 based on the arima model it was predicted that es1 es3 and as3 will increase while as4 will slightly decrease multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that resilience will experience an increasingly volatile evolution trend in the future 3 in the future it is necessary to steadily improve the resilience of agricultural water and soil resources by developing different scenario analysis sets for key driving factors reasonably optimizing the planting structure improving the grain yield and considering the healthy development
