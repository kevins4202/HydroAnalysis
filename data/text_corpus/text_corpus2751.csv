13755,this study aimed at evaluating the potential use of carbonated bauxite residue cbr as filter substrate to upgrade phosphorus p removal in small wastewater treatment plants such as constructed wetlands comparative experiments of p removal were performed in two columns continuously fed with synthetic and real wastewater to investigate the behavior of cbr under aerobic column a and anoxic biotic conditions column b the effect of various parameters including ph temperature addition of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen concentration was investigated also a series of chemical extractions was performed to elucidate the main mechanisms of p removal achieved by cbr over 140 days of operation columns a and b showed a total p removal performance of 98 5 and 91 6 thus reaching a total p removal capacity of 0 63 mg p g cbr and 0 61 mg p g cbr respectively the results indicate that aeration conditions and microbial activity can significantly affect the performance of cbr filters under aerobic conditions precipitation of ca p complexes appears to be the main mechanism leading to p removal under anoxic biotic conditions microbially driven mobilization of fe from cbr may provide fe ions for fe p precipitation but also it may lead to fe release from the filters this study provides crucial information to evaluate the potential use of cbr at different steps of the wastewater treatment process overall the results indicate that the use of cbr filters is particularly suitable as a tertiary treatment step to remove p from effluents with low organic load under aerobic conditions keywords wastewater treatment phosphorus removal bauxite residue constructed wetland reactive filter 1 introduction nowadays improving phosphorus p removal performances in small wastewater treatment plants wwtps such as constructed wetlands cws represents a topical issue for researchers and professionals in the field of wastewater treatment 1 several strategies are currently being studied including the enhanced p biological uptake by intermittent aeration 2 the use of electrochemical methods to intensify electron exchanges 3 the improvement of iron dosing strategies for efficient p removal 4 and the selection of wetland plants and substrate materials with high p sorption capacities 5 6 during the last decade the use of separate filter units filled with reactive materials having a high affinity for p binding has been proposed as a promising solution to upgrade p removal performances in cws 7 10 a large variety of reactive materials including natural soils and sediments industrial wastes and by products and manufactured adsorbent materials have been tested for p removal 11 13 most of these materials present high contents of calcium ca iron fe and or aluminum al which are elements with a strong affinity for p binding 13 14 several international studies have demonstrated that bauxite residue a fe and al oxide rich waste from the aluminum industry is an efficient filter material for p removal from wastewater 15 18 according to evans 19 aluminum industry produces about 150 mt per year of bauxite residue worldwide of which no more of 3 5 is reused in a productive way e g cement and ceramic production 20 this indicates a very interesting potential market of bauxite residue valorization as filter substrate in cws maximum p removal capacities ranged from 6 to up than 12 mg p g bauxite residue 16 17 thus depending on the type and composition of bauxite residue and on the experimental parameters established for the experiments the main mechanisms leading to p removal were anionic adsorption on functional sites e g oh and precipitation of ca p complexes on the mineral surface of bauxite residue 17 due to its high alkaline nature 19 bauxite residue can produce high ph leachates up to 13 20 and therefore a pretreatment with gypsum was efficiently proposed by cusack et al 15 to neutralize its alkalinity and reduce ph leachates below 9 however most of these studies were performed in batch and using synthetic p solutions which did not contain all the components occurring in real effluents that may affect p removal performances e g microorganisms and organic compounds competing ions suspended solids moreover results from batch experiments usually cannot be directly employed to preview the behavior of field scale filters as treatment performances and p removal mechanisms can differ under dynamic operating conditions to the best of our knowledge only a study in the literature has investigated p removal performances of bauxite residue in small scale columns continuously fed with real effluents 21 furthermore there is a lack of data in the literature concerning the effect of aeration conditions and microbial activity on the performance of bauxite residue filters this study aimed at evaluating performances and determining p removal mechanisms of carbonated bauxite residue cbr under aerobic and anoxic biotic conditions indeed the organic content in wastewater and or the addition of external organic carbon to the effluents which is often used as a strategy to enhance heterotrophic denitrification in wwtps 22 23 may promote the establishment of anoxic biotic conditions in water saturated filters therefore knowledge and understanding of the effect of different aeration conditions and microbial activity on the behavior of cbr are indispensable to evaluate its potential use as filter substrate at different steps of the wastewater treatment process in cws the novelty and importance of this paper are highlighted by the following two points i the first comparative investigation of p removal performances of cbr under aerobic and anoxic conditions in dynamic flow experiments two laboratory scale columns were filled with cbr and continuously fed with synthetic and real cw effluents the effect of various parameters including ph temperature addition of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen concentration on p removal performances was investigated ii an in depth critical investigation of the p removal mechanisms achieved by cbr a systemic approach which involves the integration and analysis of the experimental results of water quality monitoring and chemical extractions from cbr was followed to investigate mineralogical changes and to elucidate the main mechanisms of p removal achieved by cbr under aerobic and anoxic biotic conditions overall the results of this study allow evaluating the behavior of cbr under real operating scenarios and they provide crucial information for the scale up of the filters from the laboratory to the field scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 bauxite residue collection and preparation the samples of bauxite residue used in this study were provided by the company alteo gardanne france their main chemical composition was fe2o3 45 53 al2o3 10 16 tio2 9 15 sio2 5 8 cao 3 8 and na2o 3 5 data from alteo before column experiments bauxite residues were mixed with gypsum caso4 2h2o at a dried mass ratio of 5 mass of gypsum to mass of bauxite residue and put in contact with the atmosphere to produce cbr this was done to neutralize the naoh content of bauxite residue by carbonation and calcium carbonate precipitation according to eq 1 and to decrease the ph of cbr leachates below a value of 9 as described by cusack et al 15 and experienced in large scale on the storage site of alteo 1 2naoh caso4 2h2o co2 caco3 na2so4 3h2o after carbonation cbr was sieved and the fraction less than 2 mm was collected to perform column experiments cbr samples were dried at 45 c overnight to reduce their water content before the experiments the temperature of 45 c was selected in order to reduce the risk of changes in the mineralogical composition during drying 24 the remaining water content of cbr was determined after heating at 105 c until constant weight 2 2 set up of column experiments two glass columns of total volume 0 59 l were filled with about 0 35 l of cbr each thus corresponding to about 0 45 kg dried mass of cbr per column columns a and b the main details of the column design are shown in fig 1 during the full period of operation the columns were continuously fed according to a vertical up flow of about 12 ml h thus giving a theoretical hydraulic retention time based on the initial void volume hrtv of around 24 h during the first 54 days of operation column a was fed with a synthetic solution of about 10 mg p l and 40 mg n l prepared with tap water kh2po4 and kno3 these p and nitrogen n concentrations are in good agreement with the average outlet concentrations of vertical flow cws in france total p 8 3 mg p l phosphate p 8 2 mg p l total kjeldahl n 7 7 mg n l ammonium n 5 6 mg n l and nitrate n 56 25 mg n l average values standard deviations of 151 plants 25 then from day 55 140 the column a was fed with the real effluent of a vertical flow cw that treats the domestic wastewater of a small french municipality 1500 people equivalent rougiers france during the same periods of operation the column b was operated identically to column a but with the only difference that the feeding solutions were enriched with about 0 5 g l of glucose this was done to favor the establishment of anoxic metabolic conditions in column b column experiments were performed at the laboratory under room temperature conditions 22 7 2 1 c average value standard deviation 4 measures per week main composition and physical chemical properties of the inlet solutions are summarized in table 1 2 3 water quality monitoring inlet and outlet values of ph redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen do were measured twice per week by water probes water samples about 40 ml were collected from the inlet and from the outlet of each column twice per week then total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 p total n tn chemical oxygen demand cod al ca and fe concentrations of the water samples were measured tp concentrations were determined after persulfate digestion en iso6878 2004 whereas po4 p al ca and fe concentrations were determined after filtration 0 45 μm filters of the water samples differences between tp removal efficiencies of columns a and b were tested by the non parametric mann whitney u test and were considered significant at p value 0 05 analytical and statistical methods are described in the supplementary information si 2 4 chemical extractions a series of chemical extractions was performed to investigate the p content and chemical changes of cbr before and after column experiments and hence to elucidate the main p removal mechanisms occurring in the columns samples of cbr were taken at the inlet zone of the columns a and b after 140 days of operation fig 1 since this zone was exposed to inlet p rich wastewater these samples were likely to have had a high amount of p bound to their surfaces before the chemical extractions the samples of cbr were dried overnight at 45 c to reduce water content and to avoid mineralogical changes deriving from high temperature drying 24 aqua regia extractions were performed according to standard methods en 13346 2000 en 13657 2003 to determine the total p content of cbr before and after column experiments a series of chemical extractions was performed to quantify the amount of reactive amorphous and crystalline fe hydro xides and al hydro xides on cbr samples before and after their use in the columns indeed speciation of reactive fe and al compounds in cbr may give useful information to better understand and describe the p binding mechanisms 26 amorphous fe crystalline fe and al hydro xides extractions were performed according to standard method iso 12782 1 2009 iso 12782 2 2009 and iso 12782 3 2009 respectively a sequential extraction protocol adapted from tiessen and moir 27 was followed to quantify the fractions of p bound to different mineral compounds in cbr before and after column experiments four fractions of p were sequentially extracted from 1 g of cbr dried mass equivalent following the procedure described in barca et al 28 i bicarbonate extractable inorganic p this fraction is defined as weakly bound p as p extraction is mainly due to washing and ion exchange ii hydroxide extractable inorganic p this fraction is primarily related to dissolution of al and fe bound p compounds that are soluble at high ph iii diluted acid extractable inorganic p this fraction is defined as ca bound p as p extraction is mainly due to dissolution of ca p complexes at low ph iv hot concentrated acid extractable organic and inorganic p this fraction represents p in stable residual compounds that need much more energy to be dissolved the detailed protocols of the chemical extractions are presented and discussed in si all chemical extractions were performed in duplicate or triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 p removal performances the average values and standard deviations of inlet and outlet tp po4 p do ph eh tn cod fe al and ca of columns a and b over day 1 54 synthetic solution feeding and day 55 140 of operation real effluent feeding are summarized in table 1 a slight cod release from column a was observed only during the first 3 weeks of operation with outlet concentrations up to 52 mg cod l this was primarily attributed to the use of organic flocculants polyacrylamide during the dewatering process of bauxite residue 19 for both the columns the average inlet tp concentration was 10 3 0 5 mg p l during the first period of operation synthetic solution feeding and 5 5 1 5 1 7 mg p l during the second period of operation real effluent feeding results in table 1 also indicate that po4 p represent more than 98 of inlet tp for synthetic solutions day 1 54 and more than 89 of inlet tp for real effluents day 55 140 the difference between tp and po4 p content in real effluents was primarily attributed to stable organic p and p content in microorganisms 29 over the full period of 140 days of operation inlet and outlet do concentrations of column a were 6 4 1 0 mg o2 l and 2 3 1 4 mg o2 l respectively whereas inlet and outlet do concentrations of column b were 2 0 3 2 mg o2 l and 0 3 0 4 mg o2 l respectively with outlet do stabilizing below a value of 0 3 mg o2 l after day 28 of operation fig s1 b these results indicate that column a was operated under aerobic conditions during the full period of operation day 1 140 whereas column b was operated under anoxic conditions this especially during the second period of operation day 55 140 as shown in fig 2 a outlet tp concentrations of column a were always lower than 0 7 mg p l with an average value of 0 1 mg p l this indicates very high p removal efficiencies of column a during the full period of operation day 1 140 over the first period of operation day 1 55 column b showed outlet tp concentrations always lower than 0 2 mg p l thus showing very high p removal efficiencies 98 however a decrease in p removal performance of column b was observed during the second period of operation day 55 140 when an average outlet tp concentration of 0 9 mg p l and some massive releases of p outlet tp 2 mg p l were observed fig 2b the results from non parametric mann whitney u tests si indicate that the differences between tp removal efficiencies of columns a and b were not significant during day 1 54 of operation p value 0 528 whereas they were significant during day 55 140 of operation p value 0 0001 fig 3 a shows the evolution of tp retained as a function of tp added at the inlet of each column mg p g cbr over the full period of 140 days of operation column a showed a tp removal performance of 98 5 and it reached a tp retention capacity of 0 63 mg p g cbr whereas column b showed a tp removal performance of 91 6 and it reached a tp retention capacity of 0 61 mg p g cbr as shown in fig 3a p removal performance of column b has started to decline during the second period of operation day 55 140 when the column b was fed with a real cw effluent enriched with glucose to promote anoxic biotic conditions inside the column overall these results suggest that the development of anoxic biotic conditions during the operation of column b may account for its lower p removal performance as described in the following sections cod and tn removal were studied to investigate the main metabolic processes occurring in the columns fig 3b shows the evolution of tn removed as a function of tn added to the inlet of the columns a and b mg n g cbr over the full period of 140 days of operation columns a and b removed 66 1 and 87 3 of tn added to the inlet of each column respectively tn removal in column a was most probably primarily related to adsorption of nitrate no3 on functional groups e g oh at the surface of cbr 17 as already described by cengeloglu et al 30 as shown in fig 3b tn removal performance of column a started to decline after 55 days of operation thus suggesting saturation of adsorption sites instead column b showed a higher tn removal performance over the full period of operation most probably glucose addition and low do concentrations promoted heterotrophic denitrification in column b thus improving tn removal performance inlet and outlet do cod and tn concentrations of column b table 1 appears to confirm that tn removal was related to cod removal according to the metabolic pathways of heterotrophic denitrification indeed several studies in the literature indicate that denitrification in cws occurs when do is below 0 5 mg o2 l and the mass ratio of organic carbon to no3 is higher than 2 86 g cod g n 23 31 furthermore the results of this study are in good agreement with the findings of previous pilot experiments 32 which have shown that the addition of methanol as a carbon substrate for denitrification improves the tn removal performance of bauxsol pellets seawater neutralized bauxite residues by a factor of 2 over the full period of 140 days of operation inlet and outlet eh values for column b were 229 32 mv and 182 27 mv table 1 respectively these results appear to confirm reduction of electron acceptors e g no3 during water filtration trough the column b moreover experimental eh values varied in the range of values that promote denitrification in cws 29 33 table 2 summarizes the main results of previous column studies that have investigated p removal performances of various types of untreated and treated bauxite residue p removal performances varied from 56 to 98 thus confirming that bauxite residue is an efficient filter material to remove p from wastewater however it is difficult to compare the results of the different studies because of the large discrepancy on experimental parameters such as type of bauxite residue type of solution inlet p concentration and particle size comparative experiments of herron et al 34 have indicated that p removal performance increases from 28 to 98 with decreasing particle size from 12 to 2 mm most probably because the lower particle size gives a higher specific surface available for p sorption however the lower particle size can also result in lower pore size between the grains thus reducing the hydraulic conductivity of the filters 35 in addition various biological and physical chemical phenomena including biofilm growth retention of suspended solids particle segregation precipitation and accumulation of precipitates may further decrease the void volume and the pore size 36 thus affecting the long term hydraulic and treatment performances of the filters and increasing the risk of clogging when treating real effluents therefore herron et al 34 recommended the 6 mm as optimum particle size in field scale applications it should be also noticed that many of the experiments were conducted for too short a period to evaluate long term performances of the filters 21 34 despland et al 32 observed that p removal performances of columns packed with bauxsol pellets decreased from 95 to 80 and to 60 after 5 and 6 months of operation respectively thus suggesting saturation of p retention capacity the results of our study indicate very high p removal performances over the full period of 140 days of operation especially for column a 98 5 and no clogging phenomena were observed 3 2 alkaline and metal leaching from cbr alkaline releases from both the columns were observed during the full period of operation with average outlet ph values of 8 3 0 5 and 7 7 0 6 for columns a and b respectively these ph increases were secondarily attributed to release of residual diluted na2co3 and mainly to caco3 dissolution from cbr according to eq 2 37 as already described in a recent study that has investigated the effect of gypsum treatment on the leaching behavior of cbr 15 2 caco3 h2o ca2 hco3 oh the highest outlet ph values from 8 5 to 9 1 were observed during the first 2 months of operation fig s2 then they stabilized around a value of 7 7 0 1 and 7 2 0 2 for columns a and b respectively after day 100 of operation over the full period of operation column b showed lower outlet ph than column a this was most probably related to the production of organic acids during the metabolic conversion of glucose in column b which buffered the increase in ph due to caco3 dissolution the evolution of ca al and fe release rates μg g cbr day from columns a and b was calculated by outlet to inlet mass balances using eq 3 where coutlet indicates the outlet metal concentration μg l cinlet the inlet metal concentration μg l m the dried mass of cbr in the column g and f the feeding flow l day 3 r e l e a s e r a t e c o u t l e t c i n l e t m f as shown in fig 4 positive values indicate metal release from cbr whereas negative values indicate metal retention on cbr massive releases of ca 1200 mg ca l were observed from both the columns during the first 3 weeks of operation fig s3 and they were most probably related to dissolution of caco3 and or unreacted caso4 2h2o from cbr equation 1 and 2 then the data clearly indicate ca retention in column a since day 42 of operation with outlet ca concentrations always lower than inlet ca concentrations during the second period of operation real effluent feeding the molar ratio of ca removed to p removed in column a varied from 10 8 to 56 0 mol ca mol p these values are 6 5 to 56 times higher than ca to p molar ratios of the most common ca phosphates in wastewater treatment systems 1 1 67 mol ca mol p 38 thus suggesting co precipitation of ca phosphates and ca carbonates under slightly basic conditions inlet ph 7 6 0 3 outlet ph 8 0 0 4 as already found in previous studies 16 39 differently from column a results from column b do not indicate ca retention during the second period of operation real effluent feeding this although the ca content of the real cw effluent was not a limiting factor for ca p precipitation as indicated by the ca to p molar ratios always higher than 34 mol ca mol p most probably the lower ph values of column b inlet ph 6 4 0 5 outlet ph 7 2 0 3 had the effect of limiting ca phosphate and ca carbonate precipitation compared to column a indeed solubility of ca phosphate and ca carbonate drastically increases with decreasing ph below 8 40 however the findings of cusack et al 21 indicate that p removal by surface precipitation of ca phosphates can happen at almost neutral ph and without requiring the consumption of ca ions from the inlet wastewater as the result of the interaction between po4 p ions present in the wastewater with ca compounds already present in the composition of bauxite residue massive releases of al from cbr were observed during the first period of operation day 1 55 fig 4 c with outlet al concentration exceeding 30 mg al l and 15 mg al l for columns a and b respectively fig s4 these al concentrations are several orders of magnitude higher than the maximum theoretical solubility of al hydroxides in water for ph ranging between 7 8 at 20 c 0 3 mg al l according to 41 therefore they were primarily attributed to washing out from the columns of colloidal fractions and or very fine al cbr particles passing the 0 45 μm filters then outlet al concentrations stabilized below a value of 1 mg al l after day 98 and after day 49 of operation for columns a and b respectively lower outlet al concentrations of column b were most probably related to the more neutral values of outlet ph compared to column a table 1 as it is well known from the literature that al hydroxides present minimum solubility at ph ranging between 6 7 41 with the only exception of day 49 column a showed very few fe releases during the full period of operation fig 4b with outlet fe concentrations lower than 0 3 mg fe l fig s5 the higher outlet fe concentration on day 49 was most probably affected by a cleaning step of the outlet pipe that likely had the effect of mobilizing and washing out from the column some fine particles of cbr differently from column a column b showed higher fe releases during the second period of operation real effluent feeding with outlet fe concentrations up to 2 1 mg fe l these results on metal release are in good agreement with the findings of cusack et al 21 who observed al and fe releases from bauxite residue in rapid small scale column tests with outlet al and fe concentrations up to 3 5 and 3 mg l respectively therefore they recommended a washing step before packing bauxite residue to prevent excessive al and fe releases from the filters 3 3 iron mobilization in cbr the results of our study seem to indicate fe mobilization from cbr in column b under anoxic biotic conditions thus giving fe releases up to 2 1 mg fe l both eh and ph values are commonly used as key parameters to evaluate redox conditions and to interpret metal solubility data in soils 42 43 the relationship between outlet eh and ph for columns a and b during the full period of operation is presented in fig 5 pourbaix diagram 44 the results indicate a very good linear correlation between the experimental data r2 0 949 with eh increasing with decreasing the ph these eh ph relationships are in very good agreement with the findings of husson et al 42 who concluded that both eh and ph should be interactively used as relevant primary parameters to characterize redox conditions in soils as shown in fig 5 outlet eh and ph values varied between the ranges of values that promote solid phase fe hydroxides fe oh 3 at 23 c which was the average temperature during column experiments adapted from 45 however it should be noticed that theoretical fe3 fe2 equilibrium conditions in fig 5 are established for fe oh 3 solution in pure water the presence of organic matter and or microorganisms and the related microbial activities can play a key role in fe mobilization from solid matrices 26 46 48 under anoxic conditions microorganisms can use fe3 as a terminal electron acceptor to oxidize organic matter during the anaerobic respiration process thus reducing fe3 to more soluble fe2 moreover microorganisms can produce fe3 chelating molecules e g siderophores to improve the bio availability of soluble fe3 compounds from crystalline fe3 minerals 46 overall this microbially driven process of fe3 chelation and reduction can result in the mobilization of soluble fe3 compounds and release of fe2 ions the results in fig 5 also suggest a shift from more oxidizing to less oxidizing conditions with increasing temperature from 16 7 24 3 c probably because the increase in temperature has a positive effect on microbial activity and a negative effect on oxygen saturation concentration the chemical notion of pe ph which involves both the eh and ph parameters can be used as an indicator of the electronic activity of a solution in the presence of living organisms 42 43 48 the electronic potential pe at 25 c can be calculated from eh mv by using eq 4 4 p e e h 59 according to husson et al 42 at 25 c pure water is redox indifferent at pe ph equal to 13 8 then pe ph values higher than 13 8 indicate oxidizing media whereas pe ph values lower than 13 8 indicate reducing media the fig 6 shows the relationship between fe concentrations and pe ph values of the effluents from columns a and b during the second period of operation real effluent feeding when fe release was observed at the outlet of column b for column b the results indicate a clear trend of increase in outlet fe concentration with decreasing pe ph below a value of 11 whereas no correlations were observed between outlet fe concentrations and pe ph values in column a these results appear to confirm fe mobilization from cbr in the presence of living microorganisms under anoxic conditions column b fig 7 summarizes the results of amorphous fe crystalline fe and al hydr oxide extractions from cbr before fresh cbr and after their use as filter substrate in the columns a and b cbr a and cbr b respectively the results indicate a relative increase in crystalline fe and al hydr oxides for both the columns after 140 days of operation fig 7b and c these relative increases in crystalline fe and al hydr oxide contents were most probably related to the dissolution of more soluble ca compounds from cbr e g caco3 and residual gypsum as already suggested by the high ca releases observed during the first month of column operation fig 4a as shown in fig 7a the results indicate a slight decrease in amorphous fe for column a after 140 days of operation which was most probably related to washing out from the column of more mobile fe compounds differently from column a the content of amorphous fe in column b cbr b increased by a factor 2 2 compared to fresh cbr thus suggesting the conversion of crystalline fe to amorphous fe compounds under anoxic biotic conditions the conversion of crystalline fe to amorphous fe compounds was already observed in soils in the presence of living microorganisms 26 47 48 and it was primarily attributed to microbial reduction of crystalline fe3 hydr oxides probably followed by the precipitation of amorphous fe2 complexes 47 li et al 48 observed that a decrease of pe ph from 11 06 to 8 29 was accompanied by a 110 increase of amorphous fe content in rhizosphere soils according to the authors low pe ph may promote the activity of fe reduction bacteria to produce fe2 which is re oxidized to amorphous fe oxides however this hypothesis still needs to be verified by further studies 48 3 4 p removal mechanisms the results of sequential p extractions from cbr samples before fresh cbr and after 140 days of column operation cbr a and cbr b are summarized in fig 8 the total amounts of p extracted by sequential extractions was 0 10 0 01 mg p kg cbr 2 04 0 04 mg p kg cbr and 2 08 0 21 mg p kg cbr for fresh cbr cbr a and cbr b respectively average values standard deviations from duplicate experiments thus confirming p retention on cbr during column experiments and indicating a similar total amount of p extracted from cbr a and cbr b p in stable residual compounds represents the 45 8 and 42 9 of total p extracted from cbr a and cbr b respectively followed by ca bound p that represents the 37 4 and 32 8 of total p extracted from cbr a and cbr b respectively fig 8 in the literature 27 28 49 p in stable residual compounds is mainly attributed to the most thermodynamically stable ca p crystals e g hydroxyapatite and or organic matter that is not alkali extractable organic p whereas ca bound p is mainly attributed to amorphous ca phosphates that can be dissolved with diluted acids e g 1 m hcl these results seem to confirm that ca p precipitation followed by the retention of ca p complexes into the columns was the main mechanism leading to p removal from wastewater as already observed in previous column studies that have investigated p removal performances of ca rich filter substrates steel slag 39 50 51 their findings indicated that ca phosphates initially precipitate under amorphous forms and later recrystallize into the most thermodynamically stable form of hydroxyapatite as shown in fig 8 al and fe bound p extracted from cbr b 0 40 0 17 mg p g cbr was 3 3 times higher than al and fe bound p extracted from cbr a 0 12 0 01 mg p g cbr the higher amorphous fe content in cbr b appears to be correlated with the higher al and fe bound p in cbr b when comparing fe and p extraction data from cbr a and cbr b moreover the molar ratio of fe to p between the differences of i amorphous fe in cbr b and a fig 7 and ii al and fe bound p in cbr b and a fig 8 is equal to 0 92 mol fe mol p this value is close to the theoretical fe p ratios of the most common fe p complexes in wastewater systems 1 1 5 mol fe mol p these results may indicate re precipitation of mobilized fe as amorphous fe p phases on cbr b at almost neutral ph eqs 5 and 6 as already observed and described in previous studies that have investigated the effects of microbial driven fe mobilization in soils 26 47 5 3fe2 2h2po4 fe3 po4 2 4h 6 fe3 h2po4 fepo4 2h the results of aqua regia extractions indicate total p contents of 2 66 0 05 mg p kg cbr and 3 00 0 10 mg p kg cbr for cbr a and cbr b respectively average values standard deviations from duplicate experiments these values are 30 and 44 higher than the total amounts of p extracted by sequential extractions for cbr a and cbr b respectively according to tiessen and moir 27 these differences may be related to highly recalcitrant inorganic p but also to bicarbonate and hydroxide extractable organic p that were not taken into account in sequential extractions most probably biological p uptake in column b may explain the higher difference between total p extracted by aqua regia and total amount of p extracted by sequential extraction for cbr b 3 5 closing remarks and perspectives overall the results of this study indicate that aeration conditions and microbial activity affect the performance and p removal mechanisms of cbr filters as follows under aerobic conditions ca p precipitation probably followed by crystallization of ca p complexes on the surface of cbr appears to be the main mechanism leading to p removal from wastewater under anoxic biotic conditions microbially driven mobilization of fe from minerals may i provide fe ions for further fe p precipitation but also may ii lead to fe releases from cbr filters vertical flow cws represent one of the most employed wastewater treatment systems for small communities in france less than 2000 people equivalent with more than 2500 systems in operation in 2015 25 according to paing et al 25 french vertical flow cws present high removal performances for cod and total suspended solids tss whereas tp and tn removal performances are relatively low mean values of 151 plants 93 96 30 and 39 for cod tss tp and tn removal respectively therefore the use of cbr filters appears to be particularly suitable as a tertiary treatment step to remove p from the effluents of vertical flow cws the addition of external organic carbon and or partial recirculation of raw wastewater at the inlet of cbr filters can further improve tn removal by coupling the processes of p retention and denitrification in a single treatment step but could also promote fe mobilization and give a lower tp removal performance however further studies are needed before full scale application of cbr filters in cws in particular long term pilot experiments at the field scale are required to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations of wastewater temperature and composition and accumulation of solids and precipitates on the hydraulic and treatment performances of cbr filters under real operating conditions 4 conclusions the results of this study confirm that cbr is an efficient filter material to remove p from wastewater over 140 days of operation column a showed a tp removal performance of 98 5 achieving a tp retention capacity of 0 63 mg p g cbr whereas column b showed a tp removal performance of 91 6 achieving a tp retention capacity of 0 61 mg p g cbr thus indicating higher p removal performance of cbr under aerobic rather than anoxic biotic conditions the main mechanisms of p removal were related to the precipitation of ca p complexes most probably followed by recrystallization under more stable forms e g hydroxyapatite on the mineral surface of cbr the results of this study also indicate fe mobilization from cbr under anoxic biotic conditions thus i providing fe ions that are available for further fe p precipitation but also ii leading to fe releases from cbr filters overall the results of this study indicate that cbr filters can be successfully applied to remove p from effluents with low organic load in both aerobic as well as anoxic conditions but aerobic conditions are recommended to prevent excessive

wetlands comparative experiments of p removal were performed in two columns continuously fed with synthetic and real wastewater to investigate the behavior of cbr under aerobic column a and anoxic biotic conditions column b the effect of various parameters including ph temperature addition of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen concentration was investigated also a series of chemical extractions was performed to elucidate the main mechanisms of p removal achieved by cbr over 140 days of operation columns a and b showed a total p removal performance of 98 5 and 91 6 thus reaching a total p removal capacity of 0 63 mg p g cbr and 0 61 mg p g cbr respectively the results indicate that aeration conditions and microbial activity can significantly affect the performance of cbr filters under aerobic conditions precipitation of ca p complexes appears to be the main mechanism leading to p removal under anoxic biotic conditions microbially driven mobilization of fe from cbr may provide fe ions for fe p precipitation but also it may lead to fe release from the filters this study provides crucial information to evaluate the potential use of cbr at different steps of the wastewater treatment process overall the results indicate that the use of cbr filters is particularly suitable as a tertiary treatment step to remove p from effluents with low organic load under aerobic conditions keywords wastewater treatment phosphorus removal bauxite residue constructed wetland reactive filter 1 introduction nowadays improving phosphorus p removal performances in small wastewater treatment plants wwtps such as constructed wetlands cws represents a topical issue for researchers and professionals in the field of wastewater treatment 1 several strategies are currently being studied including the enhanced p biological uptake by intermittent aeration 2 the use of electrochemical methods to intensify electron exchanges 3 the improvement of iron dosing strategies for efficient p removal 4 and the selection of wetland plants and substrate materials with high p sorption capacities 5 6 during the last decade the use of separate filter units filled with reactive materials having a high affinity for p binding has been proposed as a promising solution to upgrade p removal performances in cws 7 10 a large variety of reactive materials including natural soils and sediments industrial wastes and by products and manufactured adsorbent materials have been tested for p removal 11 13 most of these materials present high contents of calcium ca iron fe and or aluminum al which are elements with a strong affinity for p binding 13 14 several international studies have demonstrated that bauxite residue a fe and al oxide rich waste from the aluminum industry is an efficient filter material for p removal from wastewater 15 18 according to evans 19 aluminum industry produces about 150 mt per year of bauxite residue worldwide of which no more of 3 5 is reused in a productive way e g cement and ceramic production 20 this indicates a very interesting potential market of bauxite residue valorization as filter substrate in cws maximum p removal capacities ranged from 6 to up than 12 mg p g bauxite residue 16 17 thus depending on the type and composition of bauxite residue and on the experimental parameters established for the experiments the main mechanisms leading to p removal were anionic adsorption on functional sites e g oh and precipitation of ca p complexes on the mineral surface of bauxite residue 17 due to its high alkaline nature 19 bauxite residue can produce high ph leachates up to 13 20 and therefore a pretreatment with gypsum was efficiently proposed by cusack et al 15 to neutralize its alkalinity and reduce ph leachates below 9 however most of these studies were performed in batch and using synthetic p solutions which did not contain all the components occurring in real effluents that may affect p removal performances e g microorganisms and organic compounds competing ions suspended solids moreover results from batch experiments usually cannot be directly employed to preview the behavior of field scale filters as treatment performances and p removal mechanisms can differ under dynamic operating conditions to the best of our knowledge only a study in the literature has investigated p removal performances of bauxite residue in small scale columns continuously fed with real effluents 21 furthermore there is a lack of data in the literature concerning the effect of aeration conditions and microbial activity on the performance of bauxite residue filters this study aimed at evaluating performances and determining p removal mechanisms of carbonated bauxite residue cbr under aerobic and anoxic biotic conditions indeed the organic content in wastewater and or the addition of external organic carbon to the effluents which is often used as a strategy to enhance heterotrophic denitrification in wwtps 22 23 may promote the establishment of anoxic biotic conditions in water saturated filters therefore knowledge and understanding of the effect of different aeration conditions and microbial activity on the behavior of cbr are indispensable to evaluate its potential use as filter substrate at different steps of the wastewater treatment process in cws the novelty and importance of this paper are highlighted by the following two points i the first comparative investigation of p removal performances of cbr under aerobic and anoxic conditions in dynamic flow experiments two laboratory scale columns were filled with cbr and continuously fed with synthetic and real cw effluents the effect of various parameters including ph temperature addition of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen concentration on p removal performances was investigated ii an in depth critical investigation of the p removal mechanisms achieved by cbr a systemic approach which involves the integration and analysis of the experimental results of water quality monitoring and chemical extractions from cbr was followed to investigate mineralogical changes and to elucidate the main mechanisms of p removal achieved by cbr under aerobic and anoxic biotic conditions overall the results of this study allow evaluating the behavior of cbr under real operating scenarios and they provide crucial information for the scale up of the filters from the laboratory to the field scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 bauxite residue collection and preparation the samples of bauxite residue used in this study were provided by the company alteo gardanne france their main chemical composition was fe2o3 45 53 al2o3 10 16 tio2 9 15 sio2 5 8 cao 3 8 and na2o 3 5 data from alteo before column experiments bauxite residues were mixed with gypsum caso4 2h2o at a dried mass ratio of 5 mass of gypsum to mass of bauxite residue and put in contact with the atmosphere to produce cbr this was done to neutralize the naoh content of bauxite residue by carbonation and calcium carbonate precipitation according to eq 1 and to decrease the ph of cbr leachates below a value of 9 as described by cusack et al 15 and experienced in large scale on the storage site of alteo 1 2naoh caso4 2h2o co2 caco3 na2so4 3h2o after carbonation cbr was sieved and the fraction less than 2 mm was collected to perform column experiments cbr samples were dried at 45 c overnight to reduce their water content before the experiments the temperature of 45 c was selected in order to reduce the risk of changes in the mineralogical composition during drying 24 the remaining water content of cbr was determined after heating at 105 c until constant weight 2 2 set up of column experiments two glass columns of total volume 0 59 l were filled with about 0 35 l of cbr each thus corresponding to about 0 45 kg dried mass of cbr per column columns a and b the main details of the column design are shown in fig 1 during the full period of operation the columns were continuously fed according to a vertical up flow of about 12 ml h thus giving a theoretical hydraulic retention time based on the initial void volume hrtv of around 24 h during the first 54 days of operation column a was fed with a synthetic solution of about 10 mg p l and 40 mg n l prepared with tap water kh2po4 and kno3 these p and nitrogen n concentrations are in good agreement with the average outlet concentrations of vertical flow cws in france total p 8 3 mg p l phosphate p 8 2 mg p l total kjeldahl n 7 7 mg n l ammonium n 5 6 mg n l and nitrate n 56 25 mg n l average values standard deviations of 151 plants 25 then from day 55 140 the column a was fed with the real effluent of a vertical flow cw that treats the domestic wastewater of a small french municipality 1500 people equivalent rougiers france during the same periods of operation the column b was operated identically to column a but with the only difference that the feeding solutions were enriched with about 0 5 g l of glucose this was done to favor the establishment of anoxic metabolic conditions in column b column experiments were performed at the laboratory under room temperature conditions 22 7 2 1 c average value standard deviation 4 measures per week main composition and physical chemical properties of the inlet solutions are summarized in table 1 2 3 water quality monitoring inlet and outlet values of ph redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen do were measured twice per week by water probes water samples about 40 ml were collected from the inlet and from the outlet of each column twice per week then total phosphorus tp phosphate po4 p total n tn chemical oxygen demand cod al ca and fe concentrations of the water samples were measured tp concentrations were determined after persulfate digestion en iso6878 2004 whereas po4 p al ca and fe concentrations were determined after filtration 0 45 μm filters of the water samples differences between tp removal efficiencies of columns a and b were tested by the non parametric mann whitney u test and were considered significant at p value 0 05 analytical and statistical methods are described in the supplementary information si 2 4 chemical extractions a series of chemical extractions was performed to investigate the p content and chemical changes of cbr before and after column experiments and hence to elucidate the main p removal mechanisms occurring in the columns samples of cbr were taken at the inlet zone of the columns a and b after 140 days of operation fig 1 since this zone was exposed to inlet p rich wastewater these samples were likely to have had a high amount of p bound to their surfaces before the chemical extractions the samples of cbr were dried overnight at 45 c to reduce water content and to avoid mineralogical changes deriving from high temperature drying 24 aqua regia extractions were performed according to standard methods en 13346 2000 en 13657 2003 to determine the total p content of cbr before and after column experiments a series of chemical extractions was performed to quantify the amount of reactive amorphous and crystalline fe hydro xides and al hydro xides on cbr samples before and after their use in the columns indeed speciation of reactive fe and al compounds in cbr may give useful information to better understand and describe the p binding mechanisms 26 amorphous fe crystalline fe and al hydro xides extractions were performed according to standard method iso 12782 1 2009 iso 12782 2 2009 and iso 12782 3 2009 respectively a sequential extraction protocol adapted from tiessen and moir 27 was followed to quantify the fractions of p bound to different mineral compounds in cbr before and after column experiments four fractions of p were sequentially extracted from 1 g of cbr dried mass equivalent following the procedure described in barca et al 28 i bicarbonate extractable inorganic p this fraction is defined as weakly bound p as p extraction is mainly due to washing and ion exchange ii hydroxide extractable inorganic p this fraction is primarily related to dissolution of al and fe bound p compounds that are soluble at high ph iii diluted acid extractable inorganic p this fraction is defined as ca bound p as p extraction is mainly due to dissolution of ca p complexes at low ph iv hot concentrated acid extractable organic and inorganic p this fraction represents p in stable residual compounds that need much more energy to be dissolved the detailed protocols of the chemical extractions are presented and discussed in si all chemical extractions were performed in duplicate or triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 p removal performances the average values and standard deviations of inlet and outlet tp po4 p do ph eh tn cod fe al and ca of columns a and b over day 1 54 synthetic solution feeding and day 55 140 of operation real effluent feeding are summarized in table 1 a slight cod release from column a was observed only during the first 3 weeks of operation with outlet concentrations up to 52 mg cod l this was primarily attributed to the use of organic flocculants polyacrylamide during the dewatering process of bauxite residue 19 for both the columns the average inlet tp concentration was 10 3 0 5 mg p l during the first period of operation synthetic solution feeding and 5 5 1 5 1 7 mg p l during the second period of operation real effluent feeding results in table 1 also indicate that po4 p represent more than 98 of inlet tp for synthetic solutions day 1 54 and more than 89 of inlet tp for real effluents day 55 140 the difference between tp and po4 p content in real effluents was primarily attributed to stable organic p and p content in microorganisms 29 over the full period of 140 days of operation inlet and outlet do concentrations of column a were 6 4 1 0 mg o2 l and 2 3 1 4 mg o2 l respectively whereas inlet and outlet do concentrations of column b were 2 0 3 2 mg o2 l and 0 3 0 4 mg o2 l respectively with outlet do stabilizing below a value of 0 3 mg o2 l after day 28 of operation fig s1 b these results indicate that column a was operated under aerobic conditions during the full period of operation day 1 140 whereas column b was operated under anoxic conditions this especially during the second period of operation day 55 140 as shown in fig 2 a outlet tp concentrations of column a were always lower than 0 7 mg p l with an average value of 0 1 mg p l this indicates very high p removal efficiencies of column a during the full period of operation day 1 140 over the first period of operation day 1 55 column b showed outlet tp concentrations always lower than 0 2 mg p l thus showing very high p removal efficiencies 98 however a decrease in p removal performance of column b was observed during the second period of operation day 55 140 when an average outlet tp concentration of 0 9 mg p l and some massive releases of p outlet tp 2 mg p l were observed fig 2b the results from non parametric mann whitney u tests si indicate that the differences between tp removal efficiencies of columns a and b were not significant during day 1 54 of operation p value 0 528 whereas they were significant during day 55 140 of operation p value 0 0001 fig 3 a shows the evolution of tp retained as a function of tp added at the inlet of each column mg p g cbr over the full period of 140 days of operation column a showed a tp removal performance of 98 5 and it reached a tp retention capacity of 0 63 mg p g cbr whereas column b showed a tp removal performance of 91 6 and it reached a tp retention capacity of 0 61 mg p g cbr as shown in fig 3a p removal performance of column b has started to decline during the second period of operation day 55 140 when the column b was fed with a real cw effluent enriched with glucose to promote anoxic biotic conditions inside the column overall these results suggest that the development of anoxic biotic conditions during the operation of column b may account for its lower p removal performance as described in the following sections cod and tn removal were studied to investigate the main metabolic processes occurring in the columns fig 3b shows the evolution of tn removed as a function of tn added to the inlet of the columns a and b mg n g cbr over the full period of 140 days of operation columns a and b removed 66 1 and 87 3 of tn added to the inlet of each column respectively tn removal in column a was most probably primarily related to adsorption of nitrate no3 on functional groups e g oh at the surface of cbr 17 as already described by cengeloglu et al 30 as shown in fig 3b tn removal performance of column a started to decline after 55 days of operation thus suggesting saturation of adsorption sites instead column b showed a higher tn removal performance over the full period of operation most probably glucose addition and low do concentrations promoted heterotrophic denitrification in column b thus improving tn removal performance inlet and outlet do cod and tn concentrations of column b table 1 appears to confirm that tn removal was related to cod removal according to the metabolic pathways of heterotrophic denitrification indeed several studies in the literature indicate that denitrification in cws occurs when do is below 0 5 mg o2 l and the mass ratio of organic carbon to no3 is higher than 2 86 g cod g n 23 31 furthermore the results of this study are in good agreement with the findings of previous pilot experiments 32 which have shown that the addition of methanol as a carbon substrate for denitrification improves the tn removal performance of bauxsol pellets seawater neutralized bauxite residues by a factor of 2 over the full period of 140 days of operation inlet and outlet eh values for column b were 229 32 mv and 182 27 mv table 1 respectively these results appear to confirm reduction of electron acceptors e g no3 during water filtration trough the column b moreover experimental eh values varied in the range of values that promote denitrification in cws 29 33 table 2 summarizes the main results of previous column studies that have investigated p removal performances of various types of untreated and treated bauxite residue p removal performances varied from 56 to 98 thus confirming that bauxite residue is an efficient filter material to remove p from wastewater however it is difficult to compare the results of the different studies because of the large discrepancy on experimental parameters such as type of bauxite residue type of solution inlet p concentration and particle size comparative experiments of herron et al 34 have indicated that p removal performance increases from 28 to 98 with decreasing particle size from 12 to 2 mm most probably because the lower particle size gives a higher specific surface available for p sorption however the lower particle size can also result in lower pore size between the grains thus reducing the hydraulic conductivity of the filters 35 in addition various biological and physical chemical phenomena including biofilm growth retention of suspended solids particle segregation precipitation and accumulation of precipitates may further decrease the void volume and the pore size 36 thus affecting the long term hydraulic and treatment performances of the filters and increasing the risk of clogging when treating real effluents therefore herron et al 34 recommended the 6 mm as optimum particle size in field scale applications it should be also noticed that many of the experiments were conducted for too short a period to evaluate long term performances of the filters 21 34 despland et al 32 observed that p removal performances of columns packed with bauxsol pellets decreased from 95 to 80 and to 60 after 5 and 6 months of operation respectively thus suggesting saturation of p retention capacity the results of our study indicate very high p removal performances over the full period of 140 days of operation especially for column a 98 5 and no clogging phenomena were observed 3 2 alkaline and metal leaching from cbr alkaline releases from both the columns were observed during the full period of operation with average outlet ph values of 8 3 0 5 and 7 7 0 6 for columns a and b respectively these ph increases were secondarily attributed to release of residual diluted na2co3 and mainly to caco3 dissolution from cbr according to eq 2 37 as already described in a recent study that has investigated the effect of gypsum treatment on the leaching behavior of cbr 15 2 caco3 h2o ca2 hco3 oh the highest outlet ph values from 8 5 to 9 1 were observed during the first 2 months of operation fig s2 then they stabilized around a value of 7 7 0 1 and 7 2 0 2 for columns a and b respectively after day 100 of operation over the full period of operation column b showed lower outlet ph than column a this was most probably related to the production of organic acids during the metabolic conversion of glucose in column b which buffered the increase in ph due to caco3 dissolution the evolution of ca al and fe release rates μg g cbr day from columns a and b was calculated by outlet to inlet mass balances using eq 3 where coutlet indicates the outlet metal concentration μg l cinlet the inlet metal concentration μg l m the dried mass of cbr in the column g and f the feeding flow l day 3 r e l e a s e r a t e c o u t l e t c i n l e t m f as shown in fig 4 positive values indicate metal release from cbr whereas negative values indicate metal retention on cbr massive releases of ca 1200 mg ca l were observed from both the columns during the first 3 weeks of operation fig s3 and they were most probably related to dissolution of caco3 and or unreacted caso4 2h2o from cbr equation 1 and 2 then the data clearly indicate ca retention in column a since day 42 of operation with outlet ca concentrations always lower than inlet ca concentrations during the second period of operation real effluent feeding the molar ratio of ca removed to p removed in column a varied from 10 8 to 56 0 mol ca mol p these values are 6 5 to 56 times higher than ca to p molar ratios of the most common ca phosphates in wastewater treatment systems 1 1 67 mol ca mol p 38 thus suggesting co precipitation of ca phosphates and ca carbonates under slightly basic conditions inlet ph 7 6 0 3 outlet ph 8 0 0 4 as already found in previous studies 16 39 differently from column a results from column b do not indicate ca retention during the second period of operation real effluent feeding this although the ca content of the real cw effluent was not a limiting factor for ca p precipitation as indicated by the ca to p molar ratios always higher than 34 mol ca mol p most probably the lower ph values of column b inlet ph 6 4 0 5 outlet ph 7 2 0 3 had the effect of limiting ca phosphate and ca carbonate precipitation compared to column a indeed solubility of ca phosphate and ca carbonate drastically increases with decreasing ph below 8 40 however the findings of cusack et al 21 indicate that p removal by surface precipitation of ca phosphates can happen at almost neutral ph and without requiring the consumption of ca ions from the inlet wastewater as the result of the interaction between po4 p ions present in the wastewater with ca compounds already present in the composition of bauxite residue massive releases of al from cbr were observed during the first period of operation day 1 55 fig 4 c with outlet al concentration exceeding 30 mg al l and 15 mg al l for columns a and b respectively fig s4 these al concentrations are several orders of magnitude higher than the maximum theoretical solubility of al hydroxides in water for ph ranging between 7 8 at 20 c 0 3 mg al l according to 41 therefore they were primarily attributed to washing out from the columns of colloidal fractions and or very fine al cbr particles passing the 0 45 μm filters then outlet al concentrations stabilized below a value of 1 mg al l after day 98 and after day 49 of operation for columns a and b respectively lower outlet al concentrations of column b were most probably related to the more neutral values of outlet ph compared to column a table 1 as it is well known from the literature that al hydroxides present minimum solubility at ph ranging between 6 7 41 with the only exception of day 49 column a showed very few fe releases during the full period of operation fig 4b with outlet fe concentrations lower than 0 3 mg fe l fig s5 the higher outlet fe concentration on day 49 was most probably affected by a cleaning step of the outlet pipe that likely had the effect of mobilizing and washing out from the column some fine particles of cbr differently from column a column b showed higher fe releases during the second period of operation real effluent feeding with outlet fe concentrations up to 2 1 mg fe l these results on metal release are in good agreement with the findings of cusack et al 21 who observed al and fe releases from bauxite residue in rapid small scale column tests with outlet al and fe concentrations up to 3 5 and 3 mg l respectively therefore they recommended a washing step before packing bauxite residue to prevent excessive al and fe releases from the filters 3 3 iron mobilization in cbr the results of our study seem to indicate fe mobilization from cbr in column b under anoxic biotic conditions thus giving fe releases up to 2 1 mg fe l both eh and ph values are commonly used as key parameters to evaluate redox conditions and to interpret metal solubility data in soils 42 43 the relationship between outlet eh and ph for columns a and b during the full period of operation is presented in fig 5 pourbaix diagram 44 the results indicate a very good linear correlation between the experimental data r2 0 949 with eh increasing with decreasing the ph these eh ph relationships are in very good agreement with the findings of husson et al 42 who concluded that both eh and ph should be interactively used as relevant primary parameters to characterize redox conditions in soils as shown in fig 5 outlet eh and ph values varied between the ranges of values that promote solid phase fe hydroxides fe oh 3 at 23 c which was the average temperature during column experiments adapted from 45 however it should be noticed that theoretical fe3 fe2 equilibrium conditions in fig 5 are established for fe oh 3 solution in pure water the presence of organic matter and or microorganisms and the related microbial activities can play a key role in fe mobilization from solid matrices 26 46 48 under anoxic conditions microorganisms can use fe3 as a terminal electron acceptor to oxidize organic matter during the anaerobic respiration process thus reducing fe3 to more soluble fe2 moreover microorganisms can produce fe3 chelating molecules e g siderophores to improve the bio availability of soluble fe3 compounds from crystalline fe3 minerals 46 overall this microbially driven process of fe3 chelation and reduction can result in the mobilization of soluble fe3 compounds and release of fe2 ions the results in fig 5 also suggest a shift from more oxidizing to less oxidizing conditions with increasing temperature from 16 7 24 3 c probably because the increase in temperature has a positive effect on microbial activity and a negative effect on oxygen saturation concentration the chemical notion of pe ph which involves both the eh and ph parameters can be used as an indicator of the electronic activity of a solution in the presence of living organisms 42 43 48 the electronic potential pe at 25 c can be calculated from eh mv by using eq 4 4 p e e h 59 according to husson et al 42 at 25 c pure water is redox indifferent at pe ph equal to 13 8 then pe ph values higher than 13 8 indicate oxidizing media whereas pe ph values lower than 13 8 indicate reducing media the fig 6 shows the relationship between fe concentrations and pe ph values of the effluents from columns a and b during the second period of operation real effluent feeding when fe release was observed at the outlet of column b for column b the results indicate a clear trend of increase in outlet fe concentration with decreasing pe ph below a value of 11 whereas no correlations were observed between outlet fe concentrations and pe ph values in column a these results appear to confirm fe mobilization from cbr in the presence of living microorganisms under anoxic conditions column b fig 7 summarizes the results of amorphous fe crystalline fe and al hydr oxide extractions from cbr before fresh cbr and after their use as filter substrate in the columns a and b cbr a and cbr b respectively the results indicate a relative increase in crystalline fe and al hydr oxides for both the columns after 140 days of operation fig 7b and c these relative increases in crystalline fe and al hydr oxide contents were most probably related to the dissolution of more soluble ca compounds from cbr e g caco3 and residual gypsum as already suggested by the high ca releases observed during the first month of column operation fig 4a as shown in fig 7a the results indicate a slight decrease in amorphous fe for column a after 140 days of operation which was most probably related to washing out from the column of more mobile fe compounds differently from column a the content of amorphous fe in column b cbr b increased by a factor 2 2 compared to fresh cbr thus suggesting the conversion of crystalline fe to amorphous fe compounds under anoxic biotic conditions the conversion of crystalline fe to amorphous fe compounds was already observed in soils in the presence of living microorganisms 26 47 48 and it was primarily attributed to microbial reduction of crystalline fe3 hydr oxides probably followed by the precipitation of amorphous fe2 complexes 47 li et al 48 observed that a decrease of pe ph from 11 06 to 8 29 was accompanied by a 110 increase of amorphous fe content in rhizosphere soils according to the authors low pe ph may promote the activity of fe reduction bacteria to produce fe2 which is re oxidized to amorphous fe oxides however this hypothesis still needs to be verified by further studies 48 3 4 p removal mechanisms the results of sequential p extractions from cbr samples before fresh cbr and after 140 days of column operation cbr a and cbr b are summarized in fig 8 the total amounts of p extracted by sequential extractions was 0 10 0 01 mg p kg cbr 2 04 0 04 mg p kg cbr and 2 08 0 21 mg p kg cbr for fresh cbr cbr a and cbr b respectively average values standard deviations from duplicate experiments thus confirming p retention on cbr during column experiments and indicating a similar total amount of p extracted from cbr a and cbr b p in stable residual compounds represents the 45 8 and 42 9 of total p extracted from cbr a and cbr b respectively followed by ca bound p that represents the 37 4 and 32 8 of total p extracted from cbr a and cbr b respectively fig 8 in the literature 27 28 49 p in stable residual compounds is mainly attributed to the most thermodynamically stable ca p crystals e g hydroxyapatite and or organic matter that is not alkali extractable organic p whereas ca bound p is mainly attributed to amorphous ca phosphates that can be dissolved with diluted acids e g 1 m hcl these results seem to confirm that ca p precipitation followed by the retention of ca p complexes into the columns was the main mechanism leading to p removal from wastewater as already observed in previous column studies that have investigated p removal performances of ca rich filter substrates steel slag 39 50 51 their findings indicated that ca phosphates initially precipitate under amorphous forms and later recrystallize into the most thermodynamically stable form of hydroxyapatite as shown in fig 8 al and fe bound p extracted from cbr b 0 40 0 17 mg p g cbr was 3 3 times higher than al and fe bound p extracted from cbr a 0 12 0 01 mg p g cbr the higher amorphous fe content in cbr b appears to be correlated with the higher al and fe bound p in cbr b when comparing fe and p extraction data from cbr a and cbr b moreover the molar ratio of fe to p between the differences of i amorphous fe in cbr b and a fig 7 and ii al and fe bound p in cbr b and a fig 8 is equal to 0 92 mol fe mol p this value is close to the theoretical fe p ratios of the most common fe p complexes in wastewater systems 1 1 5 mol fe mol p these results may indicate re precipitation of mobilized fe as amorphous fe p phases on cbr b at almost neutral ph eqs 5 and 6 as already observed and described in previous studies that have investigated the effects of microbial driven fe mobilization in soils 26 47 5 3fe2 2h2po4 fe3 po4 2 4h 6 fe3 h2po4 fepo4 2h the results of aqua regia extractions indicate total p contents of 2 66 0 05 mg p kg cbr and 3 00 0 10 mg p kg cbr for cbr a and cbr b respectively average values standard deviations from duplicate experiments these values are 30 and 44 higher than the total amounts of p extracted by sequential extractions for cbr a and cbr b respectively according to tiessen and moir 27 these differences may be related to highly recalcitrant inorganic p but also to bicarbonate and hydroxide extractable organic p that were not taken into account in sequential extractions most probably biological p uptake in column b may explain the higher difference between total p extracted by aqua regia and total amount of p extracted by sequential extraction for cbr b 3 5 closing remarks and perspectives overall the results of this study indicate that aeration conditions and microbial activity affect the performance and p removal mechanisms of cbr filters as follows under aerobic conditions ca p precipitation probably followed by crystallization of ca p complexes on the surface of cbr appears to be the main mechanism leading to p removal from wastewater under anoxic biotic conditions microbially driven mobilization of fe from minerals may i provide fe ions for further fe p precipitation but also may ii lead to fe releases from cbr filters vertical flow cws represent one of the most employed wastewater treatment systems for small communities in france less than 2000 people equivalent with more than 2500 systems in operation in 2015 25 according to paing et al 25 french vertical flow cws present high removal performances for cod and total suspended solids tss whereas tp and tn removal performances are relatively low mean values of 151 plants 93 96 30 and 39 for cod tss tp and tn removal respectively therefore the use of cbr filters appears to be particularly suitable as a tertiary treatment step to remove p from the effluents of vertical flow cws the addition of external organic carbon and or partial recirculation of raw wastewater at the inlet of cbr filters can further improve tn removal by coupling the processes of p retention and denitrification in a single treatment step but could also promote fe mobilization and give a lower tp removal performance however further studies are needed before full scale application of cbr filters in cws in particular long term pilot experiments at the field scale are required to evaluate the effects of seasonal variations of wastewater temperature and composition and accumulation of solids and precipitates on the hydraulic and treatment performances of cbr filters under real operating conditions 4 conclusions the results of this study confirm that cbr is an efficient filter material to remove p from wastewater over 140 days of operation column a showed a tp removal performance of 98 5 achieving a tp retention capacity of 0 63 mg p g cbr whereas column b showed a tp removal performance of 91 6 achieving a tp retention capacity of 0 61 mg p g cbr thus indicating higher p removal performance of cbr under aerobic rather than anoxic biotic conditions the main mechanisms of p removal were related to the precipitation of ca p complexes most probably followed by recrystallization under more stable forms e g hydroxyapatite on the mineral surface of cbr the results of this study also indicate fe mobilization from cbr under anoxic biotic conditions thus i providing fe ions that are available for further fe p precipitation but also ii leading to fe releases from cbr filters overall the results of this study indicate that cbr filters can be successfully applied to remove p from effluents with low organic load in both aerobic as well as anoxic conditions but aerobic conditions are recommended to prevent excessive

treatment 1 introduction by the year 2025 water stressed or water scarce conditions will be faced by 2 4 3 2 billion people due to rising demands of clean water worldwide quadrupling the amount of population who stayed in regions with restricted availability of fresh water at the beginning of 2000s 1 scientists and organizations are urged to explore novel processes and technologies to decrease the energy consumed in desalination this is because seawater reverse osmosis swro process requires extensive energy and is costly to operate besides desalination cost swro faces critical issues including high consumption of fossil fuels with its associated environmental effects and high salinity brine discharge to the marine environments 2 osmotically driven membrane processes odmps have been developed as a potential sustainable solution against these problems in this process water is driven across a semipermeable membrane using osmotic pressure rather than hydraulic pressure and this could be advantageous to operating cost 3 besides capital costs associated with pumping and system construction can be reduced with installation of simple and inexpensive low pressure equipment since externally applied hydraulic pressure is not needed 4 forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro are two types of the odmps the integration of osmosis and membrane technology makes them a strong choice to be employed in applications ranging from evaporation to crystallization together with advantages of strongly compact modules high efficiency and sustainable environment friendly processes 5 by utilizing osmotic pressure gradient δπ fo processes move water across a semipermeable membrane from a lower osmotic pressure region into a higher osmotic pressure region on the other hand in pro processes water from a source with low salinity permeates across a membrane into a pressurized water source with higher salinity and power is produced via depressurizing the permeate using a hydro turbine this osmotic pressure gradient energy which makes use of the free energy released while two water bodies with different salinity levels are mixed is a potential green and sustainable renewable energy source fo and pro acting as alternative membrane processes have the potential to treat wastewater in order to produce high quality water they can be directly applied to a complex water body without extensive pre treatment owing to their high fouling reversibility and high rejection of dissolved contaminants 6 some examples of the treated complex wastewaters are textile wastewaters landfill leachate activated sludge municipal wastewater simulated wastewaters and even nuclear wastewater 7 several major system configurations have been developed for wastewater treatment applications depending on the type of wastewater one example is osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr which is the integration of fo within a membrane bioreactor ombr systems include submerged ombr for wastewater treatment under aerobic condition submerged ombr for wastewater reclamation under aerobic condition submerged ombr for biogas recovery under anaerobic condition side stream ombr under aerobic condition and combined ombr under aerobic condition 8 by coupling with a recovery process of draw solute production of clean water from the draw solution is feasible additionally energy needed to treat the wastewaters can be compensated by utilizing the osmotic power produced by the pro process alternatively anaerobic ombr which allows biogas production and avoids extensive aerations could also offset the overall energy consumption 9 besides nutrients such as phosphorus which has significant environmental value can be recovered from the wastewaters including urine secondary treated effluent waste activated sludge and digested sludge centrate 10 13 the recovery of these resources i e water nutrient and energy from wastewaters provides great opportunities to deal with the severe issues of water energy nexus many research works related to fo and pro have been presented mostly focusing on membrane development antifouling approaches and factor optimization in view of the increasing attention on resource recovery through odmps this review demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of both fo and pro including case studies in various countries attempting to describe the research needs for these technologies to achieve full scale water reclamation and wastewater treatment this outline includes the background of fo its membrane development and some recent trends to solve membrane fouling subsequently fo applications and its potential advantages on environment are presented the next section discusses the background of pro processes osmotic power generation and pro membrane development advanced techniques economic analysis and environmental impacts of the pro processes which have not been adequately discussed are also reviewed finally resource recovery from wastewaters and future trends of the fo and pro development are highlighted 2 forward osmosis fo is a growing technology based on osmosis which is naturally occurring to permeate a solvent usually water across a semipermeable membrane from a less to a more concentrated electrolyte the concentrated solution draw solution ds generates high osmotic pressure as moving power to permeate the water from the solution with lower concentration feed solution fs consequently the fs decreases in volume and increases in salt concentration leading to a reduction of permeate flux towards the osmotic agent region recovery of the diffused water requires a further procedure for its isolation from the draw solution but it may subsequently allow reuse of the draw solution and produce a final water product 14 different types of energy such as electrical energy chemical energy solar energy water heat and magnetic field energy have been used to recover ds 15 the amount of required energy and effectiveness of recovery process must be considered when selecting ds for any particular application if the recovery or discarding of the draw agent demands lower amount or quality energy the overall energy cost of fo can be lower to a very great extent there has been development in draw solutions with absence of the subsequent separation step an example of these osmotic agents is fertilizers like nano3 kcl ca no3 2 etc where these diluted fertilizers as the product of fo desalination can be used for fertigation on crops 16 however the type and availability of these direct use ds are still limited leading to a restriction of applications nonetheless fo offers advantages such as the fouling layers could be easily removed or reversed because there is no compression also two fss could be simultaneously treated in one treatment step while liquids which are not appropriate for other membrane processes could be treated and considerably high amount of water could be recovered 17 fo processes are different from membrane processes which are driven by pressure as only osmotic pressure difference between feed and draw solutions is used as the driving force therefore significantly less electrical energy is required also fo processes run with very low operating pressure as only a minimal hydraulic pressure is required due to the frictional resistance of fluid 18 2 1 fo membrane development at the beginning of the 20th century development of fo membranes begun while before that reverse osmosis ro membranes were being employed in most of the fo researches but they had thick support layers and were not well fitted for applications of fo 19 the support layer as thick as the one in ro is not required since high hydraulic pressure does not happen in fo ideal fo membranes should have a thin support layer which has minimized porosity to restrict internal concentration polarization icp a dense active layer which accomplishes an increased rejection of solute and hydrophilic properties to minimize fouling as well as maximize flux 20 therefore besides ro membranes early investigations on the fo process were mostly performed using cta based fo membranes commercialized by hydration technology innovation hti since then different start ups have been introduced into the market of fo commercial membranes and systems these fo companies can be primarily categorized into membrane manufacturing companies fluid technology solutions fts formerly hydration technology innovations hti oasys water porifera and aquaporin as well as process development and operation companies modern water statkraft desalgae water hti and trevi systems except toyobo and samsung cheil industries which offered unique hollow fiber fo membranes as well as aquaporin which introduced biomimetic hollow fiber and spiral wound fo membrane configurations all other companies have introduced spiral wound fo membrane which could be used in the fo system table 1 one of the brands producing fo flat sheet membranes is fts h2o and the price of ftsh2o flat sheet cta membrane varies from 74 98 to 794 09 depending on the size in general there are two methods to fabricate fo membranes which are phase inversion and interfacial polymerization technologies for thin film composite tfc membranes 21 some recent novel membranes with their membrane performance in fo mode with active layer faces feed solution al fs are demonstrated in table 2 generally deionized di water was used as the fs few parameters including membrane water flux jw reverse solute flux js and specific reverse salt flux js jw can be used to determine membrane performance jw volume per membrane area per time shows the rate where water diffuses across a membrane a higher jw is induced by a higher osmotic potential concentration of ds compared to fs since fo is an osmotic driven process on the other hand js mass per membrane area per time is defined as the rate where solutes diffuse in opposite direction to water flux basically js depends on the chemical physical properties of the solute and the solute selectivity of the active layer generally nacl was most widely used as ds in the literature its concentrations range from 0 3 m to 6 m and it is often used at 0 5 m to simulate the osmotic pressure of seawater however divalent inorganic and organic dss like magnesium sulfate mgso4 magnesium chloride mgcl2 and trisodium citrate have lower diffusivity due to the increasing charge molecular weight and hydrated radius of the ion 22 23 js jw loss of draw solute per permeated water is a better representation of membrane selectivity smaller js jw is favorable because it implies less loss of solute per unit of water diffused hence better membrane selectivity 24 an ideal ds should produce high jw and low jw i e low js jw like those induced by nacl and divalent salts respectively 25 furthermore it is noteworthy that the performance of fo membrane is influenced by physical properties of its support skin and thin rejection skin although the coaxial electrospun cellulose acetate polyvinylidene fluoride ca pvdf tfc membrane by shibuya et al 26 has the lowest js jw 0 03 g l reported in literature up to date it has lower hydrophilicity and water flux compared to the pure ca membrane on the other hand studies showed that tfc membranes generally have higher jw and js than cta membranes under the same operating conditions 27 in short a variety of fo membranes crafted using commercial materials or chemically modified on the ready made polymeric materials or the membrane supports has been presented in laboratory scale studies but these are not yet prepared for actual practical applications 28 hence research approaches are crucial in order to develop an optimized membrane for fo processes while investigating the interrelation of membrane properties which affect fo performance 2 2 applications although fo has been identified as practical and commercially viable starting from 1930 and recognized as a feasible technique to concentrate juice for more than five decades practical illustration of fo and that in full scale has happened only in the last 10 12 years and 3 5 years respectively 14 fo technology has been actively researched and developed to serve as alternative in solving the occurring water issues via desalination wastewater treatment and power generation it is noteworthy that fo can be applied to treat various types of hazardous wastewaters and remove toxic heavy metal ions in various manufacturing industries indeed novel fo membrane with enhanced separation efficiency stable separation selectivity and improved water flux is suitable for industries with heavy metal usage for removal of heavy metal ions 37 examples of industries which can employ fo for wastewater treatment are pharmaceutical industry 38 coal processing industry 39 textile industry 40 electronic industry 41 car manufacturing industry 42 and chemical industry 43 besides simultaneous concentration of active pharmaceutical ingredients such as bovine serum albumin and recovery of organic solvents can be achieved through fo process as it offers a reasonable jw and low js without external pressure 44 45 for food and beverage industry whey dewatering to produce valuable products like whey protein concentrates 46 and juice processing to increase its shelf life as well as to save the transportation cost 47 could be developed using fo process additionally by employing fo in polyvinyl chloride pvc latex dehydration energy consumption in the final drying process to produce latex can be reduced 48 similarly fo processes can be applied for microalgae dewatering to solve the technical issue of concentrating algae cells as the conventional strategies either require high energy or addition of harmful chemical 49 all these applications demonstrate the potential of fo processes but most of them are still in laboratory stage where there are research gaps prior to commercial implementation one of the main reasons is that ro and distillation the proposed recovery processes of diluted ds remain energy intensive and inefficient 41 pushing forward the real world commercialization it is important to continuously explore new industrial areas with potential for fo applications without the requirement of draw solution recovery process 2 3 potential benefits on environment unlike other pressure driven desalination technologies fo process does not leave major carbon footprints greenhouse gases ghg emissions from fo are greatly lower than that of thermal technologies and demand of electricity is notably lower compared to that of ro especially when combining fo and other power generation or industrial processes which have waste heat production 50 furthermore environmental effects and carbon emissions due to fossil fuels used in fo hybrid processes could be further reduced and eliminated by coupling fo systems with other renewable energy technologies such as hydro wind and bioenergy 51 since hydraulic pressure is negligible and the fouling layer is less compressed fo is less susceptible to serious fouling unlike fouling that happens in ro membranes osmotic backwashing can easily remove majority of the foulants discovered on the membranes for fo hence any chemical cleaning reagents that can disrupt the aquatic ecosystems as well as flora and fauna at discharge locations is not necessarily needed 52 53 exceeding 98 recovery of permeate water flux which is much higher than that usually noticed in ro could be obtained after water rinsing alone 54 the primary concern for environmental aspect of desalination is that natural water bodies at discharge point and disposed brine could differ in temperature and salinity in addition the density of the brine is greater than the typical seawater and the sunken brine can be toxic to the communities at the seafloor fortunately fo can possibly decrease the quantity of rejected hazardous brine effectively as long as the osmotic pressure differential across the membrane is sufficiently strong to achieve appropriate membrane water flux and recovery of water 55 nevertheless a report on the real environmental impacts of fo plant should be done so that its sustainability is more convincing for full scale implementation 3 pressure retarded osmosis pro pro is a promising process producing blue energy without essential emission of co2 56 a semipermeable membrane separates fs and draw agent resulting in osmotic pressure difference and salinity gradient difference which are utilized in pro process 2 in contrast to fo process a back hydraulic pressure is applied to pressurize the concentrated osmotic agent 57 this method proposed by loeb 58 could recover osmotic energy as electrical energy hence it is also referred as generation of osmotic pressure power water is diffused through an energy recovery device erd either pressure exchanger or hydro turbine to produce hydraulic head which is released to enable the conversion of salinity energy to osmotic power or electricity 59 similar to other fo applications the osmotic gradient determines the amount of the energy generated by mixing river water and seawater the approximated worldwide osmotic energy generated is 1750 to 2000 tw h per annum which exceeds one tenths of the energy consumption in the whole world with the working pressure of 13 5 bar operating at steady state equivalent to a 135 m water column in a hydroelectric power plant 60 to compare with other renewable energy technologies the actual power generation in 2017 is 481 tw h from biofuels energy 4197 tw h from hydraulic energy and 1127 tw h from wind energy 61 however current pro technology has yet to have high performance because the semipermeable membranes have too small permeability due to its sub nanometer scaled pore structure to strain particles and subsequently the power which is calculated by multiplying pressure drop with flow rate is accordingly low 62 besides the available osmotic pressure difference may lead to a very small quantity of generated energy if each and every contributions of energy consumption like pumping and pretreatment processes are considered 63 ds concentration fouling control and post treatment of the concentrated fs are the other possible energy consumers 64 energy consumption of pro technology is compared with other membrane technologies in table 3 since pro is membrane based properties of membrane configuration of structure and operational conditions could significantly affect its performance 73 two approaches to reach the break even point for economic feasibility are improving osmotic membranes and employing high salinity draw solutions replacing seawater basically it is more suitable to have membranes with high power density in generating osmotic power though this technology has yet to be thoroughly commercialized it is a potential process of renewable energy 74 3 1 osmotic power generation open loop fig 1 a and closed loop fig 1b are two classes of pro systems categorized based on their configuration in the former system which presents the solar driven processes water from the ocean is evaporated due to renewable energy by the sun and this energy is then recovered when salt water and fresh water are mixed at a river mouth in the latter system of pro thermal plant which is usually called an engine for osmotic heat low grade heat generated from other industrial processes or power plants is utilized to generate power and regenerate draw solution this design offers one of the most important benefits which is no brine waste discharge however the set up is very restricted depending on availability of waste heat source 75 fig 2 demonstrates a schematic diagram of a typical pro osmotic power plant firstly feed waters undergo pretreatment through several filtrations before moving into membrane modules consisting of hollow fiber or spiral wound membranes in order to get rid of contaminants as well as mitigate fouling of membrane then pretreated fresh water is pumped into an enclosed section which is at zero or low hydraulic pressure pf meanwhile the pretreated draw solution flows into the high pressure chamber at an elevated hydraulic pressure ps to be in contact with another membrane area by pumping across a pressure exchanger beforehand the fresh water permeates against the porous support of membrane whereas the active layer faces the salty water water employs the driving force across the membrane δπ δp where δp ps pf and travels from the low pressure to the high pressure chamber through the membrane spontaneously at a flowing rate of incoming volume δv water flux jw can be calculated using eq 1 it can also be improved by manipulating δv and membrane area am where effects of membrane and operating conditions on the performance of odmps have been investigated extensively 1 δ v j w a m where jw is the water permeation flux and am is the area of membrane as soon as the water diffuses across the membrane from the low pressure region pressure and volume of the salty water in the high pressure chamber increase consequently the draw solution undergoes dilution into a new solution named brackish water which is then divided into two parts about 1 3 is employed to run a hydro turbine to generate electricity whereas the remaining flows back to erd pressure exchanger to pressurize the salty water the pressure of the brackish water is transferred to the feed of salty water through the erd hence establishing a pro system which is cost effective therefore energy loss must be reduced to minimum by working pressure exchanger efficiently because the energy produced by the hydro turbine will not be sufficient to pretreat pump and pressurize the feeds 77 system optimization is an essential criterion to enhance the actual power generation of the pro power plant and it can be achieved by optimizing module design offering advanced membrane performance and improving salinity gradient between the two solutions power density w is the power output per unit membrane area and is usually used to indicate how efficient the membrane converts energy it is critical as it influences the power cost directly it finds out the membrane area needed and the plant size for a certain generation capacity of energy 77 this is because desired total net energy can be achieved by just enlarging the total area of membranes which have low power density 2 the greater the power density the cheaper the costs for installation operation and maintenance pro processes are suggested to be operated at a pressure which is close to δπ 2 to maximize the power generation for instance the ideal operating pressure for pairing of river seawater is 13 0 13 5 bar 77 however the effective osmotic pressure gradient in actual pro processes is lower than that between the bulk salt water and fresh water δπ πs πf because of reverse salt permeation rsp and concentration polarization cp effects which have been demonstrated to seriously decrease the osmotic pressure differential and the corresponding water flux resulting in a lower power density 78 nonetheless the power density of the membranes is not the only factor of power production capacity of a pro power plant by modifying the flow rates of both draw and feed waters as well as by using different solute concentrations with higher draw solute or lower feed concentrations than the seawater river water pair also can give rise to much higher power density 56 it should be noted that the maximum power density may not be discovered in most of the pro research as the experimental setups have restricted them at comparatively low pressures 20 bar 79 therefore improving the experimental setups may achieve even greater power density with increasing draw solution salinity 3 2 pro membrane development although the concept was proposed about six decades ago early works of osmotic energy production were mostly terminated because effective membranes the main factors of osmotic power systems which determine the overall power generation capital costs plant size as well as profitability were absent 80 statkraft constructed the first prototype of osmotic power plant in norway with 2000 m2 flat sheet ca membranes and 2 kw 4 kw marginal power output capacity in 2009 50 however it was terminated in 2014 possibly because the technology was immature with extensive pretreatment processes high pressure pump limited salinity gradient between river water and seawater membrane limitations fouling and low power output 60 indeed power density and net specific energy which are generated by pro process using pair of seawater and river water are found to be not sufficiently high 81 pro activity may be restricted by power density if its production costs are increased to an extent that it is unprofitable to be economically feasible there must be sufficiently high energy output compared to the energy consumed for pretreatments and water pumps 80 therefore pro studies have focused on looking for appropriate huge salinity gradient feed pairs and developing high performance membranes with good mechanical stability and high water flux use of a highly saline draw solution necessitates novel pro membranes to tolerate a higher working pressure and generate a higher power density under high pressure circumstances 82 basically pro membranes should have an optimal combination of the membrane properties high a water permeability and low b salt permeability for the active layer and low s structural factor for the support layer similar to fo a broad range of nano sized materials have been explored to synthesize tfc membrane with desirable performance like improved water flux hydrophilicity mechanical stability and osmotic power 75 as shown in table 4 recent studies in the scientific literature have documented membranes exceeding power density of 5 wm 2 which was claimed to be the economic break even point meanwhile a commercial membrane developed by porifera inc revealed to be capable of achieving gross power density of 7 1 wm 2 under laboratory conditions 83 however it is noteworthy that the highest pressure used in laboratory was only 30 bar table 4 which led to restricted performance of power density research involving enhanced experimental systems for higher pressures should be carried out since the possibility of employing commercial fo membranes under pressures up to 70 bar was reported 84 3 3 advanced techniques pro can be integrated with ro or fo to carry out simultaneous desalination one of the benefits is that pro has a subunit role in which energy productivity is less important compared to pro which has a main unit role since energy used in other subunit processes is recovered instead of producing the additional energy for daily usage 89 osmotic power generation can be sustained with the benefits of fo including low fouling tendency simple membrane cleaning as well as minimal external energy needed when a real waste effluent is utilized as the feed 90 a power density larger than 5 wm 2 could be achieved by inter looping 1 m nacl solution in a fo pro hybrid system osmotic agent in first stage and the fs to second stage given these circumstances fo has a competitive water flux at a possibly cheaper operational cost compared to conventional pretreatment methods via pressure driven membrane processes 91 this is because the foulants could be effectively rejected by fo process resulting in mild membrane fouling the diluted ds can then leave fo as a clean feed to the subsequent pro unit at negligible fouling tendency furthermore the ds used in pro process could be diluted back as seawater level and disposed easily reducing the cost for post treatment in short the reduction in the osmotic pressure of the diluted ds in fo process and the reduction in the hydraulic operational pressure needed by the freshwater recovery process provide energy savings for the fo pro system however capital cost would be higher for fo process due to the membrane area and salinity gradient in the pro process would be inadequate indeed life cycle cost analysis by valladares linares et al 92 showed that capital and operational expenses of fo lpro hybrid system are 21 higher and 56 lower respectively compared to swro hence jeng and chu 93 suggested that fo is not cost effective to act as the pretreatment step for the pro in the dual purpose desalination power plants ro brine has potential to serve as a salinity gradient energy source since it has high osmotic pressure 35 7 bar 74 2 bar and high salt concentration 4 3 9 0 94 energy efficiency and sustainability of seawater desalination could be improved while disposal and environmental impacts of ro waste could be reduced with integration of swro plants and osmotic power generators 95 the hybrid system could be pro ro or ro pro the former is preferred when there is higher demand for a higher quality of water lower water concentration than for power as the seawater flowing into the second stage has a lower salinity whereas the latter is more fitted for high power demand since a greater salinity gradient is created for the second stage 93 in non ideal pro systems there is no full recovery of salinity gradient energy and the energy which cannot be recovered stays in the solutions to discharge 96 a dual stage pro dspro process is an alternative where a pro unit in second stage can utilize the remaining energy in the diluted draw agent to maximize energy recovery before discharge as well as to reduce the cp effect and to enhance energy generation 97 a water pump with extra high pressure for the draw solution is not needed in dspro since the pressurized and diluted osmotic agent from the first pro unit will be recycled to the second stage 98 at the end of the second stage whole diluted draw solution which totals up the permeate water of both stages flows to a hydro turbine to generate power 99 generally benefits of dual stage systems are that it is flexible in selecting types of membrane configurations of module as well as sources of feed and draw agent moreover fresh water with low concentration flowing into the second stage may result in additional water permeation across the membrane leading to higher power output 97 theoretical researches have indicated that dspro process is capable to increase the energy yield of the pro process by more than 18 96 soltani and struchtrup 97 also demonstrated improvement in dual stage pro system comparison to single stage system furthermore altaee et al 100 revealed that each stage in dspro has different optimum operating pressure and a maximum power density is reached at a hydraulic pressure lower than the δπ 2 for example when 5 m 0 6 m salinity gradient was used the hydraulic pressures for maximum power density of the first stage 18 5 w m2 and second stage 6 8 w m2 were 110 bar and 60 bar respectively this indicates that there is lower requirement on the mechanical stability of a membrane in dspro there should be more studies on dspro since it demonstrates more benefits over the standalone pro 3 4 economic analysis the major benefit of pro is that it can generate baseload power which is reliable leading to yearly energy costs which are competitive and comparable with other renewable energy sources 101 however the current cost for osmotic power is difficult to be estimated due to deficiency of osmotic power plants which are in large scale to prove the price assumed 102 chung et al 103 discovered that minimum net power density of 56 4 w m2 is needed for a pro system to reach a 0 074 kwh levelized cost of electricity lcoe to be same as that of solar photovoltaic in the united states then the commonly cited minimum power density to make pro economical was revisited and 5 w m2 was concluded as ten times lower than that needed for economic feasibility 103 among cost components of pro capital cost makes up a large part 60 whereas operational and maintenance costs remain as a small part a high capital cost is expected if a membrane has low power density because a huge membrane area and high membrane installation cost is required to increase the power 102 for instance the resulting capital cost for power density of 1 w m2 is around 20 000 per kw but that for power density of 5 w m2 would be 4000 per kw 101 furthermore membranes with ongoing maintenance costs have certain lifespan where the installed membranes need to be replaced besides membranes large capital costs are also resulted by facilities of pretreatment intake and outfall systems pumps pressure exchangers hydro turbines as well as other devices selecting a suitable location to launch an osmotic plant could reduce the capital costs for intake and outfall systems 104 meanwhile extensive efforts should be carried out to enhance the viability of pretreatment processes which are responsible for the biggest energy losses reducing pretreatment cost from 0 22 to 0 16 mj m3 which is around 25 reduction would result in power generation that is 50 higher 105 installation nature also affects the cost where cost of hybrid installation should be lower than the stand alone pro plant 106 in an economic evaluation of ro pro hybrid system choi et al 107 concluded that ro pro can only be economically competitive with the ro process if there are high electricity cost power density and recovery with low pro membrane cost these are the important variables to study the pro economic viability and determine the estimated revenue of a pro facility 76 2 r e v e n u e m e m b r a n e a r e a y e a r p o w e r d e n s i t y e n e r g y p r i c e on the other hand chung et al 108 estimated the minimum lcoe for a 2 mw generation pro system with different feed draw pairs and 0 066 kwh was reported for the pair of river water and almost saturated water 26 wt there is a potential to compete with few other renewable power generation technologies shown in table 5 including geothermal solar power and offshore wind power however the costs associated with feeds pretreatment as well as intake and outfall systems are not considered as these vary with water sources and plant site a pro plant proposed by khasawneh et al 110 is also economically viable with a lcoe of 0 056 kwh without costs for the intake and outfall systems and a capacity of 134 5 mw by employing the red sea water and the dead sea water as feed water and osmotic agent respectively in comparison with other power plants of renewable energy the pro osmotic plant was shown to have the highest efficiency 74 5 after the hydroelectric power plant however this study is very restricted since the fs and ds are from specific locations and the economic viability is largely contributed by the very high salinity of the ds in short site location of the pro plant is very important that ds and fs which can provide high salinity gradient should be easily assessible to make the pro plant economic feasible 3 5 environmental impacts osmotic energy is considered clean and sustainable as there is no co2 or other emissions including carbon monoxide co and mono nitrogen oxides nox interfering with global climate and the noise of installations is low 102 111 kuleszo et al 112 estimated that up to 24 of worldwide energy related non co2 ghg emissions may be reduced by osmotic energy if there is full implementation of pro to substitute coal fired power plants leading to global ghg emissions reduction 8 gt co2 eq per annum touati and tadeo 106 also pointed out that under accelerated environmental policies global ghg emissions could be decreased using pro by 2741 megatons by 2030 like other facilities along the coast e g desalination facilities damage to species and habitat due to modification of land release of pollutants and noise is expected for building and decommission of a salinity gradient energy facility 113 however a comparatively small area of footprint is normally needed by osmotic power plants which could be built partially or entirely underground hence osmotic plants have minimized environmental impacts at the estuaries while maintaining ecological situations 106 nonetheless pro power plant should cause some impacts on the local environment for example a louder sound during operation is expected since water is needed to be maintained at sufficient pressure using additional water pumps in addition construction of an osmotic power plant close to and in water heighten the chance of contaminants entering the ocean 113 pro power plant also uses a large quantity of fresh water fresh water would need to be pumped into 2 mw and 20 mw osmotic power facilities at rates of 2 7 m3s 1 and 26 7 m3s 1 respectively to generate power of 0 75 mw m3s 1 which is the typical outputs of renewable sources power plants 101 under such large intakes of freshwater developers of osmotic power plant must make sure that minimum flow needed for downstream is retained in the rivers similar to ro desalination plants the issues of cp scaling and fouling necessitate chemical cleaning which influences the properties of the brackish water discharged 106 salinity of the effluent water will likely be different from that of water at the discharge point and either cause decreasing or increasing in local salinity thereby giving special risks to discharge sites 113 fortunately small variations in local salinity could be expected for pro plants in comparison to ro plants as brackish water is discharged rather than brine 101 besides the difference of temperature between surface water and discharge could slightly influence the water temperature at the discharge site of pro brackish water fortunately a biological evaluation made by statkraft had demonstrated that the discharge water of their prototype plant has no effect on the local communities at or near the bottom of a sea for three years 114 however it is suggested to carry out an updated and detailed research on this aspect since there is lack of study to prove the environmental friendliness of a pro plant apart from that successful integration of pro and ro processes would lead to more sustainable seawater desalination with less waste footprint of fs dependence on energy as well as issues on disposal of waste ro brine and other environmental impacts 107 this is because brine will undergo dilution before being discharged into the ocean and its influence on nature is alleviated for instance a brine dilution of more than 22 was reported with a simultaneous maximum net power of 1 5 kw net power density of 6 6 w m2 63 in addition environmental conditions in heavy industrial areas can be improved by using industrial rejected hazardous brines in an osmotic power plant 111 4 resource recovery from wastewaters fo and pro are recognized as highly suitable technologies to facilitate recovery of clean water nutrients and energy from wastewater fig 3 it is noteworthy that some of them could carry out resource recovery and wastewater treatment simultaneously when integrated with a ds recovery process the methods of recovering draw solution include thermal processes e g multistage flash distillation and muliti vapor compression membrane based processes e g nf swro and md and responsive thermal processes e g ammonium bicarbonate draw system suitable draw regeneration method should be selected based on the operating conditions and the total dissolved solids tds equaivalent range of ds since there is no one size fit all solution ansari et al 115 had summarized a number of studies of fo processes to enhance the recovery of energy and nutrients from various wastewaters for instance high rejection of fo membrane for phosphates results in permeate water with very low concentration of total phosphorus tp the accumulated phosphorus can then be recovered through precipitation by modifying ph in the reactor 116 except phosphorus precipitation coupling fo with anaerobic treatment could also facilitate resource recovery it employs fo to firstly pre concentrate wastewater to a high strength before the subsequent anaerobic treatment through anaerobic treatment for wastewater chemical energy contained in wastewater can be recovered through biogas conversion an alternative approach is anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor an ombr which presents vast potential as methane yield 0 21 l g cod was achieved in the previous study 117 apart from that fo could be coupled with microalgae cultivation process which uses wastewaters resulting in an energy efficient process of microalgae dewatering interestingly a microalgal culture medium could be employed as draw solution omitting the energy intensive regeneration of draw solution where the resulting diluted nutrient solution can be directly reused as a culture medium 118 algae which are able to synthesize various valuable bioactive compounds including polysaccharides proteins and lipids are widely useful in different industries such as pharmaceutical cosmetics food 119 120 161 after dewatering algae through fo or pro these high value bioproducts such as lipids could be extracted from algae through conventional methods such as soxhlet extraction and folch extraction or newer techniques such as supercritical co2 sc co2 and ionic liquids ils 121 122 besides extraction other downstream processing steps include isolation and purification steps the downstream processing steps are generally complex and expensive which could be eased by utilizing cost effective fo technology in the harvesting step furthermore energy required to treat the wastewaters can be compensated by utilizing the osmotic power generated through the pro process 4 1 wastewater treatment fo has been employed to treat diverse complex and hazardous wastewaters either reclaiming the wastewater as drinking water or concentrating the trace feed by decreasing the volume of fs 123 most approaches of fo wastewater treatment are similar to the direct desalination technique where an osmotic agent is employed to concentrate the wastewater fs and other post treatment technologies e g ro membrane distillation md are subsequently applied for salt recovery 124 in simple terms clean water diffuses across the membrane and subsequently dilutes the ds while foulants and contaminates are left behind if the original wastewater is high in hazard levels concentrating the hazardous material before shipping or discharge may lead to huge cost benefits since the costs of the disposal is directly depending on volume of the waste in fact for chromium ion exchange processes more than 90 of the total annual operating costs is due to the disposal costs of the waste brine which can be reduced by integrating fo into the process to reduce the waste brine volume 125 moreover since there are various types of industrial wastewaters fo can treat two different wastewaters one concentrated wastewater and one diluted wastewater in single treatment step this energy efficient integration could result in more economical management of industrial water and resources 17 as presented in table 6 researches have been carried out using raw and synthetic wastewater to evaluate the performance of fo membranes for instance in a study by ferrari et al 126 a pilot scale fo module was able to concentrate actual raw municipal wastewater and achieve water recovery of 70 without clogging and degradation problems thus it is appealing and economically feasible to be scaled up while pretreatment for wastewater is not required besides different constituents simulating actual wastewater discharged from different industries have been tested preparing and studying synthetic wastewater is essential for fo application in pilot scale research especially when real and stable effluents are not available this has challenged the research communities to evaluate and summarize the characteristics components of various industrial wastewaters furthermore there has been significantly increase in interest of coupling fo with anaerobic treatment recently because of the potential benefits including low energy stabilization of wastewater and resource recovery a high level of dissolved contaminants could be rejected to generate clean water from the draw agent when a draw solute recovery process is included leading to further opportunities of water reuse 115 in addition treatment with fo generates higher quantity of sludge which has a higher content of organic matter compared to the conventional biological process and leads to a higher biogas production i e conversion of organic solids to methane making fo a more energy efficient process compared to anaerobic digestion of the sludge alone 135 apart from anaerobic treatment zhou et al 136 combined fo and md to treat leachates from hazardous waste landfill by rejecting pollutants like organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n as well as toxic elements like hg as and sb in the high salinity wastewater 4 2 microalgae dewatering in recent years microalgae have attracted much focus as they have potential applications in aquaculture biofuels cosmetics pharmaceuticals food additives and nutrition 137 although numerous research approaches have been carried out the main challenges in term of microalgae are the high starting investment microalgae harvesting from medium with low concentration as well as productivity of biomass which is desired for high value added products 138 in order to harvest the microalgae a large amount 99 of water is required to be drawn out as the typical cell densities in microalgal cultures are usually low 0 03 0 1 wt 139 in fact a great degree 20 30 of the total costs of energy in the production of microalgal biofuel can be represented by the energy required for dewatering and drying steps 49 traditional microalgae processes of drying or dewatering requires extensive well trained laborers consume time e g sedimentation via gravity and have poisonous effect on microalgae e g chemical flocculation or coagulation 140 membrane driven processes for microalgae harvesting like microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and nf are considered not economical in terms of membrane and energy cost 137 buckwalter et al 49 suggested that fo may save energy for dewatering freshwater microalgae given that there are suitable draw solution and well controlled conditions to avoid leakage fo has many benefits in harvesting algae including great efficiency of separation limited propensity of fouling low consumption of energy and superb recovery of intact algae cells since hydraulic pressure is absent 141 employing freshwater microalgae culture as fs and seawater other suitable solution as draw agent fo processes facilitate water transport across an fo membrane while rejecting the algae resulting in effective concentrating harvesting of the algae culture consequently the concentrated feed water is expected to have high concentration of biomass and this has potential in causing fouling problem leading to reduced efficiency of microalgae dewatering degradation of membrane and an increase in the overall operational costs 142 for example study by volpin et al 143 showed that human urine utilized as novel draw solution resulted in a four fold increase in algal concentration but a thin layer of algae was deposited on the active side of the membrane causing a flux decrease of 19 greater efforts should be carried out to lower the risk of membrane fouling by optimizing operational conditions while using turbulence inducers and optimized design of membrane materials and modules 4 3 seawater desalination employing fo membrane for seawater desalination has been suggested since 1965 144 direct fo desalination is similar to other membrane based processes such as ro and nanofiltration where fresh water is directly extracted from saline water seawater or brackish water using solution with greater osmotic pressure as the osmotic agent pretreatment of the feed seawater may be required but there has been limited number of studies employing natural seawater in direct fo desalination 145 meanwhile standalone fo is overly idealistic for desalination and has appeared to be realistically impractical without an easy and competitive way to restore the diluted draw solution while recovering the water 146 as mentioned earlier recovery of ds may consume huge amount of energy making fo less energy efficient compared to the conventional desalination this is shown in a study by mazlan et al 147 that fo process itself required very low energy consumption 0 11 kw h m3 however when ds recovery process such as nanofiltration nf was included the specific energy consumption increased to 2 4 kw h m3 and it was higher than ro 2 3 kw h m3 147 despite the insignificant difference higher specific membrane areas are required for fo with nf recovery process compared to ro resulting in higher cost to operate fo desalination in a more beneficial approach an idea of hybrid systems by integrating fo with other process has been proposed recently the hybrid fo desalination systems which are often studied is fo ro in comparison to the standalone ro process choi et al 148 concluded that a fo ro hybrid system in pilot scale employing wastewater and seawater performed better with less fouling and consumed less energy technically fo pretreats seawater to remove majority of the dissolved components it also dilutes seawater for lower consumption of energy and better efficiency of recovery in the swro process 149 consequently using the diluted draw agent as fs in the ro part minimizes scaling fouling problems and the standard of the water produced by ro can be potentially improved 150 a modeling study by seo et al 149 also reported that there is less specific energy consumption in fo ro hybrid process with less requirement of applied pressure for ro indeed only 50 of the energy utilized for swro with high pressure which was about 1 5 kw h m 3 out of 2 5 4 kw h m 3 was consumed in a process of fo coupled with low pressure ro for indirect desalination and high quality water was extracted 151 nonetheless further work on designing fo element and ro process for this hybrid system should be carried out while cost analysis is required to investigate its economic feasibility 5 commercialization of fo and pro the market of fo is small that none of the companies have more than a few commercial installations commercial entitles which provide fo technologies for a variety of applications was summarized by francis et al 152 generally the development and commercialization of the fo membranes occur mainly in the usa japan korea and denmark table 1 it was started by hti in the usa a pouch made from a semipermeable membrane and high osmotic pressure sugar solution can be placed in the available water so that clean water flows to sugar side in order to produce hti s emergency energy sugar drink from contaminated water 153 this technology has been applied in nasa branches of the usa military and the usa department of defences 154 moreover hti had collaborated with bear creek services to treat wastewater from oil and gas operations a high recovery of around 90 was obtained when treating drilling fluids from shale gas operation 152 apart from that fo process in various applications has been developed by modern water since 2007 particularly it has been employed as the core of modern water s manipulated osmosis desalination mod process in facilities from university lab to a full scale commercial facility which provides drinking water into the public supply in the middle east the operation of this fo system has been successful with a seawater recovery of 35 and its low energy consumption 60 of swro s energy consumption is the real potential benefit 153 in addition this plant had operated without any changing of membranes chemical cleaning and reduction in productivity over a 36 month period since november 2009 155 additionally the company oasys water in the usa had developed a polyamide tfc membrane in 2008 and launched an integrated fo system with heat recoverable nh4 2co3 and nh4hco3 as the draw solutes in 2013 154 brine was also used by this company as a draw solute in permian basin and marcellus shale project for desalination of highly saline water in 2017 oasys water had partnered with beijing woteer for the world s largest coal to oolefin project to treat and recover the large quantity of wastewater generated by the zhongtian hechuang energy corporation with the aim of achieving zero liquid discharge this was done by integrating beijing woteer s completed pretreatment system and oasys water s clearflo membrane brine concentrator mbctm 154 on the other hand statkraft the largest renewable energy supplier in europe was the first company to challenge the commercialization of pro power generation its world s first pro pilot plant built in norway was discontinued in 2013 due to short of expectations on the plant s operation as compared to fo which has membrane module supplier commercially available there is currently no company that manufactures a commercialized module which is optimized for pro processes this is because the small market of pro is not attractive for membrane manufacturers to carry out research and development r d on the production of inexpensive and large quantities membranes due to high r d and equipment cost several companies which have commercialized fo membranes such as hti aquaporin and nitto denko have attempted to developed commercialized pro membrane but the commercialization of pro membrane does not happen yet hence collaborations with various business partner such as membrane manufacturers research institutes and utility companies could help in optimization of pro process and make pro commercialization viable in the near future 6 future trends fo has been studied for various applications and it has shown promising prospects in wastewater treatment due to its excellent performance of high rejection rate and comparatively low membrane fouling characteristics however there are several challenges to enhance its performance i e maximize the resource recovery especially in real application in full scale plants a number of research areas must be focused to boost the development of this fo technology firstly simulation and mathematical modelling are required to understand fundamental factors influencing fo process and to predict performance better examples of factors are solution chemistry pretreatment temperature flow rate ph concentration recovery pressure and membrane properties such as material configuration fabrication orientation and fouling 27 the relationship between each factor should be clearly understood employing novel substances to fabricate fo membrane or modifying fo membrane available to achieve desired performance is also the main focus of the fo research communities furthermore various kinds of ds which can be easily regenerated should be synthesized or discovered in order to significantly reduce the energy consumption it is also suggested to explore new industrial area which could support the elimination of draw solute recovery process moreover fouling is one of the major challenges in fo and pro processes since it can significantly influence the water flux and quality some of the potential approach for fouling issues are pretreatment e g oxidation coagulation and adsoption as well as chemical and physical cleaning method among the physical cleaning methods osmotic backwashing demonstrated the highest cleaning efficiency while air scouring showed a rapid improvement in cleaning 156 in another study by liu et al 132 chemical cleaning i e hcl removed more foulants compared to the physical method ultrasound these studies indicated the limitations of each cleaning method and the needs to establish a combined cleaning protocol besides membranes can be modified to be fouling resistant many attempts have been done to suppress the undesired membrane foulant interactions via surface functionalizations or to delay the occurrence of fouling via additional enthalpic barrier steric hindrance or electrostatic repulsion 157 more in depth research e g in situ real time fouling monitoring techniques should be carried out to establish better understanding on mechanism and fouling layer on the membrane since there is still a huge gap in the current research results apart from that several novel coupled or hybrid fo processes have been developed and proven to have better outcome these advanced techniques should be investigated for their suitability in various applications most of the studies carried out to date are in laboratory scale and only some are in pilot scale it is essential to carry out theoretical inspection in full scale to find out the optimal design and operational modes for various applications simulation and performance illustration of module scale fo operation is also necessary to better understand its economic and environmental impacts for instance the metal parts of the installed devices may have corrosion due to seawater and its real time effects should be studied on the other hand pro process with main purpose for power generation is reported to have a greater efficiency and high power density in comparison with other salinity energies unfortunately there is still uncertainty in the prospect of commercializing pro this is indicated by the recent publication numbers that research trend has been stagnating since 2016 which was the peak year for the pro research 158 the main concern for pro is the power density which must be improved through different approaches to make the engineered osmosis economically feasible firstly it is a must to develop appropriate osmotic membranes which are highly permeable with water flux higher than 50 l m2h while still being selective with solute rejection more than 99 and highly tolerant for hydraulic pressures higher than 5 5 mpa 800 psi 159 alongside thorough improvements of membrane it must push forward to advance in unexplored solution pairings with higher salinity gradients this is because the inherent limitations of the maximum energy extractable from conventional river seawater pair have been recognized in a study by straub et al 160 the maximum gibbs free energy of mixing from 0 6 m and 0 015 m nacl salinity similar as seawater and river water is only 0 26 kwh m3 such a small extractable energy leaves doubt on the fundamental feasibility of pro since energy inputs such as pretreatment pressurization and intake total 0 17 0 55 kw h m3 are required in fact there is significant osmotic potential in waters of ultrahigh salinity 100 000 ppm like the dead sea to be exploited in pro process 2 however a comprehensive process optimization is needed since hydraulic pressures required are beyond what current membranes and experiment setups could tolerate and be mechanically stable moreover the current spacers available in the market have been reported as inappropriate for pro operation since they cause serious channel blockage and membrane deformation 158 novel spacer designs for pro or other alternatives should be developed since there is concern on inefficient spacer and module designs in addition recent studies on pro processes have been focused on experiments targeting to enhance power densities which are in coupon scale but these are inapplicable to the full scale performance for example there are yet clear answers to the cost commercial availability and large scale practical performance of membranes although membranes with high power density have been reported in current literature therefore research applications should pay attention to the development of pro process at large scale for example the sustainable permseletivity of pro membranes should be tested under long term pressurization for practical pro operation 7 conclusion in a nutshell fo and pro have demonstrated vast potential in a variety of resource recovery applications such as separating pollutants treating wastewaters and generating osmotic power however more extensive and comprehensive studies on large scale which take all constraints e g technical environmental and economic into account are required to provide further insights and to evaluate the feasibility of these processes improvement of membrane optimization of operational conditions and use of high salinity draw solution are key aspects in enhancing these technologies it is believed that this state of the art review containing comprehensive commercial aspects could help in further developing fo and pro towards practical applications declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgements this

13756,there has been increasing attention in osmotically driven membrane processes odmps which include forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro they provide a sustainable solution against water and energy scarcity issues by utilizing the osmotic pressure difference between two water bodies feed low salinity and draw solution high salinity across a semipermeable membrane indeed their main applications water treatment e g desalination and wastewater treatment and power generation facilitate resource recovery from wastewaters this review updates the recent development of fo and pro by providing a comprehensive review on their fundamentals membrane properties potential applications as well as advanced techniques in addition economic analysis and environmental impacts are critically reviewed to highlight their feasibility and sustainability resource recovery from wastewaters e g water nutrient and energy using fo and pro is also discussed followed by their commercialization and future trends in order to push forward laboratory research to full scale commercialization keywords draw solution economic analysis hybrid system osmotic power wastewater treatment 1 introduction by the year 2025 water stressed or water scarce conditions will be faced by 2 4 3 2 billion people due to rising demands of clean water worldwide quadrupling the amount of population who stayed in regions with restricted availability of fresh water at the beginning of 2000s 1 scientists and organizations are urged to explore novel processes and technologies to decrease the energy consumed in desalination this is because seawater reverse osmosis swro process requires extensive energy and is costly to operate besides desalination cost swro faces critical issues including high consumption of fossil fuels with its associated environmental effects and high salinity brine discharge to the marine environments 2 osmotically driven membrane processes odmps have been developed as a potential sustainable solution against these problems in this process water is driven across a semipermeable membrane using osmotic pressure rather than hydraulic pressure and this could be advantageous to operating cost 3 besides capital costs associated with pumping and system construction can be reduced with installation of simple and inexpensive low pressure equipment since externally applied hydraulic pressure is not needed 4 forward osmosis fo and pressure retarded osmosis pro are two types of the odmps the integration of osmosis and membrane technology makes them a strong choice to be employed in applications ranging from evaporation to crystallization together with advantages of strongly compact modules high efficiency and sustainable environment friendly processes 5 by utilizing osmotic pressure gradient δπ fo processes move water across a semipermeable membrane from a lower osmotic pressure region into a higher osmotic pressure region on the other hand in pro processes water from a source with low salinity permeates across a membrane into a pressurized water source with higher salinity and power is produced via depressurizing the permeate using a hydro turbine this osmotic pressure gradient energy which makes use of the free energy released while two water bodies with different salinity levels are mixed is a potential green and sustainable renewable energy source fo and pro acting as alternative membrane processes have the potential to treat wastewater in order to produce high quality water they can be directly applied to a complex water body without extensive pre treatment owing to their high fouling reversibility and high rejection of dissolved contaminants 6 some examples of the treated complex wastewaters are textile wastewaters landfill leachate activated sludge municipal wastewater simulated wastewaters and even nuclear wastewater 7 several major system configurations have been developed for wastewater treatment applications depending on the type of wastewater one example is osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr which is the integration of fo within a membrane bioreactor ombr systems include submerged ombr for wastewater treatment under aerobic condition submerged ombr for wastewater reclamation under aerobic condition submerged ombr for biogas recovery under anaerobic condition side stream ombr under aerobic condition and combined ombr under aerobic condition 8 by coupling with a recovery process of draw solute production of clean water from the draw solution is feasible additionally energy needed to treat the wastewaters can be compensated by utilizing the osmotic power produced by the pro process alternatively anaerobic ombr which allows biogas production and avoids extensive aerations could also offset the overall energy consumption 9 besides nutrients such as phosphorus which has significant environmental value can be recovered from the wastewaters including urine secondary treated effluent waste activated sludge and digested sludge centrate 10 13 the recovery of these resources i e water nutrient and energy from wastewaters provides great opportunities to deal with the severe issues of water energy nexus many research works related to fo and pro have been presented mostly focusing on membrane development antifouling approaches and factor optimization in view of the increasing attention on resource recovery through odmps this review demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of both fo and pro including case studies in various countries attempting to describe the research needs for these technologies to achieve full scale water reclamation and wastewater treatment this outline includes the background of fo its membrane development and some recent trends to solve membrane fouling subsequently fo applications and its potential advantages on environment are presented the next section discusses the background of pro processes osmotic power generation and pro membrane development advanced techniques economic analysis and environmental impacts of the pro processes which have not been adequately discussed are also reviewed finally resource recovery from wastewaters and future trends of the fo and pro development are highlighted 2 forward osmosis fo is a growing technology based on osmosis which is naturally occurring to permeate a solvent usually water across a semipermeable membrane from a less to a more concentrated electrolyte the concentrated solution draw solution ds generates high osmotic pressure as moving power to permeate the water from the solution with lower concentration feed solution fs consequently the fs decreases in volume and increases in salt concentration leading to a reduction of permeate flux towards the osmotic agent region recovery of the diffused water requires a further procedure for its isolation from the draw solution but it may subsequently allow reuse of the draw solution and produce a final water product 14 different types of energy such as electrical energy chemical energy solar energy water heat and magnetic field energy have been used to recover ds 15 the amount of required energy and effectiveness of recovery process must be considered when selecting ds for any particular application if the recovery or discarding of the draw agent demands lower amount or quality energy the overall energy cost of fo can be lower to a very great extent there has been development in draw solutions with absence of the subsequent separation step an example of these osmotic agents is fertilizers like nano3 kcl ca no3 2 etc where these diluted fertilizers as the product of fo desalination can be used for fertigation on crops 16 however the type and availability of these direct use ds are still limited leading to a restriction of applications nonetheless fo offers advantages such as the fouling layers could be easily removed or reversed because there is no compression also two fss could be simultaneously treated in one treatment step while liquids which are not appropriate for other membrane processes could be treated and considerably high amount of water could be recovered 17 fo processes are different from membrane processes which are driven by pressure as only osmotic pressure difference between feed and draw solutions is used as the driving force therefore significantly less electrical energy is required also fo processes run with very low operating pressure as only a minimal hydraulic pressure is required due to the frictional resistance of fluid 18 2 1 fo membrane development at the beginning of the 20th century development of fo membranes begun while before that reverse osmosis ro membranes were being employed in most of the fo researches but they had thick support layers and were not well fitted for applications of fo 19 the support layer as thick as the one in ro is not required since high hydraulic pressure does not happen in fo ideal fo membranes should have a thin support layer which has minimized porosity to restrict internal concentration polarization icp a dense active layer which accomplishes an increased rejection of solute and hydrophilic properties to minimize fouling as well as maximize flux 20 therefore besides ro membranes early investigations on the fo process were mostly performed using cta based fo membranes commercialized by hydration technology innovation hti since then different start ups have been introduced into the market of fo commercial membranes and systems these fo companies can be primarily categorized into membrane manufacturing companies fluid technology solutions fts formerly hydration technology innovations hti oasys water porifera and aquaporin as well as process development and operation companies modern water statkraft desalgae water hti and trevi systems except toyobo and samsung cheil industries which offered unique hollow fiber fo membranes as well as aquaporin which introduced biomimetic hollow fiber and spiral wound fo membrane configurations all other companies have introduced spiral wound fo membrane which could be used in the fo system table 1 one of the brands producing fo flat sheet membranes is fts h2o and the price of ftsh2o flat sheet cta membrane varies from 74 98 to 794 09 depending on the size in general there are two methods to fabricate fo membranes which are phase inversion and interfacial polymerization technologies for thin film composite tfc membranes 21 some recent novel membranes with their membrane performance in fo mode with active layer faces feed solution al fs are demonstrated in table 2 generally deionized di water was used as the fs few parameters including membrane water flux jw reverse solute flux js and specific reverse salt flux js jw can be used to determine membrane performance jw volume per membrane area per time shows the rate where water diffuses across a membrane a higher jw is induced by a higher osmotic potential concentration of ds compared to fs since fo is an osmotic driven process on the other hand js mass per membrane area per time is defined as the rate where solutes diffuse in opposite direction to water flux basically js depends on the chemical physical properties of the solute and the solute selectivity of the active layer generally nacl was most widely used as ds in the literature its concentrations range from 0 3 m to 6 m and it is often used at 0 5 m to simulate the osmotic pressure of seawater however divalent inorganic and organic dss like magnesium sulfate mgso4 magnesium chloride mgcl2 and trisodium citrate have lower diffusivity due to the increasing charge molecular weight and hydrated radius of the ion 22 23 js jw loss of draw solute per permeated water is a better representation of membrane selectivity smaller js jw is favorable because it implies less loss of solute per unit of water diffused hence better membrane selectivity 24 an ideal ds should produce high jw and low jw i e low js jw like those induced by nacl and divalent salts respectively 25 furthermore it is noteworthy that the performance of fo membrane is influenced by physical properties of its support skin and thin rejection skin although the coaxial electrospun cellulose acetate polyvinylidene fluoride ca pvdf tfc membrane by shibuya et al 26 has the lowest js jw 0 03 g l reported in literature up to date it has lower hydrophilicity and water flux compared to the pure ca membrane on the other hand studies showed that tfc membranes generally have higher jw and js than cta membranes under the same operating conditions 27 in short a variety of fo membranes crafted using commercial materials or chemically modified on the ready made polymeric materials or the membrane supports has been presented in laboratory scale studies but these are not yet prepared for actual practical applications 28 hence research approaches are crucial in order to develop an optimized membrane for fo processes while investigating the interrelation of membrane properties which affect fo performance 2 2 applications although fo has been identified as practical and commercially viable starting from 1930 and recognized as a feasible technique to concentrate juice for more than five decades practical illustration of fo and that in full scale has happened only in the last 10 12 years and 3 5 years respectively 14 fo technology has been actively researched and developed to serve as alternative in solving the occurring water issues via desalination wastewater treatment and power generation it is noteworthy that fo can be applied to treat various types of hazardous wastewaters and remove toxic heavy metal ions in various manufacturing industries indeed novel fo membrane with enhanced separation efficiency stable separation selectivity and improved water flux is suitable for industries with heavy metal usage for removal of heavy metal ions 37 examples of industries which can employ fo for wastewater treatment are pharmaceutical industry 38 coal processing industry 39 textile industry 40 electronic industry 41 car manufacturing industry 42 and chemical industry 43 besides simultaneous concentration of active pharmaceutical ingredients such as bovine serum albumin and recovery of organic solvents can be achieved through fo process as it offers a reasonable jw and low js without external pressure 44 45 for food and beverage industry whey dewatering to produce valuable products like whey protein concentrates 46 and juice processing to increase its shelf life as well as to save the transportation cost 47 could be developed using fo process additionally by employing fo in polyvinyl chloride pvc latex dehydration energy consumption in the final drying process to produce latex can be reduced 48 similarly fo processes can be applied for microalgae dewatering to solve the technical issue of concentrating algae cells as the conventional strategies either require high energy or addition of harmful chemical 49 all these applications demonstrate the potential of fo processes but most of them are still in laboratory stage where there are research gaps prior to commercial implementation one of the main reasons is that ro and distillation the proposed recovery processes of diluted ds remain energy intensive and inefficient 41 pushing forward the real world commercialization it is important to continuously explore new industrial areas with potential for fo applications without the requirement of draw solution recovery process 2 3 potential benefits on environment unlike other pressure driven desalination technologies fo process does not leave major carbon footprints greenhouse gases ghg emissions from fo are greatly lower than that of thermal technologies and demand of electricity is notably lower compared to that of ro especially when combining fo and other power generation or industrial processes which have waste heat production 50 furthermore environmental effects and carbon emissions due to fossil fuels used in fo hybrid processes could be further reduced and eliminated by coupling fo systems with other renewable energy technologies such as hydro wind and bioenergy 51 since hydraulic pressure is negligible and the fouling layer is less compressed fo is less susceptible to serious fouling unlike fouling that happens in ro membranes osmotic backwashing can easily remove majority of the foulants discovered on the membranes for fo hence any chemical cleaning reagents that can disrupt the aquatic ecosystems as well as flora and fauna at discharge locations is not necessarily needed 52 53 exceeding 98 recovery of permeate water flux which is much higher than that usually noticed in ro could be obtained after water rinsing alone 54 the primary concern for environmental aspect of desalination is that natural water bodies at discharge point and disposed brine could differ in temperature and salinity in addition the density of the brine is greater than the typical seawater and the sunken brine can be toxic to the communities at the seafloor fortunately fo can possibly decrease the quantity of rejected hazardous brine effectively as long as the osmotic pressure differential across the membrane is sufficiently strong to achieve appropriate membrane water flux and recovery of water 55 nevertheless a report on the real environmental impacts of fo plant should be done so that its sustainability is more convincing for full scale implementation 3 pressure retarded osmosis pro pro is a promising process producing blue energy without essential emission of co2 56 a semipermeable membrane separates fs and draw agent resulting in osmotic pressure difference and salinity gradient difference which are utilized in pro process 2 in contrast to fo process a back hydraulic pressure is applied to pressurize the concentrated osmotic agent 57 this method proposed by loeb 58 could recover osmotic energy as electrical energy hence it is also referred as generation of osmotic pressure power water is diffused through an energy recovery device erd either pressure exchanger or hydro turbine to produce hydraulic head which is released to enable the conversion of salinity energy to osmotic power or electricity 59 similar to other fo applications the osmotic gradient determines the amount of the energy generated by mixing river water and seawater the approximated worldwide osmotic energy generated is 1750 to 2000 tw h per annum which exceeds one tenths of the energy consumption in the whole world with the working pressure of 13 5 bar operating at steady state equivalent to a 135 m water column in a hydroelectric power plant 60 to compare with other renewable energy technologies the actual power generation in 2017 is 481 tw h from biofuels energy 4197 tw h from hydraulic energy and 1127 tw h from wind energy 61 however current pro technology has yet to have high performance because the semipermeable membranes have too small permeability due to its sub nanometer scaled pore structure to strain particles and subsequently the power which is calculated by multiplying pressure drop with flow rate is accordingly low 62 besides the available osmotic pressure difference may lead to a very small quantity of generated energy if each and every contributions of energy consumption like pumping and pretreatment processes are considered 63 ds concentration fouling control and post treatment of the concentrated fs are the other possible energy consumers 64 energy consumption of pro technology is compared with other membrane technologies in table 3 since pro is membrane based properties of membrane configuration of structure and operational conditions could significantly affect its performance 73 two approaches to reach the break even point for economic feasibility are improving osmotic membranes and employing high salinity draw solutions replacing seawater basically it is more suitable to have membranes with high power density in generating osmotic power though this technology has yet to be thoroughly commercialized it is a potential process of renewable energy 74 3 1 osmotic power generation open loop fig 1 a and closed loop fig 1b are two classes of pro systems categorized based on their configuration in the former system which presents the solar driven processes water from the ocean is evaporated due to renewable energy by the sun and this energy is then recovered when salt water and fresh water are mixed at a river mouth in the latter system of pro thermal plant which is usually called an engine for osmotic heat low grade heat generated from other industrial processes or power plants is utilized to generate power and regenerate draw solution this design offers one of the most important benefits which is no brine waste discharge however the set up is very restricted depending on availability of waste heat source 75 fig 2 demonstrates a schematic diagram of a typical pro osmotic power plant firstly feed waters undergo pretreatment through several filtrations before moving into membrane modules consisting of hollow fiber or spiral wound membranes in order to get rid of contaminants as well as mitigate fouling of membrane then pretreated fresh water is pumped into an enclosed section which is at zero or low hydraulic pressure pf meanwhile the pretreated draw solution flows into the high pressure chamber at an elevated hydraulic pressure ps to be in contact with another membrane area by pumping across a pressure exchanger beforehand the fresh water permeates against the porous support of membrane whereas the active layer faces the salty water water employs the driving force across the membrane δπ δp where δp ps pf and travels from the low pressure to the high pressure chamber through the membrane spontaneously at a flowing rate of incoming volume δv water flux jw can be calculated using eq 1 it can also be improved by manipulating δv and membrane area am where effects of membrane and operating conditions on the performance of odmps have been investigated extensively 1 δ v j w a m where jw is the water permeation flux and am is the area of membrane as soon as the water diffuses across the membrane from the low pressure region pressure and volume of the salty water in the high pressure chamber increase consequently the draw solution undergoes dilution into a new solution named brackish water which is then divided into two parts about 1 3 is employed to run a hydro turbine to generate electricity whereas the remaining flows back to erd pressure exchanger to pressurize the salty water the pressure of the brackish water is transferred to the feed of salty water through the erd hence establishing a pro system which is cost effective therefore energy loss must be reduced to minimum by working pressure exchanger efficiently because the energy produced by the hydro turbine will not be sufficient to pretreat pump and pressurize the feeds 77 system optimization is an essential criterion to enhance the actual power generation of the pro power plant and it can be achieved by optimizing module design offering advanced membrane performance and improving salinity gradient between the two solutions power density w is the power output per unit membrane area and is usually used to indicate how efficient the membrane converts energy it is critical as it influences the power cost directly it finds out the membrane area needed and the plant size for a certain generation capacity of energy 77 this is because desired total net energy can be achieved by just enlarging the total area of membranes which have low power density 2 the greater the power density the cheaper the costs for installation operation and maintenance pro processes are suggested to be operated at a pressure which is close to δπ 2 to maximize the power generation for instance the ideal operating pressure for pairing of river seawater is 13 0 13 5 bar 77 however the effective osmotic pressure gradient in actual pro processes is lower than that between the bulk salt water and fresh water δπ πs πf because of reverse salt permeation rsp and concentration polarization cp effects which have been demonstrated to seriously decrease the osmotic pressure differential and the corresponding water flux resulting in a lower power density 78 nonetheless the power density of the membranes is not the only factor of power production capacity of a pro power plant by modifying the flow rates of both draw and feed waters as well as by using different solute concentrations with higher draw solute or lower feed concentrations than the seawater river water pair also can give rise to much higher power density 56 it should be noted that the maximum power density may not be discovered in most of the pro research as the experimental setups have restricted them at comparatively low pressures 20 bar 79 therefore improving the experimental setups may achieve even greater power density with increasing draw solution salinity 3 2 pro membrane development although the concept was proposed about six decades ago early works of osmotic energy production were mostly terminated because effective membranes the main factors of osmotic power systems which determine the overall power generation capital costs plant size as well as profitability were absent 80 statkraft constructed the first prototype of osmotic power plant in norway with 2000 m2 flat sheet ca membranes and 2 kw 4 kw marginal power output capacity in 2009 50 however it was terminated in 2014 possibly because the technology was immature with extensive pretreatment processes high pressure pump limited salinity gradient between river water and seawater membrane limitations fouling and low power output 60 indeed power density and net specific energy which are generated by pro process using pair of seawater and river water are found to be not sufficiently high 81 pro activity may be restricted by power density if its production costs are increased to an extent that it is unprofitable to be economically feasible there must be sufficiently high energy output compared to the energy consumed for pretreatments and water pumps 80 therefore pro studies have focused on looking for appropriate huge salinity gradient feed pairs and developing high performance membranes with good mechanical stability and high water flux use of a highly saline draw solution necessitates novel pro membranes to tolerate a higher working pressure and generate a higher power density under high pressure circumstances 82 basically pro membranes should have an optimal combination of the membrane properties high a water permeability and low b salt permeability for the active layer and low s structural factor for the support layer similar to fo a broad range of nano sized materials have been explored to synthesize tfc membrane with desirable performance like improved water flux hydrophilicity mechanical stability and osmotic power 75 as shown in table 4 recent studies in the scientific literature have documented membranes exceeding power density of 5 wm 2 which was claimed to be the economic break even point meanwhile a commercial membrane developed by porifera inc revealed to be capable of achieving gross power density of 7 1 wm 2 under laboratory conditions 83 however it is noteworthy that the highest pressure used in laboratory was only 30 bar table 4 which led to restricted performance of power density research involving enhanced experimental systems for higher pressures should be carried out since the possibility of employing commercial fo membranes under pressures up to 70 bar was reported 84 3 3 advanced techniques pro can be integrated with ro or fo to carry out simultaneous desalination one of the benefits is that pro has a subunit role in which energy productivity is less important compared to pro which has a main unit role since energy used in other subunit processes is recovered instead of producing the additional energy for daily usage 89 osmotic power generation can be sustained with the benefits of fo including low fouling tendency simple membrane cleaning as well as minimal external energy needed when a real waste effluent is utilized as the feed 90 a power density larger than 5 wm 2 could be achieved by inter looping 1 m nacl solution in a fo pro hybrid system osmotic agent in first stage and the fs to second stage given these circumstances fo has a competitive water flux at a possibly cheaper operational cost compared to conventional pretreatment methods via pressure driven membrane processes 91 this is because the foulants could be effectively rejected by fo process resulting in mild membrane fouling the diluted ds can then leave fo as a clean feed to the subsequent pro unit at negligible fouling tendency furthermore the ds used in pro process could be diluted back as seawater level and disposed easily reducing the cost for post treatment in short the reduction in the osmotic pressure of the diluted ds in fo process and the reduction in the hydraulic operational pressure needed by the freshwater recovery process provide energy savings for the fo pro system however capital cost would be higher for fo process due to the membrane area and salinity gradient in the pro process would be inadequate indeed life cycle cost analysis by valladares linares et al 92 showed that capital and operational expenses of fo lpro hybrid system are 21 higher and 56 lower respectively compared to swro hence jeng and chu 93 suggested that fo is not cost effective to act as the pretreatment step for the pro in the dual purpose desalination power plants ro brine has potential to serve as a salinity gradient energy source since it has high osmotic pressure 35 7 bar 74 2 bar and high salt concentration 4 3 9 0 94 energy efficiency and sustainability of seawater desalination could be improved while disposal and environmental impacts of ro waste could be reduced with integration of swro plants and osmotic power generators 95 the hybrid system could be pro ro or ro pro the former is preferred when there is higher demand for a higher quality of water lower water concentration than for power as the seawater flowing into the second stage has a lower salinity whereas the latter is more fitted for high power demand since a greater salinity gradient is created for the second stage 93 in non ideal pro systems there is no full recovery of salinity gradient energy and the energy which cannot be recovered stays in the solutions to discharge 96 a dual stage pro dspro process is an alternative where a pro unit in second stage can utilize the remaining energy in the diluted draw agent to maximize energy recovery before discharge as well as to reduce the cp effect and to enhance energy generation 97 a water pump with extra high pressure for the draw solution is not needed in dspro since the pressurized and diluted osmotic agent from the first pro unit will be recycled to the second stage 98 at the end of the second stage whole diluted draw solution which totals up the permeate water of both stages flows to a hydro turbine to generate power 99 generally benefits of dual stage systems are that it is flexible in selecting types of membrane configurations of module as well as sources of feed and draw agent moreover fresh water with low concentration flowing into the second stage may result in additional water permeation across the membrane leading to higher power output 97 theoretical researches have indicated that dspro process is capable to increase the energy yield of the pro process by more than 18 96 soltani and struchtrup 97 also demonstrated improvement in dual stage pro system comparison to single stage system furthermore altaee et al 100 revealed that each stage in dspro has different optimum operating pressure and a maximum power density is reached at a hydraulic pressure lower than the δπ 2 for example when 5 m 0 6 m salinity gradient was used the hydraulic pressures for maximum power density of the first stage 18 5 w m2 and second stage 6 8 w m2 were 110 bar and 60 bar respectively this indicates that there is lower requirement on the mechanical stability of a membrane in dspro there should be more studies on dspro since it demonstrates more benefits over the standalone pro 3 4 economic analysis the major benefit of pro is that it can generate baseload power which is reliable leading to yearly energy costs which are competitive and comparable with other renewable energy sources 101 however the current cost for osmotic power is difficult to be estimated due to deficiency of osmotic power plants which are in large scale to prove the price assumed 102 chung et al 103 discovered that minimum net power density of 56 4 w m2 is needed for a pro system to reach a 0 074 kwh levelized cost of electricity lcoe to be same as that of solar photovoltaic in the united states then the commonly cited minimum power density to make pro economical was revisited and 5 w m2 was concluded as ten times lower than that needed for economic feasibility 103 among cost components of pro capital cost makes up a large part 60 whereas operational and maintenance costs remain as a small part a high capital cost is expected if a membrane has low power density because a huge membrane area and high membrane installation cost is required to increase the power 102 for instance the resulting capital cost for power density of 1 w m2 is around 20 000 per kw but that for power density of 5 w m2 would be 4000 per kw 101 furthermore membranes with ongoing maintenance costs have certain lifespan where the installed membranes need to be replaced besides membranes large capital costs are also resulted by facilities of pretreatment intake and outfall systems pumps pressure exchangers hydro turbines as well as other devices selecting a suitable location to launch an osmotic plant could reduce the capital costs for intake and outfall systems 104 meanwhile extensive efforts should be carried out to enhance the viability of pretreatment processes which are responsible for the biggest energy losses reducing pretreatment cost from 0 22 to 0 16 mj m3 which is around 25 reduction would result in power generation that is 50 higher 105 installation nature also affects the cost where cost of hybrid installation should be lower than the stand alone pro plant 106 in an economic evaluation of ro pro hybrid system choi et al 107 concluded that ro pro can only be economically competitive with the ro process if there are high electricity cost power density and recovery with low pro membrane cost these are the important variables to study the pro economic viability and determine the estimated revenue of a pro facility 76 2 r e v e n u e m e m b r a n e a r e a y e a r p o w e r d e n s i t y e n e r g y p r i c e on the other hand chung et al 108 estimated the minimum lcoe for a 2 mw generation pro system with different feed draw pairs and 0 066 kwh was reported for the pair of river water and almost saturated water 26 wt there is a potential to compete with few other renewable power generation technologies shown in table 5 including geothermal solar power and offshore wind power however the costs associated with feeds pretreatment as well as intake and outfall systems are not considered as these vary with water sources and plant site a pro plant proposed by khasawneh et al 110 is also economically viable with a lcoe of 0 056 kwh without costs for the intake and outfall systems and a capacity of 134 5 mw by employing the red sea water and the dead sea water as feed water and osmotic agent respectively in comparison with other power plants of renewable energy the pro osmotic plant was shown to have the highest efficiency 74 5 after the hydroelectric power plant however this study is very restricted since the fs and ds are from specific locations and the economic viability is largely contributed by the very high salinity of the ds in short site location of the pro plant is very important that ds and fs which can provide high salinity gradient should be easily assessible to make the pro plant economic feasible 3 5 environmental impacts osmotic energy is considered clean and sustainable as there is no co2 or other emissions including carbon monoxide co and mono nitrogen oxides nox interfering with global climate and the noise of installations is low 102 111 kuleszo et al 112 estimated that up to 24 of worldwide energy related non co2 ghg emissions may be reduced by osmotic energy if there is full implementation of pro to substitute coal fired power plants leading to global ghg emissions reduction 8 gt co2 eq per annum touati and tadeo 106 also pointed out that under accelerated environmental policies global ghg emissions could be decreased using pro by 2741 megatons by 2030 like other facilities along the coast e g desalination facilities damage to species and habitat due to modification of land release of pollutants and noise is expected for building and decommission of a salinity gradient energy facility 113 however a comparatively small area of footprint is normally needed by osmotic power plants which could be built partially or entirely underground hence osmotic plants have minimized environmental impacts at the estuaries while maintaining ecological situations 106 nonetheless pro power plant should cause some impacts on the local environment for example a louder sound during operation is expected since water is needed to be maintained at sufficient pressure using additional water pumps in addition construction of an osmotic power plant close to and in water heighten the chance of contaminants entering the ocean 113 pro power plant also uses a large quantity of fresh water fresh water would need to be pumped into 2 mw and 20 mw osmotic power facilities at rates of 2 7 m3s 1 and 26 7 m3s 1 respectively to generate power of 0 75 mw m3s 1 which is the typical outputs of renewable sources power plants 101 under such large intakes of freshwater developers of osmotic power plant must make sure that minimum flow needed for downstream is retained in the rivers similar to ro desalination plants the issues of cp scaling and fouling necessitate chemical cleaning which influences the properties of the brackish water discharged 106 salinity of the effluent water will likely be different from that of water at the discharge point and either cause decreasing or increasing in local salinity thereby giving special risks to discharge sites 113 fortunately small variations in local salinity could be expected for pro plants in comparison to ro plants as brackish water is discharged rather than brine 101 besides the difference of temperature between surface water and discharge could slightly influence the water temperature at the discharge site of pro brackish water fortunately a biological evaluation made by statkraft had demonstrated that the discharge water of their prototype plant has no effect on the local communities at or near the bottom of a sea for three years 114 however it is suggested to carry out an updated and detailed research on this aspect since there is lack of study to prove the environmental friendliness of a pro plant apart from that successful integration of pro and ro processes would lead to more sustainable seawater desalination with less waste footprint of fs dependence on energy as well as issues on disposal of waste ro brine and other environmental impacts 107 this is because brine will undergo dilution before being discharged into the ocean and its influence on nature is alleviated for instance a brine dilution of more than 22 was reported with a simultaneous maximum net power of 1 5 kw net power density of 6 6 w m2 63 in addition environmental conditions in heavy industrial areas can be improved by using industrial rejected hazardous brines in an osmotic power plant 111 4 resource recovery from wastewaters fo and pro are recognized as highly suitable technologies to facilitate recovery of clean water nutrients and energy from wastewater fig 3 it is noteworthy that some of them could carry out resource recovery and wastewater treatment simultaneously when integrated with a ds recovery process the methods of recovering draw solution include thermal processes e g multistage flash distillation and muliti vapor compression membrane based processes e g nf swro and md and responsive thermal processes e g ammonium bicarbonate draw system suitable draw regeneration method should be selected based on the operating conditions and the total dissolved solids tds equaivalent range of ds since there is no one size fit all solution ansari et al 115 had summarized a number of studies of fo processes to enhance the recovery of energy and nutrients from various wastewaters for instance high rejection of fo membrane for phosphates results in permeate water with very low concentration of total phosphorus tp the accumulated phosphorus can then be recovered through precipitation by modifying ph in the reactor 116 except phosphorus precipitation coupling fo with anaerobic treatment could also facilitate resource recovery it employs fo to firstly pre concentrate wastewater to a high strength before the subsequent anaerobic treatment through anaerobic treatment for wastewater chemical energy contained in wastewater can be recovered through biogas conversion an alternative approach is anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor an ombr which presents vast potential as methane yield 0 21 l g cod was achieved in the previous study 117 apart from that fo could be coupled with microalgae cultivation process which uses wastewaters resulting in an energy efficient process of microalgae dewatering interestingly a microalgal culture medium could be employed as draw solution omitting the energy intensive regeneration of draw solution where the resulting diluted nutrient solution can be directly reused as a culture medium 118 algae which are able to synthesize various valuable bioactive compounds including polysaccharides proteins and lipids are widely useful in different industries such as pharmaceutical cosmetics food 119 120 161 after dewatering algae through fo or pro these high value bioproducts such as lipids could be extracted from algae through conventional methods such as soxhlet extraction and folch extraction or newer techniques such as supercritical co2 sc co2 and ionic liquids ils 121 122 besides extraction other downstream processing steps include isolation and purification steps the downstream processing steps are generally complex and expensive which could be eased by utilizing cost effective fo technology in the harvesting step furthermore energy required to treat the wastewaters can be compensated by utilizing the osmotic power generated through the pro process 4 1 wastewater treatment fo has been employed to treat diverse complex and hazardous wastewaters either reclaiming the wastewater as drinking water or concentrating the trace feed by decreasing the volume of fs 123 most approaches of fo wastewater treatment are similar to the direct desalination technique where an osmotic agent is employed to concentrate the wastewater fs and other post treatment technologies e g ro membrane distillation md are subsequently applied for salt recovery 124 in simple terms clean water diffuses across the membrane and subsequently dilutes the ds while foulants and contaminates are left behind if the original wastewater is high in hazard levels concentrating the hazardous material before shipping or discharge may lead to huge cost benefits since the costs of the disposal is directly depending on volume of the waste in fact for chromium ion exchange processes more than 90 of the total annual operating costs is due to the disposal costs of the waste brine which can be reduced by integrating fo into the process to reduce the waste brine volume 125 moreover since there are various types of industrial wastewaters fo can treat two different wastewaters one concentrated wastewater and one diluted wastewater in single treatment step this energy efficient integration could result in more economical management of industrial water and resources 17 as presented in table 6 researches have been carried out using raw and synthetic wastewater to evaluate the performance of fo membranes for instance in a study by ferrari et al 126 a pilot scale fo module was able to concentrate actual raw municipal wastewater and achieve water recovery of 70 without clogging and degradation problems thus it is appealing and economically feasible to be scaled up while pretreatment for wastewater is not required besides different constituents simulating actual wastewater discharged from different industries have been tested preparing and studying synthetic wastewater is essential for fo application in pilot scale research especially when real and stable effluents are not available this has challenged the research communities to evaluate and summarize the characteristics components of various industrial wastewaters furthermore there has been significantly increase in interest of coupling fo with anaerobic treatment recently because of the potential benefits including low energy stabilization of wastewater and resource recovery a high level of dissolved contaminants could be rejected to generate clean water from the draw agent when a draw solute recovery process is included leading to further opportunities of water reuse 115 in addition treatment with fo generates higher quantity of sludge which has a higher content of organic matter compared to the conventional biological process and leads to a higher biogas production i e conversion of organic solids to methane making fo a more energy efficient process compared to anaerobic digestion of the sludge alone 135 apart from anaerobic treatment zhou et al 136 combined fo and md to treat leachates from hazardous waste landfill by rejecting pollutants like organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n as well as toxic elements like hg as and sb in the high salinity wastewater 4 2 microalgae dewatering in recent years microalgae have attracted much focus as they have potential applications in aquaculture biofuels cosmetics pharmaceuticals food additives and nutrition 137 although numerous research approaches have been carried out the main challenges in term of microalgae are the high starting investment microalgae harvesting from medium with low concentration as well as productivity of biomass which is desired for high value added products 138 in order to harvest the microalgae a large amount 99 of water is required to be drawn out as the typical cell densities in microalgal cultures are usually low 0 03 0 1 wt 139 in fact a great degree 20 30 of the total costs of energy in the production of microalgal biofuel can be represented by the energy required for dewatering and drying steps 49 traditional microalgae processes of drying or dewatering requires extensive well trained laborers consume time e g sedimentation via gravity and have poisonous effect on microalgae e g chemical flocculation or coagulation 140 membrane driven processes for microalgae harvesting like microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf and nf are considered not economical in terms of membrane and energy cost 137 buckwalter et al 49 suggested that fo may save energy for dewatering freshwater microalgae given that there are suitable draw solution and well controlled conditions to avoid leakage fo has many benefits in harvesting algae including great efficiency of separation limited propensity of fouling low consumption of energy and superb recovery of intact algae cells since hydraulic pressure is absent 141 employing freshwater microalgae culture as fs and seawater other suitable solution as draw agent fo processes facilitate water transport across an fo membrane while rejecting the algae resulting in effective concentrating harvesting of the algae culture consequently the concentrated feed water is expected to have high concentration of biomass and this has potential in causing fouling problem leading to reduced efficiency of microalgae dewatering degradation of membrane and an increase in the overall operational costs 142 for example study by volpin et al 143 showed that human urine utilized as novel draw solution resulted in a four fold increase in algal concentration but a thin layer of algae was deposited on the active side of the membrane causing a flux decrease of 19 greater efforts should be carried out to lower the risk of membrane fouling by optimizing operational conditions while using turbulence inducers and optimized design of membrane materials and modules 4 3 seawater desalination employing fo membrane for seawater desalination has been suggested since 1965 144 direct fo desalination is similar to other membrane based processes such as ro and nanofiltration where fresh water is directly extracted from saline water seawater or brackish water using solution with greater osmotic pressure as the osmotic agent pretreatment of the feed seawater may be required but there has been limited number of studies employing natural seawater in direct fo desalination 145 meanwhile standalone fo is overly idealistic for desalination and has appeared to be realistically impractical without an easy and competitive way to restore the diluted draw solution while recovering the water 146 as mentioned earlier recovery of ds may consume huge amount of energy making fo less energy efficient compared to the conventional desalination this is shown in a study by mazlan et al 147 that fo process itself required very low energy consumption 0 11 kw h m3 however when ds recovery process such as nanofiltration nf was included the specific energy consumption increased to 2 4 kw h m3 and it was higher than ro 2 3 kw h m3 147 despite the insignificant difference higher specific membrane areas are required for fo with nf recovery process compared to ro resulting in higher cost to operate fo desalination in a more beneficial approach an idea of hybrid systems by integrating fo with other process has been proposed recently the hybrid fo desalination systems which are often studied is fo ro in comparison to the standalone ro process choi et al 148 concluded that a fo ro hybrid system in pilot scale employing wastewater and seawater performed better with less fouling and consumed less energy technically fo pretreats seawater to remove majority of the dissolved components it also dilutes seawater for lower consumption of energy and better efficiency of recovery in the swro process 149 consequently using the diluted draw agent as fs in the ro part minimizes scaling fouling problems and the standard of the water produced by ro can be potentially improved 150 a modeling study by seo et al 149 also reported that there is less specific energy consumption in fo ro hybrid process with less requirement of applied pressure for ro indeed only 50 of the energy utilized for swro with high pressure which was about 1 5 kw h m 3 out of 2 5 4 kw h m 3 was consumed in a process of fo coupled with low pressure ro for indirect desalination and high quality water was extracted 151 nonetheless further work on designing fo element and ro process for this hybrid system should be carried out while cost analysis is required to investigate its economic feasibility 5 commercialization of fo and pro the market of fo is small that none of the companies have more than a few commercial installations commercial entitles which provide fo technologies for a variety of applications was summarized by francis et al 152 generally the development and commercialization of the fo membranes occur mainly in the usa japan korea and denmark table 1 it was started by hti in the usa a pouch made from a semipermeable membrane and high osmotic pressure sugar solution can be placed in the available water so that clean water flows to sugar side in order to produce hti s emergency energy sugar drink from contaminated water 153 this technology has been applied in nasa branches of the usa military and the usa department of defences 154 moreover hti had collaborated with bear creek services to treat wastewater from oil and gas operations a high recovery of around 90 was obtained when treating drilling fluids from shale gas operation 152 apart from that fo process in various applications has been developed by modern water since 2007 particularly it has been employed as the core of modern water s manipulated osmosis desalination mod process in facilities from university lab to a full scale commercial facility which provides drinking water into the public supply in the middle east the operation of this fo system has been successful with a seawater recovery of 35 and its low energy consumption 60 of swro s energy consumption is the real potential benefit 153 in addition this plant had operated without any changing of membranes chemical cleaning and reduction in productivity over a 36 month period since november 2009 155 additionally the company oasys water in the usa had developed a polyamide tfc membrane in 2008 and launched an integrated fo system with heat recoverable nh4 2co3 and nh4hco3 as the draw solutes in 2013 154 brine was also used by this company as a draw solute in permian basin and marcellus shale project for desalination of highly saline water in 2017 oasys water had partnered with beijing woteer for the world s largest coal to oolefin project to treat and recover the large quantity of wastewater generated by the zhongtian hechuang energy corporation with the aim of achieving zero liquid discharge this was done by integrating beijing woteer s completed pretreatment system and oasys water s clearflo membrane brine concentrator mbctm 154 on the other hand statkraft the largest renewable energy supplier in europe was the first company to challenge the commercialization of pro power generation its world s first pro pilot plant built in norway was discontinued in 2013 due to short of expectations on the plant s operation as compared to fo which has membrane module supplier commercially available there is currently no company that manufactures a commercialized module which is optimized for pro processes this is because the small market of pro is not attractive for membrane manufacturers to carry out research and development r d on the production of inexpensive and large quantities membranes due to high r d and equipment cost several companies which have commercialized fo membranes such as hti aquaporin and nitto denko have attempted to developed commercialized pro membrane but the commercialization of pro membrane does not happen yet hence collaborations with various business partner such as membrane manufacturers research institutes and utility companies could help in optimization of pro process and make pro commercialization viable in the near future 6 future trends fo has been studied for various applications and it has shown promising prospects in wastewater treatment due to its excellent performance of high rejection rate and comparatively low membrane fouling characteristics however there are several challenges to enhance its performance i e maximize the resource recovery especially in real application in full scale plants a number of research areas must be focused to boost the development of this fo technology firstly simulation and mathematical modelling are required to understand fundamental factors influencing fo process and to predict performance better examples of factors are solution chemistry pretreatment temperature flow rate ph concentration recovery pressure and membrane properties such as material configuration fabrication orientation and fouling 27 the relationship between each factor should be clearly understood employing novel substances to fabricate fo membrane or modifying fo membrane available to achieve desired performance is also the main focus of the fo research communities furthermore various kinds of ds which can be easily regenerated should be synthesized or discovered in order to significantly reduce the energy consumption it is also suggested to explore new industrial area which could support the elimination of draw solute recovery process moreover fouling is one of the major challenges in fo and pro processes since it can significantly influence the water flux and quality some of the potential approach for fouling issues are pretreatment e g oxidation coagulation and adsoption as well as chemical and physical cleaning method among the physical cleaning methods osmotic backwashing demonstrated the highest cleaning efficiency while air scouring showed a rapid improvement in cleaning 156 in another study by liu et al 132 chemical cleaning i e hcl removed more foulants compared to the physical method ultrasound these studies indicated the limitations of each cleaning method and the needs to establish a combined cleaning protocol besides membranes can be modified to be fouling resistant many attempts have been done to suppress the undesired membrane foulant interactions via surface functionalizations or to delay the occurrence of fouling via additional enthalpic barrier steric hindrance or electrostatic repulsion 157 more in depth research e g in situ real time fouling monitoring techniques should be carried out to establish better understanding on mechanism and fouling layer on the membrane since there is still a huge gap in the current research results apart from that several novel coupled or hybrid fo processes have been developed and proven to have better outcome these advanced techniques should be investigated for their suitability in various applications most of the studies carried out to date are in laboratory scale and only some are in pilot scale it is essential to carry out theoretical inspection in full scale to find out the optimal design and operational modes for various applications simulation and performance illustration of module scale fo operation is also necessary to better understand its economic and environmental impacts for instance the metal parts of the installed devices may have corrosion due to seawater and its real time effects should be studied on the other hand pro process with main purpose for power generation is reported to have a greater efficiency and high power density in comparison with other salinity energies unfortunately there is still uncertainty in the prospect of commercializing pro this is indicated by the recent publication numbers that research trend has been stagnating since 2016 which was the peak year for the pro research 158 the main concern for pro is the power density which must be improved through different approaches to make the engineered osmosis economically feasible firstly it is a must to develop appropriate osmotic membranes which are highly permeable with water flux higher than 50 l m2h while still being selective with solute rejection more than 99 and highly tolerant for hydraulic pressures higher than 5 5 mpa 800 psi 159 alongside thorough improvements of membrane it must push forward to advance in unexplored solution pairings with higher salinity gradients this is because the inherent limitations of the maximum energy extractable from conventional river seawater pair have been recognized in a study by straub et al 160 the maximum gibbs free energy of mixing from 0 6 m and 0 015 m nacl salinity similar as seawater and river water is only 0 26 kwh m3 such a small extractable energy leaves doubt on the fundamental feasibility of pro since energy inputs such as pretreatment pressurization and intake total 0 17 0 55 kw h m3 are required in fact there is significant osmotic potential in waters of ultrahigh salinity 100 000 ppm like the dead sea to be exploited in pro process 2 however a comprehensive process optimization is needed since hydraulic pressures required are beyond what current membranes and experiment setups could tolerate and be mechanically stable moreover the current spacers available in the market have been reported as inappropriate for pro operation since they cause serious channel blockage and membrane deformation 158 novel spacer designs for pro or other alternatives should be developed since there is concern on inefficient spacer and module designs in addition recent studies on pro processes have been focused on experiments targeting to enhance power densities which are in coupon scale but these are inapplicable to the full scale performance for example there are yet clear answers to the cost commercial availability and large scale practical performance of membranes although membranes with high power density have been reported in current literature therefore research applications should pay attention to the development of pro process at large scale for example the sustainable permseletivity of pro membranes should be tested under long term pressurization for practical pro operation 7 conclusion in a nutshell fo and pro have demonstrated vast potential in a variety of resource recovery applications such as separating pollutants treating wastewaters and generating osmotic power however more extensive and comprehensive studies on large scale which take all constraints e g technical environmental and economic into account are required to provide further insights and to evaluate the feasibility of these processes improvement of membrane optimization of operational conditions and use of high salinity draw solution are key aspects in enhancing these technologies it is believed that this state of the art review containing comprehensive commercial aspects could help in further developing fo and pro towards practical applications declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgements this

13757,the world is facing the third coronavirus caused pandemic in less than twenty years the sars cov 2 virus not only affects the human respiratory system but also the gastrointestinal tract the virus has been found in human feces in sewage and in wastewater treatment plants it has the potential to become a panzootic disease as it is now proven that several mammalian species become infected since it has been shown that the virus can be detected in sewage even before the onset of symptoms in the local population wastewater based epidemiology should be developed not only to localize infection clusters of the primary wave but also to detect a potential second or subsequent wave to prevent a panzootic virus removal techniques from wastewater need to be implemented to prevent the virus dissemination into the environment in that context this review presents recent improvements in all the fields of wastewater treatment from treatment ponds to the use of algae or nanomaterials with a particular emphasis on membrane based techniques keywords wastewater sars cov 2 virus covid 19 membranes wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction sars cov 2 is the third coronavirus to spread worldwide in the last two decades 1 as of july 9th 2020 the virus has infected more than 12 million people with the covid 19 disease and claimed the lives of 552 000 people the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars as its given name indicates primarily affects the respiratory system of the patients however covid 19 has a broader range of symptoms with digestive tract symptoms widely spread amongst patients moreover a substantial portion of infected people are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms but still can transmit the virus lastly sars cov 2 is not only supposed to have been transmitted to humans through animal carriers but humans can also transmit the disease to other animals in this review the literature concerning the presence of the disease in the digestive tract of patients and its dissemination in the wastewater network will be detailed the present literature concerning which animals have been identified as potential carriers of sars cov 2 will then be summarized to limit the propagation of covid 19 and to avoid the possibility of a pan zoonotic disease wastewater based epidemiology that allows rapid detection of the presence of the disease in an area and the tools available to remove viruses from the wastewater at the wastewater treatment plant to reduce the risk of spreading the disease further within the environment either by discharge into water systems or by the production of reclaimed water for irrigation or human consumption will be presented 2 sars cov 2 2019 ncov information sars cov 2 is an enveloped single stranded rna virus which belongs to the coronaviridae family this family is subdivided into four subfamilies ranging from alpha to delta subfamilies alpha and beta can affect humans sars cov 2 is from the subfamily coronavirinae genera β 2 sub genus sarbecovirus 3 since 1960 there have been seven coronaviruses from these two subfamilies that have been reported to have affected humans 4 5 229e oc43 sars cov nl63 mers hku1 and sars cov 2 229e oc43 nl63 hku1 are involved in 15 of the common colds 5 whereas sars cov mers and sars cov 2 viruses are more virulent and they cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars sars cov outbreak was in 2002 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov broke out in the arabian peninsula in 2012 1 bar on et al 6 provide regularly updated data in which can be found the sars cov 2 size which is around 100 nm for membrane based treatment processes size is important as it determines the maximum pore size of the membrane which needs to be selected to remove the viral particles fig 1 provides size and shape comparisons of several viruses in this figure virus sizes range from 20 nm to 970 nm with 100 nm sars cov 2 is slightly smaller than sars cov but is bigger than most common viruses 3 spread of sars cov 2 in the environment the two main ways which were initially reported for sars cov 2 transmission are through direct contact and through aerosols produced by contaminated people when sneezing or coughing sars cov 2 is able to survive on surfaces with survival duration highly dependent on surface type 8 10 although it has not as yet been been demonstrated as a route for transmission however sars cov 2 rna has also been found in human feces 11 21 of at least 39 of tested patients 22 and therefore the question of the possibility of fecal oral transmission is raised 15 17 zang et al 23 studied the infection of human small intestinal enterocytes and reported that two mucosa specific serine proteases promoted virus entry in enterocytes mart et al 24 also demonstrated that enterocytes are easily infected and can actually be used as experimental models but regarding the possibility of fecal oral transmission it was indicated that the sars cov 2 was inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid 23 these data are in vitro data and it is also reported that live sars cov 2 virus was found in patient s stool samples 25 26 detection of sars cov 2 virus was obtained in both nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs in a pediatrical study of 10 children 27 moreover from the day of admission the rectal swabs returned positive for 27 days whereas no virus was detected in any nasopharyngeal swabs after 15 days 19 27 however virus replication tests realized on fecal swabs returned negative jiang et al 28 even detected the virus in the stools of patients for as many as 42 days numerous teams have indicated that covid 19 could be transmissible by the fecal oral route 11 17 19 25 31 but there is no demonstrated case at this point however caution should be taken to limit the possibilities of virus shedding in the environment for both human and animals he et al 32 provided data about when and the duration that infected people can shed virus and for how long the rna virus can be detected 33 those data were compiled by viralzone 34 and are presented in fig 2 since the virus is present in feces is it found in municipal wastewater and this raises the possibility of spread to the wider environment from insufficiently treated effluent several articles have been published indicating detection of sars cov 2 35 40 in sewage wurtzer et al 36 were able to correlate the results of the quantitative monitoring of sars cov 2 genome in paris sewage to the number of people infected they even suggested that sewage water samples should be stored in a databank to allow them to be investigated retrospectively when an outbreak is starting the importance of this archiving was equally outlined by dolfing 41 medema et al 39 report a study in the netherlands where they started looking for the presence of covid 19 rna in 6 locations on february 6th 2020 the detection started on march 4 5 six days before the first cases were reported similarly randazzo et al 42 in spain and wu et al 43 in the usa detected covid 19 rna in wastewater even in low prevalence area in spain la rosa et al 44 reported the detection of covid 19 in untreated wastewater in italy this raises the question of the presence of sars cov 2 in the aquatic environment since covid19 is a pandemic spread in 215 countries it covers countries with wastewater treatment plants and other developing countries where wastewater is directly sent to the aquatic environment untreated thus the presence of viable sars cov 2 virus or rna in aquatic environment is reported by several authors 45 52 4 sars cov 2 zoonosis covid19 disease was first detected in the city of wuhan in the hubei province of china in december 2019 the corona virus that causes the disease is now named sars cov 2 since it shares 96 whole genome identity to a bat coronavirus batcov ratg13 53 the bat rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province is suspected to be the original mammal hosting the precursor of sars cov 2 however the two provinces are distant from each other and the contacts between bats and humans are limited it is possible that an intermediate animal host is involved in the transmission from animals to humans the presence of pangolins in the putative starting point of the pandemic which is the seafood market in wuhan china and the 91 nucleotide identity of the sars cov 2 with a pangolin cov 6 53 makes it a conjectured intermediate host 54 although this is far from certain and efforts are ongoing to find other candidate intermediate hosts apart from the search for the intermediate host studies have been made to identify animal species that could have been infected a chinese study examined antibody levels in pigs sheep horses chicken and ducks 55 and the results were negative however it is reported that diseased humans have transmitted the virus naturally to ferrets cats dogs tigers lion and minks 3 56 59 apart from minks farms there is no evidence so far that livestock for human consumption such as cows sheep and pigs have been infected in farms 60 this last point is rather important if it is considered that in the case of mers cov which belongs to coronaviridae beta subfamily like sars cov 2 but not to the subgenus sarbecovirus camels 61 62 were suspected to be possible reservoirs or intermediate hosts for successive outbreaks even raw milk and improperly cooked meat were discussed as potential sources of infection apart from the natural transmission of sars cov 2 virus from human to animals studies have reported of experimental inoculation of the virus to animals and study the possibility of transmission from animals and the transmission route by putting in the same cage infected and non infected animals and having other animals in another cage close to the first 63 66 this has demonstrated that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to the virus whist dogs are less susceptible and livestock pigs sheep and ducks studied were not found to be susceptible it is to be noted that those tests were done on a limited number of animals so how representative they are of the species as a whole is not entirely known transmission back to humans was discussed by franklin et al 67 who raised the possibility of wild hosts in north america as a potential source of perpetuation of the pathogen in the environment damas et al 68 studied in silico the probabilities of a wide range of animals to get infected and ranked them in five levels from very low to very high based on the conservation of genes for 25 amino acids important in the binding of the virus to a putatively important receptor ace2 the ranking used the fact that the main receptor of sars cov 2 is the angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 their study on 410 vertebrates including 252 mammals could help identify potential animals that could be viral host from this they judged that only mammals fell into the categories of medium or higher risk in the meantime in the nederland on mink farms where minks had been found to be contaminated sequencing was done on samples taken from diseased farmers and while the topic is still under investigation the transmission from minks to human seems to have occurred 56 gollakner et al 69 underlined that although the data gathered so far does not allow definite conclusion of the possibility of a panzootic aspect for covid 19 allowance should be made for the possibility since there is shedding of the virus to the environment through sewage the question has been raised about the possibility of aquatic mammals to become contaminated 70 5 wastewater based epidemiology from the previous sections it was shown that sars cov 2 is found live in human feces and that it can be transmitted to animals which can also excrete it although the fecal oral transmission has still not been demonstrated precaution measures should be taken to minimize this possibility fig 3 summarizes the pathways that excreta from both human and animals can follow to potentially transmit the virus back to humans 71 sewage and then wastewater treatment plant wtt are at the center of this potential transmission route and wtt can play an important role in detection and control of sars cov 2 spread for the detection part wastewater based epidemiology wbe could be used wbe is a relatively new tool whose idea comes from the fact that relatively stable environmental contaminants that are released in the sewage system can be sampled and quantified it potentially provides real time information on wastewater contaminants 72 and was first used in 2001 to evaluate illicit drug usage 73 more recently wbe has been proposed for the early detection of viral outbreaks 74 82 as well as for the persistence of viral indicators in the aquatic environment 75 83 the methods used are high throughput rna sequencing rna seq more commonly than pcr qrt pcr 75 84 in 2019 o brien and xagoraraki 74 85 underlined the importance of wastewater data collection to understand spatial and temporal evolution of viral diseases in the case of sars cov 2 considering that the virus was found both in stool samples and wastewater as previously described several authors have proposed to use wbe as a tool to monitor the pandemic 41 76 80 86 100 thus medema et al 38 reported that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor sars cov 2 circulation in the population since it could be detected prior to symptoms being reported in the local population moreover monitoring of international airport sewage would allow very early detection of the entrance of the virus into a country wurtzer et al 36 even suggested that wastewater sample storage would allow detection of an outbreak retroactively to provide historic information of the spread of the virus in the present sars covid 2 outbreak it could have allowed the localization of the first patients and define which cities should be on lockdown instead of putting the lockdown on a whole country for example until now it was believed that the sars cov 2 outbreak in france started late january 2020 but sars cov 2 was detected retrospectively by rt pcr in samples from a patient admitted in intensive care in late december 2019 101 mao et al 102 proposed a small portable paper based device for the detection of sars cov 2 and hata and honda 91 provided information on the potential sensitivity of wastewater monitoring for sars cov 2 which is one diseased person in 100 000 6 wastewater treatment for virus removal the who 103 underlined in its interim guidance of april 23rd 2020 the importance of safely managing wastewater limiting the dissemination of the sars cov 2 into the environment is of great importance considering that several animals have already been identified as potential hosts and that reclaimed water could be used in irrigation gerba et al 104 reported the virus removal reduction factor that wastewater plants need to provide depending on the reclaimed water use for irrigation of edible crops they indicate a 6 log10 removal is sufficient whereas a 12 log10 removal would be needed to make the water potable the same removal targets have been reported by ahmed et al 105 in their 2020 article on recycled water safety wastewater treatment is a wide field and its full description is not the target of this review this section will focus on the literature containing techniques used for virus removal after presenting the model viruses that are used to evaluate the efficiency of wastewater virus removal treatment recently developed methods will be presented 6 1 model virus sars cov 2 is a potentially lethal virus to humans and some precautions need to be taken for scientific testing to be made thus the center for disease control and prevention cdc provides guidelines for biosafety and covid 19 106 for environment specimen testing the cdc defines that procedures that concentrate viruses such as precipitation or membrane filtration can be performed in a bsl 2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow and bsl 3 precautions as a result in general virus surrogates are used instead of dangerous pathogens the surrogate to be used depends on the experiment type to be handled for example to compare the virus concentration methods for wastewater testing murine hepatitis virus mhv has been used as a sars cov 2 surrogate 84 other animal coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and the feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv have also been used for testing the persistence and disinfection of human coronaviruses in water and wastewater 107 for safety reasons some laboratories are using the enveloped bacteriophage φ6 107 109 whose size is 85 nm 110 or the non enveloped escherichia virus ms2 109 111 122 whose size is 26 nm 123 124 however shirasaki et al 125 studied different virus models and they concluded that the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov which is a plant virus appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric virus whereas ms2 and φx174 are not pmmov has also been validated together with aiv 1 and tmv as surrogates of human enteric viruses for testing wastewater virus reduction 126 6 2 wastewater treatment pond systems wastewater treatment ponds are very common worldwide as they are the technically simplest way to handle wastewater verbyla and mihelcic 120 reviewed 71 different wastewater treatment pond systems for virus removal and concluded that one log10 reduction of virus content in water was achieved between 14 5 20 9 days considering the world health organization guidelines for wastewater reuse for irrigation a pathogen reduction of 6 7 log10 units is required 127 this target can be reached only by the combination of several methods ponds are used as primary treatment and there can be up to three treatment steps virus removal in pond treatment systems is not very well understood and depends on the particular characteristics of the pond including chemical composition and optical properties but the process seems to be a combination of sunlight mediated mechanisms and interactions of virus particles with other particulates including other microorganisms and sedimentation 120 6 3 uv inactivation and chlorine treatment qiu et al 128 reported the inactivation of human infectious virus at two wastewater plants they measured the reduction using qpcr on different virus types the mean log10 reduction they obtained was 1 2 and 1 8 simon et al 129 reported the use of chlorine and ultraviolet light disinfection against different viruses they obtained up to 2 5 3 log10 reduction lr on coliphage and e coli otherwise the lrs were in the range of 0 3 to 1 3 they observed that results are better on sand filtered samples uv inactivation and treatment with hypochlorite generally renders viruses inactive by damaging replicative machinery through oxidation processes 130 6 4 ozone treatment ozone is highly effective for the inactivation of many viruses a statement by the international ozone association ioa indicated that it was not aware of any research and testing that had been conducted specifically on the sars cov 2 coronavirus peer reviewed research has not yet been completed and therefore definitive conclusions cannot be made regarding ozone inactivation of sars cov 2 ioa statement on covid 19 2020 131 the us epa has published disinfection contact time ct values for virus inactivation by ozone in the surface water treatment rule swtr us epa 1989 132 to assess the disinfection efficiency in water treatment the ct concept is applied c represents the concentration of disinfectant ozone and t the contact time ct is the product of the disinfectant concentration and contact time sigmon et al 133 calculated ct values for specified log inactivation levels of a number of viruses and surrogates in wastewater at ph 7 6 and 16 c with log reduction values lrv for all viruses ranging from 0 56 for an lrv of 1 1 32 for an lrv of 1 32 133 these data indicated that all organisms were generally inactivated to 4 log at a ct of no more than 1 0 mg min l enteric viruses do not get proper inactivation in wastewater effluent discharged to the environment 134 as such effluent discharged from sewage treatment plants will have an elevated number of viruses 135 ozone has been used as a disinfectant instead of chlorine for the disinfection of sewage effluents used for irrigation of crops and for discharge to surface water due to the issue of high chlorine demand and problematic disinfectant byproducts 136 a study by perez rey et al 137 reported that selected microorganisms including four viruses three non sporulated bacteria two sporulated bacteria and one fungus were employed in vaccine preparation for animals viruses were the most readily inactivated microorganisms and sporulated bacteria the most resistant strains the inactivation followed a second order kinetic law depending on both ozone and microorganism concentration the conclusion of that study was total inactivation of microorganisms in wastewater is possible by ozone application a study by aydogan et al 138 indicated the effectiveness of ozone gas to inactivate bacillus subtilis spores which share the same physiological characteristics as bacillus anthracis spores that cause the anthrax disease increased humidity during the ozone application increased the rate of inactivation the city of montreal québec canada investigated three disinfection processes ozone uv and performic acid to improve wastewater treatment to reduce pharmaceuticals and endocrine chemicals in one of the primary treated effluents high flow system 139 the city of montreal municipal wastewater has the target criteria for coliforms of 9000 ufc 100 ml that needs to be met ozone treatment was found to be the most efficient of the three disinfection processes investigated in removing selected pharmaceutical products from lightly treated effluents 139 6 5 sand filters for virus removal sand filters are commonly used in wastewater treatment but they usually have less than one unit log10 virus removal they are used more for particle removal however samineni et al 112 developed functionalized sand filters using a water extract of moringa oleifera seeds then they tested the efficiency of the obtained sand using ms2 bacteriophage virus obtaining an impressive 7 log10 reduction in virus content the mechanism implies that ms2 has affinity for some components from the seeds and binds to it it also implies that the functionalized sand will progressively get saturated and will eventually have to be replaced or regenerated in some way 6 6 algal systems for virus removal delanka pedige et al 140 142 recently published three articles dealing with the use of algae for removing viruses in wastewater results obtained are in the same range as for activated sludge with log removal values in the range of 1 3 depending on the virus type they seem however to reduce the number of species more efficiently and thus reduce the need for chlorination mechanisms for viral removal in algae based wastewater treatment systems include sedimentation after viral particles have attached to algal biomass increased temperatures denaturing algal nucleic acids and proteins and sunlight mediated degradation 140 6 7 membranes use in wastewater treatment for virus removal water filtration membranes are categorized by their pore size and their distributions in four categories reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration and microfiltration fig 4 gives a representation of those pore sizes together with the main contaminants including viruses that can be found in water considering that sars cov 2 size is 100μm membranes such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration and ultrafiltration should be able to remove it goswani et al 143 reviewed the use of polymeric and ceramic membranes for virus removal from water the reported removal efficiencies were highly variable since the range reported was 0 2 7 this section will outline very recent literature showing the potential use of those membranes for sars cov 2 before considering microfiltration and membrane bioreactor technology 6 7 1 reverse osmosis wlodarczyk and kwarciak kozlowska 71 recently reviewed the treatment of waterborne pathogens by reverse osmosis they provide complete description of the type of pathogens that are waterborne which are divided in three different groups protozoans 5 100 μm bacteria 0 5 1 0 μm and viruses 0 01 0 1 μm as well as requirements for reverse osmosis membrane materials they indicated that reverse osmosis is seldom used to remove pathogens from water even if it is one of the techniques reported by the epa with indicative log removals above 6 this is because reverse osmosis is typically coupled with a pre treatment system often ultrafiltration to reduce foulants which may interfere with the reverse osmosis process however ro can be used in combination with such a suitable a pretreatment to remove particulate matter and post treatment to complete the removal of any remaining contaminants 145 prado et al 146 reported that membrane bioreactor reverse osmosis systems were providing virus removal efficiencies in the range of 2 3 2 9 log10 which is rather lower than what was reported by vickers et al 147 who used reverse osmosis for the removal of ms2 coliphage they obtained a nomimal 5 log10 removal without the mbr considering that ms2 is 27 μm in size which is roughly 60 times smaller than sars cov 2 the removal efficiency on the latter would be expected to be higher the same authors 148 also reported the use of sand anthracite filters and a membrane bioreactor reverse osmosis system for the removal of noroviruses which are non enveloped capsids of about 38 40 nm in diameter 149 in raw sewage the efficiency of the system led to a virus concentration below the detection level which would mean considering the initial virus concentration and the detection limit of the analysis a log10 removal higher than 6 or 7 6 7 2 nanofiltration pore sizes of nanofiltration membranes are generally less than 10 nm which is smaller than any virus presented in fig 1 150 although the literature on nanofiltration removal of viruses is not extensive several studies have been published which generate log removal rates for various viruses at between 3 and 8 151 155 6 7 3 ultrafiltration as ultrafiltration is often used as a pre treatment step prior to ro treatment its efficacy in removal of viruses is more widely reported in the scientific literature than for other membrane based technologies recently al aani et al 156 reviewed the use of ultrafiltration membranes for wastewater and water process engineering and report their use for bacteria and virus removal lee et al 117 used a combination of coagulation and ultrafiltration uf on a pilot scale for wastewater reclamation they improved removal of ms2 bacteriophage by optimizing the ph of the secondary effluent to a range of 5 6 depending on the effluent once improved the virus removal factor was in the 6 8 7 5 log10 range additionally to obtain a more stable transmembrane pressure an additional sedimentation step was required the ideal combination was a hybrid coagulation sedimentation uf system other researchers 157 used a polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane with average membrane pore sizes of 67 nm for the removal of the bacteriophage pp7 they studied the effect of ph in the range of 5 8 and modelled virus and membrane electrostatic interaction forces the log10 removal range obtained was in the 1 5 2 8 range depending on ionic strength divalent cations present in feed solutions were found to have a negative impact on the viral removal effectiveness compared with monovalent cations due to their modification of electrostatic interactions grafted zwitterionic polymer hydrogels were used by lu et al 158 for the modification of a 150 kda polyethersulfone membrane they studied the membrane efficiency on ms2 and hadv 2 human viruses the grafting reduced water permeability but provided a log10 removal in the 3 4 range a pore interconnectivity method of evaluation of asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes has been developed commercially specifically for virus removal 159 gold nanoparticles of different sizes were used and their capture by the membranes was visualized using sem it was found that membranes shown by this method to have poor pore interconnectivity were also membranes which had been previously shown to have significant loss of viral retention after process recovery whereas membranes shown to have better interconnectivity were more robust in terms of virus retention over a range of operating conditions 6 7 4 microfiltration since microfiltration membrane average pore sizes are larger than 100 nm they are more suited to the removal of protozoa and bacteria rather than the smaller viruses 160 however this only considers separation by sieving mechanisms sinclair et al 161 modified a microfiltration membranes using a cationic polymer they reached a 3 log10 ms2 reduction with the resulting membrane with only 22 reduction in flux they proposed such membranes for low pressure point of use water filtration due to the high water permeability of such membranes 6 7 5 membrane bioreactor o brien and xagoraraki reported that membrane bioreactors under the correct conditions are capable of a 7log10 reduction in virus concentration 162 from a comparison of a number of studies it was found that the presence of a biofilm on the membrane was important in virus removal efficiency where a biofilm whilst reducing water flux also restricted viral penetration of the membrane it was concluded that there must be a trade off between maintaining a biofilm to keep viral removal efficiency high with backwashing of the membrane to remove biofilm to maintain acceptable water fluxes they also concluded that model viruses do not necessarily show the same removal efficiency as viruses which are pathogenic to humans with data obtained using harmless bacteriophages likely to lead to overestimation of viral removal efficiencies for pathogenic viruses miura et al 163 investigated the removal of three virus families in a full scale membrane bioreactor plant the best results were obtained at ph4 with a log10 reduction range of 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 ceramic membranes im et al 122 164 first compared ozonation and coagulation as pretreatments for virus removal with a ceramic membrane they then used a combination of ozonation coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration for water reclamation they obtained on a pilot plant a 12 log10 removal factor of ms2 the use of hydrophobic ceramic capillary membranes for virus removal was reported by bartels et al 165 they functionalized ceramic membranes with hexyl or octyl triethoxysilanes in order to increase hydrophobic surface properties without functionalization they obtained log10 removal in the range of 0 3 3 4 for the bacteriophages ms2 and phix174 whereas after functionalization the log10 removal was around 9 this increase in removal efficiency was due to favorable virus treated membrane surface interactions primarily due to hydrophobic interactions which lead to adsorption of viruses to the membrane material presumably such membranes would potentially be subjected to a sufficiently high saturation of viral concentration thus necessitating cleaning in line coagulation with ceramic membrane filtration for the removal of the bacteriophage qβ was investigated by wattanachira et al 166 the coagulant they used is polyaluminum chloride they underlined that they had to adjust coagulant dosage with virus concentration overall they obtained 6 7 log10 virus removal under optimal conditions 6 7 7 nanomaterials the use of nanomaterials to remove and de activate viruses in wastewater is a broad field and includes the use of fullerenes photocatalysts and membranes incorporating nanomaterials such as cnts tio2 and zvis 167 169 for instance kim et al 170 reported that silver multiwall nanotubes ag mwcnt used in a nanocomposite filter system reached a 100 removal for several different viruses 170 domaga et al 113 studied cu2o mwcnts filters for ms2 virus removal from water one of their three samples reached a 7 log10 reduction in ms2 at ph5 nemeth et al 171 used a cu2o coated mwcnt membrane and obtained a 4 log10 ms2 removal in a ph range of 5 9 kuo et al 115 obtained a 7 log10 reduction on three viruses qβ bacteriophage ms2 bacteriophage and aichi virus with smectic liquid crystalline ionic membranes 6 8 integrity testing techniques and imperfection fixing for the reverse osmosis nano filtration and ultra filtration membranes to efficiently remove viruses their integrity has to be optimal for instance membranes may contain defect obtained during manufacture or may suffer mechanical damage during use from high hydraulic operating pressures or scouring by particulates in the feed water a number of reviews are found in the literature for techniques to assess the integrity and structure property relationships of separation membranes including by wang et al 172 ostarcevic et al 144 and pype et al 173 high pressure membranes are only credited at 2 log10 virus removal by regulatory agencies whereas in the sections above articles were presented where it reached as high as 7 log10 this difference is due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive detection technologies available industrially 174 frenkel and cohen 175 proposed new techniques for real time monitoring of reverse osmosis membrane integrity for virus removal they proposed a pulsed marker membrane integrity monitoring system the potentials and limitations of this type of fluorescent based technique was then investigated by yoon 174 who managed to obtain a sensitivity level at the 4 log10 level then niewersch et al 176 proposed a solution diffusion imperfection model with a decision tree for diagnosis to help monitor the integrity of membranes which was capable of identifying the types of imperfections present in a particular membrane under study for ultrafiltration khahnstover et al 177 published a comparison of different methods that can be used to assess integrity and separation efficiency nanoparticle counting was found to be the most sensitive method overall in terms of lowest lrv values reported as a solution to imperfections in nanoscale membranes suzuki et al 178 proposed to use a small volume of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol to selectively plug imperfections these plugs were then stabilized through exposures to citric acid sodium hydroxide and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 7 conclusions sars cov 2 is a virus that emerged at the end of 2019 in china and generated a pandemic of covid 19 within a few months initially thought to affect only the respiratory system it was soon proven to be also gastrointestinal then the environmental implication is that sars cov 2 is shed into the sewage system and thus reaches wastewater treatment plants when existing or more globally the aquatic environment sars cov 2 has also been proven to be transmitted from humans to animals which can potentially be a virus reservoir considering the possibility of sars cov 2 being a panzoonotic it becomes even more important to limit sars cov 2 spread into the environment wastewater treatment plants could be a solution for the early detection of the disease in an area through the development of a wastewater based epidemiology plan it could also be used as a decision helper for lockdown application or removal after reporting some of the virus models that can be used to characterize virus removal efficiency a wide range of recently developed wastewater treatments were presented this include some classical and advanced technologies treatments ozone uv etc and numerous membrane based systems as a general rule it is the combination of different techniques in primary secondary and tertiary treatments that would allow enough virus removal to limit the possibility of environment contamination the sars cov 2 pandemic should develop a global awareness that solutions have to be found for improving the wastewater treatment even in developing countries due to the possibility of its spread through the aquatic environment from inadequately treated waste water sars cov 2 transmission through the fecal oral route is not predominant but considering that it is the third new coronavirus to evolve to a pandemic in less than twenty years preparations should be made for the possibility of a virus pandemic more readily transmissible through this route considering the economic costs of the present pandemic greater efforts to improve wastewater treatment specifically with the removal or inactivation of viral contaminants on a global scale should be an urgent priority declaration of competing interest the authors of this manuscript declare that there is no conflict of interest 
13757,the world is facing the third coronavirus caused pandemic in less than twenty years the sars cov 2 virus not only affects the human respiratory system but also the gastrointestinal tract the virus has been found in human feces in sewage and in wastewater treatment plants it has the potential to become a panzootic disease as it is now proven that several mammalian species become infected since it has been shown that the virus can be detected in sewage even before the onset of symptoms in the local population wastewater based epidemiology should be developed not only to localize infection clusters of the primary wave but also to detect a potential second or subsequent wave to prevent a panzootic virus removal techniques from wastewater need to be implemented to prevent the virus dissemination into the environment in that context this review presents recent improvements in all the fields of wastewater treatment from treatment ponds to the use of algae or nanomaterials with a particular emphasis on membrane based techniques keywords wastewater sars cov 2 virus covid 19 membranes wastewater based epidemiology 1 introduction sars cov 2 is the third coronavirus to spread worldwide in the last two decades 1 as of july 9th 2020 the virus has infected more than 12 million people with the covid 19 disease and claimed the lives of 552 000 people the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars as its given name indicates primarily affects the respiratory system of the patients however covid 19 has a broader range of symptoms with digestive tract symptoms widely spread amongst patients moreover a substantial portion of infected people are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms but still can transmit the virus lastly sars cov 2 is not only supposed to have been transmitted to humans through animal carriers but humans can also transmit the disease to other animals in this review the literature concerning the presence of the disease in the digestive tract of patients and its dissemination in the wastewater network will be detailed the present literature concerning which animals have been identified as potential carriers of sars cov 2 will then be summarized to limit the propagation of covid 19 and to avoid the possibility of a pan zoonotic disease wastewater based epidemiology that allows rapid detection of the presence of the disease in an area and the tools available to remove viruses from the wastewater at the wastewater treatment plant to reduce the risk of spreading the disease further within the environment either by discharge into water systems or by the production of reclaimed water for irrigation or human consumption will be presented 2 sars cov 2 2019 ncov information sars cov 2 is an enveloped single stranded rna virus which belongs to the coronaviridae family this family is subdivided into four subfamilies ranging from alpha to delta subfamilies alpha and beta can affect humans sars cov 2 is from the subfamily coronavirinae genera β 2 sub genus sarbecovirus 3 since 1960 there have been seven coronaviruses from these two subfamilies that have been reported to have affected humans 4 5 229e oc43 sars cov nl63 mers hku1 and sars cov 2 229e oc43 nl63 hku1 are involved in 15 of the common colds 5 whereas sars cov mers and sars cov 2 viruses are more virulent and they cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome sars sars cov outbreak was in 2002 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov broke out in the arabian peninsula in 2012 1 bar on et al 6 provide regularly updated data in which can be found the sars cov 2 size which is around 100 nm for membrane based treatment processes size is important as it determines the maximum pore size of the membrane which needs to be selected to remove the viral particles fig 1 provides size and shape comparisons of several viruses in this figure virus sizes range from 20 nm to 970 nm with 100 nm sars cov 2 is slightly smaller than sars cov but is bigger than most common viruses 3 spread of sars cov 2 in the environment the two main ways which were initially reported for sars cov 2 transmission are through direct contact and through aerosols produced by contaminated people when sneezing or coughing sars cov 2 is able to survive on surfaces with survival duration highly dependent on surface type 8 10 although it has not as yet been been demonstrated as a route for transmission however sars cov 2 rna has also been found in human feces 11 21 of at least 39 of tested patients 22 and therefore the question of the possibility of fecal oral transmission is raised 15 17 zang et al 23 studied the infection of human small intestinal enterocytes and reported that two mucosa specific serine proteases promoted virus entry in enterocytes mart et al 24 also demonstrated that enterocytes are easily infected and can actually be used as experimental models but regarding the possibility of fecal oral transmission it was indicated that the sars cov 2 was inactivated by simulated human colonic fluid 23 these data are in vitro data and it is also reported that live sars cov 2 virus was found in patient s stool samples 25 26 detection of sars cov 2 virus was obtained in both nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs in a pediatrical study of 10 children 27 moreover from the day of admission the rectal swabs returned positive for 27 days whereas no virus was detected in any nasopharyngeal swabs after 15 days 19 27 however virus replication tests realized on fecal swabs returned negative jiang et al 28 even detected the virus in the stools of patients for as many as 42 days numerous teams have indicated that covid 19 could be transmissible by the fecal oral route 11 17 19 25 31 but there is no demonstrated case at this point however caution should be taken to limit the possibilities of virus shedding in the environment for both human and animals he et al 32 provided data about when and the duration that infected people can shed virus and for how long the rna virus can be detected 33 those data were compiled by viralzone 34 and are presented in fig 2 since the virus is present in feces is it found in municipal wastewater and this raises the possibility of spread to the wider environment from insufficiently treated effluent several articles have been published indicating detection of sars cov 2 35 40 in sewage wurtzer et al 36 were able to correlate the results of the quantitative monitoring of sars cov 2 genome in paris sewage to the number of people infected they even suggested that sewage water samples should be stored in a databank to allow them to be investigated retrospectively when an outbreak is starting the importance of this archiving was equally outlined by dolfing 41 medema et al 39 report a study in the netherlands where they started looking for the presence of covid 19 rna in 6 locations on february 6th 2020 the detection started on march 4 5 six days before the first cases were reported similarly randazzo et al 42 in spain and wu et al 43 in the usa detected covid 19 rna in wastewater even in low prevalence area in spain la rosa et al 44 reported the detection of covid 19 in untreated wastewater in italy this raises the question of the presence of sars cov 2 in the aquatic environment since covid19 is a pandemic spread in 215 countries it covers countries with wastewater treatment plants and other developing countries where wastewater is directly sent to the aquatic environment untreated thus the presence of viable sars cov 2 virus or rna in aquatic environment is reported by several authors 45 52 4 sars cov 2 zoonosis covid19 disease was first detected in the city of wuhan in the hubei province of china in december 2019 the corona virus that causes the disease is now named sars cov 2 since it shares 96 whole genome identity to a bat coronavirus batcov ratg13 53 the bat rhinolophus affinis from yunnan province is suspected to be the original mammal hosting the precursor of sars cov 2 however the two provinces are distant from each other and the contacts between bats and humans are limited it is possible that an intermediate animal host is involved in the transmission from animals to humans the presence of pangolins in the putative starting point of the pandemic which is the seafood market in wuhan china and the 91 nucleotide identity of the sars cov 2 with a pangolin cov 6 53 makes it a conjectured intermediate host 54 although this is far from certain and efforts are ongoing to find other candidate intermediate hosts apart from the search for the intermediate host studies have been made to identify animal species that could have been infected a chinese study examined antibody levels in pigs sheep horses chicken and ducks 55 and the results were negative however it is reported that diseased humans have transmitted the virus naturally to ferrets cats dogs tigers lion and minks 3 56 59 apart from minks farms there is no evidence so far that livestock for human consumption such as cows sheep and pigs have been infected in farms 60 this last point is rather important if it is considered that in the case of mers cov which belongs to coronaviridae beta subfamily like sars cov 2 but not to the subgenus sarbecovirus camels 61 62 were suspected to be possible reservoirs or intermediate hosts for successive outbreaks even raw milk and improperly cooked meat were discussed as potential sources of infection apart from the natural transmission of sars cov 2 virus from human to animals studies have reported of experimental inoculation of the virus to animals and study the possibility of transmission from animals and the transmission route by putting in the same cage infected and non infected animals and having other animals in another cage close to the first 63 66 this has demonstrated that ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to the virus whist dogs are less susceptible and livestock pigs sheep and ducks studied were not found to be susceptible it is to be noted that those tests were done on a limited number of animals so how representative they are of the species as a whole is not entirely known transmission back to humans was discussed by franklin et al 67 who raised the possibility of wild hosts in north america as a potential source of perpetuation of the pathogen in the environment damas et al 68 studied in silico the probabilities of a wide range of animals to get infected and ranked them in five levels from very low to very high based on the conservation of genes for 25 amino acids important in the binding of the virus to a putatively important receptor ace2 the ranking used the fact that the main receptor of sars cov 2 is the angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 ace2 their study on 410 vertebrates including 252 mammals could help identify potential animals that could be viral host from this they judged that only mammals fell into the categories of medium or higher risk in the meantime in the nederland on mink farms where minks had been found to be contaminated sequencing was done on samples taken from diseased farmers and while the topic is still under investigation the transmission from minks to human seems to have occurred 56 gollakner et al 69 underlined that although the data gathered so far does not allow definite conclusion of the possibility of a panzootic aspect for covid 19 allowance should be made for the possibility since there is shedding of the virus to the environment through sewage the question has been raised about the possibility of aquatic mammals to become contaminated 70 5 wastewater based epidemiology from the previous sections it was shown that sars cov 2 is found live in human feces and that it can be transmitted to animals which can also excrete it although the fecal oral transmission has still not been demonstrated precaution measures should be taken to minimize this possibility fig 3 summarizes the pathways that excreta from both human and animals can follow to potentially transmit the virus back to humans 71 sewage and then wastewater treatment plant wtt are at the center of this potential transmission route and wtt can play an important role in detection and control of sars cov 2 spread for the detection part wastewater based epidemiology wbe could be used wbe is a relatively new tool whose idea comes from the fact that relatively stable environmental contaminants that are released in the sewage system can be sampled and quantified it potentially provides real time information on wastewater contaminants 72 and was first used in 2001 to evaluate illicit drug usage 73 more recently wbe has been proposed for the early detection of viral outbreaks 74 82 as well as for the persistence of viral indicators in the aquatic environment 75 83 the methods used are high throughput rna sequencing rna seq more commonly than pcr qrt pcr 75 84 in 2019 o brien and xagoraraki 74 85 underlined the importance of wastewater data collection to understand spatial and temporal evolution of viral diseases in the case of sars cov 2 considering that the virus was found both in stool samples and wastewater as previously described several authors have proposed to use wbe as a tool to monitor the pandemic 41 76 80 86 100 thus medema et al 38 reported that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor sars cov 2 circulation in the population since it could be detected prior to symptoms being reported in the local population moreover monitoring of international airport sewage would allow very early detection of the entrance of the virus into a country wurtzer et al 36 even suggested that wastewater sample storage would allow detection of an outbreak retroactively to provide historic information of the spread of the virus in the present sars covid 2 outbreak it could have allowed the localization of the first patients and define which cities should be on lockdown instead of putting the lockdown on a whole country for example until now it was believed that the sars cov 2 outbreak in france started late january 2020 but sars cov 2 was detected retrospectively by rt pcr in samples from a patient admitted in intensive care in late december 2019 101 mao et al 102 proposed a small portable paper based device for the detection of sars cov 2 and hata and honda 91 provided information on the potential sensitivity of wastewater monitoring for sars cov 2 which is one diseased person in 100 000 6 wastewater treatment for virus removal the who 103 underlined in its interim guidance of april 23rd 2020 the importance of safely managing wastewater limiting the dissemination of the sars cov 2 into the environment is of great importance considering that several animals have already been identified as potential hosts and that reclaimed water could be used in irrigation gerba et al 104 reported the virus removal reduction factor that wastewater plants need to provide depending on the reclaimed water use for irrigation of edible crops they indicate a 6 log10 removal is sufficient whereas a 12 log10 removal would be needed to make the water potable the same removal targets have been reported by ahmed et al 105 in their 2020 article on recycled water safety wastewater treatment is a wide field and its full description is not the target of this review this section will focus on the literature containing techniques used for virus removal after presenting the model viruses that are used to evaluate the efficiency of wastewater virus removal treatment recently developed methods will be presented 6 1 model virus sars cov 2 is a potentially lethal virus to humans and some precautions need to be taken for scientific testing to be made thus the center for disease control and prevention cdc provides guidelines for biosafety and covid 19 106 for environment specimen testing the cdc defines that procedures that concentrate viruses such as precipitation or membrane filtration can be performed in a bsl 2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow and bsl 3 precautions as a result in general virus surrogates are used instead of dangerous pathogens the surrogate to be used depends on the experiment type to be handled for example to compare the virus concentration methods for wastewater testing murine hepatitis virus mhv has been used as a sars cov 2 surrogate 84 other animal coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus tgev and the feline infectious peritonitis virus fipv have also been used for testing the persistence and disinfection of human coronaviruses in water and wastewater 107 for safety reasons some laboratories are using the enveloped bacteriophage φ6 107 109 whose size is 85 nm 110 or the non enveloped escherichia virus ms2 109 111 122 whose size is 26 nm 123 124 however shirasaki et al 125 studied different virus models and they concluded that the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov which is a plant virus appears to be a suitable surrogate for human enteric virus whereas ms2 and φx174 are not pmmov has also been validated together with aiv 1 and tmv as surrogates of human enteric viruses for testing wastewater virus reduction 126 6 2 wastewater treatment pond systems wastewater treatment ponds are very common worldwide as they are the technically simplest way to handle wastewater verbyla and mihelcic 120 reviewed 71 different wastewater treatment pond systems for virus removal and concluded that one log10 reduction of virus content in water was achieved between 14 5 20 9 days considering the world health organization guidelines for wastewater reuse for irrigation a pathogen reduction of 6 7 log10 units is required 127 this target can be reached only by the combination of several methods ponds are used as primary treatment and there can be up to three treatment steps virus removal in pond treatment systems is not very well understood and depends on the particular characteristics of the pond including chemical composition and optical properties but the process seems to be a combination of sunlight mediated mechanisms and interactions of virus particles with other particulates including other microorganisms and sedimentation 120 6 3 uv inactivation and chlorine treatment qiu et al 128 reported the inactivation of human infectious virus at two wastewater plants they measured the reduction using qpcr on different virus types the mean log10 reduction they obtained was 1 2 and 1 8 simon et al 129 reported the use of chlorine and ultraviolet light disinfection against different viruses they obtained up to 2 5 3 log10 reduction lr on coliphage and e coli otherwise the lrs were in the range of 0 3 to 1 3 they observed that results are better on sand filtered samples uv inactivation and treatment with hypochlorite generally renders viruses inactive by damaging replicative machinery through oxidation processes 130 6 4 ozone treatment ozone is highly effective for the inactivation of many viruses a statement by the international ozone association ioa indicated that it was not aware of any research and testing that had been conducted specifically on the sars cov 2 coronavirus peer reviewed research has not yet been completed and therefore definitive conclusions cannot be made regarding ozone inactivation of sars cov 2 ioa statement on covid 19 2020 131 the us epa has published disinfection contact time ct values for virus inactivation by ozone in the surface water treatment rule swtr us epa 1989 132 to assess the disinfection efficiency in water treatment the ct concept is applied c represents the concentration of disinfectant ozone and t the contact time ct is the product of the disinfectant concentration and contact time sigmon et al 133 calculated ct values for specified log inactivation levels of a number of viruses and surrogates in wastewater at ph 7 6 and 16 c with log reduction values lrv for all viruses ranging from 0 56 for an lrv of 1 1 32 for an lrv of 1 32 133 these data indicated that all organisms were generally inactivated to 4 log at a ct of no more than 1 0 mg min l enteric viruses do not get proper inactivation in wastewater effluent discharged to the environment 134 as such effluent discharged from sewage treatment plants will have an elevated number of viruses 135 ozone has been used as a disinfectant instead of chlorine for the disinfection of sewage effluents used for irrigation of crops and for discharge to surface water due to the issue of high chlorine demand and problematic disinfectant byproducts 136 a study by perez rey et al 137 reported that selected microorganisms including four viruses three non sporulated bacteria two sporulated bacteria and one fungus were employed in vaccine preparation for animals viruses were the most readily inactivated microorganisms and sporulated bacteria the most resistant strains the inactivation followed a second order kinetic law depending on both ozone and microorganism concentration the conclusion of that study was total inactivation of microorganisms in wastewater is possible by ozone application a study by aydogan et al 138 indicated the effectiveness of ozone gas to inactivate bacillus subtilis spores which share the same physiological characteristics as bacillus anthracis spores that cause the anthrax disease increased humidity during the ozone application increased the rate of inactivation the city of montreal québec canada investigated three disinfection processes ozone uv and performic acid to improve wastewater treatment to reduce pharmaceuticals and endocrine chemicals in one of the primary treated effluents high flow system 139 the city of montreal municipal wastewater has the target criteria for coliforms of 9000 ufc 100 ml that needs to be met ozone treatment was found to be the most efficient of the three disinfection processes investigated in removing selected pharmaceutical products from lightly treated effluents 139 6 5 sand filters for virus removal sand filters are commonly used in wastewater treatment but they usually have less than one unit log10 virus removal they are used more for particle removal however samineni et al 112 developed functionalized sand filters using a water extract of moringa oleifera seeds then they tested the efficiency of the obtained sand using ms2 bacteriophage virus obtaining an impressive 7 log10 reduction in virus content the mechanism implies that ms2 has affinity for some components from the seeds and binds to it it also implies that the functionalized sand will progressively get saturated and will eventually have to be replaced or regenerated in some way 6 6 algal systems for virus removal delanka pedige et al 140 142 recently published three articles dealing with the use of algae for removing viruses in wastewater results obtained are in the same range as for activated sludge with log removal values in the range of 1 3 depending on the virus type they seem however to reduce the number of species more efficiently and thus reduce the need for chlorination mechanisms for viral removal in algae based wastewater treatment systems include sedimentation after viral particles have attached to algal biomass increased temperatures denaturing algal nucleic acids and proteins and sunlight mediated degradation 140 6 7 membranes use in wastewater treatment for virus removal water filtration membranes are categorized by their pore size and their distributions in four categories reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration and microfiltration fig 4 gives a representation of those pore sizes together with the main contaminants including viruses that can be found in water considering that sars cov 2 size is 100μm membranes such as reverse osmosis nanofiltration and ultrafiltration should be able to remove it goswani et al 143 reviewed the use of polymeric and ceramic membranes for virus removal from water the reported removal efficiencies were highly variable since the range reported was 0 2 7 this section will outline very recent literature showing the potential use of those membranes for sars cov 2 before considering microfiltration and membrane bioreactor technology 6 7 1 reverse osmosis wlodarczyk and kwarciak kozlowska 71 recently reviewed the treatment of waterborne pathogens by reverse osmosis they provide complete description of the type of pathogens that are waterborne which are divided in three different groups protozoans 5 100 μm bacteria 0 5 1 0 μm and viruses 0 01 0 1 μm as well as requirements for reverse osmosis membrane materials they indicated that reverse osmosis is seldom used to remove pathogens from water even if it is one of the techniques reported by the epa with indicative log removals above 6 this is because reverse osmosis is typically coupled with a pre treatment system often ultrafiltration to reduce foulants which may interfere with the reverse osmosis process however ro can be used in combination with such a suitable a pretreatment to remove particulate matter and post treatment to complete the removal of any remaining contaminants 145 prado et al 146 reported that membrane bioreactor reverse osmosis systems were providing virus removal efficiencies in the range of 2 3 2 9 log10 which is rather lower than what was reported by vickers et al 147 who used reverse osmosis for the removal of ms2 coliphage they obtained a nomimal 5 log10 removal without the mbr considering that ms2 is 27 μm in size which is roughly 60 times smaller than sars cov 2 the removal efficiency on the latter would be expected to be higher the same authors 148 also reported the use of sand anthracite filters and a membrane bioreactor reverse osmosis system for the removal of noroviruses which are non enveloped capsids of about 38 40 nm in diameter 149 in raw sewage the efficiency of the system led to a virus concentration below the detection level which would mean considering the initial virus concentration and the detection limit of the analysis a log10 removal higher than 6 or 7 6 7 2 nanofiltration pore sizes of nanofiltration membranes are generally less than 10 nm which is smaller than any virus presented in fig 1 150 although the literature on nanofiltration removal of viruses is not extensive several studies have been published which generate log removal rates for various viruses at between 3 and 8 151 155 6 7 3 ultrafiltration as ultrafiltration is often used as a pre treatment step prior to ro treatment its efficacy in removal of viruses is more widely reported in the scientific literature than for other membrane based technologies recently al aani et al 156 reviewed the use of ultrafiltration membranes for wastewater and water process engineering and report their use for bacteria and virus removal lee et al 117 used a combination of coagulation and ultrafiltration uf on a pilot scale for wastewater reclamation they improved removal of ms2 bacteriophage by optimizing the ph of the secondary effluent to a range of 5 6 depending on the effluent once improved the virus removal factor was in the 6 8 7 5 log10 range additionally to obtain a more stable transmembrane pressure an additional sedimentation step was required the ideal combination was a hybrid coagulation sedimentation uf system other researchers 157 used a polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane with average membrane pore sizes of 67 nm for the removal of the bacteriophage pp7 they studied the effect of ph in the range of 5 8 and modelled virus and membrane electrostatic interaction forces the log10 removal range obtained was in the 1 5 2 8 range depending on ionic strength divalent cations present in feed solutions were found to have a negative impact on the viral removal effectiveness compared with monovalent cations due to their modification of electrostatic interactions grafted zwitterionic polymer hydrogels were used by lu et al 158 for the modification of a 150 kda polyethersulfone membrane they studied the membrane efficiency on ms2 and hadv 2 human viruses the grafting reduced water permeability but provided a log10 removal in the 3 4 range a pore interconnectivity method of evaluation of asymmetric ultrafiltration membranes has been developed commercially specifically for virus removal 159 gold nanoparticles of different sizes were used and their capture by the membranes was visualized using sem it was found that membranes shown by this method to have poor pore interconnectivity were also membranes which had been previously shown to have significant loss of viral retention after process recovery whereas membranes shown to have better interconnectivity were more robust in terms of virus retention over a range of operating conditions 6 7 4 microfiltration since microfiltration membrane average pore sizes are larger than 100 nm they are more suited to the removal of protozoa and bacteria rather than the smaller viruses 160 however this only considers separation by sieving mechanisms sinclair et al 161 modified a microfiltration membranes using a cationic polymer they reached a 3 log10 ms2 reduction with the resulting membrane with only 22 reduction in flux they proposed such membranes for low pressure point of use water filtration due to the high water permeability of such membranes 6 7 5 membrane bioreactor o brien and xagoraraki reported that membrane bioreactors under the correct conditions are capable of a 7log10 reduction in virus concentration 162 from a comparison of a number of studies it was found that the presence of a biofilm on the membrane was important in virus removal efficiency where a biofilm whilst reducing water flux also restricted viral penetration of the membrane it was concluded that there must be a trade off between maintaining a biofilm to keep viral removal efficiency high with backwashing of the membrane to remove biofilm to maintain acceptable water fluxes they also concluded that model viruses do not necessarily show the same removal efficiency as viruses which are pathogenic to humans with data obtained using harmless bacteriophages likely to lead to overestimation of viral removal efficiencies for pathogenic viruses miura et al 163 investigated the removal of three virus families in a full scale membrane bioreactor plant the best results were obtained at ph4 with a log10 reduction range of 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 ceramic membranes im et al 122 164 first compared ozonation and coagulation as pretreatments for virus removal with a ceramic membrane they then used a combination of ozonation coagulation and ceramic membrane filtration for water reclamation they obtained on a pilot plant a 12 log10 removal factor of ms2 the use of hydrophobic ceramic capillary membranes for virus removal was reported by bartels et al 165 they functionalized ceramic membranes with hexyl or octyl triethoxysilanes in order to increase hydrophobic surface properties without functionalization they obtained log10 removal in the range of 0 3 3 4 for the bacteriophages ms2 and phix174 whereas after functionalization the log10 removal was around 9 this increase in removal efficiency was due to favorable virus treated membrane surface interactions primarily due to hydrophobic interactions which lead to adsorption of viruses to the membrane material presumably such membranes would potentially be subjected to a sufficiently high saturation of viral concentration thus necessitating cleaning in line coagulation with ceramic membrane filtration for the removal of the bacteriophage qβ was investigated by wattanachira et al 166 the coagulant they used is polyaluminum chloride they underlined that they had to adjust coagulant dosage with virus concentration overall they obtained 6 7 log10 virus removal under optimal conditions 6 7 7 nanomaterials the use of nanomaterials to remove and de activate viruses in wastewater is a broad field and includes the use of fullerenes photocatalysts and membranes incorporating nanomaterials such as cnts tio2 and zvis 167 169 for instance kim et al 170 reported that silver multiwall nanotubes ag mwcnt used in a nanocomposite filter system reached a 100 removal for several different viruses 170 domaga et al 113 studied cu2o mwcnts filters for ms2 virus removal from water one of their three samples reached a 7 log10 reduction in ms2 at ph5 nemeth et al 171 used a cu2o coated mwcnt membrane and obtained a 4 log10 ms2 removal in a ph range of 5 9 kuo et al 115 obtained a 7 log10 reduction on three viruses qβ bacteriophage ms2 bacteriophage and aichi virus with smectic liquid crystalline ionic membranes 6 8 integrity testing techniques and imperfection fixing for the reverse osmosis nano filtration and ultra filtration membranes to efficiently remove viruses their integrity has to be optimal for instance membranes may contain defect obtained during manufacture or may suffer mechanical damage during use from high hydraulic operating pressures or scouring by particulates in the feed water a number of reviews are found in the literature for techniques to assess the integrity and structure property relationships of separation membranes including by wang et al 172 ostarcevic et al 144 and pype et al 173 high pressure membranes are only credited at 2 log10 virus removal by regulatory agencies whereas in the sections above articles were presented where it reached as high as 7 log10 this difference is due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive detection technologies available industrially 174 frenkel and cohen 175 proposed new techniques for real time monitoring of reverse osmosis membrane integrity for virus removal they proposed a pulsed marker membrane integrity monitoring system the potentials and limitations of this type of fluorescent based technique was then investigated by yoon 174 who managed to obtain a sensitivity level at the 4 log10 level then niewersch et al 176 proposed a solution diffusion imperfection model with a decision tree for diagnosis to help monitor the integrity of membranes which was capable of identifying the types of imperfections present in a particular membrane under study for ultrafiltration khahnstover et al 177 published a comparison of different methods that can be used to assess integrity and separation efficiency nanoparticle counting was found to be the most sensitive method overall in terms of lowest lrv values reported as a solution to imperfections in nanoscale membranes suzuki et al 178 proposed to use a small volume of aqueous polyvinyl alcohol to selectively plug imperfections these plugs were then stabilized through exposures to citric acid sodium hydroxide and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 7 conclusions sars cov 2 is a virus that emerged at the end of 2019 in china and generated a pandemic of covid 19 within a few months initially thought to affect only the respiratory system it was soon proven to be also gastrointestinal then the environmental implication is that sars cov 2 is shed into the sewage system and thus reaches wastewater treatment plants when existing or more globally the aquatic environment sars cov 2 has also been proven to be transmitted from humans to animals which can potentially be a virus reservoir considering the possibility of sars cov 2 being a panzoonotic it becomes even more important to limit sars cov 2 spread into the environment wastewater treatment plants could be a solution for the early detection of the disease in an area through the development of a wastewater based epidemiology plan it could also be used as a decision helper for lockdown application or removal after reporting some of the virus models that can be used to characterize virus removal efficiency a wide range of recently developed wastewater treatments were presented this include some classical and advanced technologies treatments ozone uv etc and numerous membrane based systems as a general rule it is the combination of different techniques in primary secondary and tertiary treatments that would allow enough virus removal to limit the possibility of environment contamination the sars cov 2 pandemic should develop a global awareness that solutions have to be found for improving the wastewater treatment even in developing countries due to the possibility of its spread through the aquatic environment from inadequately treated waste water sars cov 2 transmission through the fecal oral route is not predominant but considering that it is the third new coronavirus to evolve to a pandemic in less than twenty years preparations should be made for the possibility of a virus pandemic more readily transmissible through this route considering the economic costs of the present pandemic greater efforts to improve wastewater treatment specifically with the removal or inactivation of viral contaminants on a global scale should be an urgent priority declaration of competing interest the authors of this manuscript declare that there is no conflict of interest 
13758,the discharge of high toxic contaminations of heavy metals and dyes to water resources has posed severe problems for the eco system and human health in this work electrospun nanofibrous membranes of cellulose acetate containing fillers of graphene oxide go magnetite nanoparticles mnps or hydroxyapatite hap were fabricated it was shown that the membranes were configured in randomly oriented fibers with diameters around 0 11 0 35 μm and 0 66 1 23 μm 0 14 0 33 μm and 0 6 0 89 μm 0 17 0 37 μm and 0 91 4 57 μm 0 18 0 53 μm and 1 18 2 1 μm and 0 11 0 29 μm for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the observed surface roughness tends to be promoted upon supplementations as the roughness average ra increased from 31 3 nm to 52 nm for ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the estimated toughness indicated that values increased from pristine ca reaching to its highest one at mnps ca as 2 5 0 2 mj m3 to 8 2 0 5 mj m3 respectively the se iv and cr vi removal from aqueous solutions using the nanofibrous membranes was examined upon the time and ph value of the media the removal efficiency for se iv has improved from 89 3 at ph 4 96 for go mnps hap ca moreover cr vi removal progressed from 86 7 86 3 89 9 90 6 and 92 9 at ph 4 89 8 90 5 94 1 94 7 and 97 3 at ph 8 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the degradation of methylene blue mb was investigated and reached its highest value of 95 1 for go mnps hap ca after 35 min of continuous irradiation under visible light keywords nanofibers membrane water filtration heavy metal dye removal 1 introduction the recent industrial development in the world has caused severe environmental problems 1 3 besides the lack of clean water due to the increasing population has encouraged the researchers to find alternative strategies to decrease the deficiency of clean water 4 7 this might be carried out in two lines minimizing the pollutant elements and remediation of the wastewater 8 9 two main types of chemical pollutants might be accompanied by drinking water due to their connection with factories 10 13 this includes heavy metal elements such as cd ii cu ii fe ii pb ii se iv cr vi co ii etc and chemical dyes such as methylene blue methyl orange tartrazine and amaranth etc 14 18 it should be mentioned that these contaminations cause high risk illnesses including deterioration of kidney functions and even cancer tissue formation 19 21 in recent years numerous approaches have been developed to remove both dyes and heavy metal from aqueous solutions such as adsorption electrochemical technology ion exchange membrane filtration and zero valent metals reduction 22 24 however most of these techniques have their disadvantages which may limit its utilization 10 11 for instance due to the low cost simplicity good productivity of the adsorption technique it has been used widely 25 27 however most sorbents are challenging to be recovered after utilization and thus may hinder their widespread usages in large applications furthermore even though heavy metals might be preferred to be removed using one technique dyes may be preferred to be removed via different ones 28 therefore manipulation of a new composition has to be able to clean aqueous solutions from dyes and heavy metals in high demand 29 different characteristics should be included in these suggested materials such as facile recovery and high reusability one of the most facile methods that have been used for dye degradation is photocatalysis it is based on photo electron generation through a material with moderate band gab such as semi conductors 30 32 the advantage behind this technique is the feasibility of solar irradiation whereas the disadvantage is referred to as that most used material has high bandgap and thus ultraviolet uv represents around 4 of the total solar spectra energy is required to generate superficies electrons 33 therefore the selection of a specific material that displays the ability to degenerate dyes under visible light is required heavy metals could be removed effectively via the absorption technique 34 36 this requires a highly porous substance to act as a mat that possesses a high surface to volume ratio 37 38 designing a permeable photocatalytic agent for both dye and heavy metal removal might be done via hybridization of inorganic polymeric composition 39 41 different configurations are suggested to combine inorganic and polymeric such as thin films via spin coating however producing a nanofibrous membrane based on a polymer involving an inorganic phase is might be preferred additionally the electrospinning technique is a facile eco friendly low coasted method to obtain nanofibers with a high ratio of porosity furthermore mechanical properties hydrophilicity chemical stability and surface morphology of nanofibrous membranes could be tailored for the specific utilization the manipulation might be controlled by variation of the preparation conditions including the ratio of inorganic to organic phases viscosity types of constituents besides the electrospinning system parameters numerous numbers of polymers were used for water purification applications cellulose acetate ca is a low crystalline polymer and it has been used for a lot of biomedical applications due to its biocompatibility high strength and chemical stability besides its high capacity for drug carrying 42 however its low mechanical resistance towards stresses may inhibit its bioactivity and thus hinder its applications therefore modification of this property can be done via the addition of an inorganic agent graphene oxide go is a 2d carbon based constituent with sp2 hybridization 43 44 it possesses high surface area good electrical conductivity mechanical resistance chemical and thermal stability 45 moreover the go surface is modified with oxygen containing groups these oxyanions introduce the high activity of go via facilitating electrons transfer towards the ambient environment thus the interaction between go and milieu might be encouraged and hence the hydrophilic trend is expected to be displayed 14 go acts as a mat for different inorganic metal oxides via transferring their ionic carriers towards the accompanied dye 22 it could be reported that interaction with dyes is suggested to be encouraged via different scenarios including electrostatic attraction the formation of hydrogen bonding besides van der waals forces and hydrophobic trends 46 47 metal oxide such as magnetite nanoparticles mnps fe3o4 has been used intensively for water applications owing to its biocompatibility low cytotoxicity and chemical stability 48 49 furthermore its magnetic properties facilitate its recovery after utilization and thus its reuse hydroxyapatite hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 is one of the most attractive bioceramics that has been used for versatile applications involving clinical utilization gas sensing and water filtration 50 52 it possesses high biocompatibility due to its similarity to the mineral part of bone tissue besides its low toxicity thermal and chemical stability 53 56 moreover it has been displayed high potency in heavy metal removal via ionic exchange mechanism 32 57 58 this could be explained via postulating that cationic metals such as pd ii se iv or cr vi are preferred to replace crystallographic sites of ca ii within hap lattice structure while crystal system still remains 59 61 consequently this work aims to investigate the effectiveness of the electrospun nanofibrous membrane of ca modified via different additives such as go mnps and hap the structural morphological and roughness consequences were investigated whereas the efficiency of these compositions for heavy metal and dye removal from aqueous solutions were examined 2 synthesis and characterization 2 1 synthesis of nanofibrous membranes graphene oxide go was synthesized using a modified hummers method 14 pure magnetic nanoparticles mnps were synthesized using the co precipitation method briefly 0 2 m of fecl3 0 6h2o and 0 1 m of fecl2 4h2o were dissolved in 50 ml volumes separately then a flow of ar gas was passed through the fe ii solution for 20 min next the solutions of fe iii was added into the fe ii solution then the ph value of the total solution was raised to be around 11 while the bubbling of argon gas still working besides the stirring vigorously the obtained gel was separated using a filtration system washed several times using water and ethanol and dried at 50 60 c for 12 h on the other hand hap was synthesized using the co precipitation method 62 64 0 5 m of cacl2 2h2o and 0 3 m of nh4h po4 were prepared individually then p solution was dropped wisely into ca one whereas ph value was kept at 11 0 1 while stirring is working the obtained gel was washed and dried using a drier furnace around 50 60 c the nanofibrous membranes were fabricated as follows 10 g of ca was dissolved in 100 ml of the acetone to prepare a ca solution 10 then 5 bottles containing 10 ml of ca 8 for each one were prepared the first bottle was not received any additional powder pristine ca then 100 mg of go mnps hap were added individually for the next three bottles the 5th bottle was received supplementations containing 27 5 mg of go 27 5 mg of mnps and 27 5 mg of hap totally then the obtained viscous gel was transferred to the syringe pump of the electrospinning system to be processed the operating parameters of the electrospun process are voltage of 18 0 1 kv injection rate of 1 ml h distance gap between the electrode and the wall is 16 cm the syringe needle is 22φ the flow chart of the synthesis process is shown in fig 1 2 2 xrd measurements x ray diffraction xrd analyses were performed on the as synthesized nanofibers to explore the phase composition it was carried out using panalytical x pert pro with monochromatized cu kα radiation λ 1 5404 å with a step size of 0 02 and 0 5 s step time over the range of 5 2θ 70 2 3 particle morphology and roughness investigation the surface morphology was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quanta feg250 netherlands the obtained micrographs from fesem were processed with gwyddion 2 45 software to study their surface roughness behavior with a resolution of 1450 950 pixels 32 50 58 2 4 heavy metal removing experiments the removal of se iv and cr vi ions from aqueous solution was tested through a batch experiment using nanofibrous membranes as an adsorbent both contact time and ph values of the absorbed media were taken into consideration the atomic absorption measurements were done for selenium oxide solution and chromium nitrate at ph ranged from 4 to 8 the removal efficiency could be estimated as 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c f c 0 100 co and cf are the initial and final concentrations mg l respectively the removal effectiveness dependency on the ph value was established with fixed concentrations as 250 mg of the nanofibrous membrane 25 ppm for both se iv and cr vi ions and 4 h of contact time the effect of contact time was examined under conditions of 250 mg of the nanofibrous membrane 25 ppm for both se iv and cr vi ions and ph value of 6 2 5 photocatalytic set up the solution of methylene blue mb was adjusted at 5 ppm then around 250 mg of each membrane was added into each container of mb 10 ml individually the illumination system used a visible light spectrum 500 w in a closed box after irradiation 3 ml was taken off from the mb solution at the time intervals to be scanned via a spectrophotometer the degradation efficiency is estimated via the expression 65 67 2 t h e d e g r a d a t i o n e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c t c 0 100 co and ct are the starting and the final concentration at a time t the used spectra were recorded on a double beam spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1208 model after the decomposition of mb the precipitated powder was centrifuged to repeat the experiment to examine the recyclability 68 70 3 results and discussion 3 1 phase identification fig 2 displays the xrd patterns of ca nanofibrous membranes supplemented with go mnps hap along with the multi additive one of go mnps hap the characteristic peaks at 2θ 15 06 and 17 34 could be assigned to a semi crystalline structure of ca while the peak of 23 18 refers to the amorphous phase of ca 71 these high diffraction peaks refer to the semi crystallinity behavior of ca the lower intensity reflections could be assigned to the other constituents it was shown that the mnps are indexed upon the icdd card no 01 088 0315 with cubic symmetry upon the peaks of 43 1 53 6 57 1 whereas hap was crystalized in hexagonal structure upon the icdd card no 01 073 0293 72 3 2 morphological behavior the surface morphology of nanofibrous membranes is pivotal in reactions with the surrounding atmosphere fig 3 a e illustrates the progression of surface morphology upon the compositional variation the pristine ca is shown in fig 3a as interconnected network with diameters might be classified into two groups 0 11 0 35 μm and 0 66 1 23 μm the fibers tend to be branched in a non oriented form with a high content of micro porous whereas the surface seems to be smooth the membrane of go ca is shown in fig 3b the surface seems to be formed as nanofibers with diameters about 0 14 0 33 μm and 0 6 0 89 μm whereas go nanosheets are incorporated through a network with wavy structure and high dimensions porosity ratio and surface roughness look to be developed than the former composition fig 3c displays the morphological progression of mnps ca as an interconnected network with diameters 0 17 0 37 μm and 0 91 4 57 μm the fibers tend to be branched intensively which encourages higher connectivity then the former one while porosity is noticed to be moderate the incorporation of hap into ca is shown in fig 3d it was configured as a non homogenous networked membrane with diameters around 0 18 0 53 μm and 1 18 2 1 μm nanofibers are highly branched and connected the supplementation of ternary phases of go mnps hap into ca nanofibrous membranes are shown in fig 3e the nanofibers membrane is formed in non oriented fibers with narrow size distribution around 0 11 0 29 μm nanofibers tend to be branched from intensive grains with dimensions in the range of 4 57 5 71 μm these grains might be assigned to the presence of go nanosheets moreover the high content of intra granular porosity could be observed through go grains rather than intergranular ones which were detected for the former compositions it could be noticed that while the go phase was detected obviously through the membranes both mnps and hap were not detected this behavior is assigned to the ability of ca to involve mnps or hap owing to their relatively small size nano scale compared with wide sheets micro scale the development of surface roughness according to the compositional variation is shown in fig 4 a e and roughness parameters are reported in table 1 it could be noticed that the roughness average ra increased with the additions from 31 3 to 46 nm and 52 nm for pure ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively furthermore the development of the root means square roughness rq values follow ra approximately it could be observed that the maximum height of the roughness rt displayed highly relative values than the maximum roughness valley depth rv for the same compositions this indicates that the peaks are predominant in roughness formation than notches these peaks act as a hook for the ambient molecules and thus encourage interlocking behavior which is classified as physical adhesion this configuration seems to result from preparation conditions the surface defects also represent a great source of roughness via formation of active sites and thus may encourage chemical interactions with the milieu 23 59 it could be stated that types of additions that able to be involved entirely through the fiber may induce the formation of crystallographic defects such as mnps and hap in contrast large particles that prefer to be accompanied through the fibers network promote the physical adhesion 31 53 both types could be tailored via both preparation conditions and compositional contents 3 3 mechanical properties the sustainability of the membrane under stresses indicates its life span therefore the mechanical properties of these membranes were carried out as obvious in fig 5 while the estimated parameters of mechanical responses are reported in table 2 the fracture strength is noticed to be enhanced significantly upon the compositional variation starting with 6 0 0 4 mpa reaching 14 2 0 9 mpa and its highest one of 15 3 1 2 mpa for ca mnps ca and go mnps hap ca respectively furthermore the maximum strain at break is fluctuating from 59 8 2 3 achieving 96 4 4 1 and finally 60 3 3 4 for ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the capacity of absorbed energy before the break of membrane refers to the toughness which has been significantly varied upon the changing of composition it was increased from 2 5 0 2 mj m3 to its highest value of 8 2 0 5 mj m3 and then deteriorated to 5 5 0 3 mj m3 for ca mnps ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the high dependency of mechanical properties on the compositional changes refers to the ability of the latter to control the grains distribution size and configuration the ability of carbon bonds belongs to go 2d nanosheets to be stretched without fracture for high stresses promote the resistance against breakage while the rod shapes of hap induce high cohesiveness of the nanofibers and thus higher elasticity moreover mnps are postulated to be formed in a spherical shape thus a break is done via crack propagation which is provoked by slipping of dislocations therefore filling of a nanofibrous membrane with inorganic substances with non preferred crystallographic orientation may inhibit slipping motion hence the development of resistance against crack propagation might be promoted 3 4 effect of ph value and contact time on se iv and cr vi removal the ability of nanofibrous membranes to absorb heavy metal cations from aqueous solutions was investigated fig 6 a b displays the removal effectiveness η for se iv and cr vi upon the variation of ph value of the aqueous solution after 4 h of exposure to nanofibrous membranes whereas data are reported in table s1 it was shown that for se iv removal increasing ph value leads to deterioration of removal efficiency for pristine ca from 71 at ph 4 reaching 68 3 at ph 8 furthermore the supplemented membranes showed high potencies η had been improved from 79 5 84 8 85 9 and 89 3 at ph 4 reaching 85 8 91 2 92 1 and 96 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively according to cr vi removal behavior η was growing slightly for pure ca while it was progressed significantly for filling ones moreover it increased upon the type of filler in other words η of cr vi increased from 86 7 86 3 89 9 90 6 and 92 9 at ph 4 89 8 90 5 94 1 94 7 and 97 3 at ph 8 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the growth of η upon the compositional change reflects the effect of filler contribution for instance pristine ca may remove ions via the absorption mechanism at the same time those containing mnps or hap can add another mechanism denoted ionic exchange whereas hap crystal contains ten crystallographic positions for ca ii those sites prefer to be replaced with cationic ions 73 75 increasing the charge of ion may offer van der walls attraction force towards inorganic molecules the higher capacity of hap compared with mnps explains the relatively high efficiency that accompanied by hap ca it might be mentioned that the absorption mechanism is based on the content and the surface to volume ratio of porosity content 33 76 the addition of go introduces a porous surface while the modification by other inorganic molecules contributes to the creation of high content of crystallographic defects the latter behavior may add to the ionic exchange mechanism another prospected mechanism might be added to degenerate se iv and cr vi ions which is ionic reduction in contrast those ions possess a high tendency to be reduced into their lower ionic states such as se ii and cr iii 48 49 the latter ions are reported to be much safe than the former ones the ionic concentration through the aqueous solution indicates the ionic strength of that pollutant therefore lowering of this content might increase the effectiveness of removal procedure because the high content of ions is expected to accelerate saturation of the porous surface of membranes consequently it might be stated that the main mechanism to remove se iv and cr vi ions is the absorbance one which might be encouraged via the porosity of nanofibers however versatile mechanisms can act partially to facilitate ionic removal involving ionic exchange and reduction the dependency of removal efficiency upon the time is shown in fig 6 c d while data are reported in table s2 it was shown that increasing time of experiment promoted a slight change of η starting from 83 1 84 9 88 9 89 5 and 92 4 after 2 h of exposure reaching 84 6 85 5 91 1 91 2 and 93 4 after 24 h for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively in case of se iv ions this stability of η indicates that porosity has been saturated exponentially owing to their feasibility and fast reactions 3 5 dye removal efficiency the effectiveness to degrade methylene blue mb in aqueous solutions using nanofibrous membranes of ca containing different fillers including go mnps or hap was investigated under visible light as shown in fig 7 a h the absorption spectra of mb are noticed to be deteriorated significantly upon the irradiation time moreover the removal effectiveness of mb from aqueous solution using nanofibrous membranes achieved around 92 9 93 3 93 8 89 6 and 95 1 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively after 35 min of continuous exposure to visible light the kinetics parameters for the photocatalytic proceeding obeys to the pseudo first order kinetics formula as 77 78 3 l n c c o k a p p t where kapp min 1 denotes the rate of the apparent belongs to the pseudo first order constant if the term l n c c o was plotted on y axis and time t on the x axis a straight line will be obtained with slope indicates the value of kapp as mentioned in table 3 while calculations of c co and ln c co are reported in tables s3 and s4 from table 3 it could be noticed that kapp value is slightly varied upon the compositional changes it started from 6 95 10 2 min 1 for pristine ca reaching 7 03 10 2 min 1 for go mnps hap ca whilst the r2 constant was around 0 885 which refers to the good fitting the degradation of mb through aqueous solutions via nanofibrous membranes could be explained by supposing that both absorption and photocatalytic are working simultaneously the surface of pristine ca could not be provoked to eject free charge carriers via photons however its high content of porosity may introduce a facile technique to collect mb molecules 79 81 supplementation of go introduces a conductive mat that facilitates photo electron generation through oxygen containing groups belonging to go 82 83 the produced charges may promote the formation of reduced oxygen species ros which have the upper hand to degenerate dye molecules 84 85 the addition of mnps or hap induce a form of electrons that could be transferred through the bonding system and thus inhibit recombination and hence interaction with dye molecules 14 86 88 the configured free radicles such as superoxide anion scavengers o 2 and hydroxyl ion o h are classified as the most effective ions towards dyes 82 83 one of the most valuable parameters to determine the economic feasibility of nanofibrous membranes is their recyclability trend it was reported that using fiber mats guarantees their recovery after utilization 48 49 as shown in fig 7h it is evident that the efficiencies have decreased slightly after multi usage reaching 84 3 85 4 86 3 82 3 and 88 3 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively after 5 cycles the slight deterioration of efficiency after 5 cycles indicates the high stability of these membranes to be used for dye removal utilizations 4 conclusion nanofibrous membranes of cellulose acetate ca containing different supplemented fillers including go mnps or hap was fabricated the as synthesized membranes were formed as non oriented network with diameters 0 11 0 35 μm and 0 66 1 23 μm 0 14 0 33 μm and 0 6 0 89 μm 0 17 0 37 μm and 0 91 4 57 μm 0 18 0 53 μm and 1 18 2 1 μm and 0 11 0 29 μm for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively a high content of interconnected porosity is observed through the membranes the surface roughness is provoked via compositional variation whereas the roughness average ra increased 31 3 nm to 52 nm for ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the mechanical properties upon changing of filling type were investigated fracture strength started from 6 0 0 4 mpa reaching 14 2 0 9 and 15 3 1 2 mpa for ca mnps ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the potency of heavy metal removal against se iv and cr vi was investigated upon variation of ph value and contact time it was shown that η for se iv has improved from 79 5 84 8 85 9 and 89 3 at ph 4 reaching 85 8 91 2 92 1 and 96 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the removal of methylene blue mb from aqueous solution was examined and reached 92 9 93 3 93 8 89 6 and 95 1 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively after 35 min of continuous irradiation under visible light therefore manipulating of nanofibrous membranes for water filtration applications could be tailored via electrospun technique based on a compositional variation declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest acknowledgment this project was funded by the deanship of scientific

13758,the discharge of high toxic contaminations of heavy metals and dyes to water resources has posed severe problems for the eco system and human health in this work electrospun nanofibrous membranes of cellulose acetate containing fillers of graphene oxide go magnetite nanoparticles mnps or hydroxyapatite hap were fabricated it was shown that the membranes were configured in randomly oriented fibers with diameters around 0 11 0 35 μm and 0 66 1 23 μm 0 14 0 33 μm and 0 6 0 89 μm 0 17 0 37 μm and 0 91 4 57 μm 0 18 0 53 μm and 1 18 2 1 μm and 0 11 0 29 μm for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the observed surface roughness tends to be promoted upon supplementations as the roughness average ra increased from 31 3 nm to 52 nm for ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the estimated toughness indicated that values increased from pristine ca reaching to its highest one at mnps ca as 2 5 0 2 mj m3 to 8 2 0 5 mj m3 respectively the se iv and cr vi removal from aqueous solutions using the nanofibrous membranes was examined upon the time and ph value of the media the removal efficiency for se iv has improved from 89 3 at ph 4 96 for go mnps hap ca moreover cr vi removal progressed from 86 7 86 3 89 9 90 6 and 92 9 at ph 4 89 8 90 5 94 1 94 7 and 97 3 at ph 8 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the degradation of methylene blue mb was investigated and reached its highest value of 95 1 for go mnps hap ca after 35 min of continuous irradiation under visible light keywords nanofibers membrane water filtration heavy metal dye removal 1 introduction the recent industrial development in the world has caused severe environmental problems 1 3 besides the lack of clean water due to the increasing population has encouraged the researchers to find alternative strategies to decrease the deficiency of clean water 4 7 this might be carried out in two lines minimizing the pollutant elements and remediation of the wastewater 8 9 two main types of chemical pollutants might be accompanied by drinking water due to their connection with factories 10 13 this includes heavy metal elements such as cd ii cu ii fe ii pb ii se iv cr vi co ii etc and chemical dyes such as methylene blue methyl orange tartrazine and amaranth etc 14 18 it should be mentioned that these contaminations cause high risk illnesses including deterioration of kidney functions and even cancer tissue formation 19 21 in recent years numerous approaches have been developed to remove both dyes and heavy metal from aqueous solutions such as adsorption electrochemical technology ion exchange membrane filtration and zero valent metals reduction 22 24 however most of these techniques have their disadvantages which may limit its utilization 10 11 for instance due to the low cost simplicity good productivity of the adsorption technique it has been used widely 25 27 however most sorbents are challenging to be recovered after utilization and thus may hinder their widespread usages in large applications furthermore even though heavy metals might be preferred to be removed using one technique dyes may be preferred to be removed via different ones 28 therefore manipulation of a new composition has to be able to clean aqueous solutions from dyes and heavy metals in high demand 29 different characteristics should be included in these suggested materials such as facile recovery and high reusability one of the most facile methods that have been used for dye degradation is photocatalysis it is based on photo electron generation through a material with moderate band gab such as semi conductors 30 32 the advantage behind this technique is the feasibility of solar irradiation whereas the disadvantage is referred to as that most used material has high bandgap and thus ultraviolet uv represents around 4 of the total solar spectra energy is required to generate superficies electrons 33 therefore the selection of a specific material that displays the ability to degenerate dyes under visible light is required heavy metals could be removed effectively via the absorption technique 34 36 this requires a highly porous substance to act as a mat that possesses a high surface to volume ratio 37 38 designing a permeable photocatalytic agent for both dye and heavy metal removal might be done via hybridization of inorganic polymeric composition 39 41 different configurations are suggested to combine inorganic and polymeric such as thin films via spin coating however producing a nanofibrous membrane based on a polymer involving an inorganic phase is might be preferred additionally the electrospinning technique is a facile eco friendly low coasted method to obtain nanofibers with a high ratio of porosity furthermore mechanical properties hydrophilicity chemical stability and surface morphology of nanofibrous membranes could be tailored for the specific utilization the manipulation might be controlled by variation of the preparation conditions including the ratio of inorganic to organic phases viscosity types of constituents besides the electrospinning system parameters numerous numbers of polymers were used for water purification applications cellulose acetate ca is a low crystalline polymer and it has been used for a lot of biomedical applications due to its biocompatibility high strength and chemical stability besides its high capacity for drug carrying 42 however its low mechanical resistance towards stresses may inhibit its bioactivity and thus hinder its applications therefore modification of this property can be done via the addition of an inorganic agent graphene oxide go is a 2d carbon based constituent with sp2 hybridization 43 44 it possesses high surface area good electrical conductivity mechanical resistance chemical and thermal stability 45 moreover the go surface is modified with oxygen containing groups these oxyanions introduce the high activity of go via facilitating electrons transfer towards the ambient environment thus the interaction between go and milieu might be encouraged and hence the hydrophilic trend is expected to be displayed 14 go acts as a mat for different inorganic metal oxides via transferring their ionic carriers towards the accompanied dye 22 it could be reported that interaction with dyes is suggested to be encouraged via different scenarios including electrostatic attraction the formation of hydrogen bonding besides van der waals forces and hydrophobic trends 46 47 metal oxide such as magnetite nanoparticles mnps fe3o4 has been used intensively for water applications owing to its biocompatibility low cytotoxicity and chemical stability 48 49 furthermore its magnetic properties facilitate its recovery after utilization and thus its reuse hydroxyapatite hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 is one of the most attractive bioceramics that has been used for versatile applications involving clinical utilization gas sensing and water filtration 50 52 it possesses high biocompatibility due to its similarity to the mineral part of bone tissue besides its low toxicity thermal and chemical stability 53 56 moreover it has been displayed high potency in heavy metal removal via ionic exchange mechanism 32 57 58 this could be explained via postulating that cationic metals such as pd ii se iv or cr vi are preferred to replace crystallographic sites of ca ii within hap lattice structure while crystal system still remains 59 61 consequently this work aims to investigate the effectiveness of the electrospun nanofibrous membrane of ca modified via different additives such as go mnps and hap the structural morphological and roughness consequences were investigated whereas the efficiency of these compositions for heavy

on the other hand hap was synthesized using the co precipitation method 62 64 0 5 m of cacl2 2h2o and 0 3 m of nh4h po4 were prepared individually then p solution was dropped wisely into ca one whereas ph value was kept at 11 0 1 while stirring is working the obtained gel was washed and dried using a drier furnace around 50 60 c the nanofibrous membranes were fabricated as follows 10 g of ca was dissolved in 100 ml of the acetone to prepare a ca solution 10 then 5 bottles containing 10 ml of ca 8 for each one were prepared the first bottle was not received any additional powder pristine

homogenous networked membrane with diameters around 0 18 0 53 μm and 1 18 2 1 μm nanofibers are highly branched and connected the supplementation of ternary phases of go mnps hap into ca nanofibrous membranes are shown in fig 3e the nanofibers membrane is formed in non oriented fibers with narrow size distribution around 0 11 0 29 μm nanofibers tend to be branched from intensive grains with dimensions in the range of 4 57 5 71 μm these grains might be assigned to the presence of go nanosheets moreover the high content of intra granular porosity could be observed through go grains rather than intergranular ones which were detected for the former compositions it could be noticed that while the go phase was detected obviously through the membranes both mnps and hap were not detected this behavior is assigned to the ability of ca to involve mnps or hap owing to their relatively small size nano scale compared with wide sheets micro scale the development of surface roughness according to the compositional variation is shown in fig 4 a e and roughness parameters are reported in table 1 it could be noticed that the roughness average ra increased with the additions from 31 3 to 46 nm and 52 nm for pure ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively furthermore the development of the root means square roughness rq values follow ra approximately it could be observed that the maximum height of the roughness rt displayed highly relative values than the maximum roughness valley depth rv for the same compositions this indicates that the peaks are predominant in roughness formation than notches these peaks act as a hook for the ambient molecules and thus encourage interlocking behavior which is classified as physical adhesion this configuration seems to result from preparation conditions the surface defects also represent a great source of roughness via formation of active sites and thus may encourage chemical interactions with the milieu 23 59 it could be stated that types of additions that able to be involved entirely through the fiber may induce the formation of crystallographic defects such as mnps and hap in contrast large particles that prefer to be accompanied through the fibers network promote the physical adhesion 31 53 both types could be tailored via both preparation conditions and compositional contents 3 3 mechanical properties the sustainability of the membrane under stresses indicates its life span therefore the mechanical properties of these membranes were carried out as obvious in fig 5 while the estimated parameters of mechanical responses are reported in table 2 the fracture strength is noticed to be enhanced significantly upon the compositional variation starting with 6 0 0 4 mpa reaching 14 2 0 9 mpa and its highest one of 15 3 1 2 mpa for ca mnps ca and go mnps hap ca respectively furthermore the maximum strain at break is fluctuating from 59 8 2 3 achieving 96 4 4 1 and finally 60 3 3 4 for ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the capacity of absorbed energy before the break of membrane refers to the toughness which has been significantly varied upon the changing of composition it was increased from 2 5 0 2 mj m3 to its highest value of 8 2 0 5 mj m3 and then deteriorated to 5 5 0 3 mj m3 for ca mnps ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the high dependency of mechanical properties on the compositional changes refers to the ability of the latter to control the grains distribution size and configuration the ability of carbon bonds belongs to go 2d nanosheets to be stretched without fracture for high stresses promote the resistance against breakage while the rod shapes of hap induce high cohesiveness of the nanofibers and thus higher elasticity moreover mnps are postulated to be formed in a spherical shape thus a break is done via crack propagation which is provoked by slipping of dislocations therefore filling of a nanofibrous membrane with inorganic substances with non preferred crystallographic orientation may inhibit slipping motion hence the development of resistance against crack propagation might be promoted 3 4 effect of ph value and contact time on se iv and cr vi removal the ability of nanofibrous membranes to absorb heavy metal cations from aqueous solutions was investigated fig 6 a b displays the removal effectiveness η for se iv and cr vi upon the variation of ph value of the aqueous solution after 4 h of exposure to nanofibrous membranes whereas data are reported in table s1 it was shown that for se iv removal increasing ph value leads to deterioration of removal efficiency for pristine ca from 71 at ph 4 reaching 68 3 at ph 8 furthermore the supplemented membranes showed high potencies η had been improved from 79 5 84 8 85 9 and 89 3 at ph 4 reaching 85 8 91 2 92 1 and 96 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively according to cr vi removal behavior η was growing slightly for pure ca while it was progressed significantly for filling ones moreover it increased upon the type of filler in other words η of cr vi increased from 86 7 86 3 89 9 90 6 and 92 9 at ph 4 89 8 90 5 94 1 94 7 and 97 3 at ph 8 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the growth of η upon the compositional change reflects the effect of filler contribution for instance pristine ca may remove ions via the absorption mechanism at the same time those containing mnps or hap can add another mechanism denoted ionic exchange whereas hap crystal contains ten crystallographic positions for ca ii those sites prefer to be replaced with cationic ions 73 75 increasing the charge of ion may offer van der walls attraction force towards inorganic molecules the higher capacity of hap compared with mnps explains the relatively high efficiency that accompanied by hap ca it might be mentioned that the absorption mechanism is based on the content and the surface to volume ratio of porosity content 33 76 the addition of go introduces a porous surface while the modification by other inorganic molecules contributes to the creation of high content of crystallographic defects the latter behavior may add to the ionic exchange mechanism another prospected mechanism might be added to degenerate se iv and cr vi ions which is ionic reduction in contrast those ions possess a high tendency to be reduced into their lower ionic states such as se ii and cr iii 48 49 the latter ions are reported to be much safe than the former ones the ionic concentration through the aqueous solution indicates the ionic strength of that pollutant therefore lowering of this content might increase the effectiveness of removal procedure because the high content of ions is expected to accelerate saturation of the porous surface of membranes consequently it might be stated that the main mechanism to remove se iv and cr vi ions is the absorbance one which might be encouraged via the porosity of nanofibers however versatile mechanisms can act partially to facilitate ionic removal involving ionic exchange and reduction the dependency of removal efficiency upon the time is shown in fig 6 c d while data are reported in table s2 it was shown that increasing time of experiment promoted a slight change of η starting from 83 1 84 9 88 9 89 5 and 92 4 after 2 h of exposure reaching 84 6 85 5 91 1 91 2 and 93 4 after 24 h for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively in case of se iv ions this stability of η indicates that porosity has been saturated exponentially owing to their feasibility and fast reactions 3 5 dye removal efficiency the effectiveness to degrade methylene blue mb in aqueous solutions using nanofibrous membranes of ca containing different fillers including go mnps or hap was investigated under visible light as shown in fig 7 a h the absorption spectra of mb are noticed to be deteriorated significantly upon the irradiation time moreover the removal effectiveness of mb from aqueous solution using nanofibrous membranes achieved around 92 9 93 3 93 8 89 6 and 95 1 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively after 35 min of continuous exposure to visible light the kinetics parameters for the photocatalytic proceeding obeys to the pseudo first order kinetics formula as 77 78 3 l n c c o k a p p t where kapp min 1 denotes the rate of the apparent belongs to the pseudo first order constant if the term l n c c o was plotted on y axis and time t on the x axis a straight line will be obtained with slope indicates the value of kapp as mentioned in table 3 while calculations of c co and ln c co are reported in tables s3 and s4 from table 3 it could be noticed that kapp value is slightly varied upon the compositional changes it started from 6 95 10 2 min 1 for pristine ca reaching 7 03 10 2 min 1 for go mnps hap ca whilst the r2 constant was around 0 885 which refers to the good fitting the degradation of mb through aqueous solutions via nanofibrous membranes could be explained by supposing that both absorption and photocatalytic are working simultaneously the surface of pristine ca could not be provoked to eject free charge carriers via photons however its high content of porosity may introduce a facile technique to collect mb molecules 79 81 supplementation of go introduces a conductive mat that facilitates photo electron generation through oxygen containing groups belonging to go 82 83 the produced charges may promote the formation of reduced oxygen species ros which have the upper hand to degenerate dye molecules 84 85 the addition of mnps or hap induce a form of electrons that could be transferred through the bonding system and thus inhibit recombination and hence interaction with dye molecules 14 86 88 the configured free radicles such as superoxide anion scavengers o 2 and hydroxyl ion o h are classified as the most effective ions towards dyes 82 83 one of the most valuable parameters to determine the economic feasibility of nanofibrous membranes is their recyclability trend it was reported that using fiber mats guarantees their recovery after utilization 48 49 as shown in fig 7h it is evident that the efficiencies have decreased slightly after multi usage reaching 84 3 85 4 86 3 82 3 and 88 3 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively after 5 cycles the slight deterioration of efficiency after 5 cycles indicates the high stability of these membranes to be used for dye removal utilizations 4 conclusion nanofibrous membranes of cellulose acetate ca containing different supplemented fillers including go mnps or hap was fabricated the as synthesized membranes were formed as non oriented network with diameters 0 11 0 35 μm and 0 66 1 23 μm 0 14 0 33 μm and 0 6 0 89 μm 0 17 0 37 μm and 0 91 4 57 μm 0 18 0 53 μm and 1 18 2 1 μm and 0 11 0 29 μm for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively a high content of interconnected porosity is observed through the membranes the surface roughness is provoked via compositional variation whereas the roughness average ra increased 31 3 nm to 52 nm for ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the mechanical properties upon changing of filling type were investigated fracture strength started from 6 0 0 4 mpa reaching 14 2 0 9 and 15 3 1 2 mpa for ca mnps ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the potency of heavy metal removal against se iv and cr vi was investigated upon variation of ph value and contact time it was shown that η for se iv has improved from 79 5 84 8 85 9 and 89 3 at ph 4 reaching 85 8 91 2 92 1 and 96 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively the removal of methylene blue mb from aqueous solution was examined and reached 92 9 93 3 93 8 89 6 and 95 1 for ca go ca mnps ca hap ca and go mnps hap ca respectively after 35 min of continuous irradiation under visible light therefore manipulating of nanofibrous membranes for water filtration applications could be tailored via electrospun technique based on a compositional variation declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest acknowledgment this project was funded by the deanship of scientific

13759,phosphorus can be recovered from wastewater in the form of marketable fertilizers that can be profitable for municipal facilities alleviate the eutrophication of urban rivers and ease further polishing the effluent to produce reclaimed water in this work it is assessed the viability of recovering phosphorous in the treatment plants of a large metropolitan region it is proposed the production of struvite granules from sludge liquors by adding magnesium in a reactor fluidified bed or stirred previously an anaerobic tank would stimulate the action of microorganisms to release phosphorus from the sludge before its digestion applying such process in the five largest treatment facilities of the metropolitan region of são paulo would recover 5 3 tons day of phosphorous and yield 38 0 tons day of struvite granules a preliminary viability assessment was conducted considering operational expenses and potential revenues results indicate the economic viability of this nutrient recovery scheme in this particular region keywords wastewater treatment nutrient recovery phosphorus recovery struvite fertilizer eutrophication 1 introduction wastewater urban plants are steadily evolving to resource recovery facilities there are plenty of opportunities energy can be recovered in the forms of biogas from sludge digestion or as biofuel from dried sludge water is probably the most valuable resource that can be recovered producing reclaimed or recycled water is becoming a must for wastewater treatment plants in water stressed cities and will increase its importance in coming years domestic wastewater has in some countries a significant content in cellulose that resource can be recovered with the use of some technologies the cellvation process removes a cellulose rich sludge from primary clarifiers which can then be used to produce bio composites or biofuel sludges from treatment plants can also be a source of phas polyhydroxyalkanoates which are biodegradable polyesters with comparable properties to some petroleum based polyolefins 1 there are also research focusing on the extraction of acetylsalicylic and salicylic acids from sewage sludge 2 or on the production of bio char for soil amendment 3 phosphorus p and nitrogen n are essential nutrients for plant growing and urban wastewaters are rich on them recovering those nutrients brings a double benefit the first benefit is reducing the load of nutrients discharged to water bodies the presence of p and n in wastewater frequently causes eutrophication of aquatic systems generating conditions of hypoxia or anoxia 4 5 as a second benefit recovering those nutrients for agriculture reduces the dependence on industrial fertilizers that require considerable amount of energy and resources nitrogen fertilizers such as urea are produced mainly through the haber bosch ammonia reaction consuming natural gas and energy phosphate fertilizer is produced mainly through rock phosphate a dwindling resource that needs to be mined and is concentrated in a few countries europe for example lacks of phosphate resources and therefore needs to import them the recovery of p in wastewater treatment plants has been requested as a priority by the eu government germany with its 2017 amendment to the sewage sludge ordinance seems to be leading the way as will make p recovery from sewage sludge mandatory for all wastewater treatment plants larger than 50 000 person equivalents argentina and brazil are lagging behind this trend a step in that direction was taken during the last decade with the approval of legislation regarding the use of sludge from wastewater treatment plants biosolids in argentina resolution 410 18 2018 and brazil resolution 375 2006 there is a lack of studies that focus on producing p and n precipitates from municipal wastewaters in those two south american countries most studies have addressed the environmental problems caused by the release of those substances available literature ranges from eutrophication in coastal watersheds 6 7 to the pollution of watersheds due to the intensive use of fertilizers 8 or the role of detergents as a source of p 9 there has been extensive research regarding the direct application of biosolids in agriculture pasture fields and silviculture with focus on the brazilian context 10 17 some of these previous works highlighted that the sewage sludge generated in brazilian cities can contain a complex mixture of pollutants that are harmful to soil and aquatic biota 18 among them are heavy metals as in some regions industrial effluents are discharged directly into the municipal sewer system 19 the production of granulated fertilizers with high content of p and n from wastewater sludge can overcome the problem of releasing those hazardous components in soils those two key nutrients can be removed from the sludge as iron phosphates calcium phosphates or as pure crystal forms such as vivianite struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate map or potassium struvite magnesium potassium phosphate mpp vivianite and struvite crystals can be commercialized as a fertilizer rich in p and to a lesser extent in n they can be blended with potassium k to produce a more balanced fertilizer or with diammonium phosphate dap which is the world s most widely used phosphorus fertilizer in the case of struvite its blending with dap seems to increase the absorbance in agricultural soils resulting in a slow release effective fertilizer 20 the production of those precipitated salts requires more initial investment that applying wastewater sludge directly due to the need of specific equipment such as reaction vessels or crystallizers there are also some operational costs such as energy for pumps and stirrers or the addition of catalyzers for example magnesium mg to facilitate the controlled precipitation of struvite comparing the production of precipitated salts with applying sludge in fields there are key plus points for precipitated salts that form of nutrient recovery results in a high value commercial product which is concentrated and has less transport costs due to its reduced volume and has a standardized composition free of potential soil pollutants ostara s salt crystal green for example has a guaranteed standardized composition of 5 n 28 p and 10 mg it also has a defined value of the salt index 8 knowing the exact composition and solubility of the fertilizer is crucial for agriculture as allows calculating the dosage depending on the crop and soil characteristics there is higher uncertainty when applying sludge lime or biosolids from wastewater treatment plants as those are much lesser homogeneous products this research aims to contribute to the study of recovering nutrients from urban wastewater in densely populated urban areas of south america in the form of crystallized fertilizer products instead of the direct application of dried sludge that is the main novelty of this work the topic is promising and could reveal interesting business opportunities due to the coincidence of three facts 1 big metropolitan regions such as são paulo 20 million people or buenos aires 13 million providing a significant concentration of domestic wastewater in large treatment facilities the number of urban centers with more than 100 000 inhabitants is 324 for brazil and 91 for argentina although in this second country much of those centers are concentrated around the capital city buenos aires 21 22 2 there is a deficit of fertilizers in these two gigantic exporters of agricultural commodities in brazil fertilizers are the major imports after petrochemical products they represented in 2019 5 3 of the value of all imports in brazil 23 the weight of fertilizers on the imports of argentina is less significant only 2 0 24 but the country is particularly dependent on the imports of phosphatic fertilizers which represents 76 of the overall consumption of phosphate 25 3 the technology for n and p recovery has reached a high level of maturity and efficiency 26 27 there are several successful cases from wastewater treatment plants worldwide that invites to study the applicability and potential profitability of those technologies in south american cities in order to address the topic in sufficient depth this article aims to accomplish the following objectives identify the nutrient recovery process that best suits the wastewater treatment plants that operate in the metropolitan region of são paulo investigate the economic sustainability of such nutrient recovery facilities through a preliminary viability assessment explore the links between recovering nutrients in the region s wastewater facilities and two related issues i eutrophication of the urban rivers in the tietê basin and ii the need for tertiary treatment to produce recycled water more specifically it will be necessary to determine how the production of fertilizer in the facilities would affect the balance of p in são paulo s sewerage system and consequently the load of p reaching the tietê basin 2 materials and methods the area of study is the main sewerage system of são paulo s metropolitan region which is served by five wastewater treatment plants this work assesses the potential of nutrients recovery mainly p in this area aiming the production of a commercial fertilizer in the wastewater plants first the characteristics of the sewerage system in this area were reviewed with focus on those five treatment plants process layouts average flows concentration of nutrients in the input raw wastewater and in the secondary effluent that leaves each plant existing upgrades with tertiary treatment average sludge production it was necessary to identify what will be requested to local wastewater treatment plants in future years in terms of reducing the load of nutrients that is discharged to the urban rivers and recycled water production that provided an accurate perspective of how the region s treatment plants will evolve and which nutrient recovery technologies better suit them following this article provides a review of technologies for nutrient recovery from waste liquid streams digested sludge and sludge ashes among these technologies it was selected the most appropriate ones given the characteristics of the five treatment plants the proposed arrangement suits são paulo s treatment plants in terms of robustness of operation efficiency in reducing the load of nutrients in the effluent and potential to be economically sustainable through the production of high quality fertilizer the technological arrangement that was chosen is based on struvite crystallization and has several units in operation worldwide it was reviewed real data regarding the yield of fertilizer product its average composition efficiency in the removal of p and opex operational expenses costs it was considered that the treatment plants upgraded with the nutrient recovery units should operate under these specifications concentration of 0 49 mg l of total p in the final secondary effluent overall efficiency of 28 9 in the removal of p from the wastewater reduction of 10 in the volume of dry cake of sludge that is produced and content of 14 wt in p in the fertilizer product the potential production of fertilizer was calculated based on the above specifications finally it was assessed the profitability of this nutrient recovery scheme a review of literature and of the local market allowed to set a realistic sale price for the fertilizer product 60 usd ton and also to assess its marketability 3 description of the case study 3 1 sanitation in são paulo the city of são paulo pop 12 2 million is at the core of the largest metropolitan region in the americas pop 20 million each day são paulo generates 1 8 million m3 of wastewater from that volume 86 is collected in the city s sewer system and 70 is treated 28 the city s sewer system was projected to collect domestic wastewater separately from the urban drainage system separating rainwater from sewage favors the operation of treatment plants which have to process less volume of influent it favors as well the recovery of nutrients because that influent is more concentrated however domestic wastewater is discharged illegally into stormwater drains in many parts of the city so a significant part of the volume treated by the city s reclamation plant is urban runoff reverting that situation would be positive for the profitability of nutrient recovery plants and for the sewage system itself which is overloaded during intense rain events most of the wastewater generated in the metropolitan region is collected in two different sewer systems which are the focus of this study sewerage system 1 comprehends four interconnected collection basins with their respective treatment plants those are barueri abc upgraded with aquapolo reclamation plant that produces recycled water for industrial uses parque novo mundo and são miguel sewerage system 2 is an independent basin with an activated sludge plant named suzano it is the oldest one and has a significant contribution of industrial wastewater paper pulp mills dying pharmaceuticals in its influent 29 altogether both sanitation systems serve a population of 8 5 million people fig 1 shows the location of the sewer systems and their treatment plants after treatment the secondary effluent is discharged to into a series of water streams that end up in the tietê river this is the final receiving water body of the largest metropolitan region in the americas 20 million people and presents stretches with extremely high pollution 30 32 it is estimated that 122 km of this river could be dead 33 such level of river degradation is caused by the uncontrolled discharge of domestic wastewater in low income parts of the region in addition storm events commonly cause sewer overflow and waste drag to the urban rivers stormwater overloads the treatment plants of the region particularly são miguel and parque novo mundo which are operating close to their maximum capacity during normal conditions the city hopes that the construction and upgrading of other smaller plants caieiras bandeirantes and maria trinidade would alleviate this situation the discharge of nutrients from wastewater has caused eutrophication in some water bodies that is the case of parts of the guarapiranga reservoir which is one of the key sources of water supply in the region 34 during past decades clandestine and irregular neighborhoods stablished around the reservoir untreated human waste and sewage contaminated rivers and brooks that fed into the reservoir while the sewerage system is slowly being expanded to cover those irregular areas it would also be interesting to consider small decentralized solutions for providing sanitation to those communities fig 2 shows that in the area served by sewerage system 1 only 70 of the generated wastewaters is treated and 14 of wastewaters are not even collected all the wastewater treatment plants operating in this metropolitan region follow the activated sludge process consisting in the following stages preliminary treatment with screen and grit removal primary settling tanks aeration tanks and final clarifiers the underflow sludge from the primary settling tank and the final clarifier the waste activated sludge goes to a facility that stabilizes it and reduces its volume it typically undergoes the stages of thickening through rotary drums or screw press the biodigestion and finally drying drying can be performed mechanically with the use of a filter press or thermally thermal drying produces a sterile granular bio solid with 90 95 solids content but this technique is not very used in the region meanwhile filter press is widely used in são paulo producing a sludge cake with 30 solids content both the thickeners and the filter press produce a filtrate a k a sludge liquor or centrate that is returned to the aeration tanks the dried sludge cake is transported and dumped in the city s landfills which constitutes a high operational cost for the treatment plants previous characterization of the sludge generated in são paulo showed levels of cd cr and ni in the sludge s composition that made it unsuitable for the manufacture of organic fertilizers 19 those analysis pointed to the discharge of industrial wastewater into the municipal sewage network as the source of these heavy metals therefore regarding the production of a fertilizing product with potential uses for agriculture it would be more convenient recovering nutrients in the form of precipitated salts such as struvite or vivianite rather than the application of dried sludge cake any heavy metals would be confined in the sludge cake and dumped in the landfills precipitate salts concentrate the nutrients from wastewater n and p and avoid the risk of potential contaminants being released into agricultural soils 3 2 towards tertiary treatment and water reclamation only two treatment plants of são paulo s metropolitan region provide tertiary treatment after the activated sludge process those are i abc aquapolo and ii parque novo mundo the city s water utility sabesp has the goal to expand tertiary treatment to all the five largest plants of the metropolitan region it is planned to achieve that goal through the progressive installation of modular units the installed capacity of tertiary treatment will be increased from the current 12 000 l s 2020 to 47 400 l s in 2035 28 the tertiary treatment combining advanced biological and membrane processes polishes the secondary effluent by removing ammonia and phosphate as well as inorganic pollutants like silica the latter is a major issue when considering recycled water for industrial purposes as silica forms scale deposits that can be hard glassy adherent and difficult to remove from the internal heating surfaces of boiler units for example the effluent of the tertiary process achieves enough quality to be used as recycled water for non drinkable uses such as street and sewer washing in cities irrigation landscaping golf courses crop fields and industrial uses washing equipment steam generation in boilers or as a cooling fluid in heat exchangers and cooling towers nice examples of water reclamation for irrigation uses are shafdan which supplies 70 of the irrigation needs in israel 35 and atotonilco reclamation plant which treats the wastewater generated by 13 2 million people in the metropolitan area of méxico city 36 37 water stressed cities around the world are more and more considering tertiary treatment and membrane filtering to produce recycled water that can be used to recharge aquifers or distributed through pipe networks for non drinkable purposes it is perfectly possible to further polish the effluent achieving drinkable standards 38 the use of recycled water adds a new business line to the portfolio of water utilities and at the same time allows industry to obtain a stable supply at a lower price from a public perspective reclamation of municipal wastewaters reduces the water stress of cities brazilian municipal laws are steady advancing to foster water reclamation in são paulo the use of tertiary treatment was introduced in 2012 through the aquapolo project the aim of the project was to build a separate facility next to the existing activated sludge plant abc that would produce recycled water from its effluents and sell it to industrial facilities a petrochemical complex located 17 km away from the abc treatment plant was experiencing a decrease in the quality of its water sources groundwater and urban rivers most of its water consumption are due to three non drinkable uses washing equipment steam production and process cooling these two latter uses require a low content of suspended and solved minerals in the process water achieves to avoid scaling and silica deposits and the low quality of nearby water sources was causing operational problems by 2009 the companies at the complex had specified their demands for a steady supply of high quality water for industrial uses the aquapolo tertiary treatment plant was born that year from a joint venture between the city s water utility sabesp owning 49 and a private engineering company foz do brasil odebretch ambiental later bought by brookfield and renamed brk ambiental owning 51 the city s water utility provided access to the municipal sewage and the private company invested in building the reclamation plant and the pipes to supply recycled water to the petrochemical complex the reclamation plant started its operations in 2012 some months later a severe drought came são paulo s 2013 2015 drought and the arrangement showed to be strategic for the industrial facilities the stable supply of recycled water prevented the companies from economic losses due to halting their operations nowadays aquapolo has become the largest reclamation plant in the southern hemisphere and the fifth largest recycled water facility in the world it supplies 650 l s of recycled water through a distribution network to industrial facilities inside and outside the petrochemical complex fig 3 shows an aerial view of the aquapolo facilities which are located next to the abc municipal wastewater treatment plant following it is described the arrangement between the activated sludge treatment plant and the tertiary treatment upgrade the municipal wastewater arrives to the abc treatment plant where undergoes an activated sludge deep shaft treatment that removes 88 of the biological oxygen demand bod 39 the flow of effluent that leaves the abc treatment plant is 2 000 l s its low bod makes it complying with brazil s quality parameters so it is suitable to be discharged in the nearest water body the ribeirão dos meninos brook at this point 650 l s are diverted to the aquapolo reclamation plant and the rest is discharged to that water body there are sensors installed in the pipe to monitor the quality of the treated wastewater that is diverted to aquapolo so the reclamation plant can adjust the processes in order to better deal with variations in the characteristics of its influent real time measures from ph conductivity and turbidity sensors are transmitted to the plant s supervisory control and data acquisition system the abc activated sludge treatment plant was projected for the removal of carbon and organic load but not for an effective removal of ammonia and phosphorus to remove ammoniacal n and p aquapolo s process combined a biological treatment with ultrafiltration membranes in a tertiary membrane bioreactor tmbr the first one in brazil at the time this tertiary treatment avoids discharging 0 6 tonnes of ammonia and 31 4 tonnes of p to the ribeirão dos meninos brook per year 40 fig 4 shows the flowchart of the processes performed at aquapolo the tertiary treatment stages at aquapolo are as follows 1 the first stage is microfiltration wastewater is pumped throughout disk filters to remove particles larger than 400 microns the aim is to remove solids that could harm future stages of membrane filtering ultrafiltration and ro membranes 2 the second stage consists in the tertiary membrane biological reactor tmbr the tmbr unit performs biological treatment with bacteria degrading organic matter in both aerobic and anaerobic zones besides organic matter n and p are also removed the biological reactor consists in a series of tanks that altogether have a volume of 5 350 m³ this digestion of organic matter is followed by ultrafiltration throughout membranes that retain solids and bacteria larger than 0 05 microns the membranes are encapsulated in 9 tanks with 256 m³ each 3 the reverse osmosis ro system is actuated when the conductivity of the water exceeds the specification value of 50 μs cm if that is the case the water stream is by passed to two ro membrane systems that produce 150 l s of permeate 4 the reclamation plant is equipped with an automated disinfection system that doses chlorine dioxide clo2 in key points of the process when arriving at the petrochemical complex the recycled water must have a residual concentration of chlorine dioxide higher than 0 2 mg l table 1 shows that the efficiency of the tertiary treatment performed in aquapolo the average removal rates are 90 2 for p and 99 2 for ammoniacal nitrogen the experience of aquapolo was soon replicated in another treatment plant parque novo mundo which currently supplies 70 l s of recycled water to a paper mill and a textile industry aquapolo s successful case is one of the reasons behind the will to implement tertiary treatment in all the region s facilities by 2035 it proved that there is a commercially viable way to reduce the nutrients released in the tietê basin and at the same time diversifying the water sources of the metropolitan region the abc aquapolo scheme points out the direction to which the region s treatment plants will evolve in the next decade tertiary treatment with membrane filtration aiming the reclamation of water would be widespread any nutrient recovery initiatives projected for the city s treatment plants should take into consideration that evolution trend nutrient recovery units that perform and effective removal of n and p in the activated sludge plant would generate a secondary effluent with low content of both nutrients which would alleviate or even dismiss the need for a mbr downstream in that case future tertiary water reclamation plants in the region could consist in only ultrafiltration followed by reverse osmose 3 3 technical report of processes for the recovery of p municipal wastewater is rich in n p and k the average load from households has been estimated as 13 5 g n 2 1 g p and 4 0 g k per person per day 41 during anaerobic wastewater purification the phosphate present is largely converted into orthophosphate whereas the n is converted into ammonium nitrogen nh4 n during aerobic treatment orthophosphate is formed as well with potassium as counter ion in the ph range of wastewaters around 7 the dominant forms of orthophosphate are h2po4 and hpo4 2 during the treatment stages as the ph increases the dominant form of orthophosphate becomes po4 3 the removal of p from wastewater involves the incorporation of orthophosphate into total suspended solids those can be biological solids microorganisms or chemical precipitates the suspended solids are then settled and removed as sludge in the presence of mg the orthophosphate reacts with ammonium and magnesium ions to form magnesium ammonium phosphate map also known as struvite as shown in eq 1 1 mg2 nh4 po4 3 nh4 mg po4 6h2o struvite alternatively potassium can replace ammonium in the struvite crystal lattice and form magnesium potassium phosphate mpp as shown in eq 2 2 mg2 k po4 3 mgkpo4 6h2o potassium struvite struvite presents as a white crystalline powder in its pure form but can also occur either as large single crystals very small crystals large curds or a gelatinous mass the latter forms are common when this compound scales up in pipes and equipment causing operational issues preventing the unwanted precipitation of struvite in the equipment is a factor that increases the operational costs of a treatment plant it involves the injection of concentrated industrial grade chemicals that dissolve the scale and help prevent future growth however struvite can be precipitated form wastewater in a controlled manner in specifically designed equipment such as fluidified bed or stirred reactors by doing so the treatment plant is prevented from unwanted scale formations at the same time the struvite crystals produced in the reactor represent a concentrated source of p that has a commercial value as a fertilizer these reasons have driven the developing of several processes for the recovery of p as struvite during the last two decades the input for a struvite crystallizer can be any liquid stream concentrated in p swine wastewater 42 or some effluents from food processing plants can be very suitable input streams in municipal wastewater plants most of the p 80 is carried by the waste activated sludge stream was and in the sludge that leaves the primary clarifiers 10 43 was undergoes anaerobic digestion thickening and dewatering the most typical inputs for struvite crystallizing systems are the dewatering sludge liquors a k a centrate produced during the thickening centrifuges output and supernatants and the final dewatering of digested sludges in the filter press filtrate the sludge liquor from primary clarifiers or primary sludge can be used as input stream as well after some treatment there are commercial processes that combine both liquor streams and there are some processes scepphar that are specifically designed to treat primary sludge 44 the p rich input stream is introduced into the reaction vessel where struvite crystallization occurs some struvite formation can occur previously in the anaerobic digester that treats the sludge depending on the hardness of the water magnesium content the sludge liquor carries some mg but to optimize the production of struvite it is necessary to provide an external source of mg such as mgcl2 mgo or mg oh 2 the latter is generally cheaper and has the advantage of also raising the ph the ph range for which struvite can precipitate is between 7 11 most systems use the addition of sodium hydroxide naoh to increase ph and promote struvite precipitation in the reactor 45 other systems increase the ph through air stripping of dissolved carbon dioxide from the sludge or through vacuum degassing elovac in the elophos system in the reaction vessel crystalline struvite drills are formed and grow over several days until they reach the desired size struvite harvesting is quite simple because it has a 1 7 specific density and thus can easily be separated from the effluent the granules are washed as they are conveyed to a dewatering sieve dried using hot air and stocked in silos for bagging the final fertilizer ready to be commercialized meanwhile the effluent of the reactor from which p has been extracted can be conducted back to digestion with was or to the final clarifiers depending on the arrangement of the wastewater treatment plant phosphate can be precipitated with mg to form struvite but also with ca al and fe by adding calcium p can be recovered as calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 dicalcium phosphate cahpo4 and hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh their precipitation reactions are shown in eq 3 5 3 3ca2 2po4 3 ca3 po4 2 calcium phosphate 4 h3po4 ca oh 2 cahpo4 dicalcium phosphate degrades as hap if not hydrated 5 5ca2 3po4 3 oh ca5 po4 3oh hydroxyapatite hap by adding fe p can be recovered as vivianite rates of 82 6 removal of p from was fermentation in anaerobic reactors have been reported 46 the reaction is shown in eq 6 6 fe2 2po4 3 fe 3 po4 2 8h2o vivianite during the last two decades the removal of p from wastewater by adding mg ca and fe in fluidified bed stirred or aerated reactors has been tested in large treatment plants it has proven to be economically viable and robust there is another tertiary nutrient removal and recovery technology that has only been tested in pilot plants but has attracted attention because of its performance and potential the ion exchange iex processes ion exchange is the process of reciprocal transfer of ions between a solution and a resin ammonia and phosphate are selectively removed from the wastewater with specific iex media typically a resin resins containing hydrous ferric oxide for example have a good selectivity for phosphate 47 the transfer capacity of the iex resin is regularly restored by regeneration solutions where the nutrients n p accumulate n and p can be removed from the regenerants with an ammonia stripper or a combined precipitation and filtration process the regenerants can be used multiple times which is a key aspect to ensure economic feasibility of this technological route iex pilot plants are beginning to scale up a small iex unit is being commissioned at a wastewater treatment plant in cranfield uk 48 in that unit n is removed with mesolite media a mineral of the group of zeolites while p is removed with hybrid ion exchange media haix mesolite and other types of zeolites have proven to be very effective to remove ammonia from wastewaters 49 50 while iron doped zeolite are promissory selective adsorbents of p 51 52 after adsorption in mesolite media n is then recovered as ammonium sulfate through a liquid liquid membrane process while p is recovered as hap hydroxyapatite through a precipitation tank followed by filtering all the above technological processes that recover nutrients from liquid waste streams are present in table 2 which summarizes commercial processes and pilot plants developed so far some nutrient recovery systems count with a specific unit to produce a p rich sludge before the stages of digestion thickening and dewatering in order to maximize the amount of p and n that is removed both the primary sludge and the was can undergo biological thermal or chemical treatments to release phosphate to the liquid fraction of the sludge before digestion one of the main technologies is the use of stirred anaerobic tanks that leverage paos phosphorus accumulating organisms the microorganism release p from the influent as they produce vfas volatile fat acids from organic matter after a retention time of around 10 h much of the p has been released 70 in the case of ostara s wasstrip and 50 in the case of the scepphar process meanwhile the metaphos process proposes solubilizing p from was by adding an easily degradable carbohydrate source under anaerobic conditions producing a p rich liquor some plants count with a thermal pressure hydrolysis thp system previous to the anaerobic sludge digester it combines high pressure boiling followed by a rapid decompression although the aim of thp is to improve the digestion performance it also increases the concentration of phosphate and ammonium in the centrate stream obtained after digestion table 3 shows the main processes that are commercially available to release p from the sludge table 2 showed the available systems to recover p from liquid waste streams and table 3 showed some processes to maximize the content of p in the liquid solid mixture that conforms the sludge there are other two technological alternatives to recover p the first one is to recovered p directly from digested sludge without extraction process and without separation of supernatant as occurs for example in the airprex process with the use of an airlift reactor the second is the acidic leaching of digested sludge or of incinerated sludge ashes if acidic leaching is applied to digested sludge the p that is fixed in the solid sludge phase is dissolved into the aqueous phase and then recovered from the supernatant after liquid solid separation most wastewater treatment plants use thermal processes after mechanical dewatering to reduce the volume of the final dry cake of sludge to be dumped in landfills the dry sludge cake can also be incinerated and acidic leaching can be applied to the resulting ashes sludge ash is mainly composed of five elements p ca fe al and si in form of oxides and other inorganic forms the output product of ash leaching technologies such as ashdec leachphos and mephrec has a p content between 5 and 20 making them suitable for use as fertilizers the recovery rate of p from sludge ashes is higher than 70 in almost all technologies and reaches 95 in some of them ashdec 53 table 4 shows commercial and pilot scale processes to recover p from digested sludge and sludge ashes the acidic leaching of incinerated sludge allows for high p extraction but also leads to high heavy metal co extraction 54 most of the processes described on table 4 include systems to capture heavy metals from the ashes in order to preserve the quality of the final fertilizer product heavy metals can also be removed from waste liquid streams such as in the veolia irstea s opalix system which performs metal adsorption of the sludge liquor before it enters the struvite crystallizer not all the above reviewed technologies are suitable for são paulo s treatment plants thermal pressure hydrolysis of was and sludge incineration for example is non existent in the region for são paulo s plants it may be more convenient to use technologies that already have a track record of operational performance and economic viability particularly fluidified bed and stirred reactors for struvite crystallization with the use of such systems the p content in the secondary effluent leaving the treatment plants currently at 4 mg p l on average would be reduced drastically still there would be p available for recovery in the effluent given a technology that could operate efficiently with a more diluted input stream of around 1 2 mg p l iex technology has shown to be viable for input streams around 3 mg p l 55 and presents high recovery rates of nutrients it could replace the use of mbrs membrane biological reactors to provide effective tertiary treatment and cope with the city s aim of increasing the production of recycled water acting together with membrane technologies ultrafiltration and reverse osmose for são paulo s treatment plants it is proposed an arrangement with priority focus on struvite crystallization in fluidized bed or stirred reactors using the sludge liquors it is strongly recommended to combine those reactors with the use of anaerobic reactors that enhance the content of p in the input liquor once such a system is implemented the next step should be collecting data to update the concentration of total p in the secondary effluent that leaves each treatment plant if that concentration is still beyond 1 2 mg p l it could be considered an iex process that uses as input the final effluent of the activated sludge plant that is the overflow of the secondary clarifiers fig 5 depicts this ideal arrangement 4 results and discussion this study assumed a per capita production of 1 8 g p person day which results in a concentration of 13 9 mg p l in são paulo s raw wastewater that value is coherent with literature that refers to concentrations between 4 0 and 16 0 mg p l in urban wastewaters 56 the average reported value for the effluent leaving the activated sludge treatment plants is 4 0 mg p l only abc aquapolo and parque novo mundo manage to further lower that concentration by providing tertiary treatment for this study and considering the evolution trend of são paulo s treatment plants it seemed appropriate to consider 0 49 mg p l in the effluent which is the current value of aquapolo s plant that value complies with the maximum concentration of p for effluents discharged in the tietê river that according to the brazilian environmental norm 357 05 should be 0 50 mg p l 57 achieving that final concentration of p in the final effluent would imply removing 96 5 of the load of p that enters the city s sewage system as fig 6 shows to comply with the brazilian environmental norm and alleviate the eutrophication of the tietê basin the five treatment plants should remove 17 732 kg p day from the sewage system after carefully reviewing the available technologies for nutrient recovery as well as the characteristics of the existing treatment plants it was proposed a struvite crystallization system with a previous anaerobic tank to release p from sludge fig 5 that p recovery system could be complemented with an iex unit to further treat the secondary effluent if necessary but that upgrade was not considered for this assessment simulations were run to calculate the amount of p that could be feasible to harvest from the total potential 17 732 kg p day given the proposed arrangement the resulting recovery of p was 5319 kg p day or 28 9 of the overall potential the yield of struvite granules with 14 wt p is shown on table 5 after the upgrading of the treatment plants the balance of p would be as follows 646 kg p day 3 5 of the initial load would be discharged in the tietê basin 12 412 kg p day 67 5 p of the initial load would be contained in the dry sludge cake primary was and dumped in the city s landfills and 5319 kg p day 28 9 of the initial load would be recovered as struvite granules the production of struvite granules would be 38 tons day in order to assess the economic sustainability of producing that amount of struvite it is necessary to calculate the potential revenues and opex the sale of struvite fertilizer would represent 71 of revenues the rest 29 would be the savings due to the decrease in volume of the dried cake which has a cost of 1400 usd per ton that needs to be transported and dumped into the city s landfills the sale price of struvite was estimated as 60 usd ton after local market research and literature reviewing 59 meanwhile the operating costs of the fluidified bed reactor that precipitates struvite would be shared as follows 74 chemicals mgcl2 and naoh 17 electricity and 9 maintenance table 6 provides the estimated profitability of struvite production for each plant the results obtained are consistent with similar assessments 60 producing struvite fertilizer in the city s treatment plant seems able to generate a positive cash flow future assessments should take into consideration capex costs to detail if that cash flow is able to justify a viable business scheme it is fair to question how well the yield of 38 tons day of struvite granules would integrate within the existing distribution channels for fertilizers and if the local market would be able to absorb that volume of product regarding logistics the region presents unbeatable distribution channels for the commercialization of the product the metropolitan region of são paulo is located in the epicenter of the market of fertilizers in the country são paulo state accounts for 20 of brazil s fertilizers consumption and its neighboring states paraná and minas gerais for other 26 the state of são paulo concentrates 42 of the industry of fertilizers in brazil 61 regarding the marketability of the product struvite granules are unknown by local consumers however it presents key characteristics in terms of size it is produced as powder granules or pellets and in composition that makes it very suitable for the local market the most common type of fertilizer that is consumed in brazil is a blend of granulates having 64 of the market share 62 regarding the n p k formula which represents the percentual composition of the three macro nutrients in the fertilizer the most preferred one in the region is 17 10 15 17 of nitrogen 10 of phosphorus and 15 of potassium the granules of struvite precipitated with mg lack of k some typical compositions are 5 0 n 28 0 p and 10 0 mg crystalgreen 5 8 n 12 2 p and 10 4 mg phosphogreen 5 5 n 12 5 p and 9 5 mg ekobalans 5 7 n 12 6 p and 9 9 mg struvia 5 0 n 28 6 p and 10 0 mg naskeo 5 6 n 12 6 p and 10 0 mg bio stru therefore struvite granules should be blended with other sources rich in n and k to achieve the formula that is demanded by the market in the region or else marketed directly as a source of p and n for soils there is also the possibility of adapting the crystallization process to produce a more balanced precipitate composed by both struvite map and potassium struvite mpp so it contains n p k 41 63 the above results have shown that producing struvite at são paulo s wastewater treatment plants would be feasible would help to achieve the goal of providing tertiary treatment and produce more recycled water and in addition has the potential to be economically sustainable but from a wider perspective considering the balance of trade of the country there would be additional benefits finished n p k fertilizers represent the second largest imports of brazil as the nation s industry is not able to cope with the demand of its huge agricultural sector moreover the industry of fertilizers in brazil also relies on the imports of raw materials ammonia rock phosphate and sulfuric acid 64 it has experienced a steady increase in the cost of raw materials which currently represent half of the production costs 61 currently são paulo state imports 603 414 tons year of rock phosphate with an average content of 30 wt in p2o5 producing struvite in the considered treatment plants would reduce those imports by 2 5 that seems a modest figure but represents an important additional benefit that should also be taken into consideration 5 conclusions the recovery of nutrients from wastewater should be taken into consideration among the technical alternatives to reduce eutrophication in the tietê basin the production of struvite granules from sludge liquors is a reliable technology that inserts well within the current process layout of são paulo s activated sludge treatment plants if combined with a previous anaerobic tank that releases p in the sludge before its digestion it has the potential of lowering the load of that nutrient in the effluent to values below 0 50 mg l that would ease further polishing the effluent to produce reclaimed water the economic assessment of the production of struvite indicates potential profitability in the considered facilities the expected revenues would exceed the operational expenses opex resulting in steady positive cash flows in view of the results it is strongly recommended to perform a more detailed economic feasibility study that also considers capital expenses capex declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
13759,phosphorus can be recovered from wastewater in the form of marketable fertilizers that can be profitable for municipal facilities alleviate the eutrophication of urban rivers and ease further polishing the effluent to produce reclaimed water in this work it is assessed the viability of recovering phosphorous in the treatment plants of a large metropolitan region it is proposed the production of struvite granules from sludge liquors by adding magnesium in a reactor fluidified bed or stirred previously an anaerobic tank would stimulate the action of microorganisms to release phosphorus from the sludge before its digestion applying such process in the five largest treatment facilities of the metropolitan region of são paulo would recover 5 3 tons day of phosphorous and yield 38 0 tons day of struvite granules a preliminary viability assessment was conducted considering operational expenses and potential revenues results indicate the economic viability of this nutrient recovery scheme in this particular region keywords wastewater treatment nutrient recovery phosphorus recovery struvite fertilizer eutrophication 1 introduction wastewater urban plants are steadily evolving to resource recovery facilities there are plenty of opportunities energy can be recovered in the forms of biogas from sludge digestion or as biofuel from dried sludge water is probably the most valuable resource that can be recovered producing reclaimed or recycled water is becoming a must for wastewater treatment plants in water stressed cities and will increase its importance in coming years domestic wastewater has in some countries a significant content in cellulose that resource can be recovered with the use of some technologies the cellvation process removes a cellulose rich sludge from primary clarifiers which can then be used to produce bio composites or biofuel sludges from treatment plants can also be a source of phas polyhydroxyalkanoates which are biodegradable polyesters with comparable properties to some petroleum based polyolefins 1 there are also research focusing on the extraction of acetylsalicylic and salicylic acids from sewage sludge 2 or on the production of bio char for soil amendment 3 phosphorus p and nitrogen n are essential nutrients for plant growing and urban wastewaters are rich on them recovering those nutrients brings a double benefit the first benefit is reducing the load of nutrients discharged to water bodies the presence of p and n in wastewater frequently causes eutrophication of aquatic systems generating conditions of hypoxia or anoxia 4 5 as a second benefit recovering those nutrients for agriculture reduces the dependence on industrial fertilizers that require considerable amount of energy and resources nitrogen fertilizers such as urea are produced mainly through the haber bosch ammonia reaction consuming natural gas and energy phosphate fertilizer is produced mainly through rock phosphate a dwindling resource that needs to be mined and is concentrated in a few countries europe for example lacks of phosphate resources and therefore needs to import them the recovery of p in wastewater treatment plants has been requested as a priority by the eu government germany with its 2017 amendment to the sewage sludge ordinance seems to be leading the way as will make p recovery from sewage sludge mandatory for all wastewater treatment plants larger than 50 000 person equivalents argentina and brazil are lagging behind this trend a step in that direction was taken during the last decade with the approval of legislation regarding the use of sludge from wastewater treatment plants biosolids in argentina resolution 410 18 2018 and brazil resolution 375 2006 there is a lack of studies that focus on producing p and n precipitates from municipal wastewaters in those two south american countries most studies have addressed the environmental problems caused by the release of those substances available literature ranges from eutrophication in coastal watersheds 6 7 to the pollution of watersheds due to the intensive use of fertilizers 8 or the role of detergents as a source of p 9 there has been extensive research regarding the direct application of biosolids in agriculture pasture fields and silviculture with focus on the brazilian context 10 17 some of these previous works highlighted that the sewage sludge generated in brazilian cities can contain a complex mixture of pollutants that are harmful to soil and aquatic biota 18 among them are heavy metals as in some regions industrial effluents are discharged directly into the municipal sewer system 19 the production of granulated fertilizers with high content of p and n from wastewater sludge can overcome the problem of releasing those hazardous components in soils those two key nutrients can be removed from the sludge as iron phosphates calcium phosphates or as pure crystal forms such as vivianite struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate map or potassium struvite magnesium potassium phosphate mpp vivianite and struvite crystals can be commercialized as a fertilizer rich in p and to a lesser extent in n they can be blended with potassium k to produce a more balanced fertilizer or with diammonium phosphate dap which is the world s most widely used phosphorus fertilizer in the case of struvite its blending with dap seems to increase the absorbance in agricultural soils resulting in a slow release effective fertilizer 20 the production of those precipitated salts requires more initial investment that applying wastewater sludge directly due to the need of specific equipment such as reaction vessels or crystallizers there are also some operational costs such as energy for pumps and stirrers or the addition of catalyzers for example magnesium mg to facilitate the controlled precipitation of struvite comparing the production of precipitated salts with applying sludge in fields there are key plus points for precipitated salts that form of nutrient recovery results in a high value commercial product which is concentrated and has less transport costs due to its reduced volume and has a standardized composition free of potential soil pollutants ostara s salt crystal green for example has a guaranteed standardized composition of 5 n 28 p and 10 mg it also has a defined value of the salt index 8 knowing the exact composition and solubility of the fertilizer is crucial for agriculture as allows calculating the dosage depending on the crop and soil characteristics there is higher uncertainty when applying sludge lime or biosolids from wastewater treatment plants as those are much lesser homogeneous products this research aims to contribute to the study of recovering nutrients from urban wastewater in densely populated urban areas of south america in the form of crystallized fertilizer products instead of the direct application of dried sludge that is the main novelty of this work the topic is promising and could reveal interesting business opportunities due to the coincidence of three facts 1 big metropolitan regions such as são paulo 20 million people or buenos aires 13 million providing a significant concentration of domestic wastewater in large treatment facilities the number of urban centers with more than 100 000 inhabitants is 324 for brazil and 91 for argentina although in this second country much of those centers are concentrated around the capital city buenos aires 21 22 2 there is a deficit of fertilizers in these two gigantic exporters of agricultural commodities in brazil fertilizers are the major imports after petrochemical products they represented in 2019 5 3 of the value of all imports in brazil 23 the weight of fertilizers on the imports of argentina is less significant only 2 0 24 but the country is particularly dependent on the imports of phosphatic fertilizers which represents 76 of the overall consumption of phosphate 25 3 the technology for n and p recovery has reached a high level of maturity and efficiency 26 27 there are several successful cases from wastewater treatment plants worldwide that invites to study the applicability and potential profitability of those technologies in south american cities in order to address the topic in sufficient depth this article aims to accomplish the following objectives identify the nutrient recovery process that best suits the wastewater treatment plants that operate in the metropolitan region of são paulo investigate the economic sustainability of such nutrient recovery facilities through a preliminary viability assessment explore the links between recovering nutrients in the region s wastewater facilities and two related issues i eutrophication of the urban rivers in the tietê basin and ii the need for tertiary treatment to produce recycled water more specifically it will be necessary to determine how the production of fertilizer in the facilities would affect the balance of p in são paulo s sewerage system and consequently the load of p reaching the tietê basin 2 materials and methods the area of study is the main sewerage system of são paulo s metropolitan region which is served by five wastewater treatment plants this work assesses the potential of nutrients recovery mainly p in this area aiming the production of a commercial fertilizer in the wastewater plants first the characteristics of the sewerage system in this area were reviewed with focus on those five treatment plants process layouts average flows concentration of nutrients in the input raw wastewater and in the secondary effluent that leaves each plant existing upgrades with tertiary treatment average sludge production it was necessary to identify what will be requested to local wastewater treatment plants in future years in terms of reducing the load of nutrients that is discharged to the urban rivers and recycled water production that provided an accurate perspective of how the region s treatment plants will evolve and which nutrient recovery technologies better suit them following this article provides a review of technologies for nutrient recovery from waste liquid streams digested sludge and sludge ashes among these technologies it was selected the most appropriate ones given the characteristics of the five treatment plants the proposed arrangement suits são paulo s treatment plants in terms of robustness of operation efficiency in reducing the load of nutrients in the effluent and potential to be economically sustainable through the production of high quality fertilizer the technological arrangement that was chosen is based on struvite crystallization and has several units in operation worldwide it was reviewed real data regarding the yield of fertilizer product its average composition efficiency in the removal of p and opex operational expenses costs it was considered that the treatment plants upgraded with the nutrient recovery units should operate under these specifications concentration of 0 49 mg l of total p in the final secondary effluent overall efficiency of 28 9 in the removal of p from the wastewater reduction of 10 in the volume of dry cake of sludge that is produced and content of 14 wt in p in the fertilizer product the potential production of fertilizer was calculated based on the above specifications finally it was assessed the profitability of this nutrient recovery scheme a review of literature and of the local market allowed to set a realistic sale price for the fertilizer product 60 usd ton and also to assess its marketability 3 description of the case study 3 1 sanitation in são paulo the city of são paulo pop 12 2 million is at the core of the largest metropolitan region in the americas pop 20 million each day são paulo generates 1 8 million m3 of wastewater from that volume 86 is collected in the city s sewer system and 70 is treated 28 the city s sewer system was projected to collect domestic wastewater separately from the urban drainage system separating rainwater from sewage favors the operation of treatment plants which have to process less volume of influent it favors as well the recovery of nutrients because that influent is more concentrated however domestic wastewater is discharged illegally into stormwater drains in many parts of the city so a significant part of the volume treated by the city s reclamation plant is urban runoff reverting that situation would be positive for the profitability of nutrient recovery plants and for the sewage system itself which is overloaded during intense rain events most of the wastewater generated in the metropolitan region is collected in two different sewer systems which are the focus of this study sewerage system 1 comprehends four interconnected collection basins with their respective treatment plants those are barueri abc upgraded with aquapolo reclamation plant that produces recycled water for industrial uses parque novo mundo and são miguel sewerage system 2 is an independent basin with an activated sludge plant named suzano it is the oldest one and has a significant contribution of industrial wastewater paper pulp mills dying pharmaceuticals in its influent 29 altogether both sanitation systems serve a population of 8 5 million people fig 1 shows the location of the sewer systems and their treatment plants after treatment the secondary effluent is discharged to into a series of water streams that end up in the tietê river this is the final receiving water body of the largest metropolitan region in the americas 20 million people and presents stretches with extremely high pollution 30 32 it is estimated that 122 km of this river could be dead 33 such level of river degradation is caused by the uncontrolled discharge of domestic wastewater in low income parts of the region in addition storm events commonly cause sewer overflow and waste drag to the urban rivers stormwater overloads the treatment plants of the region particularly são miguel and parque novo mundo which are operating close to their maximum capacity during normal conditions the city hopes that the construction and upgrading of other smaller plants caieiras bandeirantes and maria trinidade would alleviate this situation the discharge of nutrients from wastewater has caused eutrophication in some water bodies that is the case of parts of the guarapiranga reservoir which is one of the key sources of water supply in the region 34 during past decades clandestine and irregular neighborhoods stablished around the reservoir untreated human waste and sewage contaminated rivers and brooks that fed into the reservoir while the sewerage system is slowly being expanded to cover those irregular areas it would also be interesting to consider small decentralized solutions for providing sanitation to those communities fig 2 shows that in the area served by sewerage system 1 only 70 of the generated wastewaters is treated and 14 of wastewaters are not even collected all the wastewater treatment plants operating in this metropolitan region follow the activated sludge process consisting in the following stages preliminary treatment with screen and grit removal primary settling tanks aeration tanks and final clarifiers the underflow sludge from the primary settling tank and the final clarifier the waste activated sludge goes to a facility that stabilizes it and reduces its volume it typically undergoes the stages of thickening through rotary drums or screw press the biodigestion and finally drying drying can be performed mechanically with the use of a filter press or thermally thermal drying produces a sterile granular bio solid with 90 95 solids content but this technique is not very used in the region meanwhile filter press is widely used in são paulo producing a sludge cake with 30 solids content both the thickeners and the filter press produce a filtrate a k a sludge liquor or centrate that is returned to the aeration tanks the dried sludge cake is transported and dumped in the city s landfills which constitutes a high operational cost for the treatment plants previous characterization of the sludge generated in são paulo showed levels of cd cr and ni in the sludge s composition that made it unsuitable for the manufacture of organic fertilizers 19 those analysis pointed to the discharge of industrial wastewater into the municipal sewage network as the source of these heavy metals therefore regarding the production of a fertilizing product with potential uses for agriculture it would be more convenient recovering nutrients in the form of precipitated salts such as struvite or vivianite rather than the application of dried sludge cake any heavy metals would be confined in the sludge cake and dumped in the landfills precipitate salts concentrate the nutrients from wastewater n and p and avoid the risk of potential contaminants being released into agricultural soils 3 2 towards tertiary treatment and water reclamation only two treatment plants of são paulo s metropolitan region provide tertiary treatment after the activated sludge process those are i abc aquapolo and ii parque novo mundo the city s water utility sabesp has the goal to expand tertiary treatment to all the five largest plants of the metropolitan region it is planned to achieve that goal through the progressive installation of modular units the installed capacity of tertiary treatment will be increased from the current 12 000 l s 2020 to 47 400 l s in 2035 28 the tertiary treatment combining advanced biological and membrane processes polishes the secondary effluent by removing ammonia and phosphate as well as inorganic pollutants like silica the latter is a major issue when considering recycled water for industrial purposes as silica forms scale deposits that can be hard glassy adherent and difficult to remove from the internal heating surfaces of boiler units for example the effluent of the tertiary process achieves enough quality to be used as recycled water for non drinkable uses such as street and sewer washing in cities irrigation landscaping golf courses crop fields and industrial uses washing equipment steam generation in boilers or as a cooling fluid in heat exchangers and cooling towers nice examples of water reclamation for irrigation uses are shafdan which supplies 70 of the irrigation needs in israel 35 and atotonilco reclamation plant which treats the wastewater generated by 13 2 million people in the metropolitan area of méxico city 36 37 water stressed cities around the world are more and more considering tertiary treatment and membrane filtering to produce recycled water that can be used to recharge aquifers or distributed through pipe networks for non drinkable purposes it is perfectly possible to further polish the effluent achieving drinkable standards 38 the use of recycled water adds a new business line to the portfolio of water utilities and at the same time allows industry to obtain a stable supply at a lower price from a public perspective reclamation of municipal wastewaters reduces the water stress of cities brazilian municipal laws are steady advancing to foster water reclamation in são paulo the use of tertiary treatment was introduced in 2012 through the aquapolo project the aim of the project was to build a separate facility next to the existing activated sludge plant abc that would produce recycled water from its effluents and sell it to industrial facilities a petrochemical complex located 17 km away from the abc treatment plant was experiencing a decrease in the quality of its water sources groundwater and urban rivers most of its water consumption are due to three non drinkable uses washing equipment steam production and process cooling these two latter uses require a low content of suspended and solved minerals in the process water achieves to avoid scaling and silica deposits and the low quality of nearby water sources was causing operational problems by 2009 the companies at the complex had specified their demands for a steady supply of high quality water for industrial uses the aquapolo tertiary treatment plant was born that year from a joint venture between the city s water utility sabesp owning 49 and a private engineering company foz do brasil odebretch ambiental later bought by brookfield and renamed brk ambiental owning 51 the city s water utility provided access to the municipal sewage and the private company invested in building the reclamation plant and the pipes to supply recycled water to the petrochemical complex the reclamation plant started its operations in 2012 some months later a severe drought came são paulo s 2013 2015 drought and the arrangement showed to be strategic for the industrial facilities the stable supply of recycled water prevented the companies from economic losses due to halting their operations nowadays aquapolo has become the largest reclamation plant in the southern hemisphere and the fifth largest recycled water facility in the world it supplies 650 l s of recycled water through a distribution network to industrial facilities inside and outside the petrochemical complex fig 3 shows an aerial view of the aquapolo facilities which are located next to the abc municipal wastewater treatment plant following it is described the arrangement between the activated sludge treatment plant and the tertiary treatment upgrade the municipal wastewater arrives to the abc treatment plant where undergoes an activated sludge deep shaft treatment that removes 88 of the biological oxygen demand bod 39 the flow of effluent that leaves the abc treatment plant is 2 000 l s its low bod makes it complying with brazil s quality parameters so it is suitable to be discharged in the nearest water body the ribeirão dos meninos brook at this point 650 l s are diverted to the aquapolo reclamation plant and the rest is discharged to that water body there are sensors installed in the pipe to monitor the quality of the treated wastewater that is diverted to aquapolo so the reclamation plant can adjust the processes in order to better deal with variations in the characteristics of its influent real time measures from ph conductivity and turbidity sensors are transmitted to the plant s supervisory control and data acquisition system the abc activated sludge treatment plant was projected for the removal of carbon and organic load but not for an effective removal of ammonia and phosphorus to remove ammoniacal n and p aquapolo s process combined a biological treatment with ultrafiltration membranes in a tertiary membrane bioreactor tmbr the first one in brazil at the time this tertiary treatment avoids discharging 0 6 tonnes of ammonia and 31 4 tonnes of p to the ribeirão dos meninos brook per year 40 fig 4 shows the flowchart of the processes performed at aquapolo the tertiary treatment stages at aquapolo are as follows 1 the first stage is microfiltration wastewater is pumped throughout disk filters to remove particles larger than 400 microns the aim is to remove solids that could harm future stages of membrane filtering ultrafiltration and ro membranes 2 the second stage consists in the tertiary membrane biological reactor tmbr the tmbr unit performs biological treatment with bacteria degrading organic matter in both aerobic and anaerobic zones besides organic matter n and p are also removed the biological reactor consists in a series of tanks that altogether have a volume of 5 350 m³ this digestion of organic matter is followed by ultrafiltration throughout membranes that retain solids and bacteria larger than 0 05 microns the membranes are encapsulated in 9 tanks with 256 m³ each 3 the reverse osmosis ro system is actuated when the conductivity of the water exceeds the specification value of 50 μs cm if that is the case the water stream is by passed to two ro membrane systems that produce 150 l s of permeate 4 the reclamation plant is equipped with an automated disinfection system that doses chlorine dioxide clo2 in key points of the process when arriving at the petrochemical complex the recycled water must have a residual concentration of chlorine dioxide higher than 0 2 mg l table 1 shows that the efficiency of the tertiary treatment performed in aquapolo the average removal rates are 90 2 for p and 99 2 for ammoniacal nitrogen the experience of aquapolo was soon replicated in another treatment plant parque novo mundo which currently supplies 70 l s of recycled water to a paper mill and a textile industry aquapolo s successful case is one of the reasons behind the will to implement tertiary treatment in all the region s facilities by 2035 it proved that there is a commercially viable way to reduce the nutrients released in the tietê basin and at the same time diversifying the water sources of the metropolitan region the abc aquapolo scheme points out the direction to which the region s treatment plants will evolve in the next decade tertiary treatment with membrane filtration aiming the reclamation of water would be widespread any nutrient recovery initiatives projected for the city s treatment plants should take into consideration that evolution trend nutrient recovery units that perform and effective removal of n and p in the activated sludge plant would generate a secondary effluent with low content of both nutrients which would alleviate or even dismiss the need for a mbr downstream in that case future tertiary water reclamation plants in the region could consist in only ultrafiltration followed by reverse osmose 3 3 technical report of processes for the recovery of p municipal wastewater is rich in n p and k the average load from households has been estimated as 13 5 g n 2 1 g p and 4 0 g k per person per day 41 during anaerobic wastewater purification the phosphate present is largely converted into orthophosphate whereas the n is converted into ammonium nitrogen nh4 n during aerobic treatment orthophosphate is formed as well with potassium as counter ion in the ph range of wastewaters around 7 the dominant forms of orthophosphate are h2po4 and hpo4 2 during the treatment stages as the ph increases the dominant form of orthophosphate becomes po4 3 the removal of p from wastewater involves the incorporation of orthophosphate into total suspended solids those can be biological solids microorganisms or chemical precipitates the suspended solids are then settled and removed as sludge in the presence of mg the orthophosphate reacts with ammonium and magnesium ions to form magnesium ammonium phosphate map also known as struvite as shown in eq 1 1 mg2 nh4 po4 3 nh4 mg po4 6h2o struvite alternatively potassium can replace ammonium in the struvite crystal lattice and form magnesium potassium phosphate mpp as shown in eq 2 2 mg2 k po4 3 mgkpo4 6h2o potassium struvite struvite presents as a white crystalline powder in its pure form but can also occur either as large single crystals very small crystals large curds or a gelatinous mass the latter forms are common when this compound scales up in pipes and equipment causing operational issues preventing the unwanted precipitation of struvite in the equipment is a factor that increases the operational costs of a treatment plant it involves the injection of concentrated industrial grade chemicals that dissolve the scale and help prevent future growth however struvite can be precipitated form wastewater in a controlled manner in specifically designed equipment such as fluidified bed or stirred reactors by doing so the treatment plant is prevented from unwanted scale formations at the same time the struvite crystals produced in the reactor represent a concentrated source of p that has a commercial value as a fertilizer these reasons have driven the developing of several processes for the recovery of p as struvite during the last two decades the input for a struvite crystallizer can be any liquid stream concentrated in p swine wastewater 42 or some effluents from food processing plants can be very suitable input streams in municipal wastewater plants most of the p 80 is carried by the waste activated sludge stream was and in the sludge that leaves the primary clarifiers 10 43 was undergoes anaerobic digestion thickening and dewatering the most typical inputs for struvite crystallizing systems are the dewatering sludge liquors a k a centrate produced during the thickening centrifuges output and supernatants and the final dewatering of digested sludges in the filter press filtrate the sludge liquor from primary clarifiers or primary sludge can be used as input stream as well after some treatment there are commercial processes that combine both liquor streams and there are some processes scepphar that are specifically designed to treat primary sludge 44 the p rich input stream is introduced into the reaction vessel where struvite crystallization occurs some struvite formation can occur previously in the anaerobic digester that treats the sludge depending on the hardness of the water magnesium content the sludge liquor carries some mg but to optimize the production of struvite it is necessary to provide an external source of mg such as mgcl2 mgo or mg oh 2 the latter is generally cheaper and has the advantage of also raising the ph the ph range for which struvite can precipitate is between 7 11 most systems use the addition of sodium hydroxide naoh to increase ph and promote struvite precipitation in the reactor 45 other systems increase the ph through air stripping of dissolved carbon dioxide from the sludge or through vacuum degassing elovac in the elophos system in the reaction vessel crystalline struvite drills are formed and grow over several days until they reach the desired size struvite harvesting is quite simple because it has a 1 7 specific density and thus can easily be separated from the effluent the granules are washed as they are conveyed to a dewatering sieve dried using hot air and stocked in silos for bagging the final fertilizer ready to be commercialized meanwhile the effluent of the reactor from which p has been extracted can be conducted back to digestion with was or to the final clarifiers depending on the arrangement of the wastewater treatment plant phosphate can be precipitated with mg to form struvite but also with ca al and fe by adding calcium p can be recovered as calcium phosphate ca3 po4 2 dicalcium phosphate cahpo4 and hydroxyapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh their precipitation reactions are shown in eq 3 5 3 3ca2 2po4 3 ca3 po4 2 calcium phosphate 4 h3po4 ca oh 2 cahpo4 dicalcium phosphate degrades as hap if not hydrated 5 5ca2 3po4 3 oh ca5 po4 3oh hydroxyapatite hap by adding fe p can be recovered as vivianite rates of 82 6 removal of p from was fermentation in anaerobic reactors have been reported 46 the reaction is shown in eq 6 6 fe2 2po4 3 fe 3 po4 2 8h2o vivianite during the last two decades the removal of p from wastewater by adding mg ca and fe in fluidified bed stirred or aerated reactors has been tested in large treatment plants it has proven to be economically viable and robust there is another tertiary nutrient removal and recovery technology that has only been tested in pilot plants but has attracted attention because of its performance and potential the ion exchange iex processes ion exchange is the process of reciprocal transfer of ions between a solution and a resin ammonia and phosphate are selectively removed from the wastewater with specific iex media typically a resin resins containing hydrous ferric oxide for example have a good selectivity for phosphate 47 the transfer capacity of the iex resin is regularly restored by regeneration solutions where the nutrients n p accumulate n and p can be removed from the regenerants with an ammonia stripper or a combined precipitation and filtration process the regenerants can be used multiple times which is a key aspect to ensure economic feasibility of this technological route iex pilot plants are beginning to scale up a small iex unit is being commissioned at a wastewater treatment plant in cranfield uk 48 in that unit n is removed with mesolite media a mineral of the group of zeolites while p is removed with hybrid ion exchange media haix mesolite and other types of zeolites have proven to be very effective to remove ammonia from wastewaters 49 50 while iron doped zeolite are promissory selective adsorbents of p 51 52 after adsorption in mesolite media n is then recovered as ammonium sulfate through a liquid liquid membrane process while p is recovered as hap hydroxyapatite through a precipitation tank followed by filtering all the above technological processes that recover nutrients from liquid waste streams are present in table 2 which summarizes commercial processes and pilot plants developed so far some nutrient recovery systems count with a specific unit to produce a p rich sludge before the stages of digestion thickening and dewatering in order to maximize the amount of p and n that is removed both the primary sludge and the was can undergo biological thermal or chemical treatments to release phosphate to the liquid fraction of the sludge before digestion one of the main technologies is the use of stirred anaerobic tanks that leverage paos phosphorus accumulating organisms the microorganism release p from the influent as they produce vfas volatile fat acids from organic matter after a retention time of around 10 h much of the p has been released 70 in the case of ostara s wasstrip and 50 in the case of the scepphar process meanwhile the metaphos process proposes solubilizing p from was by adding an easily degradable carbohydrate source under anaerobic conditions producing a p rich liquor some plants count with a thermal pressure hydrolysis thp system previous to the anaerobic sludge digester it combines high pressure boiling followed by a rapid decompression although the aim of thp is to improve the digestion performance it also increases the concentration of phosphate and ammonium in the centrate stream obtained after digestion table 3 shows the main processes that are commercially available to release p from the sludge table 2 showed the available systems to recover p from liquid waste streams and table 3 showed some processes to maximize the content of p in the liquid solid mixture that conforms the sludge there are other two technological alternatives to recover p the first one is to recovered p directly from digested sludge without extraction process and without separation of supernatant as occurs for example in the airprex process with the use of an airlift reactor the second is the acidic leaching of digested sludge or of incinerated sludge ashes if acidic leaching is applied to digested sludge the p that is fixed in the solid sludge phase is dissolved into the aqueous phase and then recovered from the supernatant after liquid solid separation most wastewater treatment plants use thermal processes after mechanical dewatering to reduce the volume of the final dry cake of sludge to be dumped in landfills the dry sludge cake can also be incinerated and acidic leaching can be applied to the resulting ashes sludge ash is mainly composed of five elements p ca fe al and si in form of oxides and other inorganic forms the output product of ash leaching technologies such as ashdec leachphos and mephrec has a p content between 5 and 20 making them suitable for use as fertilizers the recovery rate of p from sludge ashes is higher than 70 in almost all technologies and reaches 95 in some of them ashdec 53 table 4 shows commercial and pilot scale processes to recover p from digested sludge and sludge ashes the acidic leaching of incinerated sludge allows for high p extraction but also leads to high heavy metal co extraction 54 most of the processes described on table 4 include systems to capture heavy metals from the ashes in order to preserve the quality of the final fertilizer product heavy metals can also be removed from waste liquid streams such as in the veolia irstea s opalix system which performs metal adsorption of the sludge liquor before it enters the struvite crystallizer not all the above reviewed technologies are suitable for são paulo s treatment plants thermal pressure hydrolysis of was and sludge incineration for example is non existent in the region for são paulo s plants it may be more convenient to use technologies that already have a track record of operational performance and economic viability particularly fluidified bed and stirred reactors for struvite crystallization with the use of such systems the p content in the secondary effluent leaving the treatment plants currently at 4 mg p l on average would be reduced drastically still there would be p available for recovery in the effluent given a technology that could operate efficiently with a more diluted input stream of around 1 2 mg p l iex technology has shown to be viable for input streams around 3 mg p l 55 and presents high recovery rates of nutrients it could replace the use of mbrs membrane biological reactors to provide effective tertiary treatment and cope with the city s aim of increasing the production of recycled water acting together with membrane technologies ultrafiltration and reverse osmose for são paulo s treatment plants it is proposed an arrangement with priority focus on struvite crystallization in fluidized bed or stirred reactors using the sludge liquors it is strongly recommended to combine those reactors with the use of anaerobic reactors that enhance the content of p in the input liquor once such a system is implemented the next step should be collecting data to update the concentration of total p in the secondary effluent that leaves each treatment plant if that concentration is still beyond 1 2 mg p l it could be considered an iex process that uses as input the final effluent of the activated sludge plant that is the overflow of the secondary clarifiers fig 5 depicts this ideal arrangement 4 results and discussion this study assumed a per capita production of 1 8 g p person day which results in a concentration of 13 9 mg p l in são paulo s raw wastewater that value is coherent with literature that refers to concentrations between 4 0 and 16 0 mg p l in urban wastewaters 56 the average reported value for the effluent leaving the activated sludge treatment plants is 4 0 mg p l only abc aquapolo and parque novo mundo manage to further lower that concentration by providing tertiary treatment for this study and considering the evolution trend of são paulo s treatment plants it seemed appropriate to consider 0 49 mg p l in the effluent which is the current value of aquapolo s plant that value complies with the maximum concentration of p for effluents discharged in the tietê river that according to the brazilian environmental norm 357 05 should be 0 50 mg p l 57 achieving that final concentration of p in the final effluent would imply removing 96 5 of the load of p that enters the city s sewage system as fig 6 shows to comply with the brazilian environmental norm and alleviate the eutrophication of the tietê basin the five treatment plants should remove 17 732 kg p day from the sewage system after carefully reviewing the available technologies for nutrient recovery as well as the characteristics of the existing treatment plants it was proposed a struvite crystallization system with a previous anaerobic tank to release p from sludge fig 5 that p recovery system could be complemented with an iex unit to further treat the secondary effluent if necessary but that upgrade was not considered for this assessment simulations were run to calculate the amount of p that could be feasible to harvest from the total potential 17 732 kg p day given the proposed arrangement the resulting recovery of p was 5319 kg p day or 28 9 of the overall potential the yield of struvite granules with 14 wt p is shown on table 5 after the upgrading of the treatment plants the balance of p would be as follows 646 kg p day 3 5 of the initial load would be discharged in the tietê basin 12 412 kg p day 67 5 p of the initial load would be contained in the dry sludge cake primary was and dumped in the city s landfills and 5319 kg p day 28 9 of the initial load would be recovered as struvite granules the production of struvite granules would be 38 tons day in order to assess the economic sustainability of producing that amount of struvite it is necessary to calculate the potential revenues and opex the sale of struvite fertilizer would represent 71 of revenues the rest 29 would be the savings due to the decrease in volume of the dried cake which has a cost of 1400 usd per ton that needs to be transported and dumped into the city s landfills the sale price of struvite was estimated as 60 usd ton after local market research and literature reviewing 59 meanwhile the operating costs of the fluidified bed reactor that precipitates struvite would be shared as follows 74 chemicals mgcl2 and naoh 17 electricity and 9 maintenance table 6 provides the estimated profitability of struvite production for each plant the results obtained are consistent with similar assessments 60 producing struvite fertilizer in the city s treatment plant seems able to generate a positive cash flow future assessments should take into consideration capex costs to detail if that cash flow is able to justify a viable business scheme it is fair to question how well the yield of 38 tons day of struvite granules would integrate within the existing distribution channels for fertilizers and if the local market would be able to absorb that volume of product regarding logistics the region presents unbeatable distribution channels for the commercialization of the product the metropolitan region of são paulo is located in the epicenter of the market of fertilizers in the country são paulo state accounts for 20 of brazil s fertilizers consumption and its neighboring states paraná and minas gerais for other 26 the state of são paulo concentrates 42 of the industry of fertilizers in brazil 61 regarding the marketability of the product struvite granules are unknown by local consumers however it presents key characteristics in terms of size it is produced as powder granules or pellets and in composition that makes it very suitable for the local market the most common type of fertilizer that is consumed in brazil is a blend of granulates having 64 of the market share 62 regarding the n p k formula which represents the percentual composition of the three macro nutrients in the fertilizer the most preferred one in the region is 17 10 15 17 of nitrogen 10 of phosphorus and 15 of potassium the granules of struvite precipitated with mg lack of k some typical compositions are 5 0 n 28 0 p and 10 0 mg crystalgreen 5 8 n 12 2 p and 10 4 mg phosphogreen 5 5 n 12 5 p and 9 5 mg ekobalans 5 7 n 12 6 p and 9 9 mg struvia 5 0 n 28 6 p and 10 0 mg naskeo 5 6 n 12 6 p and 10 0 mg bio stru therefore struvite granules should be blended with other sources rich in n and k to achieve the formula that is demanded by the market in the region or else marketed directly as a source of p and n for soils there is also the possibility of adapting the crystallization process to produce a more balanced precipitate composed by both struvite map and potassium struvite mpp so it contains n p k 41 63 the above results have shown that producing struvite at são paulo s wastewater treatment plants would be feasible would help to achieve the goal of providing tertiary treatment and produce more recycled water and in addition has the potential to be economically sustainable but from a wider perspective considering the balance of trade of the country there would be additional benefits finished n p k fertilizers represent the second largest imports of brazil as the nation s industry is not able to cope with the demand of its huge agricultural sector moreover the industry of fertilizers in brazil also relies on the imports of raw materials ammonia rock phosphate and sulfuric acid 64 it has experienced a steady increase in the cost of raw materials which currently represent half of the production costs 61 currently são paulo state imports 603 414 tons year of rock phosphate with an average content of 30 wt in p2o5 producing struvite in the considered treatment plants would reduce those imports by 2 5 that seems a modest figure but represents an important additional benefit that should also be taken into consideration 5 conclusions the recovery of nutrients from wastewater should be taken into consideration among the technical alternatives to reduce eutrophication in the tietê basin the production of struvite granules from sludge liquors is a reliable technology that inserts well within the current process layout of são paulo s activated sludge treatment plants if combined with a previous anaerobic tank that releases p in the sludge before its digestion it has the potential of lowering the load of that nutrient in the effluent to values below 0 50 mg l that would ease further polishing the effluent to produce reclaimed water the economic assessment of the production of struvite indicates potential profitability in the considered facilities the expected revenues would exceed the operational expenses opex resulting in steady positive cash flows in view of the results it is strongly recommended to perform a more detailed economic feasibility study that also considers capital expenses capex declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the
