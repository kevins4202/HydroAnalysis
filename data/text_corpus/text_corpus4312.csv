21560,in the recent decades the occurrence of hypoxia in coastal bottom waters has had adverse influences on the ecological system and fishery production therefore to address this an innovative aeration device with an array of four wave driven heaving buoys was proposed in this study to produce bubbles and supply oxygen into the bottom seawater a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the device in regular waves and a relatively simple 3 d computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical model was used to simulate the motion response of the array of four heaving buoys the results indicate that the average heaving amplitude aha and the capture width ratio cwr of the seaside buoy are higher than those of the lee side buoy specifically with increasing incident wave height aha increases but cwr decreases both aha and cwr decrease with the increments in incident wave steepness relative height and density of buoy and relative equivalent damping coefficient furthermore the prediction formulas were calculated to assess the aha of the seaside and lee side buoys with a relatively high accuracy the results obtained are significant for the optimal design and operation of the proposed innovative aeration device keywords hypoxia regular waves an array of heaving buoys average heaving amplitude aha capture width ratio cwr 1 introduction dissolved oxygen is an important index used for denoting the seawater quality and it primarily regulates the biological and chemical processes in the seawater the hypoxia i e dissolved oxygen concentration doc 2 0 mg l or approximately 30 saturation contributes considerably to the slow growth and reproduction capability of aquatic organisms and the deterioration of seawater quality diaz and rosenberg 2008 ram et al 2014 furthermore a large number of fishes and invertebrates were found to escape from the water body with doc 4 mg l and the survival of benthic invertebrate species will be severely affected in water with doc 2 mg l diaz 2001 in the recent decades hypoxia has increasingly become a critical problem in the marine ecosystem diaz and rosenberg 2008 rabalais et al 2009 2010 the average doc in the global oceans has decreased by 2 since 1960s to 2008 and the number of hypoxia coastal zones was annually growing at an exponential rate of 5 54 vaquer sunyer and duarte 2008 gilbert 2017 schmidtko et al 2017 globally more than 400 hypoxia sea zones have been reported and a total area of more than 245000 km2 was affected including the baltic kattegat black sea gulf of mexico and the east china sea schmidtko et al 2017 pointed out that numerous oceanic regions exhibited a significant decline in oxygen levels such as the equatorial and north pacific ocean the southern ocean and the south atlantic ocean the northern adriatic sea mediterranean was also severely affected by hypoxia stachowitsch 1984 recently this region was classified as a zone at medium to high risk of intermittent hypoxia and anoxia unep 2012 according to this phenomenon djakovac et al 2015 explained the mechanisms of observed changes in hypoxia events frequency in the northern adriatic sea based on oxygen data series collected in the period 1972 2012 the hypoxia depth was as high as 40 m in the northwest shelf area of the black sea the maximum hypoxia area was approximately 40000 km2 and the measured minimum doc was 0 mg l zaitsev 2006 furthermore the doc significantly decreased below the thermocline of california sea bograd et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge the leading causes of sea hypoxia are the seawater eutrophication and stratification strengthened by global warming tendency in general due to the facilitation of oxygen supply from the atmosphere the surface seawater has a higher doc value however the vertical stratification plays a negative role in the mixing capability and oxygen transport between surface and bottom seawater and the severe hypoxia frequently occurs in bottom seawater coupling with the effect of organic material decomposition rabalais et al 2014 therefore research on artificial oxygen supply in seawater is of scientific and practical significance for the water purification and marine ecological restoration a few artificial technologies have attracted broad interest by strengthening the vertical mixing and oxygen transport capability between surface and bottom seawater the original purpose of enhancing water exchange is to increase the fishery production by pumping nutrient rich water from the ocean bottom to the surface isaacs et al 1976 vershinsky et al 1987 liu and qiao 1995 maruyama et al 2004 kenyon 2007 more recently some new type of devices have been analyzed to strengthen the vertical water exchange and mitigate hypoxia at bottom waters through pumping surficial water downward with the use of wave energy margheritini and claeson 2011 demonstrated the technical and financial feasibility of a wave energized aeration pump device for conducting a site test for mitigating hypoxia at bottom waters near the stockholm coast in sweden a wave driven oxyflux device first proposed by antonini et al 2012 was applied to transport the oxygen rich surface water into deep layer based on that a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the dynamic response and pumping capacity of the wave driven oxyflux device under a variety of wave conditions by changing wave steepness antonini et al 2015 subsequently the dynamic response of oxyflux device was numerically investigated through a 3 d cfd numerical model antonini et al 2016 xiao et al 2018 showed that a downwelling flow in theory can alleviate the hypoxia for bottom seawater through a tide current driven pump with a 90 bend and a vertical pipe subsequently the theoretical model was validated with experimental data to predict the accurate hydrodynamic parameters for pump design consideration in practical applications aeration is an alternative solution for dealing with the hypoxia problem in water however little attention has been devoted to its research under sea hypoxia circumstances a water lifting aerator was developed by cong et al 2009 to restrain the ammonia nitrogen released from the sediments and solve the low doc problem in the lower layer at the fenhe reservoir their results showed that it saved 77 of electrical energy in comparison to other water treatment technologies an aeration device with a wave driven heaving buoy was experimentally conducted to generate air bubbles for increasing the doc in deep seawater and the response amplitude of heaving components and the airflow rate were explored by varying the wave parameters yin et al 2018 in an attempt to efficiently address the hypoxia problem an innovative aeration device with an array of wave driven heaving buoys is proposed to intermittently produce air bubbles in deep water for enhancing the doc it is driven by water waves to ensure environmental friendliness without the consumption of fossil fuels furthermore the device consists of an array of four heaving buoys rather than a single buoy therefore it theoretically has a high wave energy capture performance in this study a series of experiments and a 3 d cfd numerical model were used to explore the hydrodynamic performance of the device in regular waves the aha and cwr of seaside and lee side buoys were examined with various wave and geometrical parameters and the prediction formulas were deduced to depict the aha the objective is to shed some light on optimization and engineering applications of the proposed innovative aeration device 2 device structure and experimental setup 2 1 device structure fig 1 shows that the device comprises the heaving components and the immovable components the heaving components were composed of four independent cylindrical buoys of 0 20 m in diameter and 0 10 m in height to absorb wave energy four independent pistons of 0 06 m in diameter and 0 002 m in thickness to suck or exclude air four independent connecting rods of 0 02 m in diameter and 0 30 m height to connect the buoys and the pistons and eight pins were fixed together with the aforementioned four buoys the two seaside buoys were marked as 1 and 2 respectively and the two lee side buoys were marked as 3 and 4 the axis distance between the two seaside buoys was 0 25 m which was equal to that of the two lee side buoys the axis distance between 1 and 3 buoys was also 0 25 m similar to that for 2 and 4 buoys the immovable components comprised the aeration components and the supporting components the main parts of the aeration components were four air cylinders with a height of 0 30 m and an inner diameter of 0 06 m there were two one way valves at the bottom of each air cylinder the one way inlet valve connected an air inlet tube with 0 01 m diameter to suck air from the atmosphere and the other one way outlet valve connected an air outlet tube with 0 01 m diameter to release the air into deep hypoxia zone the supporting components comprised four supporting frames for 0 20 m in height to fix the two horizontal square plates for 0 60 m 0 60 m eight circular steel slide bars for 0 01 m in diameter and 0 90 m in height to guide the heaving motion through the eight pins the total height of device was 1 0 m and the physical picture of the device used for the experiments is also presented in fig 2 each buoy with a hollow core was made of polyvinyl chloride material and the overall average density of each buoy was 350 kg m3 and the two horizontal square plates of supporting components were constructed of acrylic glass material 2 2 experimental setup and phenomena a series of physical experiments were conducted in a wave flume at the hydrodynamic laboratory of ocean university of china the length height and width of the flume were 25 0 m 1 0 m and 1 2 m respectively fig 3 depicts the experimental sketch at one end of the wave flume a vertical piston type wave paddle was used to generate regular waves and x 0 was defined as the balanced position of wave paddle at the other end the flume a large amount of porous material was installed to attenuate the unwanted wave reflection the device location was determined to ensure the fully developed wave and attenuate the secondary wave reflection effect on the device due to the wave paddle the central axis of seaside buoy was positioned at x 14 m after the balanced position of wave paddle the exit of each air outlet tube was fixed at the bottom of water flume at the top of flume side walls the intake of each air inlet tube was fixed to ensure a sufficient distance to the wave surface for air suction due mainly to the limitation of experimental facilities the ratio of the flume width to the width of the heaving components of the device was a relatively small value of 2 22 however similar ratios were well used in many published literatures such as 2 32 in bjarte larsson and falnes 2006 2 0 in kang et al 2012 and 2 22 in zang et al 2017 it was accepted that the natural frequency was a fundamental parameter to understand the dynamic behavior of the device a decay test was performed in still water to determine the natural period of each buoy with a value of 2 1 s and the corresponding natural frequency was about 2 99 rad s four wave gauges wg1 wg2 wg3 and wg4 in fig 3 with a sampling frequency of 50 hz were arranged at the centerline of the flume to measure the wave height histories wg1 wg2 and wg3 were fixed in front of the device to roughly identify the incident and reflected waves by using the three point method proposed by zelt and skjelbreia 1992 wp4 was placed behind the device to measure the wave transmission the distances between wp1 and wp2 and between wp2 and wp3 were determined based on the method of zelt and skjelbreia 1992 four miran kpm22 displacement sensors with an accuracy of 0 0001 m were used to measure the vertical displacement history of four heaving buoys respectively the two ends of aforementioned displacement sensors were respectively fixed on the top portions of the heaving components and a transverse structure at the top of the wave tank both the wave gauges and displacement sensors were calibrated carefully before performing the experiments with respect to the incident wave parameters in the experiments the range of regular wave height h was 0 14 m 0 22 m with an interval of 0 02 m and the wave period t ranged from 1 5 s to 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s the still water depth d was controlled as a constant of 0 5 m for all the experimental scenarios the wave reflection coefficient was assessed by performing tests without the device for the same wave parameters in the wave flume the fast fourier transform technique was used to perform the reflection analysis it was found that despite the presence of porous material at the end of the flume the wave reflection coefficients were about 15 in this study this indicated that the impact from wave reflection cannot be ignored hence to eliminate the influence of wave reflection due to the flume end only a portion of the time series 7 s 17 s of the wave surface elevation unaffected by wave reflection was used to validate the numerical model and further hydrodynamic investigation during the experimental process it was observed that when the buoys heaved from the low position to its high position under the combined effect of the vertical wave excitation force and buoyancy force etc the outside atmospheric air was sucked into the air cylinders through the air inlet tubes and the one way inlet valves when the buoys moved from the high position back to the low position the pressed air in the air cylinders was released into the bottom of a wave flume through the one way outlet valves and the air outlet tubes four bubbly jets intermittently occurred in the vicinity of ends of four air outlet tubes the bubbles oscillated to ascend and subsequently escaped from the wave surface based on the measured wave surface elevations at x 10 m location the wave surface elevation near the device x 14 m was roughly estimated using the linear wave propagation theory fig 4 shows the time series of estimated wave surface elevation η at x 14 m location and experimental heaving displacements z for buoys 1 and 3 it is seen that the heaving periods of buoys 1 and 3 are identical with the incident wave period and the range of heaving motion of buoy 3 is roughly smaller than that of buoy 1 as expected a relatively obvious phase lag about π occurred between the heaving motions of buoys and the wave surface elevation and a slight phase lag of π 10 occurred between the heaving motions of buoys 1 and 3 3 3 d cfd numerical model 3 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in this study the rans equations i e the continuity and momentum equations eqs 1 and 2 are used to model the unsteady incompressible wave field 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j ρ g i where u i is the mean velocity component in i direction x i is the cartesian space coordinate t is the time ρ is the fluid density p is pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of water g i is the acceleration of gravity in i direction and u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor the volume of fluid method vof presented by hirt and nichols 1981 is used for tracking the wave surface and the governing equation can be expressed as follows 3 α t α u i x i 0 where α is the volume fraction of water in a cell α 1 means the cell is full of water α 0 means the cell is full of air and 0 α 1 denotes the cell contains a free boundary the rng k ε model is used to model the wave

model coefficients yakhot and orszag 1986 as shown in fig 1 the device geometry is relatively complicated and the measurement of acting force between the piston and air cylinder is difficult with high accuracy in experiments in addition it is arduous to consider the geometry of all the heaving and immovable components in numerical model as a result an array of four cylindrical buoys are used to represent the device the immovable components along with the four pistons connecting rods and pins are neglected during computation and the effects of aforementioned neglected components on heaving buoys are taken into account by using the equivalent damping coefficient c b to simplify the numerical calculations moreover note that the equivalent damping coefficient only used in the numerical study which includes the structural damping coefficient caused by friction and the external damping coefficient caused by air suction and extrusion the vertical motion of the heaving buoys is explored by newton s second law and the governing equation is as follows 6 m d 2 z t d t 2 f b f e f v where m is the system mass which includes the net mass of heaving components and the additional mass of water body z t is vertical displacement of the buoy the net buoyancy force f b the equivalent damping force f e and the vertical wave excitation force f v are depicted as follows 7 f b ρ g s 1 η t z t

stationary c m is the inertia coefficient u z is the water velocity in the z direction fig 5 shows the schematic view of the computational domain and the boundary conditions the length height and width of the numerical wave flume were 25 0 m 1 0 m and 1 2 m respectively and the four buoys were set at the x 14 m location consistent with the experimental setup its left boundary was set as wave boundary and the porous medium with a porosity of 0 7 was set on the right side to absorb the waves the right and the bottom boundaries were both set as wall boundaries with zero slip velocity and the four buoys boundaries were set as wall boundaries with a free degree of heaving motion the two sides of the numerical flume were both set as symmetrical boundaries after a comparison with the no slip wall boundaries and the flow flux and fluid shear stress were all set as zero using the dirichlet boundary condition furthermore the upper boundary was set as the atmosphere inlet boundary i e the pressure value was assumed as zero 3 2 computational mesh sensitivity analysis the computational domain was partitioned using structural grids by flow 3d software the grid convergence index gci method was applied to test the grid independence which was an acceptable and recommended method that had been evaluated in over several hundred cfd cases richardson 1911 celik et al 2008 the density ρ b diameter d b height h b and equivalent damping coefficient c b of each buoy used for computational mesh sensitivity analysis were 350 kg m3 0 2 m 0 1 m and 0 n s m respectively the discretization error for the water velocities and the free surface elevations were computed by richardson extrapolation table 1 tabulates the extrapolated relative errors at the x 8 m location for incident wave height h 0 14 m and wave period t 1 8 s three sizes of relatively coarse cells were used for the far field domain partition in the gci calculations s 1 0 01 m for grid 1 s 2 0 02 m for grid 2 and s 3 0 04 m for grid 3 respectively where s represents the coarse grid size and the subscripts of 1 2 and 3 denote the numbers of grid partition scheme additionally the grids near four buoys and wave surface were further refined the refined grid sizes were 0 002 m 0 004 m and 0 008 m corresponding to grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 respectively it is found that with the decreasing total number of cells from 1390625 for grid 1 to 515625 for grid 2 the discretization errors of water velocity and wave surface elevation are rather small i e 0 4 and 0 1 respectively fig 6 depicts the computational wave elevation histories with grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 at the x 8 m location for h 0 14 m and t 1 8 s a relatively high deviation appears between grid 3 and the other grids i e grid 1 and grid 2 however there is a slight difference between grid 2 and grid 1 which indicates that the grid 2 scheme is relatively independent of the computational results therefore the grid 2 scheme is selected for the subsequent computations after considering the balance between accuracy and computational speed 3 3 numerical model validation the experimental data were used to validate the accuracy of the aforementioned numerical model the density ρ b diameter d b and height h b of each buoy in the numerical model were 350 kg m3 0 2 m and 0 1 m respectively which were consistent well with the experimental conditions however the equivalent damping coefficient c b cannot be directly obtained by the experiments a user defined function was used to model the equivalent damping force acting on the buoys in the numerical model the repeated numerical tests with different c b were performed and c b 200 n s m was determined in numerical model validation from the comparison of the numerical and experimental heaving displacements fig 7 shows the time series of wave surface elevation η at x 10 m location with the device effect for h 0 16 m and t 1 8 s where the solid line denotes the numerical results and the circles denote experimental data an overall agreement is observed between numerical wave surface elevations and experimental data and their periods are consistent well with those of the incident wave however the slight discrepancies occur between numerical wave surface elevations and experimental data at wave crest and trough locations due to mainly the complex effect between waves and buoys note that the locations of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are precisely symmetrical in the wave flume and also in the case of buoy 3 and buoy 4 thus their heaving performance shows an obvious similarity both in experiments and numerical data consequently buoy 1 and buoy 3 are chosen to represent seaside and lee side buoys for subsequent investigation respectively fig 8 shows the time series of the heaving displacements z for buoys 1 and 3 with h 0 16 m and t 1 8 s 2 4 s where z 0 corresponds to the position of the buoy s centroid in still water it is found that the heaving characteristics of buoys 1 and 3 are highly similar for the same t and their heaving periods agree well with the incident wave periods the heaving displacement range slightly differs with t 1 8 s and 2 4 s scenarios while the crest values of z for t 2 4 s are larger than that for t 1 8 s and an apparent asymmetry of heaving displacement curve appears for t 2 4 s fig 8 a and b show that the experimental z values are slightly higher than the numerical data at the crest and trough locations however their heaving ranges agree well with each other which can guarantee a relatively accurate estimation of aha fig 8 c and d illustrate that the numerical z values are consistent well with the experimental data even at the crest and trough locations it is interesting to note that the downward displacement decreases slightly at 0 01 m z 0 m range before the trough locations as shown in fig 8 c and d a possible reason is that the asymmetry between the wave crests and troughs becomes more pronounced for large wave period and this contributes to the nonlinearity of the heave motion figs 7 and 8 show that the time series of the wave surface elevation and heaving displacements are reasonably predicted in the numerical model illustrating that the aforementioned 3 d cfd numerical model is acceptable for predicting the hydraulic parameters of the wave driven heaving buoys 3 4 numerical calculation scenarios a total of 196 numerical scenarios were used to explore the heaving performance of buoys with various wave parameters buoys properties and equivalent damping coefficients the range of the equivalent damping coefficient c b was 100 n s m to 400 n s m with an interval of 100 n s m the volume of each buoy v b v b π 4 h b d b 2 was a constant with a value of 0 00314 m³ to simply the research the aforementioned numerical scenarios were divided into two groups and the detailed information was listed in table 2 in group ⅰ the buoy height h b buoy diameter d b and buoy density ρ b are constant the influence of wave elements on the heaving motion for different c b was investigated by changing h and t h was varied from 0 14 m to 0 22 m with an interval of 0 02 m and t was varied from 1 5 s to 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s with respect to group ⅱ h and t were given respectively the effect of the buoy geometry on the heaving motion for four different equivalent damping coefficients was explored by varying h b and d b d b was varied from 0 16 m to 0 24 m with an interval of 0 02 m and the corresponding h b values are about 0 156 m 0 123 m 0 100 m 0 083 m and 0 069 m respectively additionally the range of ρ b was 250 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 with an interval of 50 kg m3 4 results and discussion two parameters are defined for following exploration to quantify the effects of wave parameters and buoys property on the heaving performance i e aha eq 10 and cwr of incident wave energy eq 11 10 z b 1 n i 1 n z i max z i min where n is the number of the complete period of buoy motion in each test within 150 s range zi max and zi min denote the maximum and the minimum values of heaving displacements in the ith period respectively note that n is not a constant with varying wave period and it increases with decreasing wave period as expected for the largest t 2 7 s scenarios in group ⅰ n is more than 50 within 150 s range and eq 10 is capable of illustrating the heaving performance of buoys 11 η b p 0 p wave 100 where p 0 is the average wave power extracted by the buoy can be calculated using eq 12 12 p 0 c b z b t 2 2 p wave is the mean power of the incident wave perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and it is expressed as follows using linear wave theory 13 p wave 1 16 ρ g h 2 l t 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d d b where l g t 2 2 π tanh k d is wavelength k is wave number and k 2π l 4 1 incident wave parameters effect 4 1 1 incident wave height effect fig 9 depicts the z b value of buoys 1 and 3 versus the incident wave height h for various values of t as expected the results show that z b increases with increasing h the value of z b of buoy 3 is lower than that of buoy 1 a possible reason is that the seaside buoy absorbs a part of the incident wave energy to reduce the wave force on the lee side buoy consequently the wave power extracted by lee side buoy decreases another reason could be that the reflected wave from the lee side buoy plays an essential role in increasing the variation of wave surface elevation at the location of seaside buoy the wave force and the extracted wave power on seaside buoy also increase the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 gradually reduces with increasing t for the given h scenarios for instance in the case of h 0 22 m the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 for t 1 5 s is 0 35 cm which is significantly larger than 0 08 cm for t 2 7 s as presented in fig 9 a consequently the values of z b of buoys 1 and 3 approach to each other for t 2 7 s and their difference can therefore be neglected without causing a large deviation furthermore fig 9 a shows that the range of z b value is varied from 4 78 cm to 7 88 cm for c b 100 n s m while fig 9 d shows that z b value is within the range of 1 45 cm 3 20 cm for c b 400 n s m the z b value for c b 100 n s m is much larger than that for c b 400 n s m which indicates that the equivalent damping coefficient plays an essential role in the heaving motion of both seaside and lee side buoys fig 10 illustrates η b versus incident wave height h for various values of t it is found that η b of buoys 1 and 3 decrease with increasing h which is opposite to the relationship between z b and h as shown in fig 9 the η b values of buoy 3 are lower than those of the buoy 1 in general this is consistent with the z b tendency of buoys 1 and 3 as shown in fig 9 the reduction of η b for large wave period is smaller than that for small period with increasing h with respect to c b 100 n s m scenarios in fig 10 a the η b value of buoy 1 decreases from 6 24 to 3 55 and η b value of buoy 3 decreases from 6 03 to 3 14 with increasing h from 0 14 m to 0 22 m for t 1 5s however the η b value of buoy 1 and 3 decreases from 2 85 to 1 49 and 2 82 to 1 46 respectively for t 2 7 s note that for t 2 4 s and t 2 7 s scenarios a large proportion of η b values of buoys 1 and 3 are found to approach to each other in fig 10 a and b this finding can be attributed to the wave surface elevation varies slowly for high t scenarios the buoys 1 and 3 follow the wave motion relatively well with small c b values and z b differences and η b differences tend to reduce 4 1 2 incident wave period effect fig 11 shows the relationship between z b of buoy 1 and 3 and incident wave period t clearly as the wave period increases the z b values of buoy 1 and 3 roughly increase it is interesting to note that the average increment of z b value is 0 20 cm with increasing t from 1 8 s to 2 1 s and is 0 84 cm with increasing t from 2 1 s to 2 4 s in fig 11 b and c this indicates that the z b increases slightly as t increases from 1 8 s to 2 1 s however z b increases sharply with increasing t from 2 1 s to 2 4 s the accurate reason is still unknown to our knowledge due to the complex effect between waves and buoys however a possible explanation is that the natural period of buoys is 2 1 s in addition the increasing amplitude of z b varies a little with increasing t from 2 4 s to 2 7 s which indicates that z b is not sensitive to the t variation for high t scenarios fig 12 depicts η b of buoys 1 and 3 versus incident wave period t for various values of h fig 12 a shows that η b roughly decreases with increasing t for relatively small c b scenarios fig 12 b c and d show that with increasing t for relatively high c b scenarios except for the buoy 1 with h 0 14 m and 0 16 m η b decreases firstly follows an increase and then decreases again the relatively small η b appears at t 2 1 s in fig 12 b c and at t 1 8 s in fig 12 d respectively this trend is consistent with the conclusion reported by zhang et al 2019 that with increasing wave period the η b of a point wave energy converter increases in low wave period region and decreases in high wave period region however in our study in the lower wave period region i e t 1 5 s 2 1 s in fig 12 b c and t 1 5 s 1 8 s in fig 12 d respectively η b decreases with increasing t the reason is unknown yet but one possibility is that low c b values are used in fig 12 b c and d hence the relatively large deviation occurs from the tendency reported by zhang et al 2019 4 1 3 incident wave steepness effect fig 13 shows the relationship between the relative aha z b h and incident wave steepness h l for different c b and ρ b scenarios it is found that as h l increases z b h values of buoy 1 and 3 decrease slightly the reason could be that for increasing l with a given h h l decreases the incident wave energy increases and the energy captured by buoys also becomes more substantial which in turn increases z b and z b h for increasing h with a given l the results fig 9 show that z b increases however the increasing ratios of z b to h are smaller than 1 consequently z b h decreases with increasing h l it is also observed that the z b h values of buoy 1 and 3 are almost equal for c b 400 n s m illustrating that in this case of a high c b the effect of h l on seaside and lee side buoy weakens and the phenomenon that z b values of buoy 3 are smaller than those of buoy 1 is not evident any more fig 14 shows the relationship between η b and incident wave steepness h l for various values of c b it is found that η b decreases with an increasing incident wave steepness for a given c b scenario in each inset of fig 14 the reduction of η b value for low equivalent damping coefficient is larger than that for high equivalent damping coefficient for instance fig 14 b shows that with increasing h l from 0 039 to 0 062 the η b value of buoy 1 decreases from 5 03 to 2 67 and buoy 3 decreases from 4 55 to 2 43 for c b 100 n s m corresponding to low equivalent damping coefficient while for c b 400 n s m corresponding to high equivalent damping coefficient the η b value of buoy 1 decreases from 2 02 to 1 34 and buoy 3 decreases from 1 76 to 1 13 this also indicates that the small equivalent damping coefficient contributes to the high η b value for given h l scenarios 4 2 geometry parameters effect 4 2 1 the relative height effect to further investigate the effects of geometrical parameters on the heaving performance of buoys aha z b and buoy height are normalized respectively by wave height and buoy diameter the relationship between the relative values of z b h and the relative height h b d b with various values of c b is shown in fig 15 it is found that z b h of buoys 1 and 3 decrease slightly with increasing h b d b the reason is that with the decreasing d b accompanying with increasing h b causes an increase in h b d b and a decrease in p wave and z b consequently a flat cylinder buoy performs better in heaving response than a slim cylinder buoy with an equal volume furthermore the average values of z b h for buoys 1 and 3 are 0 248 and 0 242 respectively which indicates that the z b h values of buoy 1 are slightly higher than those of buoy 3 the significant differences of z b h between the seaside and lee side buoys only appear at h b d b 0 29 and 0 38 for c b 100 n s m as shown in each inset of fig 15 the relationship between η b and the relative height h b d b is illustrated in fig 16 the average values of η b for buoy 1 and 3 are 2 56 and 2 44 respectively this indicates that the η b values of buoy 3 are slightly lower than those of the buoy 1 thus confirming that the wave power absorption effect of the seaside buoy is better than that of the lee side buoy see figs 10 12 and 14 the η b decreases with increasing h b d b as shown in each inset of fig 16 and this conclusion is in agreement with the results that total power absorption efficiencies increase with increasing buoy diameter reported by gao and yu 2018 4 2 2 buoy density effect fig 17 shows the relationship between z b of buoys 1 and 3 and buoy density ρ b as buoy density increases the z b values of buoys 1 and 3 decrease slightly indicating that buoy density plays a slightly negative role in z b values the maximum and average values of z b for buoy 1 are 7 69 cm and 3 97 cm respectively while the maximum and average values of z b for buoy 3 are 7 21 cm and 3 87 cm respectively therefore the buoy density plays a greater role in the heaving displacements for seaside buoys than for the lee side buoys furthermore the average values of z b for c b 100 n s m 200 n s m 300 n s m and 400 n s m are 6 35 cm 3 98 cm 2 94 cm and 2 41 cm respectively this finding indicates that the z b values are sensitive to c b for relatively small c b scenarios and the small equivalent damping coefficient contributes to high z b values fig 18 depicts the relationship between the η b and buoy density ρ b similar to the relationship between z b and ρ b as shown in fig 17 it is found that η b decreases with increasing ρ b the η b values of buoy 3 are also lower than that of the buoy 1 and this can be obvious observed in fig 18 a the mean values of η b for buoy 1 and 3 in fig 18 a are 3 43 and 3 23 respectively furthermore the average values of η b for c b 100 n s m 200 n s m 300 n s m and 400 n s m are 3 33 2 61 2 14 and 1 91 respectively this also indicates that the η b is sensitive to c b for relatively small c b scenarios and the small equivalent damping coefficient contributes to high η b values in our study 4 3 equivalent damping coefficient effect the results of the relationship between z b and c b are presented in fig 19 which determines the effect of the equivalent damping coefficient on heaving motion as expected the z b values of buoy 1 and 3 rapidly decrease with increasing c b moreover with increasing c b for given d b scenarios the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 reduces gradually fig 19 a shows that the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 for c b 100 n s m and d b 0 24 m is 0 48 cm which is much larger than 0 18 cm for c b 400 n s m and d b 0 24 m fig 19 c d and e show that when the c b increases from 300 n s m to 400 n s m two z b curves of buoys 1 and 3 tend to approach to each other this illustrates that the heaving amplitudes of buoys 1 and 3 differ a little from each other for high c b and ρ b scenarios fig 20 shows the relationship between η b and the equivalent damping coefficient c b it is observed that the η b of buoy 3 is smaller than that of buoy 1 for instance the mean values of η b for buoy 1 and 3 in fig 20 a are 3 23 and 2 62 respectively on the other hand η b decreases sharply at first follows by a slight decrease and then tends to be stable with increasing c b for small d b scenarios a relatively uniform decrease of η b values occurs with increasing c b for the high d b scenarios fig 20 shows that η b values are within the range of 1 27 4 06 indicates that the η b value changes significantly when the equivalent damping coefficient is changed consequently c b plays an important role in the heave movement of both seaside and lee side buoys zhang et al 2019 pointed out that with increasing damping coefficient the η b values sharply increases to reach a maximum value and then decreases slowly see fig 14 in zhang et al 2019 this is to some extent different from the present result a possible explanation is that the incident wave parameter and buoy geometry parameter chosen in our study are different from those of reported by zhang et al 2019 consequently η b decreases with increasing c b in fig 20 while the tendency to increasing η b with increasing c b is not observed to further investigate the intrinsic relationship between z b and c b the relationship between the z b h and the relative value of equivalent damping coefficient c b ρ b g t d b 2 is presented in fig 21 generally it is found that z b h decreases with increasing c b ρ b g t d b 2 in order to envisage the equation form of z b h f c b ρ b g t d b 2 the power function is used to fit the numerical data of z b h and c b ρ b g t d b 2 as follows 14 z bs h 0 1861 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 640 15 z bl h 0 1796 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 648 where z bs and z bl are the aha values for seaside buoy 1 and lee side buoy 3 respectively the correlation coefficients r 2 of eqs 14 and 15 are 0 8374 and 0 8316 respectively this indicates that eqs 14 15 are acceptable to predict the heaving motions for seaside and lee side buoys with relatively high accuracy fig 22 shows the relationship between η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 as can be seen the distribution of data points is relatively scattered however the decreasing η b tendency appears with increasing c b ρ b g t d b 2 the power function is used to fit the following equations using the numerical results of η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 16 η bs 2 114 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 306 17 η bl 1 969 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 322 where η bs and η bl are the cwr values for seaside buoy 1 and lee side buoy 3 respectively it must be acknowledged that the correlation between the η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 is relatively weak and the correlation coefficients r 2 of the seaside and lee side buoys are as low as 0 2899 and 0 3127 respectively a possible explanation is that the incident wave period t plays a complex role in η b as shown in fig 12 it is presented in the denominator of c b ρ b g t d b 2 coupling with d b and ρ b and consequently the low correlation coefficients for eqs 16 and 17 are acquired 4 4 a correlation for the relative value of aha the z b values of the seaside and lee side buoys were investigated with respect to the incident wave parameters geometry parameters of buoy and equivalent damping coefficient aforementioned however it is arduous to predict the average heaving displacement of buoys quantitatively consequently a simple formula for z b h is desirable to assess the heaving motion for the seaside and lee side buoys the incident wave height h the incident wave period t and the incident wavelength l are used to illustrate the wave effect the buoy height h b buoy diameter d b and its density ρ b are incorporated to demonstrate the buoy effect and the equivalent damping coefficient c b is used to denote the damping effect the formula of relative average heaving range can be expressed as follow 18 z b h f h t l h b d b ρ b c b the application of dimensional homogeneity to eq 18 and it yields eq 19 19 z b h f h l h b d b c b ρ b g t d b 2 the 176 groups of numerical data from 196 scenarios above are randomly used to deduce the following eq 20 and eq 21 with the least squares method 20 z bs h 0 091 h l 0 236 h b d b 0 045 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 617 21 z bl h 0 076 h l 0 288 h b d b 0 069 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 618 the correlation coefficients r 2 of eq 20 and eq 21 are 0 877 and 0 882 respectively the other 20 groups of numerical data are used to validate eqs 20 and 21 as shown in fig 23 it is found that all their relative deviations are smaller than 20 and approximately half of them are smaller than 10 which indicates that eqs 20 and 21 are consistent well with the numerical data consequently eqs 20 and 21 are proven to be acceptable in the heaving motion examination for an array of buoys in regular waves additionally due mainly to the low r 2 between η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 as shown in fig 22 it is difficult to conduct a prediction formula of η b by using the dimensionless parameters of h l h b d b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 with acceptable accuracy therefore the η b relationship is not considered further with the parameters mentioned above 5 conclusions in this study the innovative aeration device with an array of wave driven heaving buoys was designed to mitigate the hypoxia problems in deep water a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to measure the heaving motion for four buoys in regular waves furthermore a simple 3 d cfd numerical model was conducted to study its hydrodynamic performance by coupling with the rans equations the vof method for the wave surface tracking the rng k ε turbulence model for turbulence closure and the newton s second law for assessing the vertical motion of heaving buoys the numerical model was well validated with experimental data of wave surface elevation and heaving displacement curves of buoy the relationships of aha and cwr of seaside and lee side buoys were numerically explored with the wave parameter the buoy geometry and the equivalent damping coefficient respectively it is found that aha and cwr of seaside buoy are greater than those of lee side buoys the results show that aha increases while cwr decreases with increasing incident wave height when the incident wave period increases aha increases and cwr initially decreases follows by an increase and subsequently decreases again for relatively high equivalent damping coefficient scenarios with the increases of incident wave steepness relative height and density of buoy and relative equivalent damping coefficient respectively the values of aha and cwr for buoys decrease furthermore the dimensional homogeneity and the least squares methods were used to obtain the prediction formulas of relative aha values for seaside and lee side buoys with a relatively high accuracy the research limitations should be pointed out clearly first the intermittent aeration and oxygen supply occur during the laboratory experiment which should be measured directly in experiments and considered in numerical model in further work second a small ratio of the flume width to the heaving component width was used in the physical experiments due mainly to the limitation of experimental facilities which is inconsistent with the prototype working environment in open seawater and a higher ratio should be adopted in further study to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the device third both the numerical investigation and the physical study are limited to a small scale device in laboratory experiment under regular wave conditions the hydrodynamic performance of a prototype device calls for a further examination in real sea with irregular waves to verify feasibility in real engineering application finally the aforementioned results show that the wave parameters and the device geometry etc play a significant role in the heaving motion of buoys however from the energy point of view its influence on the device motion should be taken into account in further investigation credit authorship contribution statement zegao yin conceptualization methodology writing review

21560,in the recent decades the occurrence of hypoxia in coastal bottom waters has had adverse influences on the ecological system and fishery production therefore to address this an innovative aeration device with an array of four wave driven heaving buoys was proposed in this study to produce bubbles and supply oxygen into the bottom seawater a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the device in regular waves and a relatively simple 3 d computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical model was used to simulate the motion response of the array of four heaving buoys the results indicate that the average heaving amplitude aha and the capture width ratio cwr of the seaside buoy are higher than those of the lee side buoy specifically with increasing incident wave height aha increases but cwr decreases both aha and cwr decrease with the increments in incident wave steepness relative height and density of buoy and relative equivalent damping coefficient furthermore the prediction formulas were calculated to assess the aha of the seaside and lee side buoys with a relatively high accuracy the results obtained are significant for the optimal design and operation of the proposed innovative aeration device keywords hypoxia regular waves an array of heaving buoys average heaving amplitude aha capture width ratio cwr 1 introduction dissolved oxygen is an important index used for denoting the seawater quality and it primarily regulates the biological and chemical processes in the seawater the hypoxia i e dissolved oxygen concentration doc 2 0 mg l or approximately 30 saturation contributes considerably to the slow growth and reproduction capability of aquatic organisms and the deterioration of seawater quality diaz and rosenberg 2008 ram et al 2014 furthermore a large number of fishes and invertebrates were found to escape from the water body with doc 4 mg l and the survival of benthic invertebrate species will be severely affected in water with doc 2 mg l diaz 2001 in the recent decades hypoxia has increasingly become a critical problem in the marine ecosystem diaz and rosenberg 2008 rabalais et al 2009 2010 the average doc in the global oceans has decreased by 2 since 1960s to 2008 and the number of hypoxia coastal zones was annually growing at an exponential rate of 5 54 vaquer sunyer and duarte 2008 gilbert 2017 schmidtko et al 2017 globally more than 400 hypoxia sea zones have been reported and a total area of more than 245000 km2 was affected including the baltic kattegat black sea gulf of mexico and the east china sea schmidtko et al 2017 pointed out that numerous oceanic regions exhibited a significant decline in oxygen levels such as the equatorial and north pacific ocean the southern ocean and the south atlantic ocean the northern adriatic sea mediterranean was also severely affected by hypoxia stachowitsch 1984 recently this region was classified as a zone at medium to high risk of intermittent hypoxia and anoxia unep 2012 according to this phenomenon djakovac et al 2015 explained the mechanisms of observed changes in hypoxia events frequency in the northern adriatic sea based on oxygen data series collected in the period 1972 2012 the hypoxia depth was as high as 40 m in the northwest shelf area of the black sea the maximum hypoxia area was approximately 40000 km2 and the measured minimum doc was 0 mg l zaitsev 2006 furthermore the doc significantly decreased below the thermocline of california sea bograd et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge the leading causes of sea hypoxia are the seawater eutrophication and stratification strengthened by global warming tendency in general due to the facilitation of oxygen supply from the atmosphere the surface seawater has a higher doc value however the vertical stratification plays a negative role in the mixing capability and oxygen transport between surface and bottom seawater and the severe hypoxia frequently occurs in bottom seawater coupling with the effect of organic material decomposition rabalais et al 2014 therefore research on artificial oxygen supply in seawater is of scientific and practical significance for the water purification and marine ecological restoration a few artificial technologies have attracted broad interest by strengthening the vertical mixing and oxygen transport capability between surface and bottom seawater the original purpose of enhancing water exchange is to increase the fishery production by pumping nutrient rich water from the ocean bottom to the surface isaacs et al 1976 vershinsky et al 1987 liu and qiao 1995 maruyama et al 2004 kenyon 2007 more recently some new type of devices have been analyzed to strengthen the vertical water exchange and mitigate hypoxia at bottom waters through pumping surficial water downward with the use of wave energy margheritini and claeson 2011 demonstrated the technical and financial feasibility of a wave energized aeration pump device for conducting a site test for mitigating hypoxia at bottom waters near the stockholm coast in sweden a wave driven oxyflux device first proposed by antonini et al 2012 was applied to transport the oxygen rich surface water into deep layer based on that a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the dynamic response and pumping capacity of the wave driven oxyflux device under a variety of wave conditions by changing wave steepness antonini et al 2015 subsequently the dynamic response of oxyflux device was numerically investigated through a 3 d cfd numerical model antonini et al 2016 xiao et al 2018 showed that a downwelling flow in theory can alleviate the hypoxia for bottom seawater through a tide current driven pump with a 90 bend and a vertical pipe subsequently the theoretical model was validated with experimental data to predict the accurate hydrodynamic parameters for pump design consideration in practical applications aeration is an alternative solution for dealing with the hypoxia problem in water however little attention has been devoted to its research under sea hypoxia circumstances a water lifting aerator was developed by cong et al 2009 to restrain the ammonia nitrogen released from the sediments and solve the low doc problem in the lower layer at the fenhe reservoir their results showed that it saved 77 of electrical energy in comparison to other water treatment technologies an aeration device with a wave driven heaving buoy was experimentally conducted to generate air bubbles for increasing the doc in deep seawater and the response amplitude of heaving components and the airflow rate were explored by varying the wave parameters yin et al 2018 in an attempt to efficiently address the hypoxia problem an innovative aeration device with an array of wave driven heaving buoys is proposed to intermittently produce air bubbles in deep water for enhancing the doc it is driven by water waves to ensure environmental friendliness without the consumption of fossil fuels furthermore the device consists of an array of four heaving buoys rather than a single buoy therefore it theoretically has a high wave energy capture performance in this study a series of experiments and a 3 d cfd numerical model were used to explore the hydrodynamic performance of the device in regular waves the aha and cwr of seaside and lee side buoys were examined with various wave and geometrical parameters and the prediction formulas were deduced to depict the aha the objective is to shed some light on optimization and engineering applications of the proposed innovative aeration device 2 device structure and experimental setup 2 1 device structure fig 1 shows that the device comprises the heaving components and the immovable components the heaving components were composed of four independent cylindrical buoys of 0 20 m in diameter and 0 10 m in height to absorb wave energy four independent pistons of 0 06 m in diameter and 0 002 m in thickness to suck or exclude air four independent connecting rods of 0 02 m in diameter and 0 30 m height to connect the buoys and the pistons and eight pins were fixed together with the aforementioned four buoys the two seaside buoys were marked as 1 and 2 respectively and the two lee side buoys were marked as 3 and 4 the axis distance between the two seaside buoys was 0 25 m which was equal to that of the two lee side buoys the axis distance between 1 and 3 buoys was also 0 25 m similar to that for 2 and 4 buoys the immovable components comprised the aeration components and the supporting components the main parts of the aeration components were four air cylinders with a height of 0 30 m and an inner diameter of 0 06 m there were two one way valves at the bottom of each air cylinder the one way inlet valve connected an air inlet tube with 0 01 m diameter to suck air from the atmosphere and the other one way outlet valve connected an air outlet tube with 0 01 m diameter to release the air into deep hypoxia zone the supporting components comprised four supporting frames for 0 20 m in height to fix the two horizontal square plates for 0 60 m 0 60 m eight circular steel slide bars for 0 01 m in diameter and 0 90 m in height to guide the heaving motion through the eight pins the total height of device was 1 0 m and the physical picture of the device used for the experiments is also presented in fig 2 each buoy with a hollow core was made of polyvinyl chloride material and the overall average density of each buoy was 350 kg m3 and the two horizontal square plates of supporting components were constructed of acrylic glass material 2 2 experimental setup and phenomena a series of physical experiments were conducted in a wave flume at the hydrodynamic laboratory of ocean university of china the length height and width of the flume were 25 0 m 1 0 m and 1 2 m respectively fig 3 depicts the experimental sketch at one end of the wave flume a vertical piston type wave paddle was used to generate regular waves and x 0 was defined as the balanced position of wave paddle at the other end the flume a large amount of porous material was installed to attenuate the unwanted wave reflection the device location was determined to ensure the fully developed wave and attenuate the secondary wave reflection effect on the device due to the wave paddle the central axis of seaside buoy was positioned at x 14 m after the balanced position of wave paddle the exit of each air outlet tube was fixed at the bottom of water flume at the top of flume side walls the intake of each air inlet tube was fixed to ensure a sufficient distance to the wave surface for air suction due mainly to the limitation of experimental facilities the ratio of the flume width to the width of the heaving components of the device was a relatively small value of 2 22 however similar ratios were well used in many published literatures such as 2 32 in bjarte larsson and falnes 2006 2 0 in kang et al 2012 and 2 22 in zang et al 2017 it was accepted that the natural frequency was a fundamental parameter to understand the dynamic behavior of the device a decay test was performed in still water to determine the natural period of each buoy with a value of 2 1 s and the corresponding natural frequency was about 2 99 rad s four wave gauges wg1 wg2 wg3 and wg4 in fig 3 with a sampling frequency of 50 hz were arranged at the centerline of the flume to measure the wave height histories wg1 wg2 and wg3 were fixed in front of the device to roughly identify the incident and reflected waves by using the three point method proposed by zelt and skjelbreia 1992 wp4 was placed behind the device to measure the wave transmission the distances between wp1 and wp2 and between wp2 and wp3 were determined based on the method of zelt and skjelbreia 1992 four miran kpm22 displacement sensors with an accuracy of 0 0001 m were used to measure the vertical displacement history of four heaving buoys respectively the two ends of aforementioned displacement sensors were respectively fixed on the top portions of the heaving components and a transverse structure at the top of the wave tank both the wave gauges and displacement sensors were calibrated carefully before performing the experiments with respect to the incident wave parameters in the experiments the range of regular wave height h was 0 14 m 0 22 m with an interval of 0 02 m and the wave period t ranged from 1 5 s to 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s the still water depth d was controlled as a constant of 0 5 m for all the experimental scenarios the wave reflection coefficient was assessed by performing tests without the device for the same wave parameters in the wave flume the fast fourier transform technique was used to perform the reflection analysis it was found that despite the presence of porous material at the end of the flume the wave reflection coefficients were about 15 in this study this indicated that the impact from wave reflection cannot be ignored hence to eliminate the influence of wave reflection due to the flume end only a portion of the time series 7 s 17 s of the wave surface elevation unaffected by wave reflection was used to validate the numerical model and further hydrodynamic investigation during the experimental process it was observed that when the buoys heaved from the low position to its high position under the combined effect of the vertical wave excitation force and buoyancy force etc the outside atmospheric air was sucked into the air cylinders through the air inlet tubes and the one way inlet valves when the buoys moved from the high position back to the low position the pressed air in the air cylinders was released into the bottom of a wave flume through the one way outlet valves and the air outlet tubes four bubbly jets intermittently occurred in the vicinity of ends of four air outlet tubes the bubbles oscillated to ascend and subsequently escaped from the wave surface based on the measured wave surface elevations at x 10 m location the wave surface elevation near the device x 14 m was roughly estimated using the linear wave propagation theory fig 4 shows the time series of estimated wave surface elevation η at x 14 m location and experimental heaving displacements z for buoys 1 and 3 it is seen that the heaving periods of buoys 1 and 3 are identical with the incident wave period and the range of heaving motion of buoy 3 is roughly smaller than that of buoy 1 as expected a relatively obvious phase lag about π occurred between the heaving motions of buoys and the wave surface elevation and a slight phase lag of π 10 occurred between the heaving motions of buoys 1 and 3 3 3 d cfd numerical model 3 1 governing equations and boundary conditions in this study the rans equations i e the continuity and momentum equations eqs 1 and 2 are used to model the unsteady incompressible wave field 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i x j ρ u i u j ρ g i where u i is the mean velocity component in i direction x i is the cartesian space coordinate t is the time ρ is the fluid density p is pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity of water g i is the acceleration of gravity in i direction and u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor the volume of fluid method vof presented by hirt and nichols 1981 is used for tracking the wave surface and the governing equation can be expressed as follows 3 α t α u i x i 0 where α is the volume fraction of water in a cell α 1 means the cell is full of water α 0 means the cell is full of air and 0 α 1 denotes the cell contains a free boundary the rng k ε model is used to model the wave turbulence with buoys and the transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation rate ε of are depicted as follows 4 ρ k t ρ u j k x j x j ν ν t σ k k x j ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i ρ ε 5 ρ ε t ρ u j ε x j x j ν ν t σ ε ε x j c ε 1 ε k ν t u i x j u i x j u j x i c ε 2 ρ ε 2 k where v t is the turbulent viscosity and v t c μ k 2 ε c μ c ε1 c ε2 σ k and σ ε are the model coefficients yakhot and orszag 1986 as shown in fig 1 the device geometry is relatively complicated and the measurement of acting force between the piston and air cylinder is difficult with high accuracy in experiments in addition it is arduous to consider the geometry of all the heaving and immovable components in numerical model as a result an array of four cylindrical buoys are used to represent the device the immovable components along with the four pistons connecting rods and pins are neglected during computation and the effects of aforementioned neglected components on heaving buoys are taken into account by using the equivalent damping coefficient c b to simplify the numerical calculations moreover note that the equivalent damping coefficient only used in the numerical study which includes the structural damping coefficient caused by friction and the external damping coefficient caused by air suction and extrusion the vertical motion of the heaving buoys is explored by newton s second law and the governing equation is as follows 6 m d 2 z t d t 2 f b f e f v where m is the system mass which includes the net mass of heaving components and the additional mass of water body z t is vertical displacement of the buoy the net buoyancy force f b the equivalent damping force f e and the vertical wave excitation force f v are depicted as follows 7 f b ρ g s 1 η t z t 8 f e c b d z t d t 9 f v c m ρ s 1 η t z t z 0 d d t u z d z t d t where g is the acceleration of gravity s 1 is the base area of the cylindrical buoy z 0 denotes the immersed height of the buoy at stationary c m is the inertia coefficient u z is the water velocity in the z direction fig 5 shows the schematic view of the computational domain and the boundary conditions the length height and width of the numerical wave flume were 25 0 m 1 0 m and 1 2 m respectively and the four buoys were set at the x 14 m location consistent with the experimental setup its left boundary was set as wave boundary and the porous medium with a porosity of 0 7 was set on the right side to absorb the waves the right and the bottom boundaries were both set as wall boundaries with zero slip velocity and the four buoys boundaries were set as wall boundaries with a free degree of heaving motion the two sides of the numerical flume were both set as symmetrical boundaries after a comparison with the no slip wall boundaries and the flow flux and fluid shear stress were all set as zero using the dirichlet boundary condition furthermore the upper boundary was set as the atmosphere inlet boundary i e the pressure value was assumed as zero 3 2 computational mesh sensitivity analysis the computational domain was partitioned using structural grids by flow 3d software the grid convergence index gci method was applied to test the grid independence which was an acceptable and recommended method that had been evaluated in over several hundred cfd cases richardson 1911 celik et al 2008 the density ρ b diameter d b height h b and equivalent damping coefficient c b of each buoy used for computational mesh sensitivity analysis were 350 kg m3 0 2 m 0 1 m and 0 n s m respectively the discretization error for the water velocities and the free surface elevations were computed by richardson extrapolation table 1 tabulates the extrapolated relative errors at the x 8 m location for incident wave height h 0 14 m and wave period t 1 8 s three sizes of relatively coarse cells were used for the far field domain partition in the gci calculations s 1 0 01 m for grid 1 s 2 0 02 m for grid 2 and s 3 0 04 m for grid 3 respectively where s represents the coarse grid size and the subscripts of 1 2 and 3 denote the numbers of grid partition scheme additionally the grids near four buoys and wave surface were further refined the refined grid sizes were 0 002 m 0 004 m and 0 008 m corresponding to grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 respectively it is found that with the decreasing total number of cells from 1390625 for grid 1 to 515625 for grid 2 the discretization errors of water velocity and wave surface elevation are rather small i e 0 4 and 0 1 respectively fig 6 depicts the computational wave elevation histories with grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 at the x 8 m location for h 0 14 m and t 1 8 s a relatively high deviation appears between grid 3 and the other grids i e grid 1 and grid 2 however there is a slight difference between grid 2 and grid 1 which indicates that the grid 2 scheme is relatively independent of the computational results therefore the grid 2 scheme is selected for the subsequent computations after considering the balance between accuracy and computational speed 3 3 numerical model validation the experimental data were used to validate the accuracy of the aforementioned numerical model the density ρ b diameter d b and height h b of each buoy in the numerical model were 350 kg m3 0 2 m and 0 1 m respectively which were consistent well with the experimental conditions however the equivalent damping coefficient c b cannot be directly obtained by the experiments a user defined function was used to model the equivalent damping force acting on the buoys in the numerical model the repeated numerical tests with different c b were performed and c b 200 n s m was determined in numerical model validation from the comparison of the numerical and experimental heaving displacements fig 7 shows the time series of wave surface elevation η at x 10 m location with the device effect for h 0 16 m and t 1 8 s where the solid line denotes the numerical results and the circles denote experimental data an overall agreement is observed between numerical wave surface elevations and experimental data and their periods are consistent well with those of the incident wave however the slight discrepancies occur between numerical wave surface elevations and experimental data at wave crest and trough locations due to mainly the complex effect between waves and buoys note that the locations of buoy 1 and buoy 2 are precisely symmetrical in the wave flume and also in the case of buoy 3 and buoy 4 thus their heaving performance shows an obvious similarity both in experiments and numerical data consequently buoy 1 and buoy 3 are chosen to represent seaside and lee side buoys for subsequent investigation respectively fig 8 shows the time series of the heaving displacements z for buoys 1 and 3 with h 0 16 m and t 1 8 s 2 4 s where z 0 corresponds to the position of the buoy s centroid in still water it is found that the heaving characteristics of buoys 1 and 3 are highly similar for the same t and their heaving periods agree well with the incident wave periods the heaving displacement range slightly differs with t 1 8 s and 2 4 s scenarios while the crest values of z for t 2 4 s are larger than that for t 1 8 s and an apparent asymmetry of heaving displacement curve appears for t 2 4 s fig 8 a and b show that the experimental z values are slightly higher than the numerical data at the crest and trough locations however their heaving ranges agree well with each other which can guarantee a relatively accurate estimation of aha fig 8 c and d illustrate that the numerical z values are consistent well with the experimental data even at the crest and trough locations it is interesting to note that the downward displacement decreases slightly at 0 01 m z 0 m range before the trough locations as shown in fig 8 c and d a possible reason is that the asymmetry between the wave crests and troughs becomes more pronounced for large wave period and this contributes to the nonlinearity of the heave motion figs 7 and 8 show that the time series of the wave surface elevation and heaving displacements are reasonably predicted in the numerical model illustrating that the aforementioned 3 d cfd numerical model is acceptable for predicting the hydraulic parameters of the wave driven heaving buoys 3 4 numerical calculation scenarios a total of 196 numerical scenarios were used to explore the heaving performance of buoys with various wave parameters buoys properties and equivalent damping coefficients the range of the equivalent damping coefficient c b was 100 n s m to 400 n s m with an interval of 100 n s m the volume of each buoy v b v b π 4 h b d b 2 was a constant with a value of 0 00314 m³ to simply the research the aforementioned numerical scenarios were divided into two groups and the detailed information was listed in table 2 in group ⅰ the buoy height h b buoy diameter d b and buoy density ρ b are constant the influence of wave elements on the heaving motion for different c b was investigated by changing h and t h was varied from 0 14 m to 0 22 m with an interval of 0 02 m and t was varied from 1 5 s to 2 7 s with an interval of 0 3 s with respect to group ⅱ h and t were given respectively the effect of the buoy geometry on the heaving motion for four different equivalent damping coefficients was explored by varying h b and d b d b was varied from 0 16 m to 0 24 m with an interval of 0 02 m and the corresponding h b values are about 0 156 m 0 123 m 0 100 m 0 083 m and 0 069 m respectively additionally the range of ρ b was 250 kg m3 to 450 kg m3 with an interval of 50 kg m3 4 results and discussion two parameters are defined for following exploration to quantify the effects of wave parameters and buoys property on the heaving performance i e aha eq 10 and cwr of incident wave energy eq 11 10 z b 1 n i 1 n z i max z i min where n is the number of the complete period of buoy motion in each test within 150 s range zi max and zi min denote the maximum and the minimum values of heaving displacements in the ith period respectively note that n is not a constant with varying wave period and it increases with decreasing wave period as expected for the largest t 2 7 s scenarios in group ⅰ n is more than 50 within 150 s range and eq 10 is capable of illustrating the heaving performance of buoys 11 η b p 0 p wave 100 where p 0 is the average wave power extracted by the buoy can be calculated using eq 12 12 p 0 c b z b t 2 2 p wave is the mean power of the incident wave perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and it is expressed as follows using linear wave theory 13 p wave 1 16 ρ g h 2 l t 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d d b where l g t 2 2 π tanh k d is wavelength k is wave number and k 2π l 4 1 incident wave parameters effect 4 1 1 incident wave height effect fig 9 depicts the z b value of buoys 1 and 3 versus the incident wave height h for various values of t as expected the results show that z b increases with increasing h the value of z b of buoy 3 is lower than that of buoy 1 a possible reason is that the seaside buoy absorbs a part of the incident wave energy to reduce the wave force on the lee side buoy consequently the wave power extracted by lee side buoy decreases another reason could be that the reflected wave from the lee side buoy plays an essential role in increasing the variation of wave surface elevation at the location of seaside buoy the wave force and the extracted wave power on seaside buoy also increase the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 gradually reduces with increasing t for the given h scenarios for instance in the case of h 0 22 m the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 for t 1 5 s is 0 35 cm which is significantly larger than 0 08 cm for t 2 7 s as presented in fig 9 a consequently the values of z b of buoys 1 and 3 approach to each other for t 2 7 s and their difference can therefore be neglected without causing a large deviation furthermore fig 9 a shows that the range of z b value is varied from 4 78 cm to 7 88 cm for c b 100 n s m while fig 9 d shows that z b value is within the range of 1 45 cm 3 20 cm for c b 400 n s m the z b value for c b 100 n s m is much larger than that for c b 400 n s m which indicates that the equivalent damping coefficient plays an essential role in the heaving motion of both seaside and lee side buoys fig 10 illustrates η b versus incident wave height h for various values of t it is found that η b of buoys 1 and 3 decrease with increasing h which is opposite to the relationship between z b and h as shown in fig 9 the η b values of buoy 3 are lower than those of the buoy 1 in general this is consistent with the z b tendency of buoys 1 and 3 as shown in fig 9 the reduction of η b for large wave period is smaller than that for small period with increasing h with respect to c b 100 n s m scenarios in fig 10 a the η b value of buoy 1 decreases from 6 24 to 3 55 and η b value of buoy 3 decreases from 6 03 to 3 14 with increasing h from 0 14 m to 0 22 m for t 1 5s however the η b value of buoy 1 and 3 decreases from 2 85 to 1 49 and 2 82 to 1 46 respectively for t 2 7 s note that for t 2 4 s and t 2 7 s scenarios a large proportion of η b values of buoys 1 and 3 are found to approach to each other in fig 10 a and b this finding can be attributed to the wave surface elevation varies slowly for high t scenarios the buoys 1 and 3 follow the wave motion relatively well with small c b values and z b differences and η b differences tend to reduce 4 1 2 incident wave period effect fig 11 shows the relationship between z b of buoy 1 and 3 and incident wave period t clearly as the wave period increases the z b values of buoy 1 and 3 roughly increase it is interesting to note that the average increment of z b value is 0 20 cm with increasing t from 1 8 s to 2 1 s and is 0 84 cm with increasing t from 2 1 s to 2 4 s in fig 11 b and c this indicates that the z b increases slightly as t increases from 1 8 s to 2 1 s however z b increases sharply with increasing t from 2 1 s to 2 4 s the accurate reason is still unknown to our knowledge due to the complex effect between waves and buoys however a possible explanation is that the natural period of buoys is 2 1 s in addition the increasing amplitude of z b varies a little with increasing t from 2 4 s to 2 7 s which indicates that z b is not sensitive to the t variation for high t scenarios fig 12 depicts η b of buoys 1 and 3 versus incident wave period t for various values of h fig 12 a shows that η b roughly decreases with increasing t for relatively small c b scenarios fig 12 b c and d show that with increasing t for relatively high c b scenarios except for the buoy 1 with h 0 14 m and 0 16 m η b decreases firstly follows an increase and then decreases again the relatively small η b appears at t 2 1 s in fig 12 b c and at t 1 8 s in fig 12 d respectively this trend is consistent with the conclusion reported by zhang et al 2019 that with increasing wave period the η b of a point wave energy converter increases in low wave period region and decreases in high wave period region however in our study in the lower wave period region i e t 1 5 s 2 1 s in fig 12 b c and t 1 5 s 1 8 s in fig 12 d respectively η b decreases with increasing t the reason is unknown yet but one possibility is that low c b values are used in fig 12 b c and d hence the relatively large deviation occurs from the tendency reported by zhang et al 2019 4 1 3 incident wave steepness effect fig 13 shows the relationship between the relative aha z b h and incident wave steepness h l for different c b and ρ b scenarios it is found that as h l increases z b h values of buoy 1 and 3 decrease slightly the reason could be that for increasing l with a given h h l decreases the incident wave energy increases and the energy captured by buoys also becomes more substantial which in turn increases z b and z b h for increasing h with a given l the results fig 9 show that z b increases however the increasing ratios of z b to h are smaller than 1 consequently z b h decreases with increasing h l it is also observed that the z b h values of buoy 1 and 3 are almost equal for c b 400 n s m illustrating that in this case of a high c b the effect of h l on seaside and lee side buoy weakens and the phenomenon that z b values of buoy 3 are smaller than those of buoy 1 is not evident any more fig 14 shows the relationship between η b and incident wave steepness h l for various values of c b it is found that η b decreases with an increasing incident wave steepness for a given c b scenario in each inset of fig 14 the reduction of η b value for low equivalent damping coefficient is larger than that for high equivalent damping coefficient for instance fig 14 b shows that with increasing h l from 0 039 to 0 062 the η b value of buoy 1 decreases from 5 03 to 2 67 and buoy 3 decreases from 4 55 to 2 43 for c b 100 n s m corresponding to low equivalent damping coefficient while for c b 400 n s m corresponding to high equivalent damping coefficient the η b value of buoy 1 decreases from 2 02 to 1 34 and buoy 3 decreases from 1 76 to 1 13 this also indicates that the small equivalent damping coefficient contributes to the high η b value for given h l scenarios 4 2 geometry parameters effect 4 2 1 the relative height effect to further investigate the effects of geometrical parameters on the heaving performance of buoys aha z b and buoy height are normalized respectively by wave height and buoy diameter the relationship between the relative values of z b h and the relative height h b d b with various values of c b is shown in fig 15 it is found that z b h of buoys 1 and 3 decrease slightly with increasing h b d b the reason is that with the decreasing d b accompanying with increasing h b causes an increase in h b d b and a decrease in p wave and z b consequently a flat cylinder buoy performs better in heaving response than a slim cylinder buoy with an equal volume furthermore the average values of z b h for buoys 1 and 3 are 0 248 and 0 242 respectively which indicates that the z b h values of buoy 1 are slightly higher than those of buoy 3 the significant differences of z b h between the seaside and lee side buoys only appear at h b d b 0 29 and 0 38 for c b 100 n s m as shown in each inset of fig 15 the relationship between η b and the relative height h b d b is illustrated in fig 16 the average values of η b for buoy 1 and 3 are 2 56 and 2 44 respectively this indicates that the η b values of buoy 3 are slightly lower than those of the buoy 1 thus confirming that the wave power absorption effect of the seaside buoy is better than that of the lee side buoy see figs 10 12 and 14 the η b decreases with increasing h b d b as shown in each inset of fig 16 and this conclusion is in agreement with the results that total power absorption efficiencies increase with increasing buoy diameter reported by gao and yu 2018 4 2 2 buoy density effect fig 17 shows the relationship between z b of buoys 1 and 3 and buoy density ρ b as buoy density increases the z b values of buoys 1 and 3 decrease slightly indicating that buoy density plays a slightly negative role in z b values the maximum and average values of z b for buoy 1 are 7 69 cm and 3 97 cm respectively while the maximum and average values of z b for buoy 3 are 7 21 cm and 3 87 cm respectively therefore the buoy density plays a greater role in the heaving displacements for seaside buoys than for the lee side buoys furthermore the average values of z b for c b 100 n s m 200 n s m 300 n s m and 400 n s m are 6 35 cm 3 98 cm 2 94 cm and 2 41 cm respectively this finding indicates that the z b values are sensitive to c b for relatively small c b scenarios and the small equivalent damping coefficient contributes to high z b values fig 18 depicts the relationship between the η b and buoy density ρ b similar to the relationship between z b and ρ b as shown in fig 17 it is found that η b decreases with increasing ρ b the η b values of buoy 3 are also lower than that of the buoy 1 and this can be obvious observed in fig 18 a the mean values of η b for buoy 1 and 3 in fig 18 a are 3 43 and 3 23 respectively furthermore the average values of η b for c b 100 n s m 200 n s m 300 n s m and 400 n s m are 3 33 2 61 2 14 and 1 91 respectively this also indicates that the η b is sensitive to c b for relatively small c b scenarios and the small equivalent damping coefficient contributes to high η b values in our study 4 3 equivalent damping coefficient effect the results of the relationship between z b and c b are presented in fig 19 which determines the effect of the equivalent damping coefficient on heaving motion as expected the z b values of buoy 1 and 3 rapidly decrease with increasing c b moreover with increasing c b for given d b scenarios the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 reduces gradually fig 19 a shows that the difference value of z b between buoys 1 and 3 for c b 100 n s m and d b 0 24 m is 0 48 cm which is much larger than 0 18 cm for c b 400 n s m and d b 0 24 m fig 19 c d and e show that when the c b increases from 300 n s m to 400 n s m two z b curves of buoys 1 and 3 tend to approach to each other this illustrates that the heaving amplitudes of buoys 1 and 3 differ a little from each other for high c b and ρ b scenarios fig 20 shows the relationship between η b and the equivalent damping coefficient c b it is observed that the η b of buoy 3 is smaller than that of buoy 1 for instance the mean values of η b for buoy 1 and 3 in fig 20 a are 3 23 and 2 62 respectively on the other hand η b decreases sharply at first follows by a slight decrease and then tends to be stable with increasing c b for small d b scenarios a relatively uniform decrease of η b values occurs with increasing c b for the high d b scenarios fig 20 shows that η b values are within the range of 1 27 4 06 indicates that the η b value changes significantly when the equivalent damping coefficient is changed consequently c b plays an important role in the heave movement of both seaside and lee side buoys zhang et al 2019 pointed out that with increasing damping coefficient the η b values sharply increases to reach a maximum value and then decreases slowly see fig 14 in zhang et al 2019 this is to some extent different from the present result a possible explanation is that the incident wave parameter and buoy geometry parameter chosen in our study are different from those of reported by zhang et al 2019 consequently η b decreases with increasing c b in fig 20 while the tendency to increasing η b with increasing c b is not observed to further investigate the intrinsic relationship between z b and c b the relationship between the z b h and the relative value of equivalent damping coefficient c b ρ b g t d b 2 is presented in fig 21 generally it is found that z b h decreases with increasing c b ρ b g t d b 2 in order to envisage the equation form of z b h f c b ρ b g t d b 2 the power function is used to fit the numerical data of z b h and c b ρ b g t d b 2 as follows 14 z bs h 0 1861 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 640 15 z bl h 0 1796 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 648 where z bs and z bl are the aha values for seaside buoy 1 and lee side buoy 3 respectively the correlation coefficients r 2 of eqs 14 and 15 are 0 8374 and 0 8316 respectively this indicates that eqs 14 15 are acceptable to predict the heaving motions for seaside and lee side buoys with relatively high accuracy fig 22 shows the relationship between η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 as can be seen the distribution of data points is relatively scattered however the decreasing η b tendency appears with increasing c b ρ b g t d b 2 the power function is used to fit the following equations using the numerical results of η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 16 η bs 2 114 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 306 17 η bl 1 969 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 322 where η bs and η bl are the cwr values for seaside buoy 1 and lee side buoy 3 respectively it must be acknowledged that the correlation between the η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 is relatively weak and the correlation coefficients r 2 of the seaside and lee side buoys are as low as 0 2899 and 0 3127 respectively a possible explanation is that the incident wave period t plays a complex role in η b as shown in fig 12 it is presented in the denominator of c b ρ b g t d b 2 coupling with d b and ρ b and consequently the low correlation coefficients for eqs 16 and 17 are acquired 4 4 a correlation for the relative value of aha the z b values of the seaside and lee side buoys were investigated with respect to the incident wave parameters geometry parameters of buoy and equivalent damping coefficient aforementioned however it is arduous to predict the average heaving displacement of buoys quantitatively consequently a simple formula for z b h is desirable to assess the heaving motion for the seaside and lee side buoys the incident wave height h the incident wave period t and the incident wavelength l are used to illustrate the wave effect the buoy height h b buoy diameter d b and its density ρ b are incorporated to demonstrate the buoy effect and the equivalent damping coefficient c b is used to denote the damping effect the formula of relative average heaving range can be expressed as follow 18 z b h f h t l h b d b ρ b c b the application of dimensional homogeneity to eq 18 and it yields eq 19 19 z b h f h l h b d b c b ρ b g t d b 2 the 176 groups of numerical data from 196 scenarios above are randomly used to deduce the following eq 20 and eq 21 with the least squares method 20 z bs h 0 091 h l 0 236 h b d b 0 045 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 617 21 z bl h 0 076 h l 0 288 h b d b 0 069 c b ρ b g t d b 2 0 618 the correlation coefficients r 2 of eq 20 and eq 21 are 0 877 and 0 882 respectively the other 20 groups of numerical data are used to validate eqs 20 and 21 as shown in fig 23 it is found that all their relative deviations are smaller than 20 and approximately half of them are smaller than 10 which indicates that eqs 20 and 21 are consistent well with the numerical data consequently eqs 20 and 21 are proven to be acceptable in the heaving motion examination for an array of buoys in regular waves additionally due mainly to the low r 2 between η b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 as shown in fig 22 it is difficult to conduct a prediction formula of η b by using the dimensionless parameters of h l h b d b and c b ρ b g t d b 2 with acceptable accuracy therefore the η b relationship is not considered further with the parameters mentioned above 5 conclusions in this study the innovative aeration device with an array of wave driven heaving buoys was designed to mitigate the hypoxia problems in deep water a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to measure the heaving motion for four buoys in regular waves furthermore a simple 3 d cfd numerical model was conducted to study its hydrodynamic performance by coupling with the rans equations the vof method for the wave surface tracking the rng k ε turbulence model for turbulence closure and the newton s second law for assessing the vertical motion of heaving buoys the numerical model was well validated with experimental data of wave surface elevation and heaving displacement curves of buoy the relationships of aha and cwr of seaside and lee side buoys were numerically explored with the wave parameter the buoy geometry and the equivalent damping coefficient respectively it is found that aha and cwr of seaside buoy are greater than those of lee side buoys the results show that aha increases while cwr decreases with increasing incident wave height when the incident wave period increases aha increases and cwr initially decreases follows by an increase and subsequently decreases again for relatively high equivalent damping coefficient scenarios with the increases of incident wave steepness relative height and density of buoy and relative equivalent damping coefficient respectively the values of aha and cwr for buoys decrease furthermore the dimensional homogeneity and the least squares methods were used to obtain the prediction formulas of relative aha values for seaside and lee side buoys with a relatively high accuracy the research limitations should be pointed out clearly first the intermittent aeration and oxygen supply occur during the laboratory experiment which should be measured directly in experiments and considered in numerical model in further work second a small ratio of the flume width to the heaving component width was used in the physical experiments due mainly to the limitation of experimental facilities which is inconsistent with the prototype working environment in open seawater and a higher ratio should be adopted in further study to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the device third both the numerical investigation and the physical study are limited to a small scale device in laboratory experiment under regular wave conditions the hydrodynamic performance of a prototype device calls for a further examination in real sea with irregular waves to verify feasibility in real engineering application finally the aforementioned results show that the wave parameters and the device geometry etc play a significant role in the heaving motion of buoys however from the energy point of view its influence on the device motion should be taken into account in further investigation credit authorship contribution statement zegao yin conceptualization methodology writing review

21561,in this paper a new computational fluid dynamics approach is suggested to calculate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of an underwater vehicle in this method the linear accelerated motion of the underwater vehicle is numerically simulated based on unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equations using ansys cfx software velocity and acceleration related forces are extracted from the simulation results from which the added mass coefficients are extracted to validate obtained results initially the drag and added mass coefficients of an ellipsoid are calculated using the present method and compared with the available corresponding analytical and experimental results moreover an acceleration sensitivity study was performed indicating that calculated added mass coefficients were acceleration independent the obtained results from the suggested numerical method agreed well with those obtained from the analytical and experimental methods indicating that the present cfd method can be used to obtain the added mass coefficients of more complicated geometries including the underwater vehicle used in this study the proposed cfd method is not complicated and time consuming it can be used as a reliable and inexpensive method to extract translational added mass coefficients of underwater vehicles instead of expensive experimental methods

motion in other words the added mass is an additional hydrodynamic reaction force generated by the surrounding water when the underwater vehicle accelerates prestero 2001 estimating inaccurate added mass coefficients results in inefficient dynamic model and consequently affects manoeuvrability of the vehicle in the hydrodynamic analysis of an underwater vehicle two reference frames namely body fixed and earth fixed reference frames are introduced the body fixed reference frame is a moving coordinate frame fixed to the vehicle linear and angular velocities are given relative to this frame in the earth fixed reference frame on the other hand the position and orientation of the vehicle are given relative to a fixed origin the origin of the earth fixed frame is a specific point in space while the origin of the body fixed frame is the center of buoyancy of the vehicle the body fixed and earth fixed coordinate frames for an underwater vehicle with six degrees of freedom dof motion along with applied hydrodynamic loads are shown in fig 1 the dynamics of an underwater vehicle motion is analyzed using mathematical models known as the dynamic model the dynamic model covers all hydrodynamic forces and moments applied to the underwater vehicle these hydrodynamic loads are not usually constant in time they are a function of the velocity acceleration and the shape of the vehicle therefore they are expressed as hydrodynamic coefficients multiplied by linear and angular velocities and accelerations linearized equations of the motion including hydrodynamic loads applied to the vehicle with 6 dof are shown in equations 1 6 these equations represent the dynamic model of the vehicle using a hydrodynamic derivatives concept determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients used in these equations is crucial stage of performing hydrodynamic analysis 1 x n e t x u u x u u x q q 2 y n e t y v v y r r y v v y r r y δ r δ r 3 z n e t z w w z q q z w w z q q z δ s δ s 4 k n e

coefficients in equations 1 6 are divided into two sets of damping and added mass coefficients when the underwater vehicle moves with a constant velocity the drag and lift forces constitute the main resistance loads applied to the vehicle these hydrodynamic loads which are functions of the vehicle shape and the velocity are known as damping loads the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients are known as damping coefficients given the dynamic model in equations 1 6 the coefficients x u x q y v y r y δ r z w z q z δ s k p m w m q m δ s n v n r and n δ r are damping coefficients of the underwater vehicle other hydrodynamic loads are applied to the vehicle when it changes its velocity or its motion direction the value of these loads depends on angular and transitional accelerations or coriolis effects therefore hydrodynamic coefficients representing these loads are called as added mass coefficients in equations 1 6 these coefficients include x u y v y r z w z q k p m w m q n v and n r there are several methods used by researchers to predict the hydrodynamic coefficients of submersible vehicles these methods include analytical semi empirical ase experimental fluid dynamics efd and computational fluid dynamics cfd peterson 1980 humphreys 1981 maeda and tatsuta 1989 nahon 1993 jones and clarke 2002 geisbert 2007 and isa et al 2014 are among those researchers who used ase

shadlaghani and mansoorzadeh 2016 chen et al 2017 guo and zou 2017 pook et al 2018 javanmard and mansoorzadeh 2019 and go and ahn 2019 used cfd to obtain hydrodynamics coefficients added mass coefficients in particular can be obtained using efd cfd and ase methods in experimental methods dynamic tests using ra and pmm are performed to apply the required motions and maneuvers to the vehicle on horizontal and vertical planes perturbed surge maneuver pure sway and pure yaw are among the oscillatory and hence accelerating motions that are generated by a pmm these accelerated motions apply hydrodynamic loads to the vehicle that are measured and analyzed through performing a detailed fourier analysis to calculate added mass coefficients cfd includes two ways to estimate added mass coefficients of submersible vehicles the first one is based on the assumption of the potential flow and includes panel method pm and boundary element method bem in practice due to the viscosity of the fluid flow around the vehicle this assumption decreases the accuracy of the obtained results sahin et al 1993 1997 and lin and liao 2011 used pm and bem to estimate added mass coefficients of underwater vehicles in a second way commercial cfd software is applied to simulate dynamic tests performed by pmm and rm in these simulations reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations including viscosity effect are solved in a computational domain among researchers implementing cfd simulations to predict added mass coefficients studies conducted by phillips et al 2007 sakamoto 2009 tang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 javanmard 2013 and kim et al 2015b are notable analytical methods including strip theory st and equivalent ellipsoid method emm only rely on the geometric specifications of the vehicle to calculate the added mass coefficients the main principle in these methods is to find the velocity potential using boundary conditions and use it to determine pressure distribution around the vehicle based on bernoulli s equation finally obtained pressure distribution yields the hydrodynamic forces and moments applied on the vehicle according to st a vehicle can be made up of a finite number of transversal two dimensional slices and the added mass of the whole vehicle is obtained by integration of the value of the slice over the length of the vehicle sen and vinh 2016 korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 introduced the first formulation of the st known as the ordinary strip theory method this method then was developed by tasai 1969 with modified strip theory method perstro 2001 and ferreira et al 2009 implemented st to calculate added mass coefficients of underwater vehicles in emm different parts of the vehicle are relatively assumed as equivalent ellipsoids with specified geometrical parameters using the analytical methods the added mass coefficients of any specific ellipsoid can be obtained through solving laplace equations for velocity potential integration of the all calculated added mass coefficients for different parts of the vehicle in a specific direction yields the added mass coefficient of the whole vehicle in the desired direction lamb 1945 fossen 1994 and korotkin 2009 are the main references in this area ase method is only recommended for vehicles with simple geometry since their accuracy declines by increasing the complicacy of the vehicle s geometry therefore this method requires adequate experimental data and cannot take the complicated shape of an underwater vehicle into full account pan et al 2012 go and ahn 2019 additionally the potential based methods can predict the inertial hydrodynamic coefficients satisfactorily but with the viscous terms neglected pan et al 2012 moreover although efd methods may be the most reliable way to obtain added mass coefficients it is not only costly due to requiring special facilities and equipment such as pmm to apply the accelerated motions to the vehicle but also time consuming furthermore although applying cfd to simulate oscillatory motions applied by a pmm or ra eliminates the need for such equipment there are still some ambiguities in cfd simulations of the oscillatory motions that need to be dealt with thus it has been likely to use cfd as a supplementary method besides experimental tests although there have been some studies on cfd simulations of accelerating underwater bodies with forwarding speed conducted by cimbala 2003 and mishra et al 2011 the majority of numerical investigations have been performed to obtain added mass coefficients of ocean vehicles through simulating of the oscillatory motions the added mass has been previously predicted as a function of frequency and not of time while for streamlined underwater accelerating vehicles with forwarding speed added mass not only is time dependent but also has a significant effect on the dynamic behavior of the vehicle the goal of this paper is to propose a cfd method to calculate translational added mass coefficients of an axisymmetric underwater vehicle in both longitudinal and transverse directions the proposed method includes cfd simulations of the linear accelerated motion of an academic underwater vehicle with forwarding speed based on unsteady rans equations using a finite volume method fvm comparing this method with other methods indicates that the current method is simple relatively fast and quite accurate which can be used to obtain translational added mass coefficients of vehicles with complicated geometries one of the advantages of this method is that an experimental test can be performed in a towing tank facility with conditions similar to the proposed numerical method the obtained results of both methods then can be compared the geometric model of the vehicle used for the current study is shown in fig 2 the main characteristics of the vehicle are listed in table 1 2 methodology to estimate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the vehicle using unsteady forward speed cfd simulations of the accelerated flow around the vehicle in the x longitudinal and y transverse directions are required in the present work these accelerated motions are generated using two procedures discussed in detail in the following sections 2 1 procedure one as can be seen in fig 3 a in this procedure it is assumed that in a steady motion during the time period between t 0 to t t 0 the vehicle moves with a constant forward speed of v 0 inside the fluid domain then at t t 0 this motion is changed into an accelerated motion as can be seen in fig 3 b at 0 t t 0 the applied force on the vehicle named f s t only includes drag force that is proportional to squared velocity therefore in this period f s t remains unchanged since the velocity is constant however at t t 0 when the velocity profile changes to an accelerated motion the inertia force of the fluid is added to the drag force therefore as accelerated motion begins the dynamic pressures increases at the upstream while the effects of acceleration are not felt at the downstream this temporal pressure difference increases the pressure drag locally and in return the applied force on the vehicle at the beginning of the acceleration point i as the accelerated flow expands on the whole computational domain the initial local pressure difference starts to decrease leading to a reduction in drag force then in point j accelerated flow is expanded thoroughly in the domain this means that from point i to point j it takes a while for the accelerated flow to expand thoroughly over the fluid this feature is known as history effect without this effect the applied force to the vehicle at t t 0 would be as illustrated in fig 4 point k according to fig 3 at t t j applied force named f t r consists of both drag force f s t which is of viscous origin and the hydrodynamic or inertia force of the fluid which is proportional to the acceleration of the vehicle f t r is equal to ρ m a a where ρ represents the mass of the displaced volume of the fluid occupied by the vehicle m a is added mass of the vehicle in the intended direction and a is acceleration in the intended direction therefore m a can be obtained as follows 7 m a f t r f s t a ρ the nominator of the first term in the right hand side of this equation is the applied force due to the acceleration of the vehicle the estimate used in this method includes determination of the t j therefore this procedure entails an accurate estimate of the point j since applied force on the underwater vehicle has a notable variation around this point at a short period of time accurate identification of the point is always featured with error and obtained results include high inaccuracy thus a second procedure is proposed in which estimating t j is not required 2 2 procedure two in the second procedure the motion of the underwater vehicle is represented by a piecewise velocity function described as below 8 v t v 0 0 t t 0 a t b 1 t 0 t t 1 v 1 t 1 t t 2 a t b 2 t 2 t t 3 v 0 t t 3 as can be seen in fig 5 at t t 3 decelerated motion of the vehicle reaches the initial velocity of v 0 at this time the hydrodynamic force applied to the vehicle point p consists of the drag force of the vehicle at v t v 0 caused by the velocity effects as well as inertia force of the fluid surrounding the decelerating vehicle arisen as a result of added mass effect therefore the difference of the hydrodynamic force at t t 3 and drag force at t t 0 represents fluid inertia force which is equal to ρ m a a 9 f t t 3 f t t 0 ρ m a a 10 m a f t t 3 f t t 0 a ρ the main difference between two procedures is that at the second procedure hydrodynamic force including the acceleration effects point p is measured directly and doesn t need to any estimation in contrast the first procedure is based on the estimation of the hydrodynamic force after the history effect therefore in this paper the second procedure was used to calculate translational added mass coefficients of the underwater vehicle in both longitudinal and transverse directions comparing with previous cfd studies this method neither ignores viscosity in pressure distribution computation nor needs to conduct complicated simulations such as pmm tests the proposed method can simply simulate the accelerated motion of underwater vehicle moving with forward speed 3 validation to validate the proposed cfd method firstly the obtained drag and added mass coefficients are compared with those of the analytical and experimental results secondly the obtained results are investigated to be independent of the vehicle acceleration to deal with these issues translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of an ellipsoid are calculated using both the analytical method introduced by lamb 1945 and the cfd method proposed in this study then obtained results will be compared with each other as well as available experimental data collected by lee at al 2011 to this end we consider a fully submerged ellipsoid described in equation 11 with specifications illustrated in fig 6 11 x 2 a 2 y 2 b 2 z 2 c 2 1 3 1 analytical method 3 1 1 added mass coefficients for an ellipsoid with c b and a b lamb 1945 introduced k factors as k 1 α 0 2 α 0 12 k 2 β 0 2 β 0 where α 0 and β 0 are constants that are calculated based on the geometric specifications of an ellipsoid α 0 2 1 e 2 e 2 1 2 ln 1 e 1 e e 13 β 0 1 e 2 1 e 2 2 e 2 ln 1 e 1 e where e is the eccentricity of the meridian elliptical section which is given as follows 14 e 2 1 b a 2 by defining k factors lamb 1945 represented the following analytical formulation to calculate added mass derivatives of an ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse directions 15 x u k 1 m y v z w k 2 m where m represents the mass of the displaced volume of the fluid around the ellipsoid 16 m ρ 4 3 ρ π a b 2 given the geometric specifications of the ellipsoid in fig 6 and equations 12 14 lamb s k factors can be calculated as k 1 0 057859 17 k 2 0 897798 using calculated lamb s k factors and equations 15 16 added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse directions can be obtained as follows x u 9 682 k g 18 y v z w 150 23 k g 3 1 2 drag coefficient hoerner 1965 offered an empirically derived formula to calculate the drag coefficient of streamlined bodies like ellipsoids as follows 19 c d c f 4 λ 1 3 6 λ 7 6 24 λ 8 3 where λ is fineness ratio λ a b and c f is the skin friction coefficient of an equivalent flat plate which is a function of the reynolds number as bellow c f 0 455 log 10 r e 2 58 0 045 r e 1 6 20 r e v l υ where l 2 a and υ is the kinematic viscosity of the water therefore the drag coefficient of the proposed ellipsoid in longitudinal mode is obtained in two different velocities as indicated in table 2 3 2 cfd method procedure two now added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid in longitudinal x u and transverse y v directions are extracted using the proposed cfd method as noted to calculate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of a vehicle accelerated motion of the vehicle in the proposed direction should be simulated therefore the piecewise velocity profile expressed in equation 21 and shown in fig 7 was used to simulate the accelerated motions of the ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse directions ansys cfx commercial code was applied to carry out all simulations including urans computations based on an fvm moreover icem cfd software was used to generate a structured mesh in computational domains fig 8 illustrates a cut plan on the computational grid generated to simulate the accelerated motion of the ellipsoid in a longitudinal direction more details of the numerical simulation are given in section 4 figs 9 and 10 show applied hydrodynamic forces on the ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse accelerated motions respectively 21 v t 1 5 0 t 1 5 t 1 5 t 3 3 3 t 4 t 4 3 4 t 6 using figs 9 and 10 and equation 10 longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid are obtained as follows 22 x u f t 5 5 f t 1 5 u ρ 10 04 k g 23 y v f t 5 5 f t 1 5 v ρ 143 48 k g where a u v 1 m s 2 table 3 compares obtained longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid at a 1 m s 2 using analytical and numerical methods as indicated in this table numerical results agreed well with those of the analytical method lee et al 2011 obtained transverse added mass coefficient y v of an ellipsoid with the same specifications using pmm producing oscillating pure sway motion experimental data then were compared with cfd results achieved by performing a numerical simulation of oscillating pure sway motion table 4 compares the transverse added mass coefficient of the ellipsoid obtained with the current cfd method with numerical and experimental results calculated by lee et al 2011 as indicated in table 4 there is a discrepancy of 7 7 between numerical and experimental results obtained by lee et al 2011 moreover his numerical and experimental results have discrepancies of 15 84 and 9 38 respectively with transverse added mass coefficient obtained with analytical method whereas according to table 3 current cfd method has only a difference of 4 7 with the analytical method in predicting transverse added mass coefficient of the ellipsoid this reveals that to predict translational added mass coefficients of a vehicle in longitudinal and transverse directions numerical methods where the accelerated motion of the vehicle is simulated by considering forward speed problem give more acceptable results than numerical methods simulating oscillating motions according to fig 9 drag force applied on the ellipsoid in longitudinal mode at v 1 5 m s 1 and v 3 m s 1 is 9 575 n and 34 22 n respectively thus the drag coefficient of the ellipsoid in longitudinal mode can be calculated using an empirically derived formula given by hoerner 1965 as bellow 24 c d d 1 2 ρ v 2 2 3 where d is drag force and is the volume of the ellipsoid given equation 24 the drag coefficient of the ellipsoid in longitudinal mode at two velocities can be calculated using the current cfd method table 5 compares longitudinal drag coefficients of the ellipsoid obtained with analytical and current cfd methods 3 3 acceleration independent study as noted the results of the proposed cfd method should be independent of the acceleration of the vehicle it is necessary therefore to examine this criterion to this purpose two piecewise velocity profiles expressed in equations 25 and 26 and shown in fig 11 were used to simulate the accelerated motions of the ellipsoid at two different accelerations a 1 m s 2 a 0 5 m s 2 in the longitudinal direction to calculate x u applied hydrodynamic forces on the ellipsoid in longitudinal accelerated motions are shown in fig 12 25 v 1 t 1 5 0 t 1 5 t 1 5 t 3 3 3 t 4 t 4 3 4 t 6 26 v 2 t 1 0 t 1 0 5 t 0 5 1 t 2 1 5 2 t 3 0 5 t 3 1 5 3 t 5 using fig 12 and equation 10 longitudinal added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid at two velocity profile are obtained as follows 27 x u a 1 f t 5 5 f t 1 5 a ρ 10 04 k g 28 x u a 0 5 f t 4 f t 1 a ρ 10 25 k g as can be seen there is a difference of 2 05 between the obtained results at different accelerations this means that obtained numerical results with the proposed cfd method are acceleration independent given the validation the proposed cfd method has the required accuracy to extracting translational added mass coefficients therefore the proposed method was used to calculate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the underwater vehicle 4 cfd simulation ansys cfx commercial cfd software was applied to carry out all cfd simulations in this study the software uses a unique finite volume approach to discretizing navier stokes equations based on a vertex centered finite volume scheme ansys cfx solver satisfies strict global conservation by enforcing local conservation over control volumes that are constructed around each mesh vertex or node www ansys com cfd simulation procedure consists of governing equations generating computational domain and computational grid setting adequate boundary conditions mesh independence study and verification study all these steps are fully described below 4 1 governing equations incompressible rans equations are the governing equations of the cfd simulations and consist of the continuity and momentum equations expressed as below white 1985 29 u i x i 0 30 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i u i u j x j f i in these equations u i and f i refer to fluid velocity and external body force in i direction respectively p and ρ refer to the fluid pressure and density respectively υ is the total viscosity of the flow consisting of laminar and turbulent viscosity the shear stress transport sst turbulence model was employed to estimate the increased levels of stress within the boundary layer termed the reynolds stresses u i u j and predict the turbulent viscosity the sst turbulence model is a two zone turbulence model blending a variant of k ω model with a k ε in the outer boundary layer and far from the wall moreover it is known as a reliable turbulence model to simulate flow separation caused by the adverse pressure gradient in the wake region of the moving bodies menter 1994 wilcox 2006 4 2 domain mesh generation and boundary conditions as shown in fig 13 the computational domains were generated as fixed cuboids in space surrounding a full scale of the proposed underwater vehicle the accelerated motion of the vehicle is represented by applying relative velocity profiles at the inlet boundary as can be seen the inlet boundary condition was located at 1 5l upstream of the vehicle with inlet velocity profile u i n l e t u t 0 0 for longitudinal accelerated motion and u i n l e t 0 v t 0 for the transverse accelerated motion of the vehicle u t and v t are described in equations 31 and 32 respectively an outlet boundary condition with zero relative pressure was applied at 3 5l downstream of the vehicle in longitudinal mode figs 13 a and 4 5l downstream of the vehicle in transverse mode fig 13 b free slip wall boundary condition was used for the sidewalls located 6d and 1 5l away from the vehicle in longitudinal and transverse accelerated motions respectively no slip boundary condition was applied to the vehicle 31 u t 1 5 0 t 1 5 t 1 5 t 3 3 3 t 4 t 4 3 4 t 6 32 v t 1 0 t 1 0 5 t 0 5 1 t 2 1 5 2 t 3 0 5 t 3 1 5 3 t 5 ansys icem cfd was applied to generate an unstructured mesh in computational domains since low re turbulent models like sst aim to resolve the laminar sub layer region y 5 where viscous effects are dominant an appropriate mesh resolution is required therefore the average y value was set to be close to 1 to ensure that laminar sub layer is fully resolved to estimate the first prismatic layer thickness base on a specified value of y an empirical equation expressed as δ y l δ y 80 r e l 13 14 is recommended ansys 2009 where l is the reference length equal to the length of the vehicle therefore using y 1 and the velocity of 1 5 m s 1 the first layer thickness was about 0 017 mm for all equations high resolution and second order backward euler were used as discretization schemes for advection and transient terms respectively using a time step of 0 012 s resulted in a courant number less than 1 and achieving the convergence criterion of 1e 5 in 4 internal iterations all simulations were carried out on a desktop computer with 8 cores xeon processors and 32 gb internal memory in double precision and parallel mode 4 3 mesh independence study to ensure that the numerical solution is independent of the mesh resolution a systematic grid refinement of 2 was applied to generate three mesh configurations classified as coarse medium and fine with characteristics shown in table 6 for both longitudinal and transverse modes respectively the drag coefficient of the underwater vehicle defined as c d a 2 d ρ v 2 a was computed for each mesh configuration where d means drag force of the vehicle v refers to the velocity v 1 5 m s 1 and a is the projected area of the vehicle obtained cfd results were also compared with experimental measurements of the vehicle collected by javanmard 2013 clearly the fine mesh configurations used for longitudinal and transverse modes show the minimum relative differences of 3 52 and 5 82 with the experimental results respectively therefore using the fine mesh configuration for each mode guarantees that the results were mesh independent to confirm that mesh convergence is achieved another mesh configuration named as very fine grid was generated consisting of 13 8 and 21 41 million elements for longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively according to figs 14 and 15 using this grid configuration led to insignificant increase of 1 04 and 1 37 in predicted drag coefficient of the underwater vehicle in longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively therefore using the fine mesh configuration for each mode ensure that the results were numerically cost effective fig 16 illustrates longitudinal cut plan on different computational grids around the vehicle including coarse medium and fine mesh configurations fig 17 illustrates the surface mesh on the vehicle a detailed view of the computational grid corresponding to the fine mesh configuration utilized in the mesh independence study is shown in fig 18 4 4 verification study when adequately fine mesh resolution was generated the capability of the cfd solver in solving the system of equations needs to be assessed to this end the grid convergence index gci method based on richardson extrapolation method richardson 1911 richardson and gant 1927 was applied in this paper to estimate discretization error in cfd simulations since it is a recommended approach for estimation of discretization error in cfd simulations celik et al 2008 for three mesh configurations grid 3 course grid 2 medium and grid 1 fine the grid refinement factors r 32 and r 21 are computed as r 32 h 3 h 2 and r 21 h 2 h 1 where h i is a representative grid size of the i t h grid in gci method the first step is the calculation of the apparent order of the method p a as below 33 p a ln ε 32 ε 21 q p a ln r 21 where ε 32 3 2 and ε 21 2 1 k is a key variable on the k t h grid like c d a in the present study q p a can be estimated as 34 q p a ln r 21 p a s r 32 p a s where s can be obtained as 35 s 1 s i g n ε 32 ε 21 the extrapolated value e x t 21 approximate relative error e a 21 and extrapolated relative error e e x t 21 are calculated using the following equations respectively 36 e x t 21 r 21 p a 1 2 r 21 p a 1 37 e a 21 1 2 1 38 e e x t 21 e x t 21 1 e x t 21 finally the fine grid convergence index is calculated by 39 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p a 1 table 7 presents numerical uncertainties in the estimation of the drag coefficient using three mesh configurations employed in mesh independence study as can be seen numerical uncertainties are around 1 23 and 1 43 for computed values of c d a for longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively according to these values maximum uncertainties in calculated c d a are 0 0024 and 0 0083 for longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively 5 results and discussion as described in section 4 two sets of velocity profiles indicated in equations 31 and 32 have been used for cfd simulations to calculate translational added mass coefficients of the underwater vehicle in both longitudinal and transverse directions x u and y v the obtained results are presented below 5 1 estimation of longitudinal added mass x u the accelerated motion of the vehicle in the longitudinal direction was simulated using the velocity profile indicated in equation 31 as shown in fig 19 in this case the applied hydrodynamic force on the vehicle in the longitudinal direction is shown in fig 20 using obtained hydrodynamic force in fig 20 and equation 10 longitudinal added mass coefficient of the vehicle was obtained as follows 40 x u f t 5 5 f t 1 5 u ρ 3 586 k g velocity vectors and streamlines around the rear of the vehicle at t 1 5 s and t 5 5 s are shown in figs 21 and 22 respectively according to these figures one can conclude that at t 5 5 s due to the deceleration of the vehicle and inertia effect of the surrounding fluid the wake is compressed comparing to the wake at t 1 5 s this explains how acceleration deceleration of a vehicle creates an extra force attributed to the added mass in order to show that how the inertia force of the fluid surrounding the accelerating vehicle affects the hydrodynamic force applied to the vehicle the pressure coefficient c p p p r e f 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 was calculated around the vehicle at t 1 5 s and t 5 5 s as shown in fig 23 according to this figure pressure distribution around the vehicle at t 1 5 s is generated due to the velocity effects that induces drag force to the vehicle whereas at t 5 5 s pressure distribution around the vehicle consists of both velocity and acceleration added mass effects one can therefore conclude that c p m c p t 5 5 s c p t 1 5 s represents applied pressure to the vehicle due to added mass effects as shown in fig 24 5 2 estimation of transverse added mass y v the accelerated motion of the vehicle in the transverse direction was simulated using the velocity profile indicated in equation 32 as shown in fig 25 in this case the applied hydrodynamic force on the vehicle in the transverse direction is shown in fig 26 using obtained hydrodynamic force in fig 26 and equation 10 transverse added mass coefficient of the vehicle was obtained as follows 41 y v f t 4 f t 1 v ρ 50 15 k g 6 conclusion in the present paper a cfd procedure was presented to calculate translational added mass coefficients of an axisymmetric underwater vehicle to validate the obtained results drag and added mass coefficients of an ellipsoid were obtained using the proposed cfd method and compared with the analytical and experimental results moreover by performing an acceleration sensitivity study it was shown that calculated added mass coefficients were acceleration independent it was also shown that the validation study revealed that the proposed cfd procedure has an acceptable level of accuracy to extract translational added mass coefficients a set of numerical simulations based on unsteady rans computations was performed using ansys cfx software to simulate accelerated motions of the vehicle to extract translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients the proposed numerical method can be used instead of the experimental methods which are dependent on performing oscillatory motions using pmm the pmm are technically demanding expensive and time consuming with a complicated procedure in data analyzing in addition although applying cfd to simulate oscillatory motions in pmm tests reduces the cost of the research significantly there are still some ambiguities in this implementation in contrast the presented method is not complicated and time consuming and can be used as a reliable and inexpensive method to extract translational added mass coefficients of underwater vehicles moreover the added mass coefficients

motion in other words the added mass is an additional hydrodynamic reaction force generated by the surrounding water when the underwater vehicle accelerates prestero 2001 estimating inaccurate added mass coefficients results in inefficient dynamic model and consequently affects manoeuvrability of the vehicle in the hydrodynamic analysis of an underwater vehicle two reference frames namely body fixed and earth fixed reference frames are introduced the body fixed reference frame is a moving coordinate frame fixed to the vehicle linear and angular velocities are given relative to this frame in the earth fixed reference frame on the other hand the position and orientation of the vehicle are given relative to a fixed origin the origin of the earth fixed frame is a specific point in space while the origin of the body fixed frame is the center of buoyancy of the vehicle the body fixed and earth fixed coordinate frames for an underwater vehicle with six degrees of freedom dof motion along with applied hydrodynamic loads are shown in fig 1 the dynamics of an underwater vehicle motion is analyzed using mathematical models known as the dynamic model the dynamic model covers all hydrodynamic forces and moments applied to the underwater vehicle these hydrodynamic loads are not usually constant in time they are a function of the velocity acceleration and the shape of the vehicle therefore they are expressed as hydrodynamic coefficients multiplied by linear and angular velocities and accelerations linearized equations of the motion including hydrodynamic loads applied to the vehicle with 6 dof are shown in equations 1 6 these equations represent the dynamic model of the vehicle using a hydrodynamic derivatives concept determination of the hydrodynamic coefficients used in these equations is crucial stage of performing hydrodynamic analysis 1 x n e t x u u x u u x q q 2 y n e t y v v y r r y v v y r r y δ r δ r 3 z n e t z w w z q q z w w z q q z δ s δ s 4 k n e

known as damping coefficients given the dynamic model in equations 1 6 the coefficients x u x q y v y r y δ r z w z q z δ s k p m w m q m δ s n v n r and n δ r are damping coefficients of the underwater vehicle other hydrodynamic loads are applied to the vehicle when it changes its velocity or its motion direction the value of these loads depends on angular and transitional accelerations

shadlaghani and mansoorzadeh 2016 chen et al 2017 guo and zou 2017 pook et al 2018 javanmard and mansoorzadeh 2019 and go and ahn 2019 used cfd to obtain hydrodynamics coefficients added mass coefficients in particular can be obtained using efd cfd and ase methods in experimental methods dynamic tests using ra and pmm are performed to apply the required motions and maneuvers to the vehicle on horizontal and vertical planes perturbed surge maneuver pure sway and pure yaw are among the oscillatory and hence accelerating motions that are generated by a pmm these accelerated motions apply hydrodynamic loads to the vehicle that are measured and analyzed through performing a detailed fourier analysis to calculate added mass coefficients cfd includes two ways to estimate added mass coefficients of submersible vehicles the first one is based on the assumption of the potential flow and includes panel method pm and boundary element method bem in practice due to the viscosity of the fluid flow around the vehicle this assumption decreases the accuracy of the obtained results sahin et al 1993 1997 and lin and liao 2011 used pm and bem to estimate added mass coefficients of underwater vehicles in a second way commercial cfd software is applied to simulate dynamic tests performed by pmm and rm in these simulations reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations including viscosity effect are solved in a computational domain among researchers implementing cfd simulations to predict added mass coefficients studies conducted by phillips et al 2007 sakamoto 2009 tang et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 javanmard 2013 and kim et al 2015b are notable analytical methods including strip theory st and equivalent ellipsoid method emm only rely on the geometric specifications of the vehicle to calculate the added mass coefficients the main principle in these methods is to find the velocity potential using boundary conditions and use it to determine pressure distribution around the vehicle based on bernoulli s equation finally obtained pressure distribution yields the hydrodynamic forces and moments applied on the vehicle according to st a vehicle can be made up of a finite number of transversal two dimensional slices and the added mass of the whole vehicle is obtained by integration of the value of the slice over the length of the vehicle sen and vinh 2016 korvin kroukovsky and jacobs 1957 introduced the first formulation of the st known as the ordinary strip theory method this method then was developed by tasai 1969 with modified strip theory method perstro 2001 and ferreira et al 2009 implemented st to calculate added mass coefficients of underwater vehicles in emm different parts of the vehicle are relatively assumed as equivalent ellipsoids with specified geometrical parameters using the analytical methods the added mass coefficients of any specific ellipsoid can be obtained through solving laplace equations for velocity potential integration of the all calculated added mass coefficients for different parts of the vehicle in a specific direction yields the added mass coefficient of the whole vehicle in the desired direction lamb 1945 fossen 1994 and korotkin 2009 are the main references in this area ase method is only recommended for vehicles with simple geometry since their accuracy declines by increasing the complicacy of the vehicle s geometry therefore this method requires adequate experimental data and cannot take the complicated shape of an underwater vehicle into full account pan et al 2012 go and ahn 2019 additionally the potential based methods can predict the inertial hydrodynamic coefficients satisfactorily but with the viscous terms neglected pan et al 2012 moreover although efd methods may be the most reliable way to obtain added mass coefficients it is not only costly due to requiring special facilities and equipment such as pmm to apply the accelerated motions to the vehicle but also time consuming furthermore although applying cfd to simulate oscillatory motions applied by a pmm or ra eliminates the need for such equipment there are still some ambiguities in cfd simulations of the oscillatory motions that need to be dealt with thus it has been likely to use cfd as a supplementary method besides experimental tests although there have been some studies on cfd simulations of accelerating underwater bodies with forwarding speed conducted by cimbala 2003 and mishra et al 2011 the majority of numerical investigations have been performed to obtain added mass coefficients of ocean vehicles through simulating of the oscillatory motions the added mass has been previously predicted as a function of frequency and not of time while for streamlined underwater accelerating vehicles with forwarding speed added mass not only is time dependent but also has a significant effect on the dynamic behavior of the vehicle the goal of this paper is to propose a cfd method to calculate translational added mass coefficients of an axisymmetric underwater vehicle in both longitudinal and transverse directions the proposed method includes cfd simulations of the linear accelerated motion of an academic underwater vehicle with forwarding speed based on unsteady rans equations using a finite volume method fvm comparing this method with other methods indicates that the current method is simple relatively fast and quite accurate which can be used to obtain translational added mass coefficients of vehicles with complicated geometries one of the advantages of this method is that an experimental test can be performed in a towing tank facility with conditions similar to the proposed numerical method the obtained results of both methods then can be compared the geometric model of the vehicle used for the current study is shown in fig 2 the main characteristics of the vehicle are listed in table 1 2 methodology to estimate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the vehicle using unsteady forward speed cfd simulations of the accelerated flow around the vehicle in the x longitudinal and y transverse directions are required in the present work these accelerated motions are generated using two procedures discussed in detail in the following sections 2 1 procedure one as can be seen in fig 3 a in this procedure it is assumed that in a steady motion during the time period between t 0 to t t 0 the vehicle moves with a constant forward speed of v 0 inside the fluid domain then at t t 0 this motion is changed into an accelerated motion as can be seen in fig 3 b at 0 t t 0 the applied force on the vehicle named f s t only includes drag force that is proportional to squared velocity therefore in this period f s t remains unchanged since the velocity is constant however at t t 0 when the velocity profile changes to an accelerated motion the inertia force of the fluid is added to the drag force therefore as accelerated motion begins the dynamic pressures increases at the upstream while the effects of acceleration are not felt at the downstream this temporal pressure difference increases the pressure drag locally and in return the applied force on the vehicle at the beginning of the acceleration point i as the accelerated flow expands on the whole computational domain the initial local pressure difference starts to decrease leading to a reduction in drag force then in point j accelerated flow is expanded thoroughly in the domain this means that from point i to point j it takes a while for the accelerated flow to expand thoroughly over the fluid this feature is known as history effect without this effect the applied force to the vehicle at t t 0 would be as illustrated in fig 4 point k according to fig 3 at t t j applied force named f t r consists of both drag force f s t which is of viscous origin and the hydrodynamic or inertia force of the fluid which is proportional to the acceleration of the vehicle f t r is equal to ρ m a a where ρ represents the mass of the displaced volume of the fluid occupied by the vehicle m a is added mass of the vehicle in the intended direction and a is acceleration in the intended direction therefore m a can be obtained as follows 7 m a f t r f s t a ρ the nominator of the first term in the right hand side of this equation is the applied force due to the acceleration of the vehicle the estimate used in this method includes determination of the t j therefore this procedure entails an accurate estimate of the point j since applied force on the underwater vehicle has a notable variation around this point at a short period of time accurate identification of the point is always featured with error and obtained results include high inaccuracy thus a second procedure is proposed in which estimating t j is not required 2 2 procedure two in the second procedure the motion of the underwater vehicle is represented by a piecewise velocity function described as below 8 v t v 0 0 t t 0 a t b 1 t 0 t t 1 v 1 t 1 t t 2 a t b 2 t 2 t t 3 v 0 t t 3 as can be seen in fig 5 at t t 3 decelerated motion of the vehicle reaches the initial velocity of v 0 at this time the hydrodynamic force applied to the vehicle point p consists of the drag force of the vehicle at v t v 0 caused by the velocity effects as well as inertia force of the fluid surrounding the decelerating vehicle arisen as a result of added mass effect therefore the difference of the hydrodynamic force at t t 3 and drag force at t t 0 represents fluid inertia force which is equal to ρ m a a 9 f t t 3 f t t 0 ρ m a a 10 m a f t t 3 f t t 0 a ρ the main difference between two procedures is that at the second procedure hydrodynamic force including the acceleration effects point p is measured directly and doesn t need to any estimation in contrast the first procedure is based on the estimation of the hydrodynamic force after the history effect therefore in this paper the second procedure was used to calculate translational added mass coefficients of the underwater vehicle in both longitudinal and transverse directions comparing with previous cfd studies this method neither ignores viscosity in pressure distribution computation nor needs to conduct complicated simulations such as pmm tests the proposed method can simply simulate the accelerated motion of underwater vehicle moving with forward speed 3 validation to validate the proposed cfd method firstly the obtained drag and added mass coefficients are compared with those of the analytical and experimental results secondly the obtained results are investigated to be independent of the vehicle acceleration to deal with these issues translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of an ellipsoid are calculated using both the analytical method introduced by lamb 1945 and the cfd method proposed in this study then obtained results will be compared with each other as well as available experimental data collected by lee at al 2011 to this end we consider a fully submerged ellipsoid described in equation 11 with specifications illustrated in fig 6 11 x 2 a 2 y 2 b 2 z 2 c 2 1 3 1 analytical method 3 1 1 added mass coefficients for an ellipsoid with c b and a b lamb 1945 introduced k factors as k 1 α 0 2 α 0 12 k 2 β 0 2 β 0 where α 0 and β 0 are constants that are calculated based on the geometric specifications of an ellipsoid α 0 2 1 e 2 e 2 1 2 ln 1 e 1 e e 13 β 0 1 e 2 1 e 2 2 e 2 ln 1 e 1 e where e is the eccentricity of the meridian elliptical section which is given as follows 14 e 2 1 b a 2 by defining k factors lamb 1945 represented the following analytical formulation to calculate added mass derivatives of an ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse directions 15 x u k 1 m y v z w k 2 m where m represents the mass of the displaced volume of the fluid around the ellipsoid 16 m ρ 4 3 ρ π a b 2 given the geometric specifications of the ellipsoid in fig 6 and equations 12 14 lamb s k factors can be calculated as k 1 0 057859 17 k 2 0 897798 using calculated lamb s k factors and equations 15 16 added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse directions can be obtained as follows x u 9 682 k g 18 y v z w 150 23 k g 3 1 2 drag coefficient hoerner 1965 offered an empirically derived formula to calculate the drag coefficient of streamlined bodies like ellipsoids as follows 19 c d c f 4 λ 1 3 6 λ 7 6 24 λ 8 3 where λ is fineness ratio λ a b and c f is the skin friction coefficient of an equivalent flat plate which is a function of the reynolds number as bellow c f 0 455 log 10 r e 2 58 0 045 r e 1 6 20 r e v l υ where l 2 a and υ is the kinematic viscosity of the water therefore the drag coefficient of the proposed ellipsoid in longitudinal mode is obtained in two different velocities as indicated in table 2 3 2 cfd method procedure two now added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid in longitudinal x u and transverse y v directions are extracted using the proposed cfd method as noted to calculate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of a vehicle accelerated motion of the vehicle in the proposed direction should be simulated therefore the piecewise velocity profile expressed in equation 21 and shown in fig 7 was used to simulate the accelerated motions of the ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse directions ansys cfx commercial code was applied to carry out all simulations including urans computations based on an fvm moreover icem cfd software was used to generate a structured mesh in computational domains fig 8 illustrates a cut plan on the computational grid generated to simulate the accelerated motion of the ellipsoid in a longitudinal direction more details of the numerical simulation are given in section 4 figs 9 and 10 show applied hydrodynamic forces on the ellipsoid in longitudinal and transverse accelerated motions respectively 21 v t 1 5 0 t 1 5 t 1 5 t 3 3 3 t 4 t 4 3 4 t 6 using figs 9 and 10 and equation 10 longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid are obtained as follows 22 x u f t 5 5 f t 1 5 u ρ 10 04 k g 23 y v f t 5 5 f t 1 5 v ρ 143 48 k g where a u v 1 m s 2 table 3 compares obtained longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid at a 1 m s 2 using analytical and numerical methods as indicated in this table numerical results agreed well with those of the analytical method lee et al 2011 obtained transverse added mass coefficient y v of an ellipsoid with the same specifications using pmm producing oscillating pure sway motion experimental data then were compared with cfd results achieved by performing a numerical simulation of oscillating pure sway motion table 4 compares the transverse added mass coefficient of the ellipsoid obtained with the current cfd method with numerical and experimental results calculated by lee et al 2011 as indicated in table 4 there is a discrepancy of 7 7 between numerical and experimental results obtained by lee et al 2011 moreover his numerical and experimental results have discrepancies of 15 84 and 9 38 respectively with transverse added mass coefficient obtained with analytical method whereas according to table 3 current cfd method has only a difference of 4 7 with the analytical method in predicting transverse added mass coefficient of the ellipsoid this reveals that to predict translational added mass coefficients of a vehicle in longitudinal and transverse directions numerical methods where the accelerated motion of the vehicle is simulated by considering forward speed problem give more acceptable results than numerical methods simulating oscillating motions according to fig 9 drag force applied on the ellipsoid in longitudinal mode at v 1 5 m s 1 and v 3 m s 1 is 9 575 n and 34 22 n respectively thus the drag coefficient of the ellipsoid in longitudinal mode can be calculated using an empirically derived formula given by hoerner 1965 as bellow 24 c d d 1 2 ρ v 2 2 3 where d is drag force and is the volume of the ellipsoid given equation 24 the drag coefficient of the ellipsoid in longitudinal mode at two velocities can be calculated using the current cfd method table 5 compares longitudinal drag coefficients of the ellipsoid obtained with analytical and current cfd methods 3 3 acceleration independent study as noted the results of the proposed cfd method should be independent of the acceleration of the vehicle it is necessary therefore to examine this criterion to this purpose two piecewise velocity profiles expressed in equations 25 and 26 and shown in fig 11 were used to simulate the accelerated motions of the ellipsoid at two different accelerations a 1 m s 2 a 0 5 m s 2 in the longitudinal direction to calculate x u applied hydrodynamic forces on the ellipsoid in longitudinal accelerated motions are shown in fig 12 25 v 1 t 1 5 0 t 1 5 t 1 5 t 3 3 3 t 4 t 4 3 4 t 6 26 v 2 t 1 0 t 1 0 5 t 0 5 1 t 2 1 5 2 t 3 0 5 t 3 1 5 3 t 5 using fig 12 and equation 10 longitudinal added mass coefficients of the ellipsoid at two velocity profile are obtained as follows 27 x u a 1 f t 5 5 f t 1 5 a ρ 10 04 k g 28 x u a 0 5 f t 4 f t 1 a ρ 10 25 k g as can be seen there is a difference of 2 05 between the obtained results at different accelerations this means that obtained numerical results with the proposed cfd method are acceleration independent given the validation the proposed cfd method has the required accuracy to extracting translational added mass coefficients therefore the proposed method was used to calculate translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients of the underwater vehicle 4 cfd simulation ansys cfx commercial cfd software was applied to carry out all cfd simulations in this study the software uses a unique finite volume approach to discretizing navier stokes equations based on a vertex centered finite volume scheme ansys cfx solver satisfies strict global conservation by enforcing local conservation over control volumes that are constructed around each mesh vertex or node www ansys com cfd simulation procedure consists of governing equations generating computational domain and computational grid setting adequate boundary conditions mesh independence study and verification study all these steps are fully described below 4 1 governing equations incompressible rans equations are the governing equations of the cfd simulations and consist of the continuity and momentum equations expressed as below white 1985 29 u i x i 0 30 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i x j υ u i x j u j x i u i u j x j f i in these equations u i and f i refer to fluid velocity and external body force in i direction respectively p and ρ refer to the fluid pressure and density respectively υ is the total viscosity of the flow consisting of laminar and turbulent viscosity the shear stress transport sst turbulence model was employed to estimate the increased levels of stress within the boundary layer termed the reynolds stresses u i u j and predict the turbulent viscosity the sst turbulence model is a two zone turbulence model blending a variant of k ω model with a k ε in the outer boundary layer and far from the wall moreover it is known as a reliable turbulence model to simulate flow separation caused by the adverse pressure gradient in the wake region of the moving bodies menter 1994 wilcox 2006 4 2 domain mesh generation and boundary conditions as shown in fig 13 the computational domains were generated as fixed cuboids in space surrounding a full scale of the proposed underwater vehicle the accelerated motion of the vehicle is represented by applying relative velocity profiles at the inlet boundary as can be seen the inlet boundary condition was located at 1 5l upstream of the vehicle with inlet velocity profile u i n l e t u t 0 0 for longitudinal accelerated motion and u i n l e t 0 v t 0 for the transverse accelerated motion of the vehicle u t and v t are described in equations 31 and 32 respectively an outlet boundary condition with zero relative pressure was applied at 3 5l downstream of the vehicle in longitudinal mode figs 13 a and 4 5l downstream of the vehicle in transverse mode fig 13 b free slip wall boundary condition was used for the sidewalls located 6d and 1 5l away from the vehicle in longitudinal and transverse accelerated motions respectively no slip boundary condition was applied to the vehicle 31 u t 1 5 0 t 1 5 t 1 5 t 3 3 3 t 4 t 4 3 4 t 6 32 v t 1 0 t 1 0 5 t 0 5 1 t 2 1 5 2 t 3 0 5 t 3 1 5 3 t 5 ansys icem cfd was applied to generate an unstructured mesh in computational domains since low re turbulent models like sst aim to resolve the laminar sub layer region y 5 where viscous effects are dominant an appropriate mesh resolution is required therefore the average y value was set to be close to 1 to ensure that laminar sub layer is fully resolved to estimate the first prismatic layer thickness base on a specified value of y an empirical equation expressed as δ y l δ y 80 r e l 13 14 is recommended ansys 2009 where l is the reference length equal to the length of the vehicle therefore using y 1 and the velocity of 1 5 m s 1 the first layer thickness was about 0 017 mm for all equations high resolution and second order backward euler were used as discretization schemes for advection and transient terms respectively using a time step of 0 012 s resulted in a courant number less than 1 and achieving the convergence criterion of 1e 5 in 4 internal iterations all simulations were carried out on a desktop computer with 8 cores xeon processors and 32 gb internal memory in double precision and parallel mode 4 3 mesh independence study to ensure that the numerical solution is independent of the mesh resolution a systematic grid refinement of 2 was applied to generate three mesh configurations classified as coarse medium and fine with characteristics shown in table 6 for both longitudinal and transverse modes respectively the drag coefficient of the underwater vehicle defined as c d a 2 d ρ v 2 a was computed for each mesh configuration where d means drag force of the vehicle v refers to the velocity v 1 5 m s 1 and a is the projected area of the vehicle obtained cfd results were also compared with experimental measurements of the vehicle collected by javanmard 2013 clearly the fine mesh configurations used for longitudinal and transverse modes show the minimum relative differences of 3 52 and 5 82 with the experimental results respectively therefore using the fine mesh configuration for each mode guarantees that the results were mesh independent to confirm that mesh convergence is achieved another mesh configuration named as very fine grid was generated consisting of 13 8 and 21 41 million elements for longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively according to figs 14 and 15 using this grid configuration led to insignificant increase of 1 04 and 1 37 in predicted drag coefficient of the underwater vehicle in longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively therefore using the fine mesh configuration for each mode ensure that the results were numerically cost effective fig 16 illustrates longitudinal cut plan on different computational grids around the vehicle including coarse medium and fine mesh configurations fig 17 illustrates the surface mesh on the vehicle a detailed view of the computational grid corresponding to the fine mesh configuration utilized in the mesh independence study is shown in fig 18 4 4 verification study when adequately fine mesh resolution was generated the capability of the cfd solver in solving the system of equations needs to be assessed to this end the grid convergence index gci method based on richardson extrapolation method richardson 1911 richardson and gant 1927 was applied in this paper to estimate discretization error in cfd simulations since it is a recommended approach for estimation of discretization error in cfd simulations celik et al 2008 for three mesh configurations grid 3 course grid 2 medium and grid 1 fine the grid refinement factors r 32 and r 21 are computed as r 32 h 3 h 2 and r 21 h 2 h 1 where h i is a representative grid size of the i t h grid in gci method the first step is the calculation of the apparent order of the method p a as below 33 p a ln ε 32 ε 21 q p a ln r 21 where ε 32 3 2 and ε 21 2 1 k is a key variable on the k t h grid like c d a in the present study q p a can be estimated as 34 q p a ln r 21 p a s r 32 p a s where s can be obtained as 35 s 1 s i g n ε 32 ε 21 the extrapolated value e x t 21 approximate relative error e a 21 and extrapolated relative error e e x t 21 are calculated using the following equations respectively 36 e x t 21 r 21 p a 1 2 r 21 p a 1 37 e a 21 1 2 1 38 e e x t 21 e x t 21 1 e x t 21 finally the fine grid convergence index is calculated by 39 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p a 1 table 7 presents numerical uncertainties in the estimation of the drag coefficient using three mesh configurations employed in mesh independence study as can be seen numerical uncertainties are around 1 23 and 1 43 for computed values of c d a for longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively according to these values maximum uncertainties in calculated c d a are 0 0024 and 0 0083 for longitudinal and transverse motion modes respectively 5 results and discussion as described in section 4 two sets of velocity profiles indicated in equations 31 and 32 have been used for cfd simulations to calculate translational added mass coefficients of the underwater vehicle in both longitudinal and transverse directions x u and y v the obtained results are presented below 5 1 estimation of longitudinal added mass x u the accelerated motion of the vehicle in the longitudinal direction was simulated using the velocity profile indicated in equation 31 as shown in fig 19 in this case the applied hydrodynamic force on the vehicle in the longitudinal direction is shown in fig 20 using obtained hydrodynamic force in fig 20 and equation 10 longitudinal added mass coefficient of the vehicle was obtained as follows 40 x u f t 5 5 f t 1 5 u ρ 3 586 k g velocity vectors and streamlines around the rear of the vehicle at t 1 5 s and t 5 5 s are shown in figs 21 and 22 respectively according to these figures one can conclude that at t 5 5 s due to the deceleration of the vehicle and inertia effect of the surrounding fluid the wake is compressed comparing to the wake at t 1 5 s this explains how acceleration deceleration of a vehicle creates an extra force attributed to the added mass in order to show that how the inertia force of the fluid surrounding the accelerating vehicle affects the hydrodynamic force applied to the vehicle the pressure coefficient c p p p r e f 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 was calculated around the vehicle at t 1 5 s and t 5 5 s as shown in fig 23 according to this figure pressure distribution around the vehicle at t 1 5 s is generated due to the velocity effects that induces drag force to the vehicle whereas at t 5 5 s pressure distribution around the vehicle consists of both velocity and acceleration added mass effects one can therefore conclude that c p m c p t 5 5 s c p t 1 5 s represents applied pressure to the vehicle due to added mass effects as shown in fig 24 5 2 estimation of transverse added mass y v the accelerated motion of the vehicle in the transverse direction was simulated using the velocity profile indicated in equation 32 as shown in fig 25 in this case the applied hydrodynamic force on the vehicle in the transverse direction is shown in fig 26 using obtained hydrodynamic force in fig 26 and equation 10 transverse added mass coefficient of the vehicle was obtained as follows 41 y v f t 4 f t 1 v ρ 50 15 k g 6 conclusion in the present paper a cfd procedure was presented to calculate translational added mass coefficients of an axisymmetric underwater vehicle to validate the obtained results drag and added mass coefficients of an ellipsoid were obtained using the proposed cfd method and compared with the analytical and experimental results moreover by performing an acceleration sensitivity study it was shown that calculated added mass coefficients were acceleration independent it was also shown that the validation study revealed that the proposed cfd procedure has an acceptable level of accuracy to extract translational added mass coefficients a set of numerical simulations based on unsteady rans computations was performed using ansys cfx software to simulate accelerated motions of the vehicle to extract translational longitudinal and transverse added mass coefficients the proposed numerical method can be used instead of the experimental methods which are dependent on performing oscillatory motions using pmm the pmm are technically demanding expensive and time consuming with a complicated procedure in data analyzing in addition although applying cfd to simulate oscillatory motions in pmm tests reduces the cost of the research significantly there are still some ambiguities in this implementation in contrast the presented method is not complicated and time consuming and can be used as a reliable and inexpensive method to extract translational added mass coefficients of underwater vehicles moreover the added mass coefficients obtained by the present method are more robust than the corresponding values obtained by numerical methods involving simulation of oscillating motions credit authorship contribution statement ehsan

21562,particle breakage plays an important role in strength degradation of granular soils and thus needs to be considered in the analysis of caisson foundation however no relevant research has been reported before in this study the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation is investigated with discrete element method dem firstly breakage models are reviewed and the one based on replacement method is adopted biaxial tests are conducted to validate the breakage model then a caisson foundation is investigated with the consideration of particle breakage this study demonstrates that 1 both the horizontal and rotational bearing capacities are decreased by particle breakage 2 successive breakages tend to happen near the caisson skirt while individual breakages are more common in regions far from the skirt 3 the particle rotation apr and force chain concentration are much smaller when particle breakage is considered 4 particle breakage decreases the magnitude of the anisotropy induced by external loads keywords caisson foundation particle breakage microstructure discrete element method soil fabric micromechanics 1 introduction caisson foundations have been widely used for bridges wind turbines dams and other structures that need underwater support a caisson is a hollow and watertight chamber made of steel or concrete and it is often open at the bottom and closed at the top when used as the foundation for an offshore wind turbine the caisson is floated or hauled to the job site and then sunk the seabed the caisson is pushed into the soil by self weight and the suction force which is induced by pumping the water out of the caisson compared with other types of foundations hong et al 2017 horpibulsuk and niramitkornburee 2010 horpibulsuk et al 2004 lai et al 2020 shen et al 2013b 2017 wang et al 2018 there are several advantages using caisson foundations including fast installation low cost and high adaptability to different soil conditions a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the behavior of caisson foundation with experimental analytical or numerical methods experimental studies ranging from small scale model test to full scale field test were used to investigate the horizontal and moment bearing capacities seismic response soil skirt interaction and lateral response of caisson foundations barari and ibsen 2012 kou et al 2019 lian et al 2014 wang et al 2017a 2017b yun and bransby 2007 for the analytical methods the bearing capacity failure mechanism and effect of strength non homogeneity were investigated with strain hardening plasticity model cassidy et al 2006 villalobos et al 2009 macro element method jin et al 2019c skau et al 2018 plasticity theory tani and craig 1995 and hyperplasticity theory nguyen sy and houlsby 2005 within the framework of continuum mechanics numerical methods including finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm were widely used to study the caisson foundations at various loading combinations from the insertion process to the failure process achmus et al 2013 bagheri et al 2017 jin et al 2019a 2019b mehravar et al 2017 in a recent study conducted by the authors wang and yin 2020 contrary to previous research focusing on the macroscopic behaviors the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation was analyzed in detail with the help of discrete element method dem the dem was proposed in 1970s cundall 1971 and is now widely used to study the behavior of soils at the particle scale in geotechnical engineering yin et al 2020 this method allows calculating the movements of particles based on the newton s second law and the induced contact forces from force displacement law in addition by bonding elementary spheres together the dem is able to simulate particles or materials with different shapes li et al 2020 the dem could provide detailed data of particles and contacts such as contact force contact orientation and particle movement and therefore allows more detailed micro mechanical analysis than fem or fdm as proved by many previous studies the behavior and bearing capacity of a caisson foundation are closely related to the soil property such as critical state friction angle young s modulus and shear strength kelly et al 2006 tani and craig 1995 when non cohesive soils such as sand are subjected to high compressive stress the breakage of soil particles plays an important role in determining the soil properties coop et al 2004 hu et al 2018 jin et al 2018a 2018b lade et al 1996 wang and arson 2018 wang et al 2019b yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 for example results from triaxial tests showed that the grain breakage is one of the three components forming the friction angle of sand and the other two components are friction of grain particles and dilation hassanlourad et al 2008 in another study of a rockfill material based on the large scale triaxial tests xiao et al 2014 the peak state friction angle of the rockfill material decreased with the increase of the relative breakage index the ratio of total particle breakage and breakage potential einav 2007 particle breakage also affects the compressibility shear strength and elastic modulus of soils and rocks arulrajah et al 2020 ghafghazi et al 2014 hu et al 2011 indraratna et al 2009 lee and farhoomand 1967 mohammadinia et al 2019 wang and arson 2016 results from previous research demonstrated the importance of particle breakage on soil properties but unfortunately the effect of particle breakage in the analysis of caisson foundation was ignored in this study the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation is analyzed with dem at both macro and micro scales the commonly used methods to simulate particle breakage are discussed at first and then the replacement method based on maximum contact force breakage criterion is adopted in order to examine the effect of particle breakage on the soil property a series of biaxial tests are conducted the shear strength and critical state friction angle are compared and discussed then the effect of particle breakage on caisson foundation is investigated in detail 2 dem model verification 2 1 dem models of particle breakage 2 1 1 methods to simulate particle breakage within the framework of dem the particle breakage can be modeled either by representing a crushable particle by a group of bonded elements cluster method or by replacing a broken particle with several fragments replacement method in the cluster method elements usually balls are uncrushable and connected by bonds and the bonds can break once the stress within the bonds exceed the corresponding strength or limit force some successfully cases using the cluster method to simulate particle breakage can be found in abe and mair 2005 cheng et al 2003 wang and yan 2012 the cluster method has several advantages such as realistic shape of fragments and trackable micro cracks however precise models are extremely expensive in terms of computational cost due to the large number of elements which makes it impractical for engineering problems for example lim and mcdowell 2007 found that a minimum of 500 particles is necessary to give accurate results of particle breakage and the number of balls should be at least 37 000 to eliminate size effect wang and arson 2016 on the other hand the replacement method is relatively more effective because the number of elements is equal to the number of soil grains the replacement method can be used to investigate driving forces breakage modes as well as the effect of the coordination number on particle breakage wang et al 2019b note that the coordination number of a particle is defined as the number of grains that are in contact with that particle the main challenge in the replacement method is to define the breakage model parameters such as the particle strength the position of breakage planes and the number and size of the fragments ciantia et al 2015 yang and cheng 2015 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 in this study the dem model of caisson foundation has a dimension of 1350 mm in length and 750 mm in width which results in unrealistic high computation cost with the cluster method therefore the replacement method was adopted 2 1 2 breakage criterion in the replacement method the breakage criterion i e the limit condition of the breakage needs to be defined in terms of hydrostatic pressure tensile stress shear stress or maximum contact force depending on the breakage mechanism due to the difficulty in obtaining the stress distribution in a particle subjected to several contact forces the following simplified average stress tensor σ i j is often adopted de bono and mcdowell 2016 1 σ i j 1 v n x i c c i p f j c p where v is the volume of the particle n is the total number of contact x c and x p are the locations of the contact and particle centroid respectively and f c p is the contact force based on the averaged stress tensor åström and herrmann compared simulation results using two different criteria namely the pressure the hydrostatic part of the average stress tensor σ i j and the largest compressive contact force astrom and herrmann 1998 and they found that the simulation with largest compressive force criterion yields more accurate particle size distribution psd lobo guerrero et al also used the largest compressive force to determine the breakage of a particle but he also argued that the coordination number of a crushable particle should be smaller than 3 to achieve a high tensile stress inside the particle lobo guerrero et al 2006 the resultant tensile stress is given by 2 σ t 2 f max π d and the particle breaks if the stress exceeds a certain threshold σ max d in addition σ max d is inversely proportional to particle diameter and has the expression 3 σ max d σ max 1 m m d where σ max 1 m m is the stress threshold when the particle diameter is 1 mm a criterion expressed in maximum contact force was also used in ben nun and einav 2010 and later this criterion proved to better represent the psd evolution and the stress distribution by assuming the breakage of a particle was induced by tensile or shear stress the maximum tensile stress method and octahedral shear stress were also proposed in tsoungui et al 1999 and mcdowell et al 2013 in summary the maximum contact force method which is also named as the maximum tensile stress method due to the assumption of tensile failure yields the best results and has been accepted by many researchers as the most appropriate breakage criterion de bono and mcdowell 2016 although this method seems biased due to the absence of accounting for the coordination number or the spatial distribution of contact forces it ensures that small particles are more likely to break while large particles are protected by smaller ones which is usually true in experiments therefore the maximum contact force method proposed by lobo guerrero in lobo guerrero et al 2006 was used in this study 2 1 3 arrangement of fragments once the breakage criterion is reached the crushable particle is replaced by smaller elements that represent the fragments different fragmentation methods were proposed based on mass conservation psd evolution and various breakage mechanisms mcdowell and de bono introduced two equally sized spheres to replace the broken particle without mass loss as shown in fig 1 a mcdowell et al 2013 the axis joining the two centers is in the direction of the minor principal stress which is similar to the breakage configuration in a single particle compression test however the main problem in this method is the development of high elastic stresses due to the overlap of the particles assuming that particle breakage is the result of tensile failure lobo guerrero and collaborators used a group of eight particles to replace the broken particle lobo guerrero et al 2006 the axis joining the two largest fragments is perpendicular to the direction of maximum contact force see fig 1 b ben nun and einav studied particle breakage with several different configurations two of which are shown in fig 1 c and d in all tests with different methods they obtained psds that obeyed a power law scaling with three different fractal dimensions ben nun et al 2010 to sum up although different fragmentation arrangements were proposed based on various failure mechanisms the final psd seems insensitive to the arrangements in addition the mass loss doesn t have a strong influence on the results when it is below the critical mass loss 47 according to ciantia et al 2015 in this study the arrangement in fig 1 b with a mass loss of 16 7 was adopted this arrangement assumes that the particle fails due to the indirect tensile stress generated at the center of the particle which is similar to the brazilian test wang et al 2020 therefore the axis connecting the centers of the two large fragments is perpendicular to the direction of the maximum force and smaller fragments representing the shear zone are also created near the position of maximum force it is also important to mention that both the mother particle and fragments are spherical in this method because the computational cost for spherical particle is much lower than angular particles another advantage to use the spherical shape for both mother ball and fragments is that it allows sequential breakage of fragments therefore although particle shape is also reported to have strong influence on soil property its effect will be considered separately in a follow up study 2 2 effect of particle breakage on shear behavior shear strength and frictional angle are two important characters of sand and have strong influence on the bearing capacity of caisson foundation therefore a series of biaxial tests are conducted to evaluate the effect of particle breakage on shear strength and friction angle the soil used in this study is well graded sand and has a psd parallel to the soil used in the experimental tests in foglia et al 2015 the mean grain size d50 is 2 5 mm which is approximately 18 times larger than that in the test to reduce the total number of particles and computational cost the method proposed by wood and maeda 2008 is used to determine the maximum and minimum void ratios in which the densest and loosest specimens are generated by adjusting the initial friction coefficient as 0 0 and 1 0 during the sample preparation the sands with a relative density of 80 and 20 are tested to validate the breakage model the sample is prepared with the radius expansion method which is briefly summarized as follows 1 a box wall of 80 mm in height and 40 mm width is generated which works as the sample boundary 2 sand particles are created with diameters half of the final values in the box 3 soil properties are applied to all the particles 4 the diameters of particles are increased to the final values 5 the confining stress is applied during the biaxial test the top and bottom walls of the box move towards the sample at a constant speed of 0 1 m s while the confining stress is kept constant by adjusting the positions of the left and right walls the values of micro mechanical parameters used in the dem simulations are summarized in table 1 which have been validated in a previous study by the authors wang and yin 2020 fig 2 shows the evolution of shear stress and volumetric strain with axial strain from the dense sample with confining stress of 100 kpa and 200 kpa in which the shear stress is given as σ 1 σ 3 2 in all the tests with different confining stresses in fig 2 a and b the shear stresses first increase and then decrease with the axial strain in the tests with confining stress of 100 kpa the magnitude and evolution of shear stress are quite similar in samples with and without particle breakage which is due to the fact that only a small number of breakage occurs at this stress level when the confining stress is 200 kpa fig 2 b despite the same evolution trend of the shear stresses the peak strength of the sample with particle breakage is around 16 lower than that of the sample without particle breakage however the particle breakage does not have an obvious influence on the residual shear strength as shown in fig 2 b in terms of volumetric strain shown in fig 2 c and d shear dilation is observed in all tests with or without particle breakage and the magnitude of volumetric strain is decreased with particle breakage the results of biaxial tests on loose sand with relative density of 20 are shown in fig 3 which illustrates different behaviors compared with the dense sand the shear stresses increase with the axial strain and then become stable the volumes of the samples contract at first and then become dilative the residual shear strengths of samples with or without particle are almost identical at confining stress of 100 kpa and 200 kpa dilation of the loose sand decreases with the increase of confining stress which is induced by the increase of the number of breakage events it is also interesting to see in fig 3 b that despite the same residual shear strength the stiffness of the sand is significantly decreased with the introduction of particle breakage the psds of both dense and loose sand at confining stresses of 100 kpa and 200 kpa are shown in fig 4 at the confining stress of 100 kpa the number of breakage events is very small and therefore the psd after the test remains same with the initial psd for both dense and loose samples when the confining stress is increased to 200 kpa obvious changes in the psds demonstrate that a large amount of particle breakage happen which explains the differences in the shear behavior in fig 2 b d fig 3 b and d to sum up similar and reasonable trends of shear stress and volumetric strain versus axial strain are observed for both dense and loose sand at different confining stress which are consistent with experimental observations bolton 1986 compared with the sample with uncrushable particles the introduction of particle breakage decreases the peak strength of dense sand the stiffness of loose sand and the volumetric strain of both dense and loose sands based on the critical state soil mechanics the peak friction angles of dense sand without particle breakage dense sand with particle breakage loose sand without particle breakage and loose sand with particle breakage are respectively 24 1 22 5 16 4 and 16 3 which correspond to shear strengths of 132 kpa 123 kpa 81 kpa and 79 kpa at the confining stress of 200 kpa 2 3 modeling of caisson foundation the dem model of caisson foundation in fig 5 is used in this study to study the effect particle breakage on caisson foundation the model was used in a previous study by the authors to investigate the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation during the insertion and progressive failure processes at different loading conditions wang and yin 2020 in which the particle breakage was not considered the sand in this model was assumed at dense state with a relative density of 80 and prepared with the multi layer with undercompaction method ucm jiang and yin 2012 jiang et al 2003 2016 the diameter and skirt length of the caisson are both 300 mm and the weight is 241 n the testing procedures of caisson foundation in dem are as follows a the caisson is slowly pushed into the soil at a constant velocity of 0 3 m s until the foundation fails in insertion test or reaches to the final position in constant m dh tests during which the horizontal and rotational velocity are fixed at zero b the load with constant m dh ratio is applied to the caisson and the corresponding displacements are monitored it takes about 26 h on a workstation inter xeon e5 2690a cpu and 128 gb ram to simulate one test then the model was carefully calibrated against the experimental results in foglia et al 2015 at different m dh s and a general consistency in the evolution trends of various load displacement curves was observed therefore in this study the validated dem model of caisson foundation is adopted and improved with the introduction of particle breakage it is important to note that in both the lab tests by foglia et al 2015 and the dem simulations presented in this paper the effect of groundwater is not considered although the groundwater has been extensively reported to impose risks such as leakage to underground structures shen et al 2013a wu et al 2020a 2020b 2020c its effect is negligible in this study due to the high permeability of sand and low loading speed 3 effect of particle breakage on caisson foundation in this section the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation is investigated at both macro and micro scales the caisson is subjected to a combined loads of horizontal force h and rotation moment m with the m dh equal to 1 1 3 01 and 8 748 in different tests the values of m dh are within the range of typical loading conditions of wind turbines in the dem simulations the gravity of 10g is applied so that a prototype caisson foundation with both height and diameter of 3m ten times of the size in the experiment is investigated 3 1 effect of particle breakage at macroscale the evolutions of horizontal displacement u with the horizontal load in the experiments and dem simulations with and without particle breakage are shown in fig 6 in which a similar evolution trend is found for all tests and simulations the horizontal load increases with the horizontal displacement and then reaches a plateau which is the horizontal bearing capacity in addition the horizontal bearing capacity decreases with the increase of m dh compared with the results without particle breakage fig 6 b particle breakage decreases the horizontal bearing capacity by 20 21 and 23 for the samples with m dh respectively equal to 1 1 3 01 and 8 748 as shown in fig 6 c fig 7 presents the results of relationship between rotational displacement dθ and dimensionally homogeneous moment m d the general evolution trend of m d in fig 7 is quite similar to that of the horizontal load in fig 6 the magnitudes of moment bearing capacities in the simulations with particle breakage are roughly 10 times of those in the experiments because the gravity is multiplied by 10 times results in fig 7 b and c show that the moment bearing capacity is reduced by 18 16 and 22 for the samples with m dh equal to 1 1 3 01 and 8 748 when the particle breakage is considered 3 2 effect of particle breakage at microscale the effect of particle breakage on the microscopic behavior of caisson foundation is investigated in this subsection because simulations with different m dh yield similar trends in terms of microscopic behavior the one with m dh equal to 1 1 is adopted as an example for the following analysis the positions of broken particles and breakage patterns are discussed first then microscopic behavior of caisson foundation is investigated in terms of particle rotation apr averaged micro pure rotation rate field vertical and horizontal stress distributions and void ratio at last the effect of particle breakage on soil fabric is presented 3 2 1 breakage positions and patterns particle breakage occurs both in the insertion and loading processes of caisson foundation during the insertion process the penetrating force breaks soil particles at the tip of the skirt in addition the interface shear between the caisson and particles decreases the coordination number and increases the magnitude of normal contact forces wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 some breakage events are also induced however the number of broken particles is very small in this stage because the insertion speed is kept low to achieve a quasi static state for soil particles and the thickness of the skirt is thin which can cut into soil without breaking a large number of particles therefore the following investigations focus on the particle breakage in the loading process which has a strong influence on the behavior and bearing capacity of caisson foundation when the rotational angle of the caisson is 0 5 1 and 3 the positions of broken particles are presented in fig 8 the horizontal movement of the caisson generates a passive zone outside the left skirt which results in a large number of broken particles in that area in addition the number of broken particles increases with depth which is due to the increase of both vertical and horizontal stresses as the rotation angle of the caisson increases from 0 5 to 3 the number of broken particles also increases significantly which indicates the yielding of the soils in these regions mcdowell and harireche 2002 two breakage patterns are observed during the rotation of the caisson i e successive breakage and independent breakage as shown in fig 9 in a breakage event when the broken particle is one of the neighbors or fragments of a broken particle the breakage is considered as successive breakage on the other hand the breakage is called independent breakage when there is no successive breakage as reported in wang et al 2019b during a breakage event the contact forces around the particle are redistributed at the microscale the largest contact force is released due to the breakage and smaller contact forces increase which leads to secondary and successive breakage wang et al 2019b in this study successive breakage tends to happen near the left skirt of the caisson where stress level is high and particles have lower coordination number on the other hand individual breakage is more common in regions far from the caisson skirt which can be attributed to the low stress level and shielding effect i e the increase of particle strength with the redistribution of stress towards hydrostatic stress conditions wang and arson 2016 similar patterns on particle breakage were also reported in oedometer tests of crushable sand tsoungui et al 1999 3 2 2 micro mechanical investigation mechanical behaviors at particle level are discussed here to study the effect of particle breakage the foundation failure starts when the moment reaches a plateau at which point the rotation angle of caisson is 1 according to fig 7 therefore the following discussions are based on the simulation results when the rotation angle is 1 fig 10 shows the particle rotation fields from tests without and with particle breakage in both tests the magnitudes of particle rotation for particles located at the interface between soil and caisson are much larger than those in other areas in addition because of the movement of the caisson particles in the passive region on the left and active region on the right have increased rotation compared with fig 10 a the passive region is much smaller in the test with particle breakage it is also noticeable that particles at the bottom in fig 10 b exhibits larger rotation than those in fig 10 a which is induced by the rearrangement of small fragments after particle breakage besides the accumulated particle rotation shown in fig 10 particle rotation rate and the associated transient frictional work play an important role in understanding the behavior and energy dissipation of granular materials lin and wu 2017 therefore the averaged micro pure rotation rates apr of all sand particles are presented in fig 11 apr is a micro descriptor of the particle rotation rate and is related to size of the particle the apr of a particle is given by 4 apr 1 n k 1 n 1 r θ 1 k r 1 θ 2 k r 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 where n is the coordination number of the particle θ 1 k and θ 2 k are the angular velocities of two contacting particles and r 1 and r 2 are their radii jiang et al 2005 the importance of apr lies in that it can be expressed as a function of the rotation rate of the axis of the major principal stress and therefore can be used at the continuum scale to account the particle rotation and the associated energy dissipation fig 11 shows that the apr is large for particles at the interface and in the passive and active regions in general the apr in the test with particle breakage is slightly lower than that in the test without breakage which can be attributed to the decreased interparticle force and the resultant relative rotation in addition similar to the observations of particle rotation in fig 10 the regions containing particles with large aprs are decreased in the test with particle breakage the vertical and horizontal stress distributions for tests without and with particle breakage are presented respectively in fig 12 and fig 13 the combined counter clockwise rotation and horizontal movement increase both vertical stress and horizontal stress in the passive region near the left skirt of the caisson at the same time stresses are decreased in the active region near the right skirt in both tests the particle breakage only has slight effect on the distribution of vertical stress but decreases the stress concentration in the passive region fig 13 b this observation is as expected because the maximum contact force is capped for particles in the test with particle breakage which decreases the stress concentration the movement of the caisson also influences the distribution of void ratio near the caisson as shown in fig 14 in the insertion process because the interface shear induces dilatancy at the soil structure interfaces the void ratio near the caisson skirts is increased during the loading process the regions which have high void ratio rotate with the caisson skirts the distributions of void ratio for tests are similar and are not affected by particle breakage as shown in fig 14 the force chain distributions from the tests are presented in fig 15 obvious force concentration can be observed in the passive region in the test without particle breakage in the square area at the top fig 15 a in addition because the rotation center of the caisson is located inside the caisson with a depth around 0 7 times of the caisson height force concentration is also observed in the lower left part of the soil plug bottom square in fig 15 a due to the internal inverted scoop mechanism reported in barari and ibsen 2012 in the test with particle breakage in fig 15 b there are less force concentration because the breakage events cause the redistribution of particles and release the strong contact forces another reason for the difference on the force chain distribution is that the test with particle breakage is subjected to lower horizontal force and rotational moment and therefore less forces are transmitted to the soil particles 3 2 3 soil fabrics at different regions as proved by many researchers soil behaviors are closely related to the fabric and its evolution soil fabric refers to the internal micro structure of soil particles both qualitative and quantitative results have been reported about the relationship between soil fabric and macroscopic soil properties such as shear strength strain localization breakage and liquefaction gao and zhao 2013 little et al 1992 wang et al 2019c yimsiri and soga 2010 in crushable soils particle breakage changes the soil fabric by rearranging the positions of fragments and surrounding particles and redistributing the strong contact forces wang et al 2019b in this section the effect of particle breakage on the soil fabric is presented in particular the soils are divided into different groups based on their microscopic behaviors to better capture the soil fabric at different regions according to the results in section 3 2 2 soil particles in different areas in the model exhibit significantly different behaviors thus in order to better examine the effect of particle breakage on soil fabric the soil particles are divided into four different groups based on their positions as shown in fig 16 particles in the active failure region which is the grey triangular area on the right belong to the rs short for right side group similarly particles in the passive failure region and inside the caisson are in the ls and in groups particles located in all other regions are in the out group the angle between the active region and the horizontal direction is set as 57 which is equal to 45 o φ p 2 where φ p is the friction angle of the soil obtained from the biaxial tests similarly the angle between the passive region and the horizontal direction is 57 which is the result of 45 o φ p 2 in order to qualitatively describe soil fabric many fabric descriptors have been proposed brewer and sleeman 1988 he et al 2019a 2019b in this study three commonly used fabric descriptors which are contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force are adopted to investigate the effect of particle breakage their angular distributions can be respectively characterized as rothenburg and bathurst 1989 5 e θ 1 2 π 1 a cos 2 θ θ a 6 f n θ f n 0 1 a n cos 2 θ θ n and 7 f s θ f s 0 a s sin 2 θ θ s where e θ f n θ f s θ is the distribution of contact orientation normal contact force shear contact force in terms of angle θ f n 0 f s 0 is the average normal shear force among all contacts a a n a s is the magnitude of anisotropy and θ a θ n θ s is the principal direction of anisotropy of the three descriptors detailed derivation and explanation of eq 5 to eq 7 can be found in rothenburg and bathurst 1989 the angular distributions of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact of particles in the ls and rs groups are respectively presented in fig 17 and fig 18 note that in all subfigures showing the angular distributions of different descriptors the black lines represent the data collected from the numerical simulation while the red lines are the approximations from eq 5 to eq 7 for particles in the ls and rs groups obvious fabric anisotropy can be observed in both figures the principal directions of anisotropy are largely determined by the movement direction of the caisson and only slightly influenced by particle breakage because of the combined horizontal and counter clockwise movements of the caisson the particles in the ls group are subjected to external load in top right to bottom left direction which induces the anisotropy of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force also in that direction in terms of particles in the rs group the number of the contacts in the horizontal direction and anisotropy of normal contact force are significantly decreased due to the movement of the caisson as is shown in fig 18 a b d and e and anisotropy of shear contact force is also induced to resist the soil failure fig 18 c and f despite the slight influence on the principal direction of the anisotropy particle breakage does affect the magnitude of the anisotropy where extensive particle breakage occurs because a lot of particles in the passive region are crushed in the loading process the magnitudes of the anisotropy in the test with particle breakage are much smaller than those in the test without particle breakage specifically the magnitudes of anisotropy of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force for particle in ls group in fig 17 are respectively decreased by 22 19 and 3 compared with the test without particle breakage which can be also explained by the release of strong contact force and redistribution of particles in the breakage process for particles in the rs group where the number of broken particles is low the magnitudes of the anisotropy of the three descriptors are within 5 difference the values of anisotropy of particles in all four groups are summarized in table 2 as expected the magnitude of anisotropy of particles in ls and rs groups are much larger than those in the in and out groups which are consistent with the results and observations in 3 2 2 it is also noticeable that particles in the out group in the test with particle breakage group exhibit larger anisotropy than that without particle breakage which is actually induced by the particle breakage during the insertion process in summary significant anisotropy is induced in the passive and active regions during the loading process and the particle breakage decrease the anisotropy in these regions by the release of strong contact force and redistribution of particles 4 conclusions in this study the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation was comprehensively investigated with dem firstly a review of the dem breakage model was conducted the model which includes the replacement method maximum contact force criterion and the arrangement of fragments based on tensile failure was adopted to model particle breakage a series of biaxial tests were simulated to validate the dem breakage model and obtain the soil properties the dem model of caisson foundation which was validated in a previous study was adopted and improved with the introduction of particle breakage then the effect of particle breakage on caisson foundation was investigated in detail at both macro and micro scales the conclusions of the paper are made as follows 1 at the macroscale both the horizontal and rotational bearing capacities are decreased in the test with particle breakage which can be explained by the fact that particle breakage decreases the shear strength and peak friction angle of the soil 2 during the loading process of the caisson foundation different breakage patterns are observed depending on their distances to the caisson skirt specifically successive breakages tend to happen near the left skirt of the caisson while individual breakages are more common in regions far from the caisson skirt 3 the particle rotation apr and force chain concentration are much smaller in the test with particle breakage due the release of large contact force and redistribution of fragments during the breakage process however the void ratio distribution is not affected by particle breakage 4 in terms of soil fabric significant anisotropy of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact forces are induced in the passive and active regions during the loading process and the particle breakage decreases the magnitude of the anisotropy because particle breakage has a strong negative influence on soil properties it is important to account for its effect in the analysis of caisson foundation this study is conducted to investigate of the effect of particle breakage at both macro and micro scales which can improve our understanding of the degradation of bearing capacity

21562,particle breakage plays an important role in strength degradation of granular soils and thus needs to be considered in the analysis of caisson foundation however no relevant research has been reported before in this study the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation is investigated with discrete element method dem firstly breakage models are reviewed and the one based on replacement method is adopted biaxial tests are conducted to validate the breakage model then a caisson foundation is investigated with the consideration of particle breakage this study demonstrates that 1 both the horizontal and rotational bearing capacities are decreased by particle breakage 2 successive breakages tend to happen near the caisson skirt while individual breakages are more common in regions far from the skirt 3 the particle rotation apr and force chain concentration are much smaller when particle breakage is considered 4 particle breakage decreases the magnitude of the anisotropy induced by external loads keywords caisson foundation particle breakage microstructure discrete element method soil fabric micromechanics 1 introduction caisson foundations have been widely used for bridges wind turbines dams and other structures that need underwater support a caisson is a hollow and watertight chamber made of steel or concrete and it is often open at the bottom and closed at the top when used as the foundation for an offshore wind turbine the caisson is floated or hauled to the job site and then sunk the seabed the caisson is pushed into the soil by self weight and the suction force which is induced by pumping the water out of the caisson compared with other types of foundations hong et al 2017 horpibulsuk and niramitkornburee 2010 horpibulsuk et al 2004 lai et al 2020 shen et al 2013b 2017 wang et al 2018 there are several advantages using caisson foundations including fast installation low cost and high adaptability to different soil conditions a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the behavior of caisson foundation with experimental analytical or numerical methods experimental studies ranging from small scale model test to full scale field test were used to investigate the horizontal and moment bearing capacities seismic response soil skirt interaction and lateral response of caisson foundations barari and ibsen 2012 kou et al 2019 lian et al 2014 wang et al 2017a 2017b yun and bransby 2007 for the analytical methods the bearing capacity failure mechanism and effect of strength non homogeneity were investigated with strain hardening plasticity model cassidy et al 2006 villalobos et al 2009 macro element method jin et al 2019c skau et al 2018 plasticity theory tani and craig 1995 and hyperplasticity theory nguyen sy and houlsby 2005 within the framework of continuum mechanics numerical methods including finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm were widely used to study the caisson foundations at various loading combinations from the insertion process to the failure process achmus et al 2013 bagheri et al 2017 jin et al 2019a 2019b mehravar et al 2017 in a recent study conducted by the authors wang and yin 2020 contrary to previous research focusing on the macroscopic behaviors the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation was analyzed in detail with the help of discrete element method dem the dem was proposed in 1970s cundall 1971 and is now widely used to study the behavior of soils at the particle scale in geotechnical engineering yin et al 2020 this method allows calculating the movements of particles based on the newton s second law and the induced contact forces from force displacement law in addition by bonding elementary spheres together the dem is able to simulate particles or materials with different shapes li et al 2020 the dem could provide detailed data of particles and contacts such as contact force contact orientation and particle movement and therefore allows more detailed micro mechanical analysis than fem or fdm as proved by many previous studies the behavior and bearing capacity of a caisson foundation are closely related to the soil property such as critical state friction angle young s modulus and shear strength kelly et al 2006 tani and craig 1995 when non cohesive soils such as sand are subjected to high compressive stress the breakage of soil particles plays an important role in determining the soil properties coop et al 2004 hu et al 2018 jin et al 2018a 2018b lade et al 1996 wang and arson 2018 wang et al 2019b yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 for example results from triaxial tests showed that the grain breakage is one of the three components forming the friction angle of sand and the other two components are friction of grain particles and dilation hassanlourad et al 2008 in another study of a rockfill material based on the large scale triaxial tests xiao et al 2014 the peak state friction angle of the rockfill material decreased with the increase of the relative breakage index the ratio of total particle breakage and breakage potential einav 2007 particle breakage also affects the compressibility shear strength and elastic modulus of soils and rocks arulrajah et al 2020 ghafghazi et al 2014 hu et al 2011 indraratna et al 2009 lee and farhoomand 1967 mohammadinia et al 2019 wang and arson 2016 results from previous research demonstrated the importance of particle breakage on soil properties but unfortunately the effect of particle breakage in the analysis of caisson foundation was ignored in this study the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation is analyzed with dem at both macro and micro scales the commonly used methods to simulate particle breakage are discussed at first and then the replacement method based on maximum contact force breakage criterion is adopted in order to examine the effect of particle breakage on the soil property a series of biaxial tests are conducted the shear strength and critical state friction angle are compared and discussed then the effect of particle breakage on caisson foundation is investigated in detail 2 dem model verification 2 1 dem models of particle breakage 2 1 1 methods to simulate particle breakage within the framework of dem the particle breakage can be modeled either by representing a crushable particle by a group of bonded elements cluster method or by replacing a broken particle with several fragments replacement method in the cluster method elements usually balls are uncrushable and connected by bonds and the bonds can break once the stress within the bonds exceed the corresponding strength or limit force some successfully cases using the cluster method to simulate particle breakage can be found in abe and mair 2005 cheng et al 2003 wang and yan 2012 the cluster method has several advantages such as realistic shape of fragments and trackable micro cracks however precise models are extremely expensive in terms of computational cost due to the large number of elements which makes it impractical for engineering problems for example lim and mcdowell 2007 found that a minimum of 500 particles is necessary to give accurate results of particle breakage and the number of balls should be at least 37 000 to eliminate size effect wang and arson 2016 on the other hand the replacement method is relatively more effective because the number of elements is equal to the number of soil grains the replacement method can be used to investigate driving forces breakage modes as well as the effect of the coordination number on particle breakage wang et al 2019b note that the coordination number of a particle is defined as the number of grains that are in contact with that particle the main challenge in the replacement method is to define the breakage model parameters such as the particle strength the position of breakage planes and the number and size of the fragments ciantia et al 2015 yang and cheng 2015 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 in this study the dem model of caisson foundation has a dimension of 1350 mm in length and 750 mm in width which results in unrealistic high computation cost with the cluster method therefore the replacement method was adopted 2 1 2 breakage criterion in the replacement method the breakage criterion i e the limit condition of the breakage needs to be defined in terms of hydrostatic pressure tensile stress shear stress or maximum contact force depending on the breakage mechanism due to the difficulty in obtaining the stress distribution in a particle subjected to several contact forces the following simplified average stress tensor σ i j is often adopted de bono and mcdowell 2016 1 σ i j 1 v n x i c c i p f j c p where v is the volume of the particle n is the total number of contact x c and x p are the locations of the contact and particle centroid respectively and f c p is the contact force based on the averaged stress tensor åström and herrmann compared simulation results using two different criteria namely the pressure the hydrostatic part of the average stress tensor σ i j and the largest compressive contact force astrom and herrmann 1998 and they found that the simulation with largest compressive force criterion yields more accurate particle size distribution psd lobo guerrero et al also used the largest compressive force to determine the breakage of a particle but he also argued that the coordination number of a crushable particle should be smaller than 3 to achieve a high tensile stress inside the particle lobo guerrero et al 2006 the resultant tensile stress is given by 2 σ t 2 f max π d and the particle breaks if the stress exceeds a certain threshold σ max d in addition σ max d is inversely proportional to particle diameter and has the expression 3 σ max d σ max 1 m m d where σ max 1 m m is the stress threshold when the particle diameter is 1 mm a criterion expressed in maximum contact force was also used in ben nun and einav 2010 and later this criterion proved to better represent the psd evolution and the stress distribution by assuming the breakage of a particle was induced by tensile or shear stress the maximum tensile stress method and octahedral shear stress were also proposed in tsoungui et al 1999 and mcdowell et al 2013 in summary the maximum contact force method which is also named as the maximum tensile stress method due to the assumption of tensile failure yields the best results and has been accepted by many researchers as the most appropriate breakage criterion de bono and mcdowell 2016 although this method seems biased due to the absence of accounting for the coordination number or the spatial distribution of contact forces it ensures that small particles are more likely to break while large particles are protected by smaller ones which is usually true in experiments therefore the maximum contact force method proposed by lobo guerrero in lobo guerrero et al 2006 was used in this study 2 1 3 arrangement of fragments once the breakage criterion is reached the crushable particle is replaced by smaller elements that represent the fragments different fragmentation methods were proposed based on mass conservation psd evolution and various breakage mechanisms mcdowell and de bono introduced two equally sized spheres to replace the broken particle without mass loss as shown in fig 1 a mcdowell et al 2013 the axis joining the two centers is in the direction of the minor principal stress which is similar to the breakage configuration in a single particle compression test however the main problem in this method is the development of high elastic stresses due to the overlap of the particles assuming that particle breakage is the result of tensile failure lobo guerrero and collaborators used a group of eight particles to replace the broken particle lobo guerrero et al 2006 the axis joining the two largest fragments is perpendicular to the direction of maximum contact force see fig 1 b ben nun and einav studied particle breakage with several different configurations two of which are shown in fig 1 c and d in all tests with different methods they obtained psds that obeyed a power law scaling with three different fractal dimensions ben nun et al 2010 to sum up although different fragmentation arrangements were proposed based on various failure mechanisms the final psd seems insensitive to the arrangements in addition the mass loss doesn t have a strong influence on the results when it is below the critical mass loss 47 according to ciantia et al 2015 in this study the arrangement in fig 1 b with a mass loss of 16 7 was adopted this arrangement assumes that the particle fails due to the indirect tensile stress generated at the center of the particle which is similar to the brazilian test wang et al 2020 therefore the axis connecting the centers of the two large fragments is perpendicular to the direction of the maximum force and smaller fragments representing the shear zone are also created near the position of maximum force it is also important to mention that both the mother particle and fragments are spherical in this method because the computational cost for spherical particle is much lower than angular particles another advantage to use the spherical shape for both mother ball and fragments is that it allows sequential breakage of fragments therefore although particle shape is also reported to have strong influence on soil property its effect will be considered separately in a follow up study 2 2 effect of particle breakage on shear behavior shear strength and frictional angle are two important characters of sand and have strong influence on the bearing capacity of caisson foundation therefore a series of biaxial tests are conducted to evaluate the effect of particle breakage on shear strength and friction angle the soil used in this study is well graded sand and has a psd parallel to the soil used in the experimental tests in foglia et al 2015 the mean grain size d50 is 2 5 mm which is approximately 18 times larger than that in the test to reduce the total number of particles and computational cost the method proposed by wood and maeda 2008 is used to determine the maximum and minimum void ratios in which the densest and loosest specimens are generated by adjusting the initial friction coefficient as 0 0 and 1 0 during the sample preparation the sands with a relative density of 80 and 20 are tested to validate the breakage model the sample is prepared with the radius expansion method which is briefly summarized as follows 1 a box wall of 80 mm in height and 40 mm width is generated which works as the sample boundary 2 sand particles are created with diameters half of the final values in the box 3 soil properties are applied to all the particles 4 the diameters of particles are increased to the final values 5 the confining stress is applied during the biaxial test the top and bottom walls of the box move towards the sample at a constant speed of 0 1 m s while the confining stress is kept constant by adjusting the positions of the left and right walls the values of micro mechanical parameters used in the dem simulations are summarized in table 1 which have been validated in a previous study by the authors wang and yin 2020 fig 2 shows the evolution of shear stress and volumetric strain with axial strain from the dense sample with confining stress of 100 kpa and 200 kpa in which the shear stress is given as σ 1 σ 3 2 in all the tests with different confining stresses in fig 2 a and b the shear stresses first increase and then decrease with the axial strain in the tests with confining stress of 100 kpa the magnitude and evolution of shear stress are quite similar in samples with and without particle breakage which is due to the fact that only a small number of breakage occurs at this stress level when the confining stress is 200 kpa fig 2 b despite the same evolution trend of the shear stresses the peak strength of the sample with particle breakage is around 16 lower than that of the sample without particle breakage however the particle breakage does not have an obvious influence on the residual shear strength as shown in fig 2 b in terms of volumetric strain shown in fig 2 c and d shear dilation is observed in all tests with or without particle breakage and the magnitude of volumetric strain is decreased with particle breakage the results of biaxial tests on loose sand with relative density of 20 are shown in fig 3 which illustrates different behaviors compared with the dense sand the shear stresses increase with the axial strain and then become stable the volumes of the samples contract at first and then become dilative the residual shear strengths of samples with or without particle are almost identical at confining stress of 100 kpa and 200 kpa dilation of the loose sand decreases with the increase of confining stress which is induced by the increase of the number of breakage events it is also interesting to see in fig 3 b that despite the same residual shear strength the stiffness of the sand is significantly decreased with the introduction of particle breakage the psds of both dense and loose sand at confining stresses of 100 kpa and 200 kpa are shown in fig 4 at the confining stress of 100 kpa the number of breakage events is very small and therefore the psd after the test remains same with the initial psd for both dense and loose samples when the confining stress is increased to 200 kpa obvious changes in the psds demonstrate that a large amount of particle breakage happen which explains the differences in the shear behavior in fig 2 b d fig 3 b and d to sum up similar and reasonable trends of shear stress and volumetric strain versus axial strain are observed for both dense and loose sand at different confining stress which are consistent with experimental observations bolton 1986 compared with the sample with uncrushable particles the introduction of particle breakage decreases the peak strength of dense sand the stiffness of loose sand and the volumetric strain of both dense and loose sands based on the critical state soil mechanics the peak friction angles of dense sand without particle breakage dense sand with particle breakage loose sand without particle breakage and loose sand with particle breakage are respectively 24 1 22 5 16 4 and 16 3 which correspond to shear strengths of 132 kpa 123 kpa 81 kpa and 79 kpa at the confining stress of 200 kpa 2 3 modeling of caisson foundation the dem model of caisson foundation in fig 5 is used in this study to study the effect particle breakage on caisson foundation the model was used in a previous study by the authors to investigate the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation during the insertion and progressive failure processes at different loading conditions wang and yin 2020 in which the particle breakage was not considered the sand in this model was assumed at dense state with a relative density of 80 and prepared with the multi layer with undercompaction method ucm jiang and yin 2012 jiang et al 2003 2016 the diameter and skirt length of the caisson are both 300 mm and the weight is 241 n the testing procedures of caisson foundation in dem are as follows a the caisson is slowly pushed into the soil at a constant velocity of 0 3 m s until the foundation fails in insertion test or reaches to the final position in constant m dh tests during which the horizontal and rotational velocity are fixed at zero b the load with constant m dh ratio is applied to the caisson and the corresponding displacements are monitored it takes about 26 h on a workstation inter xeon e5 2690a cpu and 128 gb ram to simulate one test then the model was carefully calibrated against the experimental results in foglia et al 2015 at different m dh s and a general consistency in the evolution trends of various load displacement curves was observed therefore in this study the validated dem model of caisson foundation is adopted and improved with the introduction of particle breakage it is important to note that in both the lab tests by foglia et al 2015 and the dem simulations presented in this paper the effect of groundwater is not considered although the groundwater has been extensively reported to impose risks such as leakage to underground structures shen et al 2013a wu et al 2020a 2020b 2020c its effect is negligible in this study due to the high permeability of sand and low loading speed 3 effect of particle breakage on caisson foundation in this section the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation is investigated at both macro and micro scales the caisson is subjected to a combined loads of horizontal force h and rotation moment m with the m dh equal to 1 1 3 01 and 8 748 in different tests the values of m dh are within the range of typical loading conditions of wind turbines in the dem simulations the gravity of 10g is applied so that a prototype caisson foundation with both height and diameter of 3m ten times of the size in the experiment is investigated 3 1 effect of particle breakage at macroscale the evolutions of horizontal displacement u with the horizontal load in the experiments and dem simulations with and without particle breakage are shown in fig 6 in which a similar evolution trend is found for all tests and simulations the horizontal load increases with the horizontal displacement and then reaches a plateau which is the horizontal bearing capacity in addition the horizontal bearing capacity decreases with the increase of m dh compared with the results without particle breakage fig 6 b particle breakage decreases the horizontal bearing capacity by 20 21 and 23 for the samples with m dh respectively equal to 1 1 3 01 and 8 748 as shown in fig 6 c fig 7 presents the results of relationship between rotational displacement dθ and dimensionally homogeneous moment m d the general evolution trend of m d in fig 7 is quite similar to that of the horizontal load in fig 6 the magnitudes of moment bearing capacities in the simulations with particle breakage are roughly 10 times of those in the experiments because the gravity is multiplied by 10 times results in fig 7 b and c show that the moment bearing capacity is reduced by 18 16 and 22 for the samples with m dh equal to 1 1 3 01 and 8 748 when the particle breakage is considered 3 2 effect of particle breakage at microscale the effect of particle breakage on the microscopic behavior of caisson foundation is investigated in this subsection because simulations with different m dh yield similar trends in terms of microscopic behavior the one with m dh equal to 1 1 is adopted as an example for the following analysis the positions of broken particles and breakage patterns are discussed first then microscopic behavior of caisson foundation is investigated in terms of particle rotation apr averaged micro pure rotation rate field vertical and horizontal stress distributions and void ratio at last the effect of particle breakage on soil fabric is presented 3 2 1 breakage positions and patterns particle breakage occurs both in the insertion and loading processes of caisson foundation during the insertion process the penetrating force breaks soil particles at the tip of the skirt in addition the interface shear between the caisson and particles decreases the coordination number and increases the magnitude of normal contact forces wang et al 2019a zhou et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 some breakage events are also induced however the number of broken particles is very small in this stage because the insertion speed is kept low to achieve a quasi static state for soil particles and the thickness of the skirt is thin which can cut into soil without breaking a large number of particles therefore the following investigations focus on the particle breakage in the loading process which has a strong influence on the behavior and bearing capacity of caisson foundation when the rotational angle of the caisson is 0 5 1 and 3 the positions of broken particles are presented in fig 8 the horizontal movement of the caisson generates a passive zone outside the left skirt which results in a large number of broken particles in that area in addition the number of broken particles increases with depth which is due to the increase of both vertical and horizontal stresses as the rotation angle of the caisson increases from 0 5 to 3 the number of broken particles also increases significantly which indicates the yielding of the soils in these regions mcdowell and harireche 2002 two breakage patterns are observed during the rotation of the caisson i e successive breakage and independent breakage as shown in fig 9 in a breakage event when the broken particle is one of the neighbors or fragments of a broken particle the breakage is considered as successive breakage on the other hand the breakage is called independent breakage when there is no successive breakage as reported in wang et al 2019b during a breakage event the contact forces around the particle are redistributed at the microscale the largest contact force is released due to the breakage and smaller contact forces increase which leads to secondary and successive breakage wang et al 2019b in this study successive breakage tends to happen near the left skirt of the caisson where stress level is high and particles have lower coordination number on the other hand individual breakage is more common in regions far from the caisson skirt which can be attributed to the low stress level and shielding effect i e the increase of particle strength with the redistribution of stress towards hydrostatic stress conditions wang and arson 2016 similar patterns on particle breakage were also reported in oedometer tests of crushable sand tsoungui et al 1999 3 2 2 micro mechanical investigation mechanical behaviors at particle level are discussed here to study the effect of particle breakage the foundation failure starts when the moment reaches a plateau at which point the rotation angle of caisson is 1 according to fig 7 therefore the following discussions are based on the simulation results when the rotation angle is 1 fig 10 shows the particle rotation fields from tests without and with particle breakage in both tests the magnitudes of particle rotation for particles located at the interface between soil and caisson are much larger than those in other areas in addition because of the movement of the caisson particles in the passive region on the left and active region on the right have increased rotation compared with fig 10 a the passive region is much smaller in the test with particle breakage it is also noticeable that particles at the bottom in fig 10 b exhibits larger rotation than those in fig 10 a which is induced by the rearrangement of small fragments after particle breakage besides the accumulated particle rotation shown in fig 10 particle rotation rate and the associated transient frictional work play an important role in understanding the behavior and energy dissipation of granular materials lin and wu 2017 therefore the averaged micro pure rotation rates apr of all sand particles are presented in fig 11 apr is a micro descriptor of the particle rotation rate and is related to size of the particle the apr of a particle is given by 4 apr 1 n k 1 n 1 r θ 1 k r 1 θ 2 k r 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 where n is the coordination number of the particle θ 1 k and θ 2 k are the angular velocities of two contacting particles and r 1 and r 2 are their radii jiang et al 2005 the importance of apr lies in that it can be expressed as a function of the rotation rate of the axis of the major principal stress and therefore can be used at the continuum scale to account the particle rotation and the associated energy dissipation fig 11 shows that the apr is large for particles at the interface and in the passive and active regions in general the apr in the test with particle breakage is slightly lower than that in the test without breakage which can be attributed to the decreased interparticle force and the resultant relative rotation in addition similar to the observations of particle rotation in fig 10 the regions containing particles with large aprs are decreased in the test with particle breakage the vertical and horizontal stress distributions for tests without and with particle breakage are presented respectively in fig 12 and fig 13 the combined counter clockwise rotation and horizontal movement increase both vertical stress and horizontal stress in the passive region near the left skirt of the caisson at the same time stresses are decreased in the active region near the right skirt in both tests the particle breakage only has slight effect on the distribution of vertical stress but decreases the stress concentration in the passive region fig 13 b this observation is as expected because the maximum contact force is capped for particles in the test with particle breakage which decreases the stress concentration the movement of the caisson also influences the distribution of void ratio near the caisson as shown in fig 14 in the insertion process because the interface shear induces dilatancy at the soil structure interfaces the void ratio near the caisson skirts is increased during the loading process the regions which have high void ratio rotate with the caisson skirts the distributions of void ratio for tests are similar and are not affected by particle breakage as shown in fig 14 the force chain distributions from the tests are presented in fig 15 obvious force concentration can be observed in the passive region in the test without particle breakage in the square area at the top fig 15 a in addition because the rotation center of the caisson is located inside the caisson with a depth around 0 7 times of the caisson height force concentration is also observed in the lower left part of the soil plug bottom square in fig 15 a due to the internal inverted scoop mechanism reported in barari and ibsen 2012 in the test with particle breakage in fig 15 b there are less force concentration because the breakage events cause the redistribution of particles and release the strong contact forces another reason for the difference on the force chain distribution is that the test with particle breakage is subjected to lower horizontal force and rotational moment and therefore less forces are transmitted to the soil particles 3 2 3 soil fabrics at different regions as proved by many researchers soil behaviors are closely related to the fabric and its evolution soil fabric refers to the internal micro structure of soil particles both qualitative and quantitative results have been reported about the relationship between soil fabric and macroscopic soil properties such as shear strength strain localization breakage and liquefaction gao and zhao 2013 little et al 1992 wang et al 2019c yimsiri and soga 2010 in crushable soils particle breakage changes the soil fabric by rearranging the positions of fragments and surrounding particles and redistributing the strong contact forces wang et al 2019b in this section the effect of particle breakage on the soil fabric is presented in particular the soils are divided into different groups based on their microscopic behaviors to better capture the soil fabric at different regions according to the results in section 3 2 2 soil particles in different areas in the model exhibit significantly different behaviors thus in order to better examine the effect of particle breakage on soil fabric the soil particles are divided into four different groups based on their positions as shown in fig 16 particles in the active failure region which is the grey triangular area on the right belong to the rs short for right side group similarly particles in the passive failure region and inside the caisson are in the ls and in groups particles located in all other regions are in the out group the angle between the active region and the horizontal direction is set as 57 which is equal to 45 o φ p 2 where φ p is the friction angle of the soil obtained from the biaxial tests similarly the angle between the passive region and the horizontal direction is 57 which is the result of 45 o φ p 2 in order to qualitatively describe soil fabric many fabric descriptors have been proposed brewer and sleeman 1988 he et al 2019a 2019b in this study three commonly used fabric descriptors which are contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force are adopted to investigate the effect of particle breakage their angular distributions can be respectively characterized as rothenburg and bathurst 1989 5 e θ 1 2 π 1 a cos 2 θ θ a 6 f n θ f n 0 1 a n cos 2 θ θ n and 7 f s θ f s 0 a s sin 2 θ θ s where e θ f n θ f s θ is the distribution of contact orientation normal contact force shear contact force in terms of angle θ f n 0 f s 0 is the average normal shear force among all contacts a a n a s is the magnitude of anisotropy and θ a θ n θ s is the principal direction of anisotropy of the three descriptors detailed derivation and explanation of eq 5 to eq 7 can be found in rothenburg and bathurst 1989 the angular distributions of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact of particles in the ls and rs groups are respectively presented in fig 17 and fig 18 note that in all subfigures showing the angular distributions of different descriptors the black lines represent the data collected from the numerical simulation while the red lines are the approximations from eq 5 to eq 7 for particles in the ls and rs groups obvious fabric anisotropy can be observed in both figures the principal directions of anisotropy are largely determined by the movement direction of the caisson and only slightly influenced by particle breakage because of the combined horizontal and counter clockwise movements of the caisson the particles in the ls group are subjected to external load in top right to bottom left direction which induces the anisotropy of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force also in that direction in terms of particles in the rs group the number of the contacts in the horizontal direction and anisotropy of normal contact force are significantly decreased due to the movement of the caisson as is shown in fig 18 a b d and e and anisotropy of shear contact force is also induced to resist the soil failure fig 18 c and f despite the slight influence on the principal direction of the anisotropy particle breakage does affect the magnitude of the anisotropy where extensive particle breakage occurs because a lot of particles in the passive region are crushed in the loading process the magnitudes of the anisotropy in the test with particle breakage are much smaller than those in the test without particle breakage specifically the magnitudes of anisotropy of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force for particle in ls group in fig 17 are respectively decreased by 22 19 and 3 compared with the test without particle breakage which can be also explained by the release of strong contact force and redistribution of particles in the breakage process for particles in the rs group where the number of broken particles is low the magnitudes of the anisotropy of the three descriptors are within 5 difference the values of anisotropy of particles in all four groups are summarized in table 2 as expected the magnitude of anisotropy of particles in ls and rs groups are much larger than those in the in and out groups which are consistent with the results and observations in 3 2 2 it is also noticeable that particles in the out group in the test with particle breakage group exhibit larger anisotropy than that without particle breakage which is actually induced by the particle breakage during the insertion process in summary significant anisotropy is induced in the passive and active regions during the loading process and the particle breakage decrease the anisotropy in these regions by the release of strong contact force and redistribution of particles 4 conclusions in this study the effect of particle breakage on the behavior of caisson foundation was comprehensively investigated with dem firstly a review of the dem breakage model was conducted the model which includes the replacement method maximum contact force criterion and the arrangement of fragments based on tensile failure was adopted to model particle breakage a series of biaxial tests were simulated to validate the dem breakage model and obtain the soil properties the dem model of caisson foundation which was validated in a previous study was adopted and improved with the introduction of particle breakage then the effect of particle breakage on caisson foundation was investigated in detail at both macro and micro scales the conclusions of the paper are made as follows 1 at the macroscale both the horizontal and rotational bearing capacities are decreased in the test with particle breakage which can be explained by the fact that particle breakage decreases the shear strength and peak friction angle of the soil 2 during the loading process of the caisson foundation different breakage patterns are observed depending on their distances to the caisson skirt specifically successive breakages tend to happen near the left skirt of the caisson while individual breakages are more common in regions far from the caisson skirt 3 the particle rotation apr and force chain concentration are much smaller in the test with particle breakage due the release of large contact force and redistribution of fragments during the breakage process however the void ratio distribution is not affected by particle breakage 4 in terms of soil fabric significant anisotropy of contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact forces are induced in the passive and active regions during the loading process and the particle breakage decreases the magnitude of the anisotropy because particle breakage has a strong negative influence on soil properties it is important to account for its effect in the analysis of caisson foundation this study is conducted to investigate of the effect of particle breakage at both macro and micro scales which can improve our understanding of the degradation of bearing capacity

21563,the main purpose of this research is to analyse the effect of cargo liquefaction on the capsizing of bulk carriers through an integrated model to do this initially an interpretive structure modelling ism was carried out to construct the relationship hierarchy of risk factors while a fuzzy bayesian networks fbn were conducted to quantify impact level the results revealed that liquefaction and improper actions to upright among 19 factors have a significant effect on capsizing the findings also emphasize that the factors improper loading 29 lack of cargo care at sea 27 4 and insufficient knowledge 22 arising from human error play an important role in cargo liquefaction unlike experimental researches in the literature this research analyses the liquefaction risk and the other basic causes resulting from the capsizing of bulk carriers using an integrated risk assessment method for further researches it is recommended to consider other risk identification and assessment models for better results keywords ism fbn capsizing risk assessment liquefaction 1 introduction and literature review liquefaction is defined as the behaviour of the material in the field of soil mechanics as a result of exposure to cyclic and monatomic loads youd 1973 similar processes such as liquefaction of the soil during the earthquake are experienced in bulk carriers especially during the transportation of mineral cargoes after liquefaction the dry bulk cargo acts as a mass of fluid displacing it in holds and causing the loss of ship s stability munro and mohajerani 2016 there are many accidents in history due to the liquefaction of the cargo in bulk carriers ju et al 2018 pittara 2018 between 1988 and 2019 a total of 25 incidents were recorded in bulk carriers encountered due to the liquefaction of the cargo and as a result 19 of the recorded incidents resulted in capsizing as the ships lost their stability snf 2020 intercargo international association of dry cargo shipowners 2020 these accidents were caused by cargoes categorized as group a cargoes in the related international conventions such as international maritime solid bulk cargoes imsbc which refers to procedures to be followed during transportation and handling in the literature studies on the relevant subject generally address numerical evaluations and experiments to reveal the liquefaction potential depending on the characteristics of the cargo zhao et al 2016 evaluated seismic performance of breakwater structures considering liquefaction process as a result of earthquake koromila et al 2013 in their experimental research revealed the effects of two different materials on ship stability by examining their liquefaction properties ju et al 2018 developed the discrete element method dem liquefaction model based on displacements of a group of particles to investigate the cargo liquefaction daoud et al 2018 evaluated the liquefaction potential of ore under swell motion by dynamic numerical model ju et al 2016 used plaxis liquefaction model ubc3d plm in order to assess cargo liquefaction potential and its impact on ship stability with an experimental approach munro and mohajerani 2016 2017 focused on the ship accidents caused by cargo liquefaction and analysed the root causes of each accident investigating the relevant incident reports then the proactive measures were identified to prevent future accidents again chua et al 2019 developed a numerical model to evaluate the effect of the cargo liquefaction on a ship s stability andrei and pazara 2013 focused on the impact of liquefaction of bulk cargoes on ship s intact stability and proposed a cargo shifting procedure in order to prevent capsizing lee 2017 developed response strategies performing redistribution of the cargo to mitigate risk of capsizing for a bulk carrier because of liquefaction process of cargo munro and mohajerani 2018 developed a model in the laboratory to test the conditions under which the iron ore fines would begin to liquefy zou et al 2018 argued that the most important factor in the capsizing of the ship due to liquefaction was the viscosity coefficient rather than the metacentric height gm in their simulation studies they concluded that the shear force is eliminated as a result of the change in the viscosity of the liquefied cargo and therefore the ship could capsize hu et al 2015 used bayesian network bn methodology to estimate seismic liquefaction using interpretive structure modelling ism despite the growing amount of published research about cargo liquefaction rather less attention has been paid to studying on the risk assessment through integrating ism and fbn although several risk assessment studies using ism and bn methods were carried out previously hu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 there is still a research gap in the field of shipping therefore this study aims to draw attention to liquefaction s effect on the risk of capsizing of dry cargo ships in line with this purpose the ism integrated fbn approach as one of the most important risk assessment methodologies was used initially the risks were identified by literature review accident reports and expert opinion then the ism hierarchy which was established in the light of expert opinions was used to determine the relationships and impact levels among risks bayesian networks were created with the data from ism structure which defines the hierarchical relationship between factors the participants depending on their expertise were then asked to determine the probabilities to conclude fbn finally the risk assessment through fbn was carried out for the safety assessment of capsizing as a result of liquefaction in dry cargo ships 2 materials and method 2 1 interpretive structural modelling ism the ism method proposed by warfield in 1974 is used to determine the relationship between factors causing a problem in complex environment janes 1988 the main stages of this method are as follows stage 1 defining the variables of the systems stage 2 determining the conceptual relationships for the variables listed in the first step stage 3 establishing a structural self interaction matrix ssim showing binary correlation for the factors stage 4 creating the reachability matrix using ssim and transitivity is conducted for controlling the final matrix stage 5 level partitioning is conducted for reachability matrix stage 6 drawing the directed graphic and removing the transition connections regarding to the correlations in the reachability matrix stage 7 converting the graphic created in the sixth step to ism method by using expressions with replacing nodes stage 8 ism is examined in terms of conceptual consistency and necessary corrections are made accordingly 2 1 1 risk identification and hierarchy construction stage 1 2 in this step the necessary literature was reviewed first to determine the variables that caused the ship to capsize due to liquefaction of the cargo and then accident reports were analysed reports of a total of 25 ship accidents resulting from the capsizing of 19 ships due to cargo liquefaction between 1986 and 2019 were analysed as shown in table 1 the reports of the ship accidents caused by the liquefaction of the cargo were obtained by the global integrated shipping information system gisis then the variables provided by the reports were revised and updated in the light of interviews with experts to do this a semi structured face to face interview was conducted with 7 experts and as a result 19 risk factors were determined the experts have extensive experience in operations of dry bulk cargo which has liquefaction risk four of the experts are currently working as a master in dry bulk cargo carriers and have experience more than 6 years one of the experts retired captain with more than 10 years of experience in bulk carriers also lectures the course called dry bulk operations at a maritime university one of the other two experts is employed as an operations manager in a shipping company operating a bulk carrier fleet while the other one works as a safety superintendent the details of each factor are shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 improper loading conditions are defined as situations that cause cargo liquefaction due to inadequate and incorrect measures taken at the loading port handling of the cargo with moisture content above tml inadequate visual inspection during loading lack of can testing wetting and contamination of holds inappropriate trimming of cargo in hold and continuing the loading operation in humid air conditions can be considered as factors that cause improper loading conditions imo 2016 insufficient knowledge is defined as the lack of knowledge of the ship s crew in the characteristics of group a cargo this factor may trigger events that cause cargo liquefaction at each stage of operation incompetent crew may fail to inspect the moisture content of the cargo prior to loading and during transportation captains with insufficient knowledge may have difficulties in classifying the cargo and identifying cargo specific risks as some cargoes are known by their trade names captain should know that he she has overriding authority with regard to safety therefore he she should not start the loading until all necessary documents under the regulations provided by the shipper the company should re consider the safety management system for operation of group a so as to ensure that the masters of ships follow strictly imo 2016 lack of cargo care at sea refers to the situation that the seafarers do not pay enough attention to the cargoes carrying risk of liquefaction during the voyage the factor addresses lack of inspection of the state of the cargo lack of monitoring the cargo holds to check any sign of excessive moisture insufficient measure the soundings of cargo hold bilges lack of ventilation and inappropriate monitoring the ship s stability imo 2016 2 1 2 structural self interaction matrix ssim stage 3 after determination of the risk factors ssim was established to reveal the contextual relationship among variables contextual relationship is usually determined by using expert opinions attri et al 2013 a total of seven experts from the shipping sector were interviewed to assess the conditional correlations in the light of binary variable comparisons there are four types of correlation a variable affects other variable a variable is affected by other variable both variables affect each other o or both variables are irrelevant x in the study ssim created based on a total of 171 contextual relationships obtained in binary comparison between among 19 variables is shown in table 3 as seen in table 3 the s8 not follow procedure node influences the s9 improper loading node in other words proper loading conditions can be achieved by following the handling procedures of group a cargo required by the imsbc code according to the procedures tml certificate and moisture content declaration provided by the operators must be delivered first cargo spaces should be dry and watertight visual monitoring of cargo and weather should be conducted frequently also the s7 insufficient knowledge node affects the s15 no test to ascertain tml on board node if the ship s crew is not familiar about the precautions to be taken during the transportation of group a cargoes the necessary tml measurements will not be performed and then risk of cargo liquefaction will arise in addition the s11 stockpile areas open node influences the s10 excessive moisture content node storage of cargo in the open area poses a risk in terms of excessive moisture content changes in water vapour concentration in the air will directly affect the moisture content of the cargo resulting in an increased risk of liquefaction therefore stockpiles should be designed in order to prevent the ingress of rainwater 2 1 3 reachability matrix stage 4 the initial reachability matrix irm is based on the method of replacing four symbols x o with the numbers of 0 and 1 by evaluating the contextual relationships then its transitivity is checked one of the main assumptions in ism is the transitivity attribution in this association if x is associated with y and if y is associated with z then variable x is associated with variable z sajid et al 2017 in the light of these rules the irm is created after embedding transitivity the modified rm is created as indicated in table 4 2 1 4 level partitions stage 5 in the final stage the hierarchical level of each factor is determined to do this the antecedent set and reachability set for each variable are provided by last matrix the antecedent set includes the variable itself and all other variables that affect it the reachability set includes the factor itself and all other factors it affects luthra et al 2014 the intersection set is the intersection of its own reachability and antecedent sets for each variable malone 1975 if the reachability and the intersection sets for a variable are equal the level of this variable is defined as 1 the level partition summary is shown in table 5 variable s1 at level 1 is located at the highest hierarchically after performing first iteration the same process is repeated with the remaining variables sajid et al 2017 wu et al 2015 the results of the second iteration are shown in table 5 as seen in table 5 s2 and s4 variables are included in level 2 after this levelling process the same procedure is followed for the other factors till there are no more factors observed in this research study all variables are listed hierarchically after 8 iterations according to the table while the factor at the top of the model is capsizing the listing and inappropriate action to upright factors are the variables at the second level in addition liquefaction factor is the only variable at level 3 it is seen that the factors arising from the error of the ship s crew are at the fourth and fifth levels it is noteworthy here that the variables in the last two levels are factors related to the port of loading after the completion of level partition process the final interpretive structural model is created 2 1 5 development of directed diagraph and formation of ism stage 6 7 8 the preliminary ism model was created after construction of the final reachability matrix after this step transitivity connections were removed to prevent the complexity in the diagraph in order to create a final diagram expert opinions were taken again to prevent inconsistencies in the network structure and the final ism model was created as shown in fig 1 2 2 risk analysis by using fbn bayesian networks are probabilistic networks where variables are represented by nodes and probabilistic dependency relationships between variables are shown by directional arrows factor determination with ism was utilized to build a hierarchy that will be further established into an initial digraph for fbn construction it is quite difficult to create a direct network structure when the relationships between the variables are uncertain and there is not enough information to solve this problem as in the previous studies liao et al 2008 wu et al 2015 hu et al 2015 sajid et al 2017 the ism method directly was used in the creation of the network structure in this study ism outputs were checked again with the expert opinion and made compatible with bn after the creation of bn structure it is necessary to determine the conditions to be used in probability evaluations for each variable as can be seen in fig 1 all the relations in the network hierarchy are composed of two states that characterize the variable in good or bad condition then probability tables should be composed of each node due to the uncertainty of the information in the accident reports experts were consulted in the creation of the conditional probability tables in order to minimize the possibility of failures arising from the evaluation of the experts the discretization method is applied during the evaluation of the possibilities wang et al 2011 71 as suggested by kim and pearl 1983 when node x in the bn has two parent nodes such as y and z its probability for these nodes are calculated as follows 1 p x y z α p x y p x z in the formula α is the determinant that normalizes the sum of the conditional probability estimated to 1 for each state of node x in cases where the nodes have more than one parent the decomposition method provides a great convenience in the creation of the conditional probability table by evaluating each parent separately wang et al 2011 three experts from the sector then were consulted in the evaluating of the probabilities between the nodes in the bn structure created by ism experts are classified under some weight criteria in terms of expertise experience and level of education as shown in table 6 thus the weight scores of the opinions given by the experts were determined in the light of these criteria experts were provided with supporting documents explaining the meaning and status of the nodes to which they would evaluate their possibilities before conducting the face to face interview the detailed information showing the possibilities between nodes was shared the profile and weight scores of each expert are shown in table 7 in table 7 which is created by taking into consideration the weight ratios in table 6 the profile information of the experts whose opinions are used to create the probability tables and the decision weights in the light of this profile are shown experts answered each question using verbal statements such as low and very high to reveal the correlation between nodes linguistic variables are defined as verbal expressions whose values are words or sentences linguistic variables are utilized to clarify and quantify fuzzy descriptions with mathematical equations the membership functions are used to mathematically express the relationships of variables with fuzzy sets trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers are generally used to symbolize linguistic variables kabir et al 2016 triangular fuzzy numbers are a specific type of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and have the same algebraic properties in our study trapezoidal membership function tmf has been selected because this function has strength in notional and practical easiness over other membership functions and creates the most common fuzzy numbers class with its linear membership function kabir and sumi 2014 based on the fuzzy tmf each verbal variable is described by fuzzy numbers as shown in table 8 the similarity aggregation method sam adopted by hsu and chen 1996 was utilized to reach a consensus from the judgments with this method the opinions obtained were explained by fuzzy numbers the sequential stages of sam are as follows i evaluating the level of similarity of opinions of pair of expert if the opinions of um and un experts are represented by tmf um a1 a2 a3 a4 and un b1 b2 b3b4 the similarity function of expert m to expert n is stated with the following equation the findings should be between 0 and 1 and the similarity increases as the value increases 2 s m n 1 1 4 i 1 4 a i b i ii evaluate experts average agreement aa the average agreement level is described as 3 a a m 1 m 1 i 1 n m m iii the evaluation of the relative level of agreement ra is reached with the equation below 4 r a m a a m k 1 m a a k iv consensus of experts consensus coefficient is evaluated with eq 5 where ß is the optimism coefficient in similarity method 5 c c m β w m 1 β r a m v finally expert opinions are aggregated with the following equation 6 e a g c 1 e 1 c 2 e 2 c m e m the equation below is used to turn fuzzy numbers obtained from sam into definite numbers 7 d e f u z z á x μ x d x μ x d x a 1 a 2 x a 1 a 2 a 1 x d x a 2 a 3 x d x a 3 a 4 a 4 x a 4 a

the above equations the aggregation values for lack of cargo care at sea node were obtained as shown in table 9 after determining the prior and conditional probabilities of the nodes in the network structure as shown in fig 2 the risk of the ship capsizing due to the liquefaction of the cargo was analysed through fbn model utilizing the netica software 2 2 1 scenario analysis in order to evaluate the suitability of the fbn methodology apart from the current situation two different scenarios were taken into account in these scenarios which are called the best and worst case scenarios the eight root nodes were considered and their status in the network structure is shown in table 10 in order to reduce the risk of capsizing as a result of liquefaction the best case scenario was first considered in the best case scenario the ideal states of each node in the network structure that do not have parent nodes will not cause capsizing besides it was seen that it would be possible to reduce the risk of capsizing due to liquefaction by changing the possibility of 8 root nodes in the best case scenario the ship s risk of capsizing was calculated as 8 69 while in the worst case scenario it was calculated as 59 2 as shown in table 10 after the preliminary and conditional possibilities were determined by the experts the current situation scenario was conducted through netica software as seen in fig 2 as a result of the liquefaction of group a cargoes the risk of capsizing of the ships was calculated as 13 the results indicate that if sufficient precautions are not taken during the transportation of cargoes with the risk of liquefaction such as iron ore it will pose a threat to the safety of the ship 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis by sensitivity analysis it can be determined which variable in the network is sensitive to the change of any other variable sensitivity analysis results are given as variance reduction values variance reduction values are defined as the expected decrease in the variance of the selected output variable depending on the value of an input variable in this study target node sensitivity analysis was applied the input variable which is determined to have the highest variance reduction value as a result of the analysis on this variable is expected to change the possibilities for the states of the target variable in the highest rate cinicioglu et al 2013 marcot 2012 51 cai et al 2012 202 akhtar and utne 2014 the basic approach in carrying out this analysis is to determine the impact of variances on the posterior probabilities as a result of the variances made in the states of the nodes ren et al 2009 7 wang et al 2011 the sensitivity analysis findings are indicated in table 11 as can be seen in table 11 by considering each node in the net structure separately the direct effect of the variables on the capsizing node was calculated by doing this in this way it is aimed to identify the child nodes that have the greatest impact on the capsize node the most important factors causing the ship to capsize during the transportation of group a cargo were determined as liquefaction and improper action to upright these variables were followed by insufficient knowledge list and lack of cargo care at sea respectively in the light of the data obtained from the accident reports and expert opinions it is seen that the biggest risk in the capsizing of the ship is the liquefaction of the cargo therefore analysis of the effects of related factors on liquefaction is important to reduce the risk of the capsizing for example the probability of liquefaction increases to 23 7 when evidence of the factor of heavy seas is entered to the network fig 3 shows the percentage changes in the liquefaction probability in case of entering evidence for each variable that have effects on the liquefaction as shown in the figure improper loading 29 lack of cargo care at sea 27 4 and insufficient knowledge 22 nodes have the highest impact on cargo liquefaction respectively although these errors are independent from one another human factor is the basis of all of them in particular tml related factors have a significant impact on liquefaction risk after the leading factors the findings of our study also support imo reports from the different perspective moreover both variables are factors that are closely related however the main factor causing the ship to capsize due to the liquefaction is the loading of cargo with inappropriate tml values in other words if the cargo without suitable tml values had not been loaded until appropriate values was recorded then the risk of liquefaction of the cargo would not have arisen at this stage the measures to be taken on the ship s side are the determining factors in mitigation of liquefaction risk of the cargo briefly it is vital that the ship s crew should follow the proper loading procedures in addition taking into consideration the negative conditions of all of the root nodes in the scenario analysis the probability of liquefaction risk rises to 87 2 and on the contrary the probability decreases to 2 2 2 3 model validation validation which is defined as the representation level of the real world in the proposed model is an important mechanism for the reliability of the fbn method schietekat et al 2016 the literature contains various approaches for determining the model validity jones et al 2010 nonetheless one of them is widely used to ensure validity of the model is to check the three axioms described below for the network structure yang et al 2009 jones et al 2010 wang et al 2011 cai et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 sharma and kulkarni 2016 1 a particular variation in the prior possibilities of each parent node should ensure a relative and substantial variation on the child node 2 the impact of various alterations on the prior possibilities of the parent node on the child node should be stable 3 for child nodes with more than one parent the individual impact of the parent a or parent b on a child node must be less than that of total impact value validation is an important step in showing that a model reflects a real system the model must provide all the above mentioned three axioms considering the parent nodes of improper loading for example when the not follow the procedure node is set to 100 the probability of improper loading increases from 17 7 to 44 3 in addition when inappropriate tml and inappropriate trimming nodes are set to 100 then the probability increases to 91 1 and 99 respectively in the light of these examples the model appears to be valid to see how accurately this model works in practice the fbn based liquefaction accident risk model has also been simulated taking into account the accidents as shown in table 12 to do this initially the causes of accidents from the accident reports were added to the network model as evidence network structure then was established using netica software a total of 5 ship accidents resulting in listing or capsizing due to cargo liquefaction were simulated in the network structure as seen in table 12 according to the simulation results liquefaction risk was found between 79 9 and 94 3 however it was calculated that the potential risk of capsizing due to liquefaction mechanism ranged between 55 3 bright ruby and 81 2 nasco diamond however the accident report shows that the master of padank hawk who faced the risk of capsize due to the liquefaction of the cargo saved ship from capsizing by proceeding to the shelter area as appropriate action for this reason the probability of capsizing was calculated to be only 8 although the risk of liquefaction of the cargo is 85 3 discussion and conclusion liquefaction as one of the most important risks during the transportation of group a cargo may cause capsizing of ship the analysis of the risks associated with the properties of the mineral cargo is quite complex since the relationships between the variables are not linear for this reason in this study a two step process was followed to identify the relationship between risks and to determine the effects on capsize to do this ism was initially used to identify relationships between factors and then a risk assessment was performed with the fbn it was found that liquefaction is the most important risk which will cause capsizing and the underlying causes are based on human error in order to minimize the risks initially the crew of the ship should be trained about the risk of liquefaction during the transportation of the cargo also awareness of the cargo operators on the requirements of the imsbc code should be increased vessel should be enforced to strictly follow the proper loading standards and requirements in all circumstances vessel should closely follow the recommendations contained in the imsbc code the operator of the vessel should have clear understanding of the special care and handling of these cargoes as mentioned in the operational procedures the results clearly indicate that cargo care at sea is vital to eliminate the risk of liquefaction especially weather conditions are crucial in the liquefaction process of mineral cargoes therefore the weather should be monitored frequently and the general conditions of the cargo such as moisture level and tml limits should be checked regularly the study concluded that the factors associated with tml are the determinant factors in liquefaction process in order to mitigate tml related risks laboratory testing of the cargoes likely to liquefy while being transported by sea needs to be approved by the relevant authority and regularly inspected the cargoes may only be carried when the actual moisture content is less than the transportable moisture limit tml can test should be applied in order to understand the cargo specification declaration provided by the shipper in case that there are specific doubts regarding the condition of the cargoes accurate information should be provided by the shipper regarding the cargoes to be shipped considering the imsbc code loading should not be commenced until that the master has no specific doubts regarding the safety of the cargoes in terms of cargo information and documentation loading operation must be followed from commence to completion by considering weather and the existence of any moisture loading operation must be suspended during periods of rain and or further moisture observed during the rainy season preloading and loading surveys should be carried out to monitor the moisture content of the cargo and intermediate measurements should be also taken if there is significant precipitation between the test time and the operation time if the cargo is stored in an open area it should be monitored regularly against the risk of liquefaction lack of cargo care during voyage is an important cause of liquefaction even if the cargo is loaded properly hence the cargo in the holds should be checked to understand whether or not there is any excess water or other indications of liquefaction risk it should be ensured that hatch cover maintains its watertight condition all crew have sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of liquefying cargoes therefore operator of the vessel should pay attention to the training programs for crew members in order to increase awareness in the transportation of such cargoes trimming of the cargoes should be implemented in order to minimize potential shifting of cargoes in the holds in order to avoid excessive motions due to heavy seas proper weather routing service should be considered when the liquefaction of the cargo occurs vessel must take the proper action to prevent capsize of vessel such as ballasting diverting of passage to find out shelter place reducing vessel motions etc there are a limited number of risk assessment studies in the literature that focus only on the effect of liquefaction on capsizing therefore with the integrated method used this study contributed to the literature by analysing the research problem from a different perspective besides its contribution to the current body of knowledge this study provides useful information to cargo operators to become aware of cargo specific risks such as liquefaction for that reason the above results are valuable for developing risk mitigation strategies for safe cargo operations in this study the combination of ism and fbn methods was used as risk assessment methodology for further researches it is recommended to consider other

21563,the main purpose of this research is to analyse the effect of cargo liquefaction on the capsizing of bulk carriers through an integrated model to do this initially an interpretive structure modelling ism was carried out to construct the relationship hierarchy of risk factors while a fuzzy bayesian networks fbn were conducted to quantify impact level the results revealed that liquefaction and improper actions to upright among 19 factors have a significant effect on capsizing the findings also emphasize that the factors improper loading 29 lack of cargo care at sea 27 4 and insufficient knowledge 22 arising from human error play an important role in cargo liquefaction unlike experimental researches in the literature this research analyses the liquefaction risk and the other basic causes resulting from the capsizing of bulk carriers using an integrated risk assessment method for further researches it is recommended to consider other risk identification and assessment models for better results keywords ism fbn capsizing risk assessment liquefaction 1 introduction and literature review liquefaction is defined as the behaviour of the material in the field of soil mechanics as a result of exposure to cyclic and monatomic loads youd 1973 similar processes such as liquefaction of the soil during the earthquake are experienced in bulk carriers especially during the transportation of mineral cargoes after liquefaction the dry bulk cargo acts as a mass of fluid displacing it in holds and causing the loss of ship s stability munro and mohajerani 2016 there are many accidents in history due to the liquefaction of the cargo in bulk carriers ju et al 2018 pittara 2018 between 1988 and 2019 a total of 25 incidents were recorded in bulk carriers encountered due to the liquefaction of the cargo and as a result 19 of the recorded incidents resulted in capsizing as the ships lost their stability snf 2020 intercargo international association of dry cargo shipowners 2020 these accidents were caused by cargoes categorized as group a cargoes in the related international conventions such as international maritime solid bulk cargoes imsbc which refers to procedures to be followed during transportation and handling in the literature studies on the relevant subject generally address numerical evaluations and experiments to reveal the liquefaction potential depending on the characteristics of the cargo zhao et al 2016 evaluated seismic performance of breakwater structures considering liquefaction process as a result of earthquake koromila et al 2013 in their experimental research revealed the effects of two different materials on ship stability by examining their liquefaction properties ju et al 2018 developed the discrete element method dem liquefaction model based on displacements of a group of particles to investigate the cargo liquefaction daoud et al 2018 evaluated the liquefaction potential of ore under swell motion by dynamic numerical model ju et al 2016 used plaxis liquefaction model ubc3d plm in order to assess cargo liquefaction potential and its impact on ship stability with an experimental approach munro and mohajerani 2016 2017 focused on the ship accidents caused by cargo liquefaction and analysed the root causes of each accident investigating the relevant incident reports then the proactive measures were identified to prevent future accidents again chua et al 2019 developed a numerical model to evaluate the effect of the cargo liquefaction on a ship s stability andrei and pazara 2013 focused on the impact of liquefaction of bulk cargoes on ship s intact stability and proposed a cargo shifting procedure in order to prevent capsizing lee 2017 developed response strategies performing redistribution of the cargo to mitigate risk of capsizing for a bulk carrier because of liquefaction process of cargo munro and mohajerani 2018 developed a model in the laboratory to test the conditions under which the iron ore fines would begin to liquefy zou et al 2018 argued that the most important factor in the capsizing of the ship due to liquefaction was the viscosity coefficient rather than the metacentric height gm in their simulation studies they concluded that the shear force is eliminated as a result of the change in the viscosity of the liquefied cargo and therefore the ship could capsize hu et al 2015 used bayesian network bn methodology to estimate seismic liquefaction using interpretive structure modelling ism despite the growing amount of published research about cargo liquefaction rather less attention has been paid to studying on the risk assessment through integrating ism and fbn although several risk assessment studies using ism and bn methods were carried out previously hu et al 2015 wu et al 2015 there is still a research gap in the field of shipping therefore this study aims to draw attention to liquefaction s effect on the risk of capsizing of dry cargo ships in line with this purpose the ism integrated fbn approach as one of the most important risk assessment methodologies was used initially the risks were identified by literature review accident reports and expert opinion then the ism hierarchy which was established in the light of expert opinions was used to determine the relationships and impact levels among risks bayesian networks were created with the data from ism structure which defines the hierarchical relationship between factors the participants depending on their expertise were then asked to determine the probabilities to conclude fbn finally the risk assessment through fbn was carried out for the safety assessment of capsizing as a result of liquefaction in dry cargo ships 2 materials and method 2 1 interpretive structural modelling ism the ism method proposed by warfield in 1974 is used to determine the relationship between factors causing a problem in complex environment janes 1988 the main stages of this method are as follows stage 1 defining the variables of the systems stage 2 determining the conceptual relationships for the variables listed in the first step stage 3 establishing a structural self interaction matrix ssim showing binary correlation for the factors stage 4 creating the reachability matrix using ssim and transitivity is conducted for controlling the final matrix stage 5 level partitioning is conducted for reachability matrix stage 6 drawing the directed graphic and removing the transition connections regarding to the correlations in the reachability matrix stage 7 converting the graphic created in the sixth step to ism method by using expressions with replacing nodes stage 8 ism is examined in terms of conceptual consistency and necessary corrections are made accordingly 2 1 1 risk identification and hierarchy construction stage 1 2 in this step the necessary literature was reviewed first to determine the variables that caused the ship to capsize due to liquefaction of the cargo and then accident reports were analysed reports of a total of 25 ship accidents resulting from the capsizing of 19 ships due to cargo liquefaction between 1986 and 2019 were analysed as shown in table 1 the reports of the ship accidents caused by the liquefaction of the cargo were obtained by the global integrated shipping information system gisis then the variables provided by the reports were revised and updated in the light of interviews with experts to do this a semi structured face to face interview was conducted with 7 experts and as a result 19 risk factors were determined the experts have extensive experience in operations of dry bulk cargo which has liquefaction risk four of the experts are currently working as a master in dry bulk cargo carriers and have experience more than 6 years one of the experts retired captain with more than 10 years of experience in bulk carriers also lectures the course called dry bulk operations at a maritime university one of the other two experts is employed as an operations manager in a shipping company operating a bulk carrier fleet while the other one works as a safety superintendent the details of each factor are shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 improper loading conditions are defined as situations that cause cargo liquefaction due to inadequate and incorrect measures taken at the loading port handling of the cargo with moisture content above tml inadequate visual inspection during loading lack of can testing wetting and contamination of holds inappropriate trimming of cargo in hold and continuing the loading operation in humid air conditions can be considered as factors that cause improper loading conditions imo 2016 insufficient knowledge is defined as the lack of knowledge of the ship s crew in the characteristics of group a cargo this factor may trigger events that cause cargo liquefaction at each stage of operation incompetent crew may fail to inspect the moisture content of the cargo prior to loading and during transportation captains with insufficient knowledge may have difficulties in classifying the cargo and identifying cargo specific risks as some cargoes are known by their trade names captain should know that he she has overriding authority with regard to safety therefore he she should not start the loading until all necessary documents under the regulations provided by the shipper the company should re consider the safety management system for operation of group a so as to ensure that the masters of ships follow strictly imo 2016 lack of cargo care at sea refers to the situation that the seafarers do not pay enough attention to the cargoes carrying risk of liquefaction during the voyage the factor addresses lack of inspection of the state of the cargo lack of monitoring the cargo holds to check any sign of excessive moisture insufficient measure the soundings of cargo hold bilges lack of ventilation and inappropriate monitoring the ship s stability imo 2016 2 1 2 structural self interaction matrix ssim stage 3 after determination of the risk factors ssim was established to reveal the contextual relationship among variables contextual relationship is usually determined by using expert opinions attri et al 2013 a total of seven experts from the shipping sector were interviewed to assess the conditional correlations in the light of binary variable comparisons there are four types of correlation a variable affects other variable a variable is affected by other variable both variables affect each other o or both variables are irrelevant x in the study ssim created based on a total of 171 contextual relationships obtained in binary comparison between among 19 variables is shown in table 3 as seen in table 3 the s8 not follow procedure node influences the s9 improper loading node in other words proper loading conditions can be achieved by following the handling procedures of group a cargo required by the imsbc code according to the procedures tml certificate and moisture content declaration provided by the operators must be delivered first cargo spaces should be dry and watertight visual monitoring of cargo and weather should be conducted frequently also the s7 insufficient knowledge node affects the s15 no test to ascertain tml on board node if the ship s crew is not familiar about the precautions to be taken during the transportation of group a cargoes the necessary tml measurements will not be performed and then risk of cargo liquefaction will arise in addition the s11 stockpile areas open node influences the s10 excessive moisture content node storage of cargo in the open area poses a risk in terms of excessive moisture content changes in water vapour concentration in the air will directly affect the moisture content of the cargo resulting in an increased risk of liquefaction therefore stockpiles should be designed in order to prevent the ingress of rainwater 2 1 3 reachability matrix stage 4 the initial reachability matrix irm is based on the method of replacing four symbols x o with the numbers of 0 and 1 by evaluating the contextual relationships then its transitivity is checked one of the main assumptions in ism is the transitivity attribution in this association if x is associated with y and if y is associated with z then variable x is associated with variable z sajid et al 2017 in the light of these rules the irm is created after embedding transitivity the modified rm is created as indicated in table 4 2 1 4 level partitions stage 5 in the final stage the hierarchical level of each factor is determined to do this the antecedent set and reachability set for each variable are provided by last matrix the antecedent set includes the variable itself and all other variables that affect it the reachability set includes the factor itself and all other factors it affects luthra et al 2014 the intersection set is the intersection of its own reachability and antecedent sets for each variable malone 1975 if the reachability and the intersection sets for a variable are equal the level of this variable is defined as 1 the level partition summary is shown in table 5 variable s1 at level 1 is located at the highest hierarchically after performing first iteration the same process is repeated with the remaining variables sajid et al 2017 wu et al 2015 the results of the second iteration are shown in table 5 as seen in table 5 s2 and s4 variables are included in level 2 after this levelling process the same procedure is followed for the other factors till there are no more factors observed in this research study all variables are listed hierarchically after 8 iterations according to the table while the factor at the top of the model is capsizing the listing and inappropriate action to upright factors are the variables at the second level in addition liquefaction factor is the only variable at level 3 it is seen that the factors arising from the error of the ship s crew are at the fourth and fifth levels it is noteworthy here that the variables in the last two levels are factors related to the port of loading after the completion of level partition process the final interpretive structural model is created 2 1 5 development of directed diagraph and formation of ism stage 6 7 8 the preliminary ism model was created after construction of the final reachability matrix after this step transitivity connections were removed to prevent the complexity in the diagraph in order to create a final diagram expert opinions were taken again to prevent inconsistencies in the network structure and the final ism model was created as shown in fig 1 2 2 risk analysis by using fbn bayesian networks are probabilistic networks where variables are represented by nodes and probabilistic dependency relationships between variables are shown by directional arrows factor determination with ism was utilized to build a hierarchy that will be further established into an initial digraph for fbn construction it is quite difficult to create a direct network structure when the relationships between the variables are uncertain and there is not enough information to solve this problem as in the previous studies liao et al 2008 wu et al 2015 hu et al 2015 sajid et al 2017 the ism method directly was used in the creation of the network structure in this study ism outputs were checked again with the expert opinion and made compatible with bn after the creation of bn structure it is necessary to determine the conditions to be used in probability evaluations for each variable as can be seen in fig 1 all the relations in the network hierarchy are composed of two states that characterize the variable in good or bad condition then probability tables should be composed of each node due to the uncertainty of the information in the accident reports experts were consulted in the creation of the conditional probability tables in order to minimize the possibility of failures arising from the evaluation of the experts the discretization method is applied during the evaluation of the possibilities wang et al 2011 71 as suggested by kim and pearl 1983 when node x in the bn has two parent nodes such as y and z its probability for these nodes are calculated as follows 1 p x y z α p x y p x z in the formula α is the determinant that normalizes the sum of the conditional probability estimated to 1 for each state of node x in cases where the nodes have more than one parent the decomposition method provides a great convenience in the creation of the conditional probability table by evaluating each parent separately wang et al 2011 three experts from the sector then were consulted in the evaluating of the probabilities between the nodes in the bn structure created by ism experts are classified under some weight criteria in terms of expertise experience and level of education as shown in table 6 thus the weight scores of the opinions given by the experts were determined in the light of these criteria experts were provided with supporting documents explaining the meaning and status of the nodes to which they would evaluate their possibilities before conducting the face to face interview the detailed information showing the possibilities between nodes was shared the profile and weight scores of each expert are shown in table 7 in table 7 which is created by taking into consideration the weight ratios in table 6 the profile information of the experts whose opinions are used to create the probability tables and the decision weights in the light of this profile are shown experts answered each question using verbal statements such as low and very high to reveal the correlation between nodes linguistic variables are defined as verbal expressions whose values are words or sentences linguistic variables are utilized to clarify and quantify fuzzy descriptions with mathematical equations the membership functions are used to mathematically express the relationships of variables with fuzzy sets trapezoidal or triangular fuzzy numbers are generally used to symbolize linguistic variables kabir et al 2016 triangular fuzzy numbers are a specific type of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and have the same algebraic properties in our study trapezoidal membership function tmf has been selected because this function has strength in notional and practical easiness over other membership functions and creates the most common fuzzy numbers class with its linear membership function kabir and sumi 2014 based on the fuzzy tmf each verbal variable is described by fuzzy numbers as shown in table 8 the similarity aggregation method sam adopted by hsu and chen 1996 was utilized to reach a consensus from the judgments with this method the opinions obtained were explained by fuzzy numbers the sequential stages of sam are as follows i evaluating the level of similarity of opinions of pair of expert if the opinions of um and un experts are represented by tmf um a1 a2 a3 a4 and un b1 b2 b3b4 the similarity function of expert m to expert n is stated with the following equation the findings should be between 0 and 1 and the similarity increases as the value increases 2 s m n 1 1 4 i 1 4 a i b i ii evaluate experts average agreement aa the average agreement

coefficient is evaluated with eq 5 where ß is the optimism coefficient in similarity method 5 c c m β w m 1 β r a m v finally expert opinions are aggregated with the following equation 6 e a g c 1 e 1 c 2 e 2 c m e m the equation below is used to turn fuzzy numbers obtained from sam into definite numbers 7 d e f u z z á x μ x d x μ x d x a 1 a 2 x a 1 a 2 a 1 x d x a 2 a 3 x d x a 3 a 4 a 4 x a 4 a

the above equations the aggregation values for lack of cargo care at sea node were obtained as shown in table 9 after determining the prior and conditional probabilities of the nodes in the network structure as shown in fig 2 the risk of the ship capsizing due to the liquefaction of the cargo was analysed through fbn model utilizing the netica software 2 2 1 scenario analysis in order to evaluate the suitability of the fbn methodology apart from the current situation two different scenarios were taken into account in these scenarios which are called the best and worst case scenarios the eight root nodes were considered and their status in the network structure is shown in table 10 in order to reduce the risk of capsizing as a result of liquefaction the best case scenario was first considered in the best case scenario the ideal states of each node in the network structure that do not have parent nodes will not cause capsizing besides it was seen that it would be possible to reduce the risk of capsizing due to liquefaction by changing the possibility of 8 root nodes in the best case scenario the ship s risk of capsizing was calculated as 8 69 while in the worst case scenario it was calculated as 59 2 as shown in table 10 after the preliminary and conditional possibilities were determined by the experts the current situation scenario was conducted through netica software as seen in fig 2 as a result of the liquefaction of group a cargoes the risk of capsizing of the ships was calculated as 13 the results indicate that if sufficient precautions are not taken during the transportation of cargoes with the risk of liquefaction such as iron ore it will pose a threat to the safety of the ship 2 2 2 sensitivity analysis by sensitivity analysis it can be determined which variable in the network is sensitive to the change of any other variable sensitivity analysis results are given as variance reduction values variance reduction values are defined as the expected decrease in the variance of the selected output variable depending on the value of an input variable in this study target node sensitivity analysis was applied the input variable which is determined to have the highest variance reduction value as a result of the analysis on this variable is expected to change the possibilities for the states of the target variable in the highest rate cinicioglu et al 2013 marcot 2012 51 cai et al 2012 202 akhtar and utne 2014 the basic approach in carrying out this analysis is to determine the impact of variances on the posterior probabilities as a result of the variances made in the states of the nodes ren et al 2009 7 wang et al 2011 the sensitivity analysis findings are indicated in table 11 as can be seen in table 11 by considering each node in the net structure separately the direct effect of the variables on the capsizing node was calculated by doing this in this way it is aimed to identify the child nodes that have the greatest impact on the capsize node the most important factors causing the ship to capsize during the transportation of group a cargo were determined as liquefaction and improper action to upright these variables were followed by insufficient knowledge list and lack of cargo care at sea respectively in the light of the data obtained from the accident reports and expert opinions it is seen that the biggest risk in the capsizing of the ship is the liquefaction of the cargo therefore analysis of the effects of related factors on liquefaction is important to reduce the risk of the capsizing for example the probability of liquefaction increases to 23 7 when evidence of the factor of heavy seas is entered to the network fig 3 shows the percentage changes in the liquefaction probability in case of entering evidence for each variable that have effects on the liquefaction as shown in the figure improper loading 29 lack of cargo care at sea 27 4 and insufficient knowledge 22 nodes have the highest impact on cargo liquefaction respectively although these errors are independent from one another human factor is the basis of all of them in particular tml related factors have a significant impact on liquefaction risk after the leading factors the findings of our study also support imo reports from the different perspective moreover both variables are factors that are closely related however the main factor causing the ship to capsize due to the liquefaction is the loading of cargo with inappropriate tml values in other words if the cargo without suitable tml values had not been loaded until appropriate values was recorded then the risk of liquefaction of the cargo would not have arisen at this stage the measures to be taken on the ship s side are the determining factors in mitigation of liquefaction risk of the cargo briefly it is vital that the ship s crew should follow the proper loading procedures in addition taking into consideration the negative conditions of all of the root nodes in the scenario analysis the probability of liquefaction risk rises to 87 2 and on the contrary the probability decreases to 2 2 2 3 model validation validation which is defined as the representation level of the real world in the proposed model is an important mechanism for the reliability of the fbn method schietekat et al 2016 the literature contains various approaches for determining the model validity jones et al 2010 nonetheless one of them is widely used to ensure validity of the model is to check the three axioms described below for the network structure yang et al 2009 jones et al 2010 wang et al 2011 cai et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 sharma and kulkarni 2016 1 a particular variation in the prior possibilities of each parent node should ensure a relative and substantial variation on the child node 2 the impact of various alterations on the prior possibilities of the parent node on the child node should be stable 3 for child nodes with more than one parent the individual impact of the parent a or parent b on a child node must be less than that of total impact value validation is an important step in showing that a model reflects a real system the model must provide all the above mentioned three axioms considering the parent nodes of improper loading for example when the not follow the procedure node is set to 100 the probability of improper loading increases from 17 7 to 44 3 in addition when inappropriate tml and inappropriate trimming nodes are set to 100 then the probability increases to 91 1 and 99 respectively in the light of these examples the model appears to be valid to see how accurately this model works in practice the fbn based liquefaction accident risk model has also been simulated taking into account the accidents as shown in table 12 to do this initially the causes of accidents from the accident reports were added to the network model as evidence network structure then was established using netica software a total of 5 ship accidents resulting in listing or capsizing due to cargo liquefaction were simulated in the network structure as seen in table 12 according to the simulation results liquefaction risk was found between 79 9 and 94 3 however it was calculated that the potential risk of capsizing due to liquefaction mechanism ranged between 55 3 bright ruby and 81 2 nasco diamond however the accident report shows that the master of padank hawk who faced the risk of capsize due to the liquefaction of the cargo saved ship from capsizing by proceeding to the shelter area as appropriate action for this reason the probability of capsizing was calculated to be only 8 although the risk of liquefaction of the cargo is 85 3 discussion and conclusion liquefaction as one of the most important risks during the transportation of group a cargo may cause capsizing of ship the analysis of the risks associated with the properties of the mineral cargo is quite complex since the relationships between the variables are not linear for this reason in this study a two step process was followed to identify the relationship between risks and to determine the effects on capsize to do this ism was initially used to identify relationships between factors and then a risk assessment was performed with the fbn it was found that liquefaction is the most important risk which will cause capsizing and the underlying causes are based on human error in order to minimize the risks initially the crew of the ship should be trained about the risk of liquefaction during the transportation of the cargo also awareness of the cargo operators on the requirements of the imsbc code should be increased vessel should be enforced to strictly follow the proper loading standards and requirements in all circumstances vessel should closely follow the recommendations contained in the imsbc code the operator of the vessel should have clear understanding of the special care and handling of these cargoes as mentioned in the operational procedures the results clearly indicate that cargo care at sea is vital to eliminate the risk of liquefaction especially weather conditions are crucial in the liquefaction process of mineral cargoes therefore the weather should be monitored frequently and the general conditions of the cargo such as moisture level and tml limits should be checked regularly the study concluded that the factors associated with tml are the determinant factors in liquefaction process in order to mitigate tml related risks laboratory testing of the cargoes likely to liquefy while being transported by sea needs to be approved by the relevant authority and regularly inspected the cargoes may only be carried when the actual moisture content is less than the transportable moisture limit tml can test should be applied in order to understand the cargo specification declaration provided by the shipper in case that there are specific doubts regarding the condition of the cargoes accurate information should be provided by the shipper regarding the cargoes to be shipped considering the imsbc code loading should not be commenced until that the master has no specific doubts regarding the safety of the cargoes in terms of cargo information and documentation loading operation must be followed from commence to completion by considering weather and the existence of any moisture loading operation must be suspended during periods of rain and or further moisture observed during the rainy season preloading and loading surveys should be carried out to monitor the moisture content of the cargo and intermediate measurements should be also taken if there is significant precipitation between the test time and the operation time if the cargo is stored in an open area it should be monitored regularly against the risk of liquefaction lack of cargo care during voyage is an important cause of liquefaction even if the cargo is loaded properly hence the cargo in the holds should be checked to understand whether or not there is any excess water or other indications of liquefaction risk it should be ensured that hatch cover maintains its watertight condition all crew have sufficient knowledge of the characteristics of liquefying cargoes therefore operator of the vessel should pay attention to the training programs for crew members in order to increase awareness in the transportation of such cargoes trimming of the cargoes should be implemented in order to minimize potential shifting of cargoes in the holds in order to avoid excessive motions due to heavy seas proper weather routing service should be considered when the liquefaction of the cargo occurs vessel must take the proper action to prevent capsize of vessel such as ballasting diverting of passage to find out shelter place reducing vessel motions etc there are a limited number of risk assessment studies in the literature that focus only on the effect of liquefaction on capsizing therefore with the integrated method used this study contributed to the literature by analysing the research problem from a different perspective besides its contribution to the current body of knowledge this study provides useful information to cargo operators to become aware of cargo specific risks such as liquefaction for that reason the above results are valuable for developing risk mitigation strategies for safe cargo operations in this study the combination of ism and fbn methods was used as risk assessment methodology for further researches it is recommended to consider other

21564,in oscillatory flow drag and inertial forces experienced by flat plates and cylinders depend on the keulegan carpenter number here we demonstrate that this extends to an asymmetric hexagonal conic heave plate suitable for a point absorber wave energy converter the forces on three geometric scales of this plate were measured throughout forced oscillation experiments in quiescent water from these measurements phase invariant and phase dependent coefficients of drag and added mass are calculated using the morison equation for low amplitude oscillations the total force experienced by the plate is well described by phase invariant coefficients that scale with the keulegan carpenter number however for larger oscillations maximum forces are better described by phase dependent coefficients flow visualization is used to interpret the phase variations keywords oscillatory flow wave energy added mass heave plates 1 introduction conversion of ocean surface waves to mechanical power has seen renewed interest in recent years falnes 2007 one of the major wave energy converter wec archetypes is a point absorber which generates power from the differential motion between two bodies shown in fig 1 in shallow water the second body can be the seabed but as water depth increases it is economically advantageous to use a heave plate either rigidly or compliantly connected to the wave forced body for such systems knowledge of the heave plate hydrodynamics is critical to predict the overall device response while these hydrodynamics are well studied for flat heave plates asymmetric plates which are employed in a few recent wec designs remain poorly characterized the foundations of relevant ocean engineering knowledge in this area were laid down more than 100 years ago in work by stokes 1851 and basset 1888 oscillatory hydrodynamic forces are traditionally decomposed into two components a quadratic drag force and a linear inertial force morison et al 1950 this description referred to as the morison equation is applicable to a range of objects cylinders flat plates and conditions cyclic wave motion oscillation in quiescent water in their seminal work keulegan and carpenter 1958 used the morison equation to estimate coefficients of drag and added mass for cylinders and flat plates fixed in oscillatory flow they found that both coefficients varied with a non dimensional parameter now known as the keulegan carpenter number k c here we apply similar techniques to investigate hydrodynamic forces on asymmetric plates at three different scales the link between vortex dynamics and hydrodynamic force in oscillatory flow is an active area of research mcnown and keulegan 1959 observed a correlation between vortex shedding and hydrodynamic coefficients while investigating the wake created by bodies submerged in oscillatory flow more recently tao and thiagarajan 2003b a evaluated vortex dynamics through direct numerical simulation and identified three vortex shedding modes dependent on k c and a frequency parameter they related changes in the relationship between the damping coefficient drag varying linearly with velocity rather than with its square and k c to transitions between vortex shedding modes sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 also related changes in hydrodynamics across k c to changing vortex dynamics they showed that the morison equation adequately described hydrodynamics at relatively low and high k c for intermediate k c a third force component the vortex force was needed to describe the hydrodynamic force since the vortex force depends on prior flow states it can be thought of as flow memory that is not captured by either the classical drag or inertia term sarpkaya 2001 further sarpkaya noted that a vortex force contains components proportional to both velocity squared and linear acceleration making it difficult to separate from drag and added mass terms in a morison equation decomposition sarpkaya 2004 while basset included a third force in his formulation of oscillatory hydrodynamics basset 1888 sarpkaya concluded that its complexity is excessive and that the morison equation is sufficient for many ocean engineering problems sarpkaya 2004 2001 1996 as such we focus our analysis on a morison equation decomposition of total force into drag and inertia utilizing flow visualization to assess vortex dynamics specific to our application two studies by garrido mendoza et al inform our experimental approach the authors first used numerical methods garrido mendoza et al 2014 to analyze added mass and damping coefficients as a function of plate submergence depth both coefficients were increased when oscillations occurred near a seabed or free surface and damping coefficients were related to enstrophy the integral of vorticity over a surface in subsequent work garrido mendoza et al 2015 the authors used flow visualization and force measurements from experiments to validate the numerical simulation these studies concluded that submergence depths at least one diameter from a surface led to results identical to those observed at greater depths recent work by bezunartea et al 2019 calculated drag quadratic velocity dependence and added mass coefficients for three scales of flat heave plates coefficients of drag and added mass were independent of frequency and scale and dependent on k c further they showed that the damping coefficient is both scale and frequency dependent this motivates our focus on using a quadratic rather than linear drag parameterization in this analysis beatty et al 2015 applied these principles to wecs demonstrating that a heave plate could increase the added mass of a single body point absorber and increase the period of peak power production aligning it with the wave period targeted for operation for two body point absorbers with compliantly coupled heave plates heave plate hydrodynamics have been partially explored brown et al 2018 characterized the hydrodynamics of both asymmetric and flat heave plates under forced oscillation they found that for k c experienced by heave plates in the range of wave conditions tested drag and added mass depended on k c and the frequency of oscillation further they noted that when the morison equation was used to reconstruct hydrodynamic force peak forces important to the design of wecs were underestimated here we build on those results to explore the hydrodynamics of an asymmetric heave plate at three geometric scales using forced oscillation experiments in doing so we have two objectives the first is to establish how parameterizations of the hydrodynamic forces added mass and drag scale with motion for an asymmetric heave plate the second is to evaluate the fidelity of possible representations of these forces across the range of tested cases we investigate scale dependence of phase invariant drag and added mass coefficients estimated from the morison equation then we use a windowed morison equation to estimate phase dependent coefficients that for some k c are shown to provide a better description of hydrodynamic force we conclude with a discussion of the implication of these results for wec design 2 background throughout this work we describe the force balance as a function of oscillation amplitude for a plate in sinusoidal motion following convention we utilize the non dimensional parameter relating flow velocity and oscillation period to plate diameter this period parameter was defined by keulegan and carpenter 1958 as 1 u m t d where u m is the maximum velocity experienced in an oscillation t is the period of oscillation and d is the plate s characteristic length or diameter since our heave plates are non circular we define an effective diameter as the diameter of a disk with the same area projected in the direction of oscillation as the heave plate for a sinusoidal oscillation of amplitude a heave plate position z can be written as a function of time as 2 z a cos 2 π t t taking the derivative of position to obtain velocity we can see by substitution that we can express u m in terms of a and t as 3 u m 2 π a t combining 1 and 3 the period parameter now referred to as the keulegan carpenter number k c becomes a ratio of the oscillation amplitude to the plate diameter as 4 k c 2 π a d additionally the roshko number r o or β is a non dimensional oscillation frequency and relates k c to the reynolds number r e tao and thiagarajan 2003a as 5 r o β d 2 f ν 6 r e u m d ν 7 r e k c β 2 π a d d 2 1 t ν 2 π a d ν t where f is the oscillation frequency in rad s and ν is the kinematic fluid viscosity in m2 s from 1 it is also apparent that k c is the inverse of the strouhal number we use these non dimensional coefficients to assess the scaling of heave plate hydrodynamics first we use the morison equation morison et al 1950 morison 1953 to decompose the total hydrodynamic force f h on a heave plate into a drag force f d and added mass force f a as 8 f h f d f a the non dimensional coefficient of drag c d is then defined as 9 c d f d 1 8 ρ π d 2 z z where ρ is the water density and z is the flow velocity past the heave plate if the heave plate is oscillating in quiescent water this is generally taken to be the velocity of the plate though we note this is a simplification when the plate is oscillating in its own wake the added mass force represents the force from the acceleration of water surrounding the heave plate and the coefficient of added mass c a is defined as 10 c a f a 1 6 ρ π d 3 z where z represents the acceleration of the heave plate through quiescent water the quantity π d 3 6 represents the volume of a sphere with the same effective diameter as the heave plate c a therefore represents the fraction of the mass of that hypothetical sphere accelerated by the heave plate this volume is arbitrarily used for flat plates and we extend its use to this asymmetric shape using these definitions we can combine 8 9 and 10 to express the hydrodynamic force as 11 f h 1 8 ρ π d 2 c d z z 1 6 ρ π d 3 c a z 3 methods 3 1 experimental setup we perform a series of experiments on hexagonal conic heave plates at three different sizes using three experimental setups the full scale plate shown in fig 2 a has an effective diameter of 2 72 m and is referenced as the 1 1 scale plate since it is the largest plate in this study the two smaller plates shown in fig 2 b have effective diameters of 0 54 m and 0 27 m we refer to these as 1 5 and 1 10 scale models respectively critical dimensions for the three plates are reported in fig 2 c the three plates were forced in sinusoidal oscillation in quiescent water and forces were measured using an in line load cell the general layout of experimental setups is given in fig 1 alongside the wec it emulates as described subsequently each heave plate scale was tested in a different facility during testing oscillation amplitude and period varied to cover a relatively wide overlapping range of k c β and r e as shown in table 1 allowing us to validate conclusions across both scale and facility the monterey bay aquarium research institute s mbari test tank fig 2 a was used to characterize the full scale plate the tank is 12 m deep 9 m wide and 14 m long a hydraulic ram with a 1 8 m stroke length is centered above the tank and actuates the heave plate using feedback position control it is capable of 1 27 m s speeds with a maximum force of 2 7 kn we measured force with a honeywell model 45 load cell which has a maximum rating of 44 kn and resolution of 22 n force and ram position were recorded at a rate of 200 hz during testing the plate hung from the ram by chain and oscillation parameters were chosen to maintain chain tension throughout each test load cell sensitivity determined the minimum experimental amplitude and frequency the 1 5 and 1 10 scale models were tested at the university of washington s applied physics laboratory dock using a modified setup from brown et al 2018 a belt drive linear actuator mounted at the dock s edge prescribes sinusoidal oscillations using feedback position control from the carriage of the belt driven actuator a futek stl s beam load cell with a 2 2 kn rating connects to a rigid driving rod which suspends the plate 1 25 m beneath the free surface as with the mbari testing force and position were recorded at 200 hz oscillation parameters are limited by maximum actuator speed 0 65 m s and the signal to noise ratio of the load cell which required that period decrease with amplitude to maintain acceptable data quality particularly for the 1 10 scale model the 1 10 scale model was also tested in a laboratory tank at the university of washington measuring 1 5 m deep and 1 3 x 1 3 m across a ball screw linear actuator mounts above the center of the tank and a rigid driving rod suspends the plate beneath the water surface velocity feedback control prescribes sinusoidal motion with a maximum stroke of 40 cm and speed of 0 65 m s an example of the commanded and realized position velocity and acceleration for this system is shown in fig 3 and demonstrates that the measured profile largely tracks the command aberrations at θ 0 and θ 0 5 result from mechanical backlash around zero velocity and exhibit no apparent effect on the calculated coefficients a 0 24 kn 6 axis submersible load cell ati mini 40 was installed at the interface between the heave plate and bottom of the driving rod this acrylic tank was also used for flow visualization by releasing dye at the inside edge of the heave plate rim and capturing imagery at 60 frames per second with a camera nikon d3200 hd slr to enhance dye visibility processed images use only the blue color channel with the dynamic range truncated by matlab s imagesc function images are grouped by phase and averaged over realizations from five oscillations 3 2 data analysis each experimental setup produces a time series of position and force we analyze the hydrodynamic forces assuming both phase invariant and phase dependent behavior and then assess the effectiveness of both approaches we isolate quasi steady oscillations neglecting startup in quiescent water before analysis tests using the dockside oscillator use sine waves with ramp up and ramp down periods which are discarded leaving 40 oscillations for analysis tests in the mbari tank and the uw test tank were limited to seven oscillations to minimize reflections so oscillations use negative cosine waves with no ramp up or ramp down period by removing the first oscillation six quasi steady oscillations remain for analysis the first step is to isolate the hydrodynamic force from the force measured by the load cells measured force is filtered using a low pass iir filter with a 7 hz passband frequency 10 hz stopband frequency and 60 hz stopband attenuation for all three facilities weight inertia and buoyancy of the heave plates must be accounted for and for the mbari tank and the dockside oscillator so must the chain and driving rod by deducting the force of inertia f i weight f w and buoyancy f b from the filtered measured force f m e a s u r e d we calculate the hydrodynamic force acting on the plate as 12 f h t f m e a s u r e d t f i t f w f b t the inertial force is estimated as 13 f i t z t m h p m r o d where m h p and m r o d are heave plate and driving rod masses respectively heave plate acceleration z is calculated by twice differentiating heave plate position z t f w is the product of m h p and m r o d with gravity the buoyancy force is given as 14 f b t ρ g v h p v r o d t where v h p and v r o d are the submerged volumes of the heave plate and driving rod this volume changes throughout each oscillation respectively ρ is water density and g is acceleration due to gravity consequently the hydrodynamic force is given from measured force as 15 f h t f m e a s u r e d t z t m h p m r o d g m h p m r o d ρ g v h p v r o d t the hydrodynamic force time series 11 can be expressed compactly by representing inertial and drag terms with two constants a and b as 16 f h t 1 f h t 2 a z 1 z 1 z 2 z 2 b z 1 z 2 h i which can be solved for a and b using a least squares regression following this decomposition the coefficient of drag is then 17 c d a 1 8 ρ π d 2 and the coefficient of added mass is 18 c a b 1 6 ρ π d 3 phase invariant coefficients of drag and added mass are calculated from 16 using time series data from all quasi steady oscillations as noted by sarpkaya 2004 the hydrodynamic force may not be adequately described by only added mass and drag for some k c consequently we evaluated the accuracy of this decomposition by reconstructing the force time series i e treating f h as the unknown in 16 and taking a and b as known constants comparison of this reconstructed approximation f h to the measured f h can identify portions of an oscillation where the morison equation is inadequate we focus on error in reconstruction of peak forces which is the average of the normalized deviation between f h and f h at the 95th and 5th percentiles all time series data has been phase averaged oscillation phase θ is defined as θ t t where θ 0 corresponds to the minimum oscillatory position as shown in fig 3 a phase bins with a width of 0 01 t are used for averaging we calculate phase dependent coefficients of drag c d θ and added mass c a θ these coefficients are calculated from unfiltered measured force using 16 by partitioning the time series into windows of width 0 1 t overlapping such that c d θ and c a θ maintain the same sampling rate as the measured data θ is taken as the center of each window this window size represents a compromise between phase resolution and experimental uncertainty force reconstruction using phase dependent coefficients is denoted by f h to preform this reconstruction we first calculate coefficients a θ and b θ from c d θ and c a θ respectively using 17 18 then a phase averaged reconstruction using phase dependent coefficients can be constructed at each phase θ n as 19 f h θ n a θ n z n z n b θ n z n 4 results we present results from all three plate scales in terms of phase invariant hydrodynamics phase dependent hydrodynamics and flow visualization in fig 4 a we see that phase invariant c d depends only on k c and is independent of r e β or geometric scale in the evaluated regimes consistent with the original findings of keulegan and carpenter 1958 for oscillating flat plates c d exhibits high values for low k c but approaches values typical of steady flow as k c increases in fig 4 b c a exhibits a scale independent linear region for k c 1 5 followed by a region with greater scale and frequency dependent variation that maintains r e independence keulegan and carpenter 1958 similarly find two trends in c a across their tests but do not explain why this change occurs fig 5 shows the degree to which a phase invariant force reconstruction f h deviates from the measured hydrodynamic force f h near the extremes in force where brown et al 2018 found poor agreement we observe that phase invariant coefficients accurately represent the hydrodynamics at all tested scales for k c 1 as the error in the peak force estimate is 10 or less error increases with k c and asymptotes around 25 for k c 2 this suggests that at higher k c a phase dependent decomposition may yield higher accuracy we focus our phase dependent analysis on two test cases representative of different characteristic regions in fig 4 b k c 0 5 representative of the linear region and k c 3 0 representative of the region of largest scale and frequency dependent variation in c a for k c 0 5 shown in fig 6 a c d θ is approximately equal to phase invariant c d except when the plate approaches zero velocity a region where drag force is negligible similarly c a θ is approximately equal to phase invariant c a throughout the cycle at larger k c shown in fig 6 b c d θ also behaves similarly to phase invariant c d while c a θ exhibits high variability potential flow theory anticipates no phase variability in c a but assumptions required for potential flow are increasingly violated with increased oscillation amplitude to assess the effectiveness of these two methods across k c we compare the phase averaged reconstructed hydrodynamic force using phase dependent and invariant coefficients f h and f h respectively with measured hydrodynamic force f h in fig 7 a k c 0 5 the reconstructions from both methods are in good agreement with f h this demonstrates that the morison equation effectively describes hydrodynamic forces for k c 1 and there is limited benefit to employing phase dependent coefficients under these conditions conversely phase invariant reconstruction departs from measured forces in fig 7 b k c 3 particularly during peak forces however f h continues to match f h indicating high c a θ variability shown in fig 6 b accurately parameterizes the inertial force for high oscillation amplitudes the contrast between consistent drag behavior and increased added mass variation as k c increases motivates a comparison of the magnitude of these terms in the overall hydrodynamic force fig 8 which shows the ratio of the root mean square rms drag f d θ and added mass f a θ forces from phase dependent coefficients demonstrates that added mass is dominant for low amplitude oscillations and remains so for all tests we conducted despite increasing c a and decreasing c d with increasing k c the relative contribution of drag increases for higher amplitude motions due to the quadratic dependence on velocity regardless the added mass term accounts for more than 50 of the hydrodynamic force for all k c tested and accounts for more than 75 of the hydrodynamic force at k c 1 this emphasizes the importance of correctly parameterizing added mass over the entire range of k c of operational interest for a qualitative look at the vortex dynamics in these flows we injected dye during oscillations of the 1 10 plate the image clarity i e lack of blurring in the phase averaged images of fig 9 indicates cycle to cycle consistency in the coherent flow structures consistent with the relatively small inter quartile ranges for phase dependent force coefficients fig 6 there is a clear evolution of vortex formation and shedding with distinctive differences between k c at each phase the change in phase invariant c a and the increased range of c a θ with increasing k c may suggest a weak link between vortex behavior and inertia as discussed by sarpkaya 2004 the morison equation cannot capture the vortex force which may be important for some k c however the vortex structures around the plate fig 9 suggest that such forces are present for an oscillating asymmetric heave plate and that the differences in vortex formation across k c are likely to affect morison equation fidelity we therefore present these images alongside phase dependent c a θ to show that while we expect added mass to maintain a constant value additional force is included by default in this acceleration dependent term the rise and fall of the resulting c a θ term is loosely linked to the growth and destruction of a vortex near the plate indicating vortex forces may be impacting the inertial term in a manner similar to a history or basset term sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 basset 1888 5 discussion 5 1 morison equation fidelity the similarity of f h f h and f h at k c 1 indicates that phase invariant coefficients accurately represent the hydrodynamic forces for small amplitude oscillations therefore the morison equation can be used to represent the time variation in hydrodynamic forces of an asymmetric heave plate in this region and any other forces e g the vortex force are negligible this is consistent with observations by sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 who note that vortex forces are not significant for cylinders in oscillatory flow at low k c similarly mcnown and keulegan 1959 identify a ratio of oscillation frequency to vortex shedding frequency above which separation and vortex shedding become important for k c 1 in our experiments the frequency ratio remains below this threshold such that we would not expect vortex forces to influence the hydrodynamics conversely for k c 3 phase invariant coefficients cannot accurately estimate the hydrodynamic force at some phases of oscillation including the phases where hydrodynamic force is at a maximum the phase dependent force reconstruction f h does track the hydrodynamic force demonstrating that a modified morison equation with phase dependent coefficients is able to predict hydrodynamic force throughout an oscillation as discussed extensively by sarpkaya 1996 2000 2001 2004 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 secondary forces such as the vortex force may depend on higher order terms beyond linear acceleration and quadratic velocity in our experiments secondary forces are seen to be parameterized primarily by c a θ because c d θ c d fig 9 generally shows vortex development while c a θ increases and vortex shedding while c a θ decreases while sarpkaya and others have described the vortex force by adding a third term to the morison equation and lighthill 1986 suggests that the vortex force should be parameterized with drag our results suggest that this force can be approximated by the two term morison equation with a phase dependent added mass coefficient for consistency with theory this might be better conceptualized as the sum of a phase invariant added mass coefficient and an additional phase dependent inertial coefficient along the lines of a history term or basset force 5 2 implications for wave energy wecs may be designed for a variety of sea states and operating conditions and heave plates may therefore experience a wide range of k c understanding the average and maximum forces present across sea states is key to the design and control of two body wecs as shown in table 1 our experiments spanned k c 0 1 to k c 7 0 while it is conceptually attractive to consider low k c values as representative of low energy sea states and high k c values as storm conditions the amplitude of heave plate motion depends strongly on the specific design of the wec and the control strategy employed with this in mind we contextualize our results to wave energy conversion specifically as part of the design validation for a two body wec a developer should evaluate and consider the impact of the k c regime on the fidelity of predicted hydrodynamics forces such a validation step is warranted regardless of heave plate geometry for low amplitude motions k c 1 phase invariant coefficients accurately describe the forces on an asymmetric heave plate while c d decreases rapidly as k c increases in this regime c a varies linearly over a small absolute range and inertial forces are dominant consequently heave plate hydrodynamic forces should be predicted with reasonable accuracy in this range using single value representations of c d and c a conversely error in force prediction using phase invariant coefficients increases with k c when k c 1 at higher k c c d asymptotically approaches a constant value however c a scatters above k c 2 with a weakly asymptotic scale dependent trend and in this regime inertial forces continue to dominate as a result while a narrow range of c d values would adequately parameterize drag forces we expect inertial forces in this regime to be more difficult to estimate particularly if obtained from scale model experiments our results show that for k c 1 we would under predict peak loads on an asymmetric heave plate by up to 30 if using phase invariant coefficients peak loads are important to wec development because they drive decisions about structural design and hence impact overall cost these results highlight a challenge for predicting loads on two body wecs when heave plate k c 1 a number of simulation tools are commonly used by wave energy developers including orcaflex orcina proteusds dsa and wec sim sandia and nrel while we have shown that hydrodynamic force is accurately reconstructed across all k c using phase dependent coefficients these tools have at best a limited ability to incorporate phase dependent coefficients and therefore cannot accurately represent peak forces for high amplitude motion of asymmetric heave plates further phase and scale invariant added mass coefficients in these simulations often rely on predictions from boundary element method bem solvers rather than physical measurements to contrast bem estimates with our experimental results we calculated added mass using nemoh an open source linear potential flow solver babarit and delhommeau 2015 for these calculations we conducted a mesh convergence study and took as representative the asymptotic added mass coefficient for simulations with greater than 700 panels the plate was submerged 20 m beneath the free surface deep water assumption for the 1 10 plate nemoh predicted an added mass coefficient of 0 58 with a similar value reproduced in wamit as shown in fig 9 this is lower than phase dependent and phase invariant c a values for all experiments since potential flow theory assumes irrotational flow this error in added mass could be anticipated from the vortical structures formed during oscillation there are indications that this under prediction of added mass is not improved by higher fidelity methods as mundon et al 2017 conclude that cfd similarly under predicts loads for an asymmetric reaction body further work by rosenberg and mundon 2016 demonstrated that despite its high computational cost cfd provides little to no improvement over bem continued efforts to improve these models are therefore critical and these challenges demonstrate the value of physical experiments to characterize added mass finally in the context of wave energy a few motivations exist for the use of a three dimensional asymmetric heave plate flat heave plates may experience a falling leaf motion with side to side motion during vertical oscillation as observed by our collaborators at mbari the asymmetric plate studied here limits that horizontal motion during the downstroke further anecdotal motivation for an asymmetric shape is potential snap load mitigation snap loading may occur when a wec uses a compliant connection between the surface float and heave plate if the heave plate descends more slowly than the float such that slack develops in the tether there is a large transient force when the tether returns to tension posing a risk of structural damage at the connection points by generating asymmetric hydrodynamics which provide less resistance during the downstroke a plate could reduce the probability of snap loading however as shown in fig 8 the inertial forces constitute the majority of hydrodynamic force for all k c tested and fig 7 demonstrates that added mass forces do not depend on the direction of plate motion c d θ is higher during the upstroke t 0 0 5 t than the downstroke fig 6 b but this difference is minor and the resulting hydrodynamic force is only weakly asymmetric our results suggest that while asymmetric heave plate geometry may reduce lateral motion during operation it is unlikely to significantly reduce the probability of snap loading 6 conclusions through experiments we have shown that phase invariant drag and added mass coefficients generally scale with k c for asymmetric heave plates this demonstrates that similar trends for cylinders and flat plates can be extended to novel asymmetric geometries further these results indicate that scale model experimental characterization of small scale heave plates produce phase invariant coefficients representative of larger plates using these coefficients to reconstruct hydrodynamic forces we demonstrate that coefficients associated with oscillations of k c 1 can be used to provide accurate force predictions consequently the two term morison equation with phase invariant coefficients is likely sufficient for estimating heave plate forces in this region of motion for k c 1 we show that phase invariant coefficients do not adequately describe the hydrodynamic force particularly during times of maximum loads this is primarily due to large deviations in c a θ from c a we therefore suggest that wec developers pay careful attention to the k c range of their heave plates and that commercial code developers consider supporting a modified form of the morison equation that allows a phase dependent inertial term finally our observations of a two term representation of oscillatory hydrodynamics ascribes error in the morison equation primarily to the inertial term flow visualization suggests that vortex development and shedding is loosely correlated with observed trends in c a θ this suggests that a phase varying inertial term accounting for deviation from c a may accurately account for the vortex forces on the plate this result may

21564,in oscillatory flow drag and inertial forces experienced by flat plates and cylinders depend on the keulegan carpenter number here we demonstrate that this extends to an asymmetric hexagonal conic heave plate suitable for a point absorber wave energy converter the forces on three geometric scales of this plate were measured throughout forced oscillation experiments in quiescent water from these measurements phase invariant and phase dependent coefficients of drag and added mass are calculated using the morison equation for low amplitude oscillations the total force experienced by the plate is well described by phase invariant coefficients that scale with the keulegan carpenter number however for larger oscillations maximum forces are better described by phase dependent coefficients flow visualization is used to interpret the phase variations keywords oscillatory flow wave energy added mass heave plates 1 introduction conversion of ocean surface waves to mechanical power has seen renewed interest in recent years falnes 2007 one of the major wave energy converter wec archetypes is a point absorber which generates power from the differential motion between two bodies shown in fig 1 in shallow water the second body can be the seabed but as water depth increases it is economically advantageous to use a heave plate either rigidly or compliantly connected to the wave forced body for such systems knowledge of the heave plate hydrodynamics is critical to predict the overall device response while these hydrodynamics are well studied for flat heave plates asymmetric plates which are employed in a few recent wec designs remain poorly characterized the foundations of relevant ocean engineering knowledge in this area were laid down more than 100 years ago in work by stokes 1851 and basset 1888 oscillatory hydrodynamic forces are traditionally decomposed into two components a quadratic drag force and a linear inertial force morison et al 1950 this description referred to as the morison equation is applicable to a range of objects cylinders flat plates and conditions cyclic wave motion oscillation in quiescent water in their seminal work keulegan and carpenter 1958 used the morison equation to estimate coefficients of drag and added mass for cylinders and flat plates fixed in oscillatory flow they found that both coefficients varied with a non dimensional parameter now known as the keulegan carpenter number k c here we apply similar techniques to investigate hydrodynamic forces on asymmetric plates at three different scales the link between vortex dynamics and hydrodynamic force in oscillatory flow is an active area of research mcnown and keulegan 1959 observed a correlation between vortex shedding and hydrodynamic coefficients while investigating the wake created by bodies submerged in oscillatory flow more recently tao and thiagarajan 2003b a evaluated vortex dynamics through direct numerical simulation and identified three vortex shedding modes dependent on k c and a frequency parameter they related changes in the relationship between the damping coefficient drag varying linearly with velocity rather than with its square and k c to transitions between vortex shedding modes sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 also related changes in hydrodynamics across k c to changing vortex dynamics they showed that the morison equation adequately described hydrodynamics at relatively low and high k c for intermediate k c a third force component the vortex force was needed to describe the hydrodynamic force since the vortex force depends on prior flow states it can be thought of as flow memory that is not captured by either the classical drag or inertia term sarpkaya 2001 further sarpkaya noted that a vortex force contains components proportional to both velocity squared and linear acceleration making it difficult to separate from drag and added mass terms in a morison equation decomposition sarpkaya 2004 while basset included a third force in his formulation of oscillatory hydrodynamics basset 1888 sarpkaya concluded that its complexity is excessive and that the morison equation is sufficient for many ocean engineering problems sarpkaya 2004 2001 1996 as such we focus our analysis on a morison equation decomposition of total force into drag and inertia utilizing flow visualization to assess vortex dynamics specific to our application two studies by garrido mendoza et al inform our experimental approach the authors first used numerical methods garrido mendoza et al 2014 to analyze added mass and damping coefficients as a function of plate submergence depth both coefficients were increased when oscillations occurred near a seabed or free surface and damping coefficients were related to enstrophy the integral of vorticity over a surface in subsequent work garrido mendoza et al 2015 the authors used flow visualization and force measurements from experiments to validate the numerical simulation these studies concluded that submergence depths at least one diameter from a surface led to results identical to those observed at greater depths recent work by bezunartea et al 2019 calculated drag quadratic velocity dependence and added mass coefficients for three scales of flat heave plates coefficients of drag and added mass were independent of frequency and scale and dependent on k c further they showed that the damping coefficient is both scale and frequency dependent this motivates our focus on using a quadratic rather than linear drag parameterization in this analysis beatty et al 2015 applied these principles to wecs demonstrating that a heave plate could increase the added mass of a single body point absorber and increase the period of peak power production aligning it with the wave period targeted for operation for two body point absorbers with compliantly coupled heave plates heave plate hydrodynamics have been partially explored brown et al 2018 characterized the hydrodynamics of both asymmetric and flat heave plates under forced oscillation they found that for k c experienced by heave plates in the range of wave conditions tested drag and added mass depended on k c and the frequency of oscillation further they noted that when the morison equation was used to reconstruct hydrodynamic force peak forces important to the design of wecs were underestimated here we build on those results to explore the hydrodynamics of an asymmetric heave plate at three geometric scales using forced oscillation experiments in doing so we have two objectives the first is to establish how parameterizations of the hydrodynamic forces added mass and drag scale with motion for an asymmetric heave plate the second is to evaluate the fidelity of possible representations of these forces across the range of tested cases we investigate scale dependence of phase invariant drag and added mass coefficients estimated from the morison equation then we use a windowed morison equation to estimate phase dependent coefficients that for some k c are shown to provide a better description of hydrodynamic force we conclude with a discussion of the implication of these results for wec design 2 background throughout this work we describe the force balance as a function of oscillation amplitude for a plate in sinusoidal motion following convention we utilize the non dimensional parameter relating flow velocity and oscillation period to plate diameter this period parameter was defined by keulegan and carpenter 1958 as 1 u m t d where u m is the maximum velocity experienced in an oscillation t is the period of oscillation and d is the plate s characteristic length or diameter since our heave plates are non circular we define an effective diameter as the diameter of a disk with the same area projected in the direction of oscillation as the heave plate for a sinusoidal oscillation of amplitude a heave plate position z can be written as a function of time as 2 z a cos 2 π t t taking the derivative of position to obtain velocity we can see by substitution that we can express u m in terms of a and t as 3 u m 2 π a t combining 1 and 3 the period parameter now referred to as the keulegan carpenter number k c becomes a ratio of the oscillation amplitude to the plate diameter as 4 k c 2 π a d additionally the roshko number r o or β is a non dimensional oscillation frequency and relates k c to the reynolds number r e tao and thiagarajan 2003a as 5 r o β d 2 f ν 6 r e u m d ν 7 r e k c β 2 π a d d 2 1 t ν 2 π a d ν t where f is the oscillation frequency in rad s and ν is the kinematic fluid viscosity in m2 s from 1 it is also apparent that k c is the inverse of the strouhal number we use these non dimensional coefficients to assess the scaling of heave plate hydrodynamics first we use the morison equation morison et al 1950 morison 1953 to decompose the total hydrodynamic force f h on a heave plate into a drag force f d and added mass force f a as 8 f h f d f a the non dimensional coefficient of drag c d is then defined as 9 c d f d 1 8 ρ π d 2 z z where ρ is the water density and z is the flow velocity past the heave plate if the heave plate is oscillating in quiescent water this is generally taken to be the velocity of the plate though we note this is a simplification when the plate is oscillating in its own wake the added mass force represents the force from the acceleration of water surrounding the heave plate and the coefficient of added mass c a is defined as 10 c a f a 1 6 ρ π d 3 z where z represents the acceleration of the heave plate through quiescent water the quantity π d 3 6 represents the volume of a sphere with the same effective diameter as the heave plate c a therefore represents the fraction of the mass of that hypothetical sphere accelerated by the heave plate this volume is arbitrarily used for flat plates and we extend its use to this asymmetric shape using these definitions we can combine 8 9 and 10 to express the hydrodynamic force as 11 f h 1 8 ρ π d 2 c d z z 1 6 ρ π d 3 c a z 3 methods 3 1 experimental setup we perform a series of experiments on hexagonal conic heave plates at three different sizes using three experimental setups the full scale plate shown in fig 2 a has an effective diameter of 2 72 m and is referenced as the 1 1 scale plate since it is the largest plate in this study the two smaller plates shown in fig 2 b have effective diameters of 0 54 m and 0 27 m we refer to these as 1 5 and 1 10 scale models respectively critical dimensions for the three plates are reported in fig 2 c the three plates were forced in sinusoidal oscillation in quiescent water and forces were measured using an in line load cell the general layout of experimental setups is given in fig 1 alongside the wec it emulates as described subsequently each heave plate scale was tested in a different facility during testing oscillation amplitude and period varied to cover a relatively wide overlapping range of k c β and r e as shown in table 1 allowing us to validate conclusions across both scale and facility the monterey bay aquarium research institute s mbari test tank fig 2 a was used to characterize the full scale plate the tank is 12 m deep 9 m wide and 14 m long a hydraulic ram with a 1 8 m stroke length is centered above the tank and actuates the heave plate using feedback position control it is capable of 1 27 m s speeds with a maximum force of 2 7 kn we measured force with a honeywell model 45 load cell which has a maximum rating of 44 kn and resolution of 22 n force and ram position were recorded at a rate of 200 hz during testing the plate hung from the ram by chain and oscillation parameters were chosen to maintain chain tension throughout each test load cell sensitivity determined the minimum experimental amplitude and frequency the 1 5 and 1 10 scale models were tested at the university of washington s applied physics laboratory dock using a modified setup from brown et al 2018 a belt drive linear actuator mounted at the dock s edge prescribes sinusoidal oscillations using feedback position control from the carriage of the belt driven actuator a futek stl s beam load cell with a 2 2 kn rating connects to a rigid driving rod which suspends the plate 1 25 m beneath the free surface as with the mbari testing force and position were recorded at 200 hz oscillation parameters are limited by maximum actuator speed 0 65 m s and the signal to noise ratio of the load cell which required that period decrease with amplitude to maintain acceptable data quality particularly for the 1 10 scale model the 1 10 scale model was also tested in a laboratory tank at the university of washington measuring 1 5 m deep and 1 3 x 1 3 m across a ball screw linear actuator mounts above the center of the tank and a rigid driving rod suspends the plate beneath the water surface velocity feedback control prescribes sinusoidal motion with a maximum stroke of 40 cm and speed of 0 65 m s an example of the commanded and realized position velocity and acceleration for this system is shown in fig 3 and demonstrates that the measured profile largely tracks the command aberrations at θ 0 and θ 0 5 result from mechanical backlash around zero velocity and exhibit no apparent effect on the calculated coefficients a 0 24 kn 6 axis submersible load cell ati mini 40 was installed at the interface between the heave plate and bottom of the driving rod this acrylic tank was also used for flow visualization by releasing dye at the inside edge of the heave plate rim and capturing imagery at 60 frames per second with a camera nikon d3200 hd slr to enhance dye visibility processed images use only the blue color channel with the dynamic range truncated by matlab s imagesc function images are grouped by phase and averaged over realizations from five oscillations 3 2 data analysis each experimental setup produces a time series of position and force we analyze the hydrodynamic forces assuming both phase invariant and phase dependent behavior and then assess the effectiveness of both approaches we isolate quasi steady oscillations neglecting startup in quiescent water before analysis tests using the dockside oscillator use sine waves with ramp up and ramp down periods which are discarded leaving 40 oscillations for analysis tests in the mbari tank and the uw test tank were limited to seven oscillations to minimize reflections so oscillations use negative cosine waves with no ramp up or ramp down period by removing the first oscillation six quasi steady oscillations remain for analysis the first step is to isolate the hydrodynamic force from the force measured by the load cells measured force is filtered using a low pass iir filter with a 7 hz passband frequency 10 hz stopband frequency and 60 hz stopband attenuation for all three facilities weight inertia and buoyancy of the heave plates must be accounted for and for the mbari tank and the dockside oscillator so must the chain and driving rod by deducting the force of inertia f i weight f w and buoyancy f b from the filtered measured force f m e a s u r e d we calculate the hydrodynamic force acting on the plate as 12 f h t f m e a s u r e d t f i t f w f b t the inertial force is estimated as 13 f i t z t m h p m r o d where m h p and m r o d are heave plate and driving rod masses respectively heave plate acceleration z is calculated by twice differentiating heave plate position z t f w is the product of m h p and m r o d with gravity the buoyancy force is given as 14 f b t ρ g v h p v r o d t where v h p and v r o d are the submerged volumes of the heave plate and driving rod this volume changes throughout each oscillation respectively ρ is water density and g is acceleration due to gravity consequently the hydrodynamic force is given from measured force as 15 f h t f m e a s u r e d t z t m h p m r o d g m h p m r o d ρ g v h p v r o d t the hydrodynamic force time series 11 can be expressed compactly by representing inertial and drag terms with two constants a and b as 16 f h t 1 f h t 2 a z 1 z 1 z 2 z 2 b z 1 z 2 h i which can be solved for a and b using a least squares regression following this decomposition the coefficient of drag is then 17 c d a 1 8 ρ π d 2 and the coefficient of added mass is 18 c a b 1 6 ρ π d 3 phase invariant coefficients of drag and added mass are calculated from 16 using time series data from all quasi steady oscillations as noted by sarpkaya 2004 the hydrodynamic force may not be adequately described by only added mass and drag for some k c consequently we evaluated the accuracy of this decomposition by reconstructing the force time series i e treating f h as the unknown in 16 and taking a and b as known constants comparison of this reconstructed approximation f h to the measured f h can identify portions of an oscillation where the morison equation is inadequate we focus on error in reconstruction of peak forces which is the average of the normalized deviation between f h and f h at the 95th and 5th percentiles all time series data has been phase averaged oscillation phase θ is defined as θ t t where θ 0 corresponds to the minimum oscillatory position as shown in fig 3 a phase bins with a width of 0 01 t are used for averaging we calculate phase dependent coefficients of drag c d θ and added mass c a θ these coefficients are calculated from unfiltered measured force using 16 by partitioning the time series into windows of width 0 1 t overlapping such that c d θ and c a θ maintain the same sampling rate as the measured data θ is taken as the center of each window this window size represents a compromise between phase resolution and experimental uncertainty force reconstruction using phase dependent coefficients is denoted by f h to preform this reconstruction we first calculate coefficients a θ and b θ from c d θ and c a θ respectively using 17 18 then a phase averaged reconstruction using phase dependent coefficients can be constructed at each phase θ n as 19 f h θ n a θ n z n z n b θ n z n 4 results we present results from all three plate scales in terms of phase invariant hydrodynamics phase dependent hydrodynamics and flow visualization in fig 4 a we see that phase invariant c d depends only on k c and is independent of r e β or geometric scale in the evaluated regimes consistent with the original findings of keulegan and carpenter 1958 for oscillating flat plates c d exhibits high values for low k c but approaches values typical of steady flow as k c increases in fig 4 b c a exhibits a scale independent linear region for k c 1 5 followed by a region with greater scale and frequency dependent variation that maintains r e independence keulegan and carpenter 1958 similarly find two trends in c a across their tests but do not explain why this change occurs fig 5 shows the degree to which a phase invariant force reconstruction f h deviates from the measured hydrodynamic force f h near the extremes in force where brown et al 2018 found poor agreement we observe that phase invariant coefficients accurately represent the hydrodynamics at all tested scales for k c 1 as the error in the peak force estimate is 10 or less error increases with k c and asymptotes around 25 for k c 2 this suggests that at higher k c a phase dependent decomposition may yield higher accuracy we focus our phase dependent analysis on two test cases representative of different characteristic regions in fig 4 b k c 0 5 representative of the linear region and k c 3 0 representative of the region of largest scale and frequency dependent variation in c a for k c 0 5 shown in fig 6 a c d θ is approximately equal to phase invariant c d except when the plate approaches zero velocity a region where drag force is negligible similarly c a θ is approximately equal to phase invariant c a throughout the cycle at larger k c shown in fig 6 b c d θ also behaves similarly to phase invariant c d while c a θ exhibits high variability potential flow theory anticipates no phase variability in c a but assumptions required for potential flow are increasingly violated with increased oscillation amplitude to assess the effectiveness of these two methods across k c we compare the phase averaged reconstructed hydrodynamic force using phase dependent and invariant coefficients f h and f h respectively with measured hydrodynamic force f h in fig 7 a k c 0 5 the reconstructions from both methods are in good agreement with f h this demonstrates that the morison equation effectively describes hydrodynamic forces for k c 1 and there is limited benefit to employing phase dependent coefficients under these conditions conversely phase invariant reconstruction departs from measured forces in fig 7 b k c 3 particularly during peak forces however f h continues to match f h indicating high c a θ variability shown in fig 6 b accurately parameterizes the inertial force for high oscillation amplitudes the contrast between consistent drag behavior and increased added mass variation as k c increases motivates a comparison of the magnitude of these terms in the overall hydrodynamic force fig 8 which shows the ratio of the root mean square rms drag f d θ and added mass f a θ forces from phase dependent coefficients demonstrates that added mass is dominant for low amplitude oscillations and remains so for all tests we conducted despite increasing c a and decreasing c d with increasing k c the relative contribution of drag increases for higher amplitude motions due to the quadratic dependence on velocity regardless the added mass term accounts for more than 50 of the hydrodynamic force for all k c tested and accounts for more than 75 of the hydrodynamic force at k c 1 this emphasizes the importance of correctly parameterizing added mass over the entire range of k c of operational interest for a qualitative look at the vortex dynamics in these flows we injected dye during oscillations of the 1 10 plate the image clarity i e lack of blurring in the phase averaged images of fig 9 indicates cycle to cycle consistency in the coherent flow structures consistent with the relatively small inter quartile ranges for phase dependent force coefficients fig 6 there is a clear evolution of vortex formation and shedding with distinctive differences between k c at each phase the change in phase invariant c a and the increased range of c a θ with increasing k c may suggest a weak link between vortex behavior and inertia as discussed by sarpkaya 2004 the morison equation cannot capture the vortex force which may be important for some k c however the vortex structures around the plate fig 9 suggest that such forces are present for an oscillating asymmetric heave plate and that the differences in vortex formation across k c are likely to affect morison equation fidelity we therefore present these images alongside phase dependent c a θ to show that while we expect added mass to maintain a constant value additional force is included by default in this acceleration dependent term the rise and fall of the resulting c a θ term is loosely linked to the growth and destruction of a vortex near the plate indicating vortex forces may be impacting the inertial term in a manner similar to a history or basset term sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 basset 1888 5 discussion 5 1 morison equation fidelity the similarity of f h f h and f h at k c 1 indicates that phase invariant coefficients accurately represent the hydrodynamic forces for small amplitude oscillations therefore the morison equation can be used to represent the time variation in hydrodynamic forces of an asymmetric heave plate in this region and any other forces e g the vortex force are negligible this is consistent with observations by sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 who note that vortex forces are not significant for cylinders in oscillatory flow at low k c similarly mcnown and keulegan 1959 identify a ratio of oscillation frequency to vortex shedding frequency above which separation and vortex shedding become important for k c 1 in our experiments the frequency ratio remains below this threshold such that we would not expect vortex forces to influence the hydrodynamics conversely for k c 3 phase invariant coefficients cannot accurately estimate the hydrodynamic force at some phases of oscillation including the phases where hydrodynamic force is at a maximum the phase dependent force reconstruction f h does track the hydrodynamic force demonstrating that a modified morison equation with phase dependent coefficients is able to predict hydrodynamic force throughout an oscillation as discussed extensively by sarpkaya 1996 2000 2001 2004 sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 secondary forces such as the vortex force may depend on higher order terms beyond linear acceleration and quadratic velocity in our experiments secondary forces are seen to be parameterized primarily by c a θ because c d θ c d fig 9 generally shows vortex development while c a θ increases and vortex shedding while c a θ decreases while sarpkaya and others have described the vortex force by adding a third term to the morison equation and lighthill 1986 suggests that the vortex force should be parameterized with drag our results suggest that this force can be approximated by the two term morison equation with a phase dependent added mass coefficient for consistency with theory this might be better conceptualized as the sum of a phase invariant added mass coefficient and an additional phase dependent inertial coefficient along the lines of a history term or basset force 5 2 implications for wave energy wecs may be designed for a variety of sea states and operating conditions and heave plates may therefore experience a wide range of k c understanding the average and maximum forces present across sea states is key to the design and control of two body wecs as shown in table 1 our experiments spanned k c 0 1 to k c 7 0 while it is conceptually attractive to consider low k c values as representative of low energy sea states and high k c values as storm conditions the amplitude of heave plate motion depends strongly on the specific design of the wec and the control strategy employed with this in mind we contextualize our results to wave energy conversion specifically as part of the design validation for a two body wec a developer should evaluate and consider the impact of the k c regime on the fidelity of predicted hydrodynamics forces such a validation step is warranted regardless of heave plate geometry for low amplitude motions k c 1 phase invariant coefficients accurately describe the forces on an asymmetric heave plate while c d decreases rapidly as k c increases in this regime c a varies linearly over a small absolute range and inertial forces are dominant consequently heave plate hydrodynamic forces should be predicted with reasonable accuracy in this range using single value representations of c d and c a conversely error in force prediction using phase invariant coefficients increases with k c when k c 1 at higher k c c d asymptotically approaches a constant value however c a scatters above k c 2 with a weakly asymptotic scale dependent trend and in this regime inertial forces continue to dominate as a result while a narrow range of c d values would adequately parameterize drag forces we expect inertial forces in this regime to be more difficult to estimate particularly if obtained from scale model experiments our results show that for k c 1 we would under predict peak loads on an asymmetric heave plate by up to 30 if using phase invariant coefficients peak loads are important to wec development because they drive decisions about structural design and hence impact overall cost these results highlight a challenge for predicting loads on two body wecs when heave plate k c 1 a number of simulation tools are commonly used by wave energy developers including orcaflex orcina proteusds dsa and wec sim sandia and nrel while we have shown that hydrodynamic force is accurately reconstructed across all k c using phase dependent coefficients these tools have at best a limited ability to incorporate phase dependent coefficients and therefore cannot accurately represent peak forces for high amplitude motion of asymmetric heave plates further phase and scale invariant added mass coefficients in these simulations often rely on predictions from boundary element method bem solvers rather than physical measurements to contrast bem estimates with our experimental results we calculated added mass using nemoh an open source linear potential flow solver babarit and delhommeau 2015 for these calculations we conducted a mesh convergence study and took as representative the asymptotic added mass coefficient for simulations with greater than 700 panels the plate was submerged 20 m beneath the free surface deep water assumption for the 1 10 plate nemoh predicted an added mass coefficient of 0 58 with a similar value reproduced in wamit as shown in fig 9 this is lower than phase dependent and phase invariant c a values for all experiments since potential flow theory assumes irrotational flow this error in added mass could be anticipated from the vortical structures formed during oscillation there are indications that this under prediction of added mass is not improved by higher fidelity methods as mundon et al 2017 conclude that cfd similarly under predicts loads for an asymmetric reaction body further work by rosenberg and mundon 2016 demonstrated that despite its high computational cost cfd provides little to no improvement over bem continued efforts to improve these models are therefore critical and these challenges demonstrate the value of physical experiments to characterize added mass finally in the context of wave energy a few motivations exist for the use of a three dimensional asymmetric heave plate flat heave plates may experience a falling leaf motion with side to side motion during vertical oscillation as observed by our collaborators at mbari the asymmetric plate studied here limits that horizontal motion during the downstroke further anecdotal motivation for an asymmetric shape is potential snap load mitigation snap loading may occur when a wec uses a compliant connection between the surface float and heave plate if the heave plate descends more slowly than the float such that slack develops in the tether there is a large transient force when the tether returns to tension posing a risk of structural damage at the connection points by generating asymmetric hydrodynamics which provide less resistance during the downstroke a plate could reduce the probability of snap loading however as shown in fig 8 the inertial forces constitute the majority of hydrodynamic force for all k c tested and fig 7 demonstrates that added mass forces do not depend on the direction of plate motion c d θ is higher during the upstroke t 0 0 5 t than the downstroke fig 6 b but this difference is minor and the resulting hydrodynamic force is only weakly asymmetric our results suggest that while asymmetric heave plate geometry may reduce lateral motion during operation it is unlikely to significantly reduce the probability of snap loading 6 conclusions through experiments we have shown that phase invariant drag and added mass coefficients generally scale with k c for asymmetric heave plates this demonstrates that similar trends for cylinders and flat plates can be extended to novel asymmetric geometries further these results indicate that scale model experimental characterization of small scale heave plates produce phase invariant coefficients representative of larger plates using these coefficients to reconstruct hydrodynamic forces we demonstrate that coefficients associated with oscillations of k c 1 can be used to provide accurate force predictions consequently the two term morison equation with phase invariant coefficients is likely sufficient for estimating heave plate forces in this region of motion for k c 1 we show that phase invariant coefficients do not adequately describe the hydrodynamic force particularly during times of maximum loads this is primarily due to large deviations in c a θ from c a we therefore suggest that wec developers pay careful attention to the k c range of their heave plates and that commercial code developers consider supporting a modified form of the morison equation that allows a phase dependent inertial term finally our observations of a two term representation of oscillatory hydrodynamics ascribes error in the morison equation primarily to the inertial term flow visualization suggests that vortex development and shedding is loosely correlated with observed trends in c a θ this suggests that a phase varying inertial term accounting for deviation from c a may accurately account for the vortex forces on the plate this result may
