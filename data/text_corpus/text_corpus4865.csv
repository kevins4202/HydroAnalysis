24325,from an evolutionary perspective it is inferred that termites evolved to build tunneling patterns in a way that optimizes search and transport efficiency so far there have been many studies on search efficiency but few studies on transport efficiency due to the difficulty of direct observation under the field condition to overcome the difficulty we developed an individual based model to simulate the transport process the model was characterized by four variables 1 the frequency of food transfer p t 2 the loss of food during transfer p l 3 the effect of tunnel curvature p c and 4 the number of individuals participating in the transport n 0 we explored the effect of the variables on the efficiency of food transport e when the distance between the food site and the nest was short food transport with p t 0 was advantageous for high e whereas for long and narrow tunnels with high traffic jam frequency transport with p t 0 could be rather advantageous for the increase of e another finding was that p t had the greatest effect on e followed by p l and third on p c n 0 had the least impact in the discussion section we discussed strategies that termites could take to optimize e with respect to the findings and presented ideas worth exploring experimentally in addition we briefly mentioned how the model could be improved to be more realistic keywords termites food transportation efficiency foraging efficiency traffic jam individual based model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction social insects such as ants and termites build foraging networks such as chemically marked foraging trails or physically established tunnel network to find and transport food resources campora and grace 2004 tschinkel 2011 some subterranean termites such as coptotermes forage resources hundreds of meters away from the nest king and spink 1969 su and scheffrahn 1988 commuting between the nest and foraging sites is energetically costly so that strategic distribution of time and energy to search for and transport food in such long pathway will be necessary to optimize costs and benefits in foraging lee et al 2007 since subterranean termites find food resources by soil excavation and transport food through the excavated network the foraging efficiency of subterranean termites is composed of two different efficiencies food searching and transportation efficiency lee et al 2007 lee and su 2009 among two different efficiencies the food searching efficiency has been historically paid much attention due to practical need for termite pest controls by investigating tunnel geometry hedlund and henderson 1999 campora and grace 2001 puche and su 2001 lee et al 2006 analysis on tunnel formation in subterranean termites revealed that termites construct an optimized foraging tunnels to avoid food finding failures while maximizing food finding opportunities campora and grace 2001 lee et al 2006 in fact the tunnel patterns of reticulitermes flavipes kollar and coptotermes formosanus shiraki showed similarities with the morphology of plant root systems which have fractal patterns a feature common to other natural structures such as coastlines and mountains puche and su 2001 which is known to be efficient for material flow or resource transportation coleman and vassilicos 2008 sun et al 2018 exploration of the foraging behavior of subterranean termites has been carried out for over decades however the research on the food search process which is a part of the exploration has been conducted for a shorter period and in particular has been mainly done by geometric analysis of tunnel patterns rather than observation of individual behavior this resulted in fragmentary information on the efficiency of food transport in subterranean termites unlike the food search behavior the food transport behavior is difficult to explore due to various factors heterogeneous distribution of individuals du et al 2017 su et al 2017 time allocation for food finding lee et al 2021 tunnel structure lee et al 2006 and individual walking speed ku et al 2013 sim and lee 2013 among them the way of transporting food to the nest can greatly affect the efficiency of food transport however it is currently unknown which modes of transportation are performed by subterranean termites in general it was suggested that three different behaviors in food transportation could exist in social insects 1 individual transportation with direct deposition by an individual from the foraging site to the nest 2 bucket brigades with direct transfer from one worker to another when they encounter each other in the pathway and 3 multistage partitioned tasks with indirect transfer of which workers transport and drop food off somewhere in the foraging trails which will be picked up by other workers anderson et al 2002 although they have not been observed in food transportation bucket brigades have been observed in subterranean termites to transport excavated soil particles when tunneling lee et al 2020 mizumoto et al 2020 a theoretical study showed that bucket brigades in the transportation of food items could be advantageous if the foraging trail is narrow and long anderson et al 2002 considering that subterranean termites forage long distances king and spink 1969 su and scheffrahn 1988 the tunnel has a relatively narrow width 4 5 mm that only 4 individuals can pass through at the same time campora and grace 2004 they may choose the bucket brigade mode however food transportation efficiency in subterranean termites is poorly understood in this study we developed an individual based model to simulate these two processes at the individual level in order to compare the bucket brigade and direct transport processes in terms of efficiency the model includes simulating the interaction between termites and the curvature of the tunnel as well as the process of transporting food through simulating contact between termites and the process of food loss occurring during transport our goal was to identify potential strategies that termites could employ to maximize the efficiency of food transport based on the results obtained from this exploration 2 model description and analysis 2 1 individual based model description we built an individual based model to simulate the food transportation behavior of termites each simulated termite occupied one grid cell and the signal processing process between termites using pheromones was excluded from the fact that the number of simulated termites is constant during the food transportation and all simulated termites participate in the transportation the simulated termites were also prevented from digging new tunnels while traveling within the tunnels in this regard the tunneling prohibition rule can be interpreted as a homogeneous soil condition since the homogeneity contributes to preventing the formation of wall irregularities in particular we deliberately excluded the variable for the growth of the tunnel gallery in order to focus on the food transport efficiency in this study the simulation was repeated 15 times for the combinational conditions of variable values for a given period t 10 000 and the results were statistically averaged 2 2 termite tunnel in a space composed of 1 000 grid cells we built the tunnel using the function y 20sin πx 500 x 0 1 2 1 000 when the function y was drawn on the grid space we selected the cells through which the y curve passes as the grid cells constituting the tunnel we also did not consider branching tunnels in this model the function contains two regions of high curvature one of which is within 1000 grid lengths along the x axis a one period tunnel shape is easier to analyze for the effect of curvature than a shape with multiple periods continuous x y coordinate values were used for the location data of the grid constituting the tunnel and the tunnel width was expressed as one grid since high tunnel curvature caused a decrease in termite walking speed in subterranean termites sim and lee 2013 sim et al 2015 we set the tunnel sections corresponding to the two ranges on the x axis 235 265 and 735 765 as the high curvature section to reflect the speed change with tunnel curvature fig 1 a and b when a simulated termite passed through the range we generated a random number between 0 and 1 for each step if the random number was greater than the given p c 0 1 0 2 1 0 the simulated termite proceeded and stopped if it was less than or equal to p c therefore p c characterizes the effect of tunnel curvature on termite walking behavior due to the physical heterogeneity of the soil size of soil particles moisture concentration etc and soil organisms the actual termite tunnel wall is likely to have irregularities lee et al 2008 the irregularities reduce the traveling efficiency of termites in the tunnel fig 1c ku et al 2012 furthermore termites also cause a time delay when passing through the pores formed between soil particles contributing to a decrease in the efficiency fig 1d ku et al 2013 to implement the termite behavior mentioned in the model we let the simulated termites that found irregularities in the tunnel or soil pores stay there for 20 time steps preliminary studies showed little change in simulation results for the stay time of 10 to 30 time steps cases with longer stay times were not considered in this study in this model we evenly distributed 20 irregularity sites on the tunnel in the simulation model we placed a food site at one end and the other was a nest a sufficient number of food particles at the food site was placed in the model and termites can move only one food particle at a time initially t 0 n 0 30 40 130 simulated termites were randomly placed in the tunnel 2 3 food transportation behavior of simulated termites in the transport process when a simulated termite with food encounters another termite without food the food transfer process is triggered according to the probability of food transfer p t 0 0 0 1 1 0 fig 2 this is accompanied by food loss p l 0 0 0 03 0 3 in fig 2a the red circles represent individuals with a food particle and red semicircles represent individuals with food lost by the p l value food transfer only occurs between individuals facing each other fig 2b if an individual encounters two or more approaching individuals facing each other one of the approaching individuals is randomly selected and food transfer is performed fig 2c on the other hand the food transfer process does not work when individuals with food meet each other two individuals participating in the process of transferring food reverse the direction of their movement while individuals not transferring food pass each other without interaction if a simulated termite drops one food particle into the nest without loss p l 0 the amount of food accumulated in the nest is quantified as 1 on the other hand when a food particle that has suffered n losses arrives at the nest the amount of food is accumulated as a value of 1 n p l if the amount of the food is negative it is considered as zero in this regard we defined the food transportation efficiency e as follows 1 e τ s t 1 τ f o o d t τ n 0 here food t represents the number of food particles dropped to the nest at time t and n 0 is the number of termites participating in food transport s is a scaling factor with a value of 10 000 which prevents e from becoming too small to simplify the representation of the values of the three variables p c p t and p l we set the relation p c k 1 1 0 05 p t k 2 1 0 05 and p l k 3 1 0 03 and expressed the variable values as k 1 k 2 and k 3 1 2 11 respectively 2 4 traffic jam to experimentally observe how termites behave when facing each other through a narrow tunnel we made an artificial tunnel 2 mm or 3 mm wide and 100 mm long on a sand substrate we observed that some termites often stop depending on the surrounding conditions in some cases the individuals behind the detained individuals stopped in succession and in other cases they turned their bodies vertically to pass through the space between the stopped individuals and the tunnel wall stop time ranged from a few seconds to more than 5 min in this study we refer to the termite stopping behavior as a traffic jam although it is somewhat different from the car traffic jam on the road to the best of our knowledge there have been few quantitative studies of the termite traffic jam we termed in field conditions but it would be reasonable to infer that there may be narrow and densely populated sections where traffic jams can occur within a termite tunnel network a detailed study on this would probably be interesting however we excluded further discussion of traffic jams so as not to obscure the focus of this study to implement the traffic jam in the model we established the rule that a traffic jam occurs when four simulated termites at a grid site overlap spatially and the sum of their movement direction vectors is zero fig 3 when the traffic jam occurred at a site the four individuals stayed at the site for 100 time steps without interacting with other individuals 2 5 sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of the four variables p t p c p l and n 0 on the food transportation efficiency e we used the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc method a global sensitivity analysis known as a reliable sampling based method marino et al 2008 to obtain the prcc we calculated the correlation coefficient cc between input x j and output y as follows 2 cc x j y i 1 n x i j x y i y i 1 n x i j x 2 1 n y i y 2 j 1 2 k here n and k represent the number of samples and the size of the input vector respectively x represents one or another of the four parameters p c p t p l or n 0 and y refers to the efficiency e the partial correlation coefficient pcc removing the linear influence of other variables measures how strong the linear relationship is between the input x j and the output y is in other words the pcc between x j and y is defined as the cc of x j x j and y y therefore x j and y are described by the following linear regression model 3 x j c 0 p 1 p j n c p x p a n d y b 0 p 1 p j n b p x p where b and c represent the regression coefficients and hat represents the regression fitted variable prcc calculates the partial correlation using the linear regression model shown in eq 3 this calculation is performed on the data transformed by ranks x j and y the value of prcc is between 1 and 1 a positive negative value indicates a positive negative correlation between the parameter and the model output a positive value of prcc indicates a positive effect on the y output value while a negative number indicates a negative contribution to the output a larger absolute prcc value indicates a greater correlation between the parameter and the output in this study we used the lhs latin hypercube sampling method to avoid repetitive sampling as one of the layered sampling methods mckay et al 1979 this method has the advantage of significantly reducing the number of simulations compared to the existing monte carlo method iman and helton 1988 we performed 219 615 simulations of 11 11 11 11 14 641 combinations of the four variables each replicated 15 times for the calculation of eqs 2 and 3 the prcc function provided in the 2021a version of matlab was used 3 results to clearly show how the number of particles transported by a simulated termite increases with different values of k 2 we calculated the value of e after removing τ from the denominator of eq 1 considering the τ as expected we can see that the e values saturated with time see inset in fig 4 in the absence of food loss e increased linearly regardless of pt in the region t simulation time 1500 see red dotted line in fig 4 this is how termites transport small amounts of food in short tunnels however when the food transport process lasted longer t 1500 pl 0 15 e decreased significantly with increasing pt fig 4b we then investigated the effects of variables on e by testing the combinatorial conditions of p c p t p l and n 0 we found that e values decreased with increasing p l regardless of p c and p t fig 5 when the number of individuals participating in food transportation was small n 0 30 and there was no food loss p l 0 little effects of p c and p t were also observed as no clear pattern was found in the contours of e values fig 5 however the p c effect became evident when n 0 was high n 0 110 and p l 0 0 that is the overall e map showed a tendency for the e value to decrease as the p c value increased this is because termites repeatedly stopped when passing through the zones with high curvature we will cover the effects of p t on the p c later next when the probability of food loss increased p l 0 15 e decreased sharply as p t increased whereas the decrease in e value was relatively small when p c increased this shows that p t has a greater influence on e than p c when p l 0 in the condition of high value of n 0 and low value of p c see dotted line below fig 5 the effect of p c was more pronounced as confirmed by the slope of the contour with respect to the e value which is more oblique in the area below the dotted line therefore the effect of p t on e became more critical as p l increased p l 0 3 the dotted line drawn manually is to visually distinguish the two areas to understand how p c and p t affect e we investigated the frequency of traffic jams n jam during the transportation where p l 0 15 and n 0 30 fig 6 n jam was defined as follows 4 n j a m t 1 t n t t where n t 0 or 1 is the number of the jamming events at time t and t 10 000 represents the simulation time in the case of p c 0 k 1 1 the n jam values were low see the dark blue horizontal row along the bottom right of fig 6 whereas the n jam generally increased as the p c increased this simulates the stopping behavior of termites in the two zones with high curvature furthermore the n jam value did not show any tendency toward an increase in p t this is because there is no simulation time cost in the process of food transfer between two simulated termites p c affected e through traffic jams while p t affected e through the p l food loss considering that individual density is related to p c we can see that the p c and p t effects are related to each other through traffic jam and contribute to the change of e value fig 7 shows visually that the individual density is relatively high in areas of high curvature which leads to many traffic jams the red circles represent the individuals transporting food to the nest and the blue circles represent the individuals returning to the food site after dropping the food into the nest green circles represent individuals stopped due to traffic jams for n 0 30 two green circles were in the zones for n 0 100 four green circles were included in the zones although we did not analyze the dynamics of the frequency of traffic jams over time the frequency occurrence of green circles was relatively high in or around the high curvature zones to understand how traffic jams contribute to e we investigated the changes in the values of e for p c and p t under the condition of no traffic jams occurring fig 8 the condition could be when the tunnel is wide or the termite population density is low of course interference may occur even in the latter case but the frequency would be relatively low as p c increased e decreased slightly while e decreased sharply as p t increased the p c effect and the p t effect are attributed to the stopping behavior of simulated termites passing through the high curvature zones and the food loss through the food transfer process respectively the linearity of the contour lines of the e map for the case of no traffic jam became more pronounced compared to what is shown in fig 6 this shows that the effect of p t on e is relatively larger than that of p c on e and the two effects are interconnected with traffic jam phenomenon and affect e through the connection to understand how the contour pattern of the e map changes with changes in p l and n 0 we calculated the sum of the slope values ρ and the slope angle θ in the e map fig 9 ρ and θ were mathematically defined as follows 5 ρ k 3 n 0 k 2 1 11 k 1 1 11 e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 6 θ k 3 n 0 arctan k 1 1 11 k 1 e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 k 2 1 11 k 1 e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 here k 1 and k 2 are variables taking the values of 1 2 11 introduced to simply express the values of p c and p t the term is an operator that stands for k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 the notation p p k 1 k 2 represents the gradient component in the p direction the value of ρ means the average slope for k 1 and k 2 in e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 shown in fig 5 in other words each number in the grid cell represents the mean slope value when looking at the distribution of the values for p l k 3 and n 0 we can visually see how the value of e changes over the whole variable θ contains information about the direction of the mean slope in degree unit ρ increased gradually when n 0 increased whereas it increased rapidly when p l increased fig 9a this is evident in the color change with blue at the bottom and red at the top of the ρ map that is p l has a greater effect on e than does n 0 in the θ map the value of θ was almost 90 for p l 0 where the slope of the e map is almost the same as the p c increase direction in a nutshell the p c effect is dominant while the p t effect is almost negligible when the p l value was high and the n 0 value was low the θ value was low and when the p l value was low and the n 0 value was high the θ value was high the relatively low value of θ means that the e value changes more rapidly in the p t direction as shown in fig 6 therefore the change appeared as an irregular boundary in the contour pattern of the e map finally we quantified the effect of all variables p c p t p l and n 0 on e using a prcc analysis fig 10 all four variables had a statistically negative effect on e p t had the greatest effect on e followed by p l p c had the third largest influence and n 0 had the smallest influence 4 discussion as subterranean termites transport food through long underground tunnels efficient food transportation is necessary to achieve high foraging efficiency which will ultimately contribute to colony success since research on food transportation in subterranean termites is difficult to observe and study with manipulative approaches we instead developed an individual based model to simulate food transportation behaviors using four different variables food transfer frequency pt food loss pl tunnel curvature pc and number of individuals participating in the food transportation n 0 we tested two possible scenarios bucket brigade mode p t 0 and direct deposition mode p t 0 in the food transportation we tested two possible scenarios in food transport bucket brigade mode p t 0 and direct deposition mode p t 0 several researchers indirectly suggested that termites that transport food over long distances 100 m are more likely to adopt bucket brigade mode jeanne 1986 ratnieks and anderson 1999 su and scherahn 1988 king and spink 1969 however their studies did not include empirical evidence for the suggestion our simulation showed that the food transportation efficiency e was higher in the absence of food transfer p t 0 compared to the case with p t 0 fig 5 this seems to be contrary to the four studies mentioned above however the value of e should be carefully interpreted along with the frequency of traffic jams even in the case of p t 0 the frequency of traffic jam occurrence may be high depending on the p c see fig 6 considering that traffic jams contribute to the drop in e value it would be more advantageous for termites to adopt the p t 0 mode strategy in narrow and short tunnels where traffic jams are expected to occur relatively frequently whereas in wide and long tunnels where there are likely to be fewer traffic jams which is more favorable to termites it would be more advantageous to adopt the p t 0 strategy termites in tunnels with less traffic jams are more likely to adopt possible food transport strategies because the efficiency costs consumed by jamming can be reduced in this respect the strategy in which individuals share food transport has an advantage in that transport stability is likely to increase although the efficiency may be somewhat lowered as a result it can be said that termites are likely to choose the p t 0 mode in wide and long tunnels there is no traffic jam study on termites so far but as a similar study couzin and franks 2003 reported through experimental and simulation studies that the army ant eciton burchelli formed lanes by increasing pheromone concentrations to maximize traffic flow during food transport we assumed a no pheromone effect in the model but it would be interesting to explore whether the food transfer process could create a lane to reduce the frequency of traffic jams if we included the pheromone effect in the model in addition if we could experimentally obtain data on individual individual interactions and algorithmize them we could gain insight into how sophisticated self organizing structures such as collectively selected unidirectional flows and minimal traffic congestion can be formed from the interactions our study is valuable not only because it provides evidence indirectly through simulations but also because it has significance in making experimentally verifiable predictions that food transfer events should occur as few as possible taking into account traffic jams we need to mention that the termite traffic jam used in this study is a different concept from the car traffic jam termites approaching from opposite directions sometimes stop moving in a narrow space for passing fig 11 a but show similar stopping behavior in a sufficiently large space fig 11b for this reason it can be seen that the traffic jams rules adopted in our model are oversimplified in other words the simulation rule that traffic jam occurs when the sum of the traveling directions of four overlapping people on the same site becomes 0 reflects only a part of the actual termite traffic jam phenomenon to the best of our knowledge there are few quantitative studies of the relationship between termite traffic jams and tunnel width and length this would be a very interesting topic to explore since irregularities are involved in the formation of termite tunnels we placed 20 evenly spaced irregularities in the simulation model considering the fact that irregularities are caused by external forces or the heterogeneity of the ground ku et al 2012 the fixation of the number and distribution implies the assumption that the soil conditions are almost homogeneous and that the tunnel walls are robust to various external forces therefore to make the results of this study more realistic it would be better to include the number and distribution as control variables in future studies another simulation result demonstrated that food transfer pt between individuals was the most significant effect on food transportation efficiency of subterranean termites and followed by p l p c and n 0 based on our sensitivity analysis fig 10 from an evolutionary point of view the results suggest that termites may have evolved in a way that limits the food transfer frequency to low levels in order to increase the food transportation efficiency given that termites cause food loss by consuming small amounts of food in the process of transportation the limitation naturally contribute to reducing food loss as well as reducing the physical burden on individuals the results also showed that limiting the number of individuals participating in food transport is effective for e optimization this is because too much participation leads to the increase of traffic jamming frequency in tunnel sections with high individual density and high curvature the variables included in the food transport model used in this study do not have a physical dimension this is basically because we do not know the physical values corresponding to the simulation time length and the size of the grid space for this reason the experimental data values related to fig 1 and 11 could not be directly applied to the model and only tendency was reflected however if more experimental data related to the food transport are accumulated the variable values can be replaced with values having a physical dimension which is highly likely to lead to a more realistic model this study is significant not only because it explores the problem of termite food transport which is difficult to access experimentally using a simulation model but also because it suggests a food transport strategy that termites can take it is also significant because we provide insights to improve the limitations of this model and to guide experimental studies in the field of termite foraging

mentioned in the model we let the simulated termites that found irregularities in the tunnel or soil pores stay there for 20 time steps preliminary studies showed little change in simulation results for the stay time of 10 to 30 time steps cases with longer stay times were not considered in this study in this model we evenly distributed 20 irregularity sites on the tunnel in the simulation model we placed a food site at one end and the other was a nest a sufficient number of food particles at the food site was placed in the model and termites can move only one food particle at a time initially t 0 n 0 30 40 130 simulated termites were randomly placed in the tunnel 2 3 food transportation behavior of simulated termites in the transport process when a simulated termite with food encounters another termite without food the food transfer process is triggered according to the probability of food transfer p t 0 0 0 1 1 0 fig 2 this is accompanied by food loss p l 0 0 0 03 0 3 in fig 2a the red circles represent individuals with a food particle and red semicircles represent individuals with food lost by the p l value food transfer only occurs between individuals facing each other fig 2b if an individual encounters two or more approaching individuals facing each other one of the approaching individuals is randomly selected and food transfer is performed fig 2c on the other hand the food transfer process does not work when individuals with food meet each other two individuals participating in the process of transferring food reverse the direction of their movement while individuals not transferring food pass each other without interaction if a simulated termite drops one food particle into the nest without loss p l 0 the amount of food accumulated in the nest is quantified as 1 on the other hand when a food particle that has suffered n losses arrives at the nest the amount of food is accumulated as a value of 1 n p l if the amount of the food is negative it is considered as zero in this regard we defined the food transportation efficiency e as follows 1 e τ s t 1 τ f o o d t τ n 0 here food t represents the number of food particles dropped to the nest at time t and n 0 is the number of termites participating in food transport s is a scaling factor with a value of 10 000 which prevents e from becoming too small to simplify the representation of the values of the three variables p c p t and p l we set the relation p c k 1 1 0 05 p t k 2 1 0 05 and p l k 3 1 0 03 and expressed the variable values as k 1 k 2 and k 3 1 2 11 respectively 2 4 traffic jam to experimentally observe how termites behave when facing each other through a narrow tunnel we made an artificial tunnel 2 mm or 3 mm wide and 100 mm long on a sand substrate we observed that some termites often stop depending on the surrounding conditions in some cases the individuals behind the detained individuals stopped in succession and in other cases they turned their bodies vertically to pass through the space between the stopped individuals and the tunnel wall stop time ranged from a few seconds to more than 5 min in this study we refer to the termite stopping behavior as a traffic jam although it is somewhat different from the car traffic jam on the road to the best of our knowledge there have been few quantitative studies of the termite traffic jam we termed in field conditions but it would be reasonable to infer that there may be narrow and densely populated sections where traffic jams can occur within a termite tunnel network a detailed study on this would probably be interesting however we excluded further discussion of traffic jams so as not to obscure the focus of this study to implement the traffic jam in the model we established the rule that a traffic jam occurs when four simulated termites at a grid site overlap spatially and the sum of their movement direction vectors is zero fig 3 when the traffic jam occurred at a site the four individuals stayed at the site for 100 time steps without interacting with other individuals 2 5 sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of the four variables p t p c p l and n 0 on the food transportation efficiency e we used the partial rank correlation coefficient prcc method a global sensitivity analysis known as a reliable sampling based method marino et al 2008 to obtain the prcc we calculated the correlation coefficient cc between input x j and output y as follows 2 cc x j y i 1 n x i j x y i y i 1 n x i j x 2 1 n y i y 2 j 1 2 k here n and k represent the number of samples and the size of the input vector respectively x represents one or another of the four parameters p c p t p l or n 0 and y refers to the efficiency e the partial correlation coefficient pcc removing the linear influence of other variables measures how strong the linear relationship is between the input x j and the output y is in other words the pcc between x j and y is defined as the cc of x j x j and y y therefore x j and y are described by the following linear regression model 3 x j c 0 p 1 p j n c p x p a n d y b 0 p 1 p j n b p x p where b and c represent the regression coefficients and hat represents the regression fitted variable prcc calculates the partial correlation using the linear regression model shown in eq 3 this calculation is performed on the data transformed by ranks x j and y the value of prcc is between 1 and 1 a positive negative value indicates a positive negative correlation between the parameter and the model output a positive value of prcc indicates a positive effect on the y output value while a negative number indicates a negative contribution to the output a larger absolute prcc value indicates a greater correlation between the parameter and the output in this study we used the lhs latin hypercube sampling method to avoid repetitive sampling as one of the layered sampling methods mckay et al 1979 this method has the advantage of significantly reducing the number of simulations compared to the existing monte carlo method iman and helton 1988 we performed 219 615 simulations of 11 11 11 11 14 641 combinations of the four variables each replicated 15 times for the calculation of eqs 2 and 3 the prcc function provided in the 2021a version of matlab was used 3 results to clearly show how the number of particles transported by a simulated termite increases with different values of k 2 we calculated the value of e after removing τ from the denominator of eq 1 considering the τ as expected we can see that the e values saturated with time see inset in fig 4 in the absence of food loss e increased linearly regardless of pt in the region t simulation time 1500 see red dotted line in fig 4 this is how termites transport small amounts of food in short tunnels however when the food transport process lasted longer t 1500 pl 0 15 e decreased significantly with increasing pt fig 4b we then investigated the effects of variables on e by testing the combinatorial conditions of p c p t p l and n 0 we found that e values decreased with increasing p l regardless of p c and p t fig 5 when the number of individuals participating in food transportation was small n 0 30 and there was no food loss p l 0 little effects of p c and p t were also observed as no clear pattern was found in the contours of e values fig 5 however the p c effect became evident when n 0 was high n 0 110 and p l 0 0 that is the overall e map showed a tendency for the e value to decrease as the p c value increased this is because termites repeatedly stopped when passing through the zones with high curvature we will cover the effects of p t on the p c later next when the probability of food loss increased p l 0 15 e decreased sharply as p t increased whereas the decrease in e value was relatively small when p c increased this shows that p t has a greater influence on e than p c when p l 0 in the condition of high value of n 0 and low value of p c see dotted line below fig 5 the effect of p c was more pronounced as confirmed by the slope of the contour with respect to the e value which is more oblique in the area below the dotted line therefore the effect of p t on e became more critical as p l increased p l 0 3 the dotted line drawn manually is to visually distinguish the two areas to understand how p c and p t affect e we investigated the frequency of traffic jams n jam during the transportation where p l 0 15 and n 0 30 fig 6 n jam was defined as follows 4 n j a m t 1 t n t t where n t 0 or 1 is the number of the jamming events at time t and t 10 000 represents the simulation time in the case of p c 0 k 1 1 the n jam values were low see the dark blue horizontal row along the bottom right of fig 6 whereas the n jam generally increased as the p c increased this simulates the stopping behavior of termites in the two zones with high curvature furthermore the n jam value did not show any tendency toward an increase in p t this is because there is no simulation time cost in the process of food transfer between two simulated termites p c affected e through traffic jams while p t affected e through the p l food loss considering that individual density is related to p c we can see that the p c and p t effects are related to each other through traffic jam and contribute to the change of e value fig 7 shows visually that the individual density is relatively high in areas of high curvature which leads to many traffic jams the red circles represent the individuals transporting food to the nest and the blue circles represent the individuals returning to the food site after dropping the food into the nest green circles represent individuals stopped due to traffic jams for n 0 30 two green circles were in the zones for n 0 100 four green circles were included in the zones although we did not analyze the dynamics of the frequency of traffic jams over time the frequency occurrence of green circles was relatively high in or around the high curvature zones to understand how traffic jams contribute to e we investigated the changes in the values of e for p c and p t under the condition of no traffic jams occurring fig 8 the condition could be when the tunnel is wide or the termite population density is low of course interference may occur even in the latter case but the frequency would be relatively low as p c increased e decreased slightly while e decreased sharply as p t increased the p c effect and the p t effect are attributed to the stopping behavior of simulated termites passing through the high curvature zones and the food loss through the food transfer process respectively the linearity of the contour lines of the e map for the case of no traffic jam became more pronounced compared to what is shown in fig 6 this shows that the effect of p t on e is relatively larger than that of p c on e and the two effects are interconnected with traffic jam phenomenon and affect e through the connection to understand how the contour pattern of the e map changes with changes in p l and n 0 we calculated the sum of the slope values ρ and the slope angle θ in the e map fig 9 ρ and θ were mathematically defined as follows 5 ρ k 3 n 0 k 2 1 11 k 1 1 11 e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 6 θ k 3 n 0 arctan k 1 1 11 k 1 e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 k 2 1 11 k 1 e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 here k 1 and k 2 are variables taking the values of 1 2 11 introduced to simply express the values of p c and p t the term is an operator that stands for k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 the notation p p k 1 k 2 represents the gradient component in the p direction the value of ρ means the average slope for k 1 and k 2 in e k 1 k 2 k 3 n 0 shown in fig 5 in other words each number in the grid cell represents the mean slope value when looking at the distribution of the values for p l k 3 and n 0 we can visually see how the value of e changes over the whole variable θ contains information about the direction of the mean slope in degree unit ρ increased gradually when n 0 increased whereas it increased rapidly when p l increased fig 9a this is evident in the color change with blue at the bottom and red at the top of the ρ map that is p l has a greater effect on e than does n 0 in the θ map the value of θ was almost 90 for p l 0 where the slope of the e map is almost the same as the p c increase direction in a nutshell the p c effect is dominant while the p t effect is almost negligible when the p l value was high and the n 0 value was low the θ value was low and when the p l value was low and the n 0 value was high the θ value was high the relatively low value of θ means that the e value changes more rapidly in the p t direction as shown in fig 6 therefore the change appeared as an irregular boundary in the contour pattern of the e map finally we quantified the effect of all variables p c p t p l and n 0 on e using a prcc analysis fig 10 all four variables had a statistically negative effect on e p t had the greatest effect on e followed by p l p c had the third largest influence and n 0 had the smallest influence 4 discussion as subterranean termites transport food through long underground tunnels efficient food transportation is necessary to achieve high foraging efficiency which will ultimately contribute to colony success since research on food transportation in subterranean termites is difficult to observe and study with manipulative approaches we instead developed an individual based model to simulate food transportation behaviors using four different variables food transfer frequency pt food loss pl tunnel curvature pc and number of individuals participating in the food transportation n 0 we tested two possible scenarios bucket brigade mode p t 0 and direct deposition mode p t 0 in the food transportation we tested two possible scenarios in food transport bucket brigade mode p t 0 and direct deposition mode p t 0 several researchers indirectly suggested that termites that transport food over long distances 100 m are more likely to adopt bucket brigade mode jeanne 1986 ratnieks and anderson 1999 su and scherahn 1988 king and spink 1969 however their studies did not include empirical evidence for the suggestion our simulation showed that the food transportation efficiency e was higher in the absence of food transfer p t 0 compared to the case with p t 0 fig 5 this seems to be contrary to the four studies mentioned above however the value of e should be carefully interpreted along with the frequency of traffic jams even in the case of p t 0 the frequency of traffic jam occurrence may be high depending on the p c see fig 6 considering that traffic jams contribute to the drop in e value it would be more advantageous for termites to adopt the p t 0 mode strategy in narrow and short tunnels where traffic jams are expected to occur relatively frequently whereas in wide and long tunnels where there are likely to be fewer traffic jams which is more favorable to termites it would be more advantageous to adopt the p t 0 strategy termites in tunnels with less traffic jams are more likely to adopt possible food transport strategies because the efficiency costs consumed by jamming can be reduced in this respect the strategy in which individuals share food transport has an advantage in that transport stability is likely to increase although the efficiency may be somewhat lowered as a result it can be said that termites are likely to choose the p t 0 mode in wide and long tunnels there is no traffic jam study on termites so far but as a similar study couzin and franks 2003 reported through experimental and simulation studies that the army ant eciton burchelli formed lanes by increasing pheromone concentrations to maximize traffic flow during food transport we assumed a no pheromone effect in the model but it would be interesting to explore whether the food transfer process could create a lane to reduce the frequency of traffic jams if we included the pheromone effect in the model in addition if we could experimentally obtain data on individual individual interactions and algorithmize them we could gain insight into how sophisticated self organizing structures such as collectively selected unidirectional flows and minimal traffic congestion can be formed from the interactions our study is valuable not only because it provides evidence indirectly through simulations but also because it has significance in making experimentally verifiable predictions that food transfer events should occur as few as possible taking into account traffic jams we need to mention that the termite traffic jam used in this study is a different concept from the car traffic jam termites approaching from opposite directions sometimes stop moving in a narrow space for passing fig 11 a but show similar stopping behavior in a sufficiently large space fig 11b for this reason it can be seen that the traffic jams rules adopted in our model are oversimplified in other words the simulation rule that traffic jam occurs when the sum of the traveling directions of four overlapping people on the same site becomes 0 reflects only a part of the actual termite traffic jam phenomenon to the best of our knowledge there are few quantitative studies of the relationship between termite traffic jams and tunnel width and length this would be a very interesting topic to explore since irregularities are involved in the formation of termite tunnels we placed 20 evenly spaced irregularities in the simulation model considering the fact that irregularities are caused by external forces or the heterogeneity of the ground ku et al 2012 the fixation of the number and distribution implies the assumption that the soil conditions are almost homogeneous and that the tunnel walls are robust to various external forces therefore to make the results of this study more realistic it would be better to include the number and distribution as control variables in future studies another simulation result demonstrated that food transfer pt between individuals was the most significant effect on food transportation efficiency of subterranean termites and followed by p l p c and n 0 based on our sensitivity analysis fig 10 from an evolutionary point of view the results suggest that termites may have evolved in a way that limits the food transfer frequency to low levels in order to increase the food transportation efficiency given that termites cause food loss by consuming small amounts of food in the process of transportation the limitation naturally contribute to reducing food loss as well as reducing the physical burden on individuals the results also showed that limiting the number of individuals participating in food transport is effective for e optimization this is because too much participation leads to the increase of traffic jamming frequency in tunnel sections with high individual density and high curvature the variables included in the food transport model used in this study do not have a physical dimension this is basically because we do not know the physical values corresponding to the simulation time length and the size of the grid space for this reason the experimental data values related to fig 1 and 11 could not be directly applied to the model and only tendency was reflected however if more experimental data related to the food transport are accumulated the variable values can be replaced with values having a physical dimension which is highly likely to lead to a more realistic model this study is significant not only because it explores the problem of termite food transport which is difficult to access experimentally using a simulation model but also because it suggests a food transport strategy that termites can take it is also significant because we provide insights to improve the limitations of this model and to guide experimental studies in the field of termite foraging

24326,this manuscript tackles the study of vegetation pattern dynamics driven by inertial effects and secondary seed dispersal to achieve this goal an hyperbolic extension of the classical parabolic klausmeier model of vegetation generally used to predict the formation of banded vegetation along the slopes of semiarid environments has been here considered together with an additional advective term mimicking the downslope motion of seeds linear stability analyses have been carried out to inspect the dependence of the wave instability locus on the model parameters with particular emphasis on the role played by inertial time and seed advection speed moreover periodic travelling wave solutions are taken into account to better characterize modulus and direction of the migration speed of striped vegetation patterns theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical investigations and ecological implications are also discussed in particular it is highlighted how the hyperbolic nature of the model may provide possible justifications about some controversial field observations keywords vegetation stripe patterns hyperbolic reaction advection diffusion models inertial times secondary seed dispersal wave instability travelling wave solutions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction self organized patchiness in ecosystems is a clear cut example of the occurrence of vegetation patterns in water limited systems von hardenberg et al 2001 gilad et al 2004 meron 2015 zelnik et al 2017 meron 2018 gowda et al 2018 tongway 2001 dunkerley 2018 in particular regular striped patterns formed along the hillsides of many arid and semi arid environments are believed to exhibit a non stationary behaviour which manifests itself as an uphill migration of bands however a larger availability of field data has brought out some controversial interpretations about the effective motion of these patches tongway 2001 dunkerley 2018 many mathematical models and numerical tools have been developed to provide a suitable description of the complex phenomena behind the formation modulation resilience and propagation of such vegetation patterns klausmeier 1999 rietkerk et al 2000 hillerislambers et al 2001 sherratt 2005 siteur 2014 thompson et al 2008 2014 sohoulande djebou and singh 2015 thompson and katul 2009 saco et

the above mentioned controversy was attributed to the phenomena of mobilization transport and germination of seeds which can be gathered under the name of secondary seed dispersal it is indeed known that in sloped terrains seeds undergo both a primary dispersal from the plant to the ground followed by a secondary dispersal due to their transport in overland flow this phenomenon has been included in several parabolic models to cite a few hillerislambers et al 2001 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 thompson and katul 2009 and consolo and valenti 2019 in particular in the work by our group consolo and valenti 2019 secondary dispersal of seeds was included in the framework of the klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 that as known is one of the easiest two compartments models for surface water and vegetation biomass capable of providing a sufficiently adequate description of the formation and movement of vegetation stripes along sloped arid terrains in that work much emphasis was given to the role of initial conditions highlighting how different ecological scenarios can take place when vegetation patterns arise from degradation of homogeneous vegetation or from colonization of bare ground however the parabolic nature of the above model prevented the possibility of taking into account those inertial effects which are observed in the vegetation response in particular for the woody component milchunas and lauenroth 1995 garcia fayos and gasque 2002 deblauwe et al 2011 valentin and d herbés 1999 deblauwe et al 2012 it was indeed emphasized that inertia of existing plant populations namely the tendency to continue residing a given location when the environmental conditions become unfavourable takes an active role in response to climate change and presence of pollutants apart from that inertial effects can even mask future deteriorations in ecosystem conditions so constituting more than just a time lag in response to an ongoing stressor accounting for inertia leads to the development of an hyperbolic framework that as known overcomes the paradox of infinite propagation speed of disturbances and is better suited to describe wave propagation phenomena mendez et al 2010 zemskov and horsthemke 2016 mvogo et al 2018 ai ghoul and eu 1996 hillen 2002 straughan 2011 curró and valenti 2021 the presence of inertia in vegetation dynamics has been considered in some of our previous works consolo et al 2017 2019 2020 2022 consolo and grifó 2022 where it has been emphasized its role both in the transient regime from a spatially homogeneous steady state toward a spatially periodic patterned state and in the modulation of the region of the parameter space in which patterns can be observed however to the best of our knowledge secondary seed dispersal has never been considered in hyperbolic models therefore the aim of the present work is to inspect how the dynamics of non stationary vegetation stripes are affected by the simultaneous action of inertial effects and secondary seed dispersal in detail in order to characterize the features of the emerging migrating patterns linear stability analysis has been performed with particular emphasis on the deduction of the threshold condition for wave instability responsible for the onset of oscillatory periodic patterns moreover to gain more insights into the mechanisms underlying the pattern propagation speed travelling wave solutions have been also taken into account analytical predictions have been corroborated by numerical simulations and by a qualitative comparison with some ecological field observations the manuscript is organized as follows the hyperbolic reaction diffusion advection model is presented in section 2 whereas linear stability analyses focused on non stationary pattern dynamics are addressed in section 3 travelling wave solutions are investigated in section 4 and final remarks are given in section 5 2 model description our analysis originates from the classical parabolic version of the klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 that is one conceptual tool used to mimic striped vegetation dynamics along sloped semi arid environments in its original formulation the model describes the spatio temporal evolution of surface water w x t and vegetation biomass u x t in the presence of an isotropic dispersal of seeds and an anisotropic flow of water through the hillside here water diffusion is neglected since the advection contribution is generally dominant on slopes later in ref consolo and valenti 2019 this model was extended to include the secondary seed dispersal phenomenon and took the 1d dimensionless form 1 u w t 1 0 0 0 u w x x ψ 0 0 ν u w x f u w g u w where the subscript stands for the partial derivative with respect to the indicated variable the x axis points along uphill direction and the advection speeds of plant and water are denoted by ψ and ν respectively the kinetic functions are given by 2 f u w w u 2 b u g u w a w w u 2 where a and b are representative of the rates of average annual rainfall and plant loss respectively note that the original klausmeier model is recovered for ψ 0 to account for the presence of biological inertia brown et al 2001 von holle et al 2003 deblauwe et al 2011 garcia fayos and gasque 2002 milchunas and lauenroth 1995 as well as to provide a better description of pattern propagation hereafter we consider its hyperbolic generalization obtained by means of extended thermodynamics et theory ruggeri and sugiyama 2021 barbera et al 2015 curró and valenti 2021 the model reads 3 u t m u x n u with 4 u u w j m ψ 0 1 0 ν 0 1 τ 0 0 n u f u w g u w 1 τ j being τ and j x t the inertial time and the dissipative flux respectively associated to plant evolution according to et theory the flux is considered as an additional state variable satisfying a thermodynamically consistent balance law τ j t u x j that reduces to the classical gradient based fick s law for vanishing inertial time τ 0 readers interested in the full derivation of the hyperbolic model may refer to ref barbera et al 2015 it is known that for a 2 b the model 3 4 with f u w and g u w given by 2 admits three distinct spatially homogeneous steady states u given by 5 u d 0 a 0 u l u l b u l 0 u s u s b u s 0 where 6 u l a a 2 4 b 2 2 b u s a a 2 4 b 2 2 b 0 u l 1 u s from an ecological viewpoint the first state u d is representative of the desert state whereas the other ones of uniformly vegetated areas note that for a 2 b the desert state is the only admitted one whereas u l u s for a 2 b according to literature realistic values of rainfall and plant loss belong to the ranges b 0 2 and a 0 3 rietkerk 2002 klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2010 moreover water advection speed is generally taken as ν 200 klausmeier 1999 whereas since secondary seed dispersal represents a small percentage of the former mechanism it is realistic to assume ψ ν consolo and valenti 2019 3 wave bifurcation analysis in order to investigate the nature of the steady states 5 a linear stability analysis for the pde system 3 4 is now carried out due to its high variability given by natural human and herbivory effects the plant loss b is considered as the control parameter then by perturbing the steady state namely by looking for solutions in the form of u u u exp ω t i k x we get 7 ω i i k m n u 0 where i denotes the identity matrix u represents the gradient with respect to the field variables and the asterisk indicates the evaluation at u searching non trivial solutions of 7 leads to the following characteristic equation 8 τ ω 3 a 1 i k τ ν ψ ω 2 a 2 i k τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ ω a 3 i k ν f u ψ g w ν k 2 0 where 9 a 1 1 τ f u g w a 2 a 2 k 2 a 2 a 2 1 τ ν ψ a 2 τ f u g w g u f w f u g w a 3 a 3 k 2 a 3 a 3 g w ν ψ a 3 f u g w g u f w let us now focus on the occurrence of the so called wave instability namely the destabilization of a spatially uniform steady state via a perturbation with a non null wavenumber k giving rise to oscillatory in time and periodic in space patterns to this aim we analyse first the local stability under an homogeneous perturbation k 0 in this case the characteristic eq 8 can be factorized and its solutions are 10 ω 1 1 τ 0 ω 2 3 1 2 f u g w f u g w 2 4 f u g w f w g u so that u is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbation iff 11 f u g w 0 f u g w f w g u 0 therefore in the abovementioned range of parameters b 0 2 and a 2 b it can be easily proved that the desert state u d and the vegetated one u s are stable against homogeneous perturbations whereas the vegetated state u l is always unstable thus this latter one cannot gives rise to pattern formation and it will not be further considered in our analysis on the other hand taking into account non homogeneous perturbations around the desert state u d the dispersion relation can be factorized and its solutions are given by 12 ω 1 1 i ν k ω 2 3 1 2 b 1 τ i ψ k b 1 τ 2 k 2 4 τ ψ 2 2 i ψ k 1 τ b consequently u d is always stable under both homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations being the real parts of all eigenvalues negative k thus the only homogeneously vegetated state configuration that can give rise to oscillatory periodic patterns is u s in particular looking for solutions of the dispersion relation 8 with re ω 0 and im ω 0 for some k 0 setting to zero the real and imaginary parts and combining the resulting equations the critical wavenumber at the onset of instability is ruled by 13 θ 1 k 6 θ 2 k 4 θ 3 k 2 θ 4 0 where 14 θ 1 a 1 β 1 2 β 1 β 3 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ β 3 2 a 3 θ 2 2 β 1 β 2 a 1 β 1 β 4 β 2 β 3 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ 2 β 3 β 4 a 3 β 3 2 a 3 θ 3 a 1 β 2 2 β 2 β 4 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ a 3 β 4 2 2 a 3 β 3 β 4 θ 4 β 4 2 a 3 β 1 τ 2 a 3 ν g w ψ f u ν a 1 2 β 2 τ 2 a 3 ν g w ψ f u

in k 2 admits three real roots two of which are equal to each other positive and representative of the critical squared wavenumber k c 2 consequently the wave bifurcation locus is implicitly defined by 15 27 θ 4 2 θ 1 2 θ 3 2 θ 2 2 4 θ 3 3 θ 1 4 θ 4 θ 2 3 18 θ 4 θ 3 θ 2 θ 1 0 note that for τ 0 the wave bifurcation locus 15 here obtained reduces to the one found in the parabolic model consolo and valenti 2019 unfortunately due to the highly nonlinear dependence of 15 on the plant loss b information can be extracted from numerical investigations only in fig 1 the loci of wave instability 15 are depicted by solid lines in the b a parameter plane for different inertial times τ 1 100 fixing ν 182 5 and ψ 1 for comparison in the same figure the parabolic locus is also shown red circles pointing out a close agreement with the one obtained in the hyperbolic model for small inertial times τ 1 on the other hand by moving away from the parabolic limit the locus of wave instability shifts up so enlarging the region where oscillatory periodic patterns may be observed in line with our previous results consolo et al 2017 curró and valenti 2021 consolo et al 2022 to confirm this theoretical prediction let us consider the point p 1 0 38 2 8 in the parameter plane see top inset in fig 1 and inspect the wavenumber dependence of real and imaginary parts of the roots of the characteristic equation as the inertial time is varied results shown in fig 2 a reveal that for τ 10 the real part of the largest eigenvalue is always negative so proving that p 1 lies outside the wave instability region on the other hand for τ 20 and τ 100 the existence of ranges of unstable wavenumbers confirm the upward shift of the locus of wave instability that has led p 1 to fall within the instability region see fig 2 b c additional numerical investigations are also performed to better understand the roles of inertial time τ and advection speeds ψ and ν on the bifurcation threshold b c in particular results shown in fig 3 a are obtained for a fixed value of ψ 1 whereas those depicted in fig 3 b correspond to the case ν 182 5 in detail for a fixed value of secondary seed dispersal and independently of the inertial time the decrease of water advection speed leads to an increase of the critical value of the control parameter which in turn represents a reduction of the instability region see fig 3 a this result agrees with the theoretical expectation that the formation of oscillatory patterns requires a non null water advection speed on the other hand for a fixed value of water advection speed the behaviour of the instability threshold depends on the distance from the parabolic limit indeed as depicted in fig 3 b for τ 1 0 1 the critical value of control parameter is almost unaffected by the strength of secondary seed dispersal on the contrary far away from the parabolic limit the role of seeds advection speed becomes more relevant in fact as the parameter ψ decreases the wave instability region enlarges let us now inspect the properties exhibited by oscillatory patterns by moving along the wave bifurcation locus to this aim let us fix three different points on the locus obtained for τ 10 as shown in the bottom inset of fig 1 and precisely p 2 0 244 1 5 p 3 0 270 1 7 and p 4 0 293 1 9 for these points the wavenumber dependence of the most unstable mode at onset characterized by angular frequency ω c and critical wavenumber k c is tracked in fig 4 since the imaginary part determines the modulus and direction of pattern speed s im ω c k c uphill downhill motion is observed for im ω c 0 im ω c 0 whereas stationary patterns originate for im ω c 0 theoretical predictions reveal that downhill motion takes place at the point p 2 see fig 4 a whereas patterns become stationary at p 3 see fig 4 b and move uphill at p 4 see fig 4 c to check the validity of the above results the governing system 3 4 is integrated numerically by means of comsol multiphysics comsol multiphysics in the computational domain x 0 200 over the time window t 0 200 moreover periodic boundary conditions are used and a small perturbation of the steady state u s is taken as initial condition namely patterns originating from degradation of homogeneous vegetation are here considered consolo and valenti 2019 sherratt 2015 results of numerical simulations confirm our predictions as shown in fig 5 the above theoretical results are in line with some body of literature klausmeier 1999 esteban and fairén 2006 which predicts that vegetation groves move upslope as a result of a larger availability of moisture in the upslope margin of the band moreover the presence of downslope seed transport offers a stabilizing mechanism that reduces the bands migration speed and can even reverse the direction of propagation saco et al 2007 thompson et al 2008 2014 however the occurrence of upslope and downslope migration of bands is still under debate due to some controversial field evidences thompson et al 2008 tongway 2001 dunkerley 2018 in particular theoretical observations of downhill movement of bands are sometimes interpreted as a regime in which pattern migration is instead precluded thompson et al 2008 this issue will be investigated in more detail later on in the manuscript according to such ecological considerations let us describe more accurately the occurrence of stationary patterns in a framework enclosing advective terms to this aim let us look for solutions of the dispersion relation 8 characterized by 16 ω 0 re ω k 0 these constraints lead to the following system that defines a turing point in the b a plane and the critical wavenumber k c at which such an instability occurs 17 k c ν f u ψ g w ν ν f u g w f w g u ν f u ψ g w ν ψ g w 0 g w ν ψ 1 τ ν ψ ν f u ψ g w τ ν f u g w f w g u ν f u g w ν ν f u ψ g w τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ 0 as it can be noticed the existence condition arising from 17 1 implies a restriction on the upper limit of seed advection speed 18 ψ b ν 1 u s 2 moreover 17 3 encloses the dependence of the turing point on hyperbolicity indeed by varying the inertial time the occurrence of stationary patterns takes place at different points in the b a plane as represented by the stars in fig 1 in particular decreasing the inertial time the turing point moves upward along the bifurcation locus so enlarging the range in which downhill motion is observed notice that for τ 1 no star is shown since it is out of the meaningful ecological range to describe the inertial time dependence of the turing point b c t we solve system 17 for fixed values of ν and ψ results are shown in fig 6 where the function that best approximates data is also depicted finally let us report some quantitative field estimations of migration speeds of vegetation patches extracted from table 12 2 in tongway 2001 and dunkerley 2018 which gather experimental results from several arid regions those data pointed out that dynamics in sloped terrains range from the quasi stationary case corresponding to almost null migration speed as observed in mexico montaña 1992 mali leprun 1992 somalia boaler and hodge 1964 and australia dunkerley 2018 to uphill motion with speed up to a 1 5 m year as in mexico montaña 1992 mali leprun 1992 and sudan worral 1959 to address a direct comparison with such data let us recast the dimensionless migration speed s and the time t in the original dimensional variables s m year and t year respectively by using the numerical estimates of the ecological parameters provided by klausmeier in klausmeier 1999 we get migration speed s 2 s m year and time t t 4 year note that the inertial time τ scales with the same law as t i e t τ 4 then the dependence of s t is reported in fig 7 for different values of ν and ψ results in panel a reveal that for a fixed value of ν and for small values of inertial times pattern speed s changes progressively sign from positive to negative as the seed advection speed ψ increases on the contrary for large values of inertial times migration speed keeps positive and approaches asymptotically the null value far away from the parabolic limit this behaviour holds independently of the value of the water advection speed as proven in fig 7 b which is obtained for ψ 1 and variable ν these intriguing results allow to claim that the hyperbolic model may provide satisfying interpretations of ecological observations both when patterns migrate uphill tongway 2001 and when they are believed to be stationary dunkerley 2018 indeed in the former case the theoretically predicted maximum speed value about 1 2 m year is in close agreement with the experimental one 1 5 m year reported in sudan tongway 2001 and worral 1959 for ψ 1 this result suggests that the uphill migration of patterns might be associated with a very small percentage of seed advection an increase of which would lead to the opposite behaviour in the latter case the vanishing migration speeds obtained for large values of inertial time yield patterns to behave as they were almost stationary independently of the strength of secondary seed dispersal on the other hand close to the parabolic limit the agreement with field data would require to set both an upper bound 18 to exclude the occurrence of downhill migration thompson et al 2008 and a lower bound to prevent propagation speed to achieve very large values 4 periodic travelling waves the analyses carried out in the previous sections have shed some light on the role played by inertial time and advection terms in the mechanism of formation of oscillatory periodic patterns in this section let us focus in more detail on the characterization of the pattern speed s in the proposed hyperbolic model 3 4 for this reason we look for solutions of the governing system in the form of periodic travelling waves namely u x t u z with z x s t this leads to recast the original pdes system in terms of the following odes one 19 m s i d u d z n u it is trivial to notice that 19 admits the same three steady states 5 moreover since we are interested in the occurrence of wave instability we focus our analysis on the homogeneously vegetated state u s only therefore searching for solutions in the form of u u s u exp ω z the following cubic characteristic equation with real coefficients is obtained 20 ω 3 d 1 ω 2 d 2 ω d 3 0 where 21 d 1 s 2 a 1 s τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ a 3 ν s τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 d 2 s a 2 ν f u ψ g w ν s τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 d 3 a 3 ν s τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 then routh hurwitz criterion is applied to determine the local stability of u s namely 22 re ω 0 ω d 1 0 d 3 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 0 the first two conditions lead to 23 i if τ f u 1 0 s 4 s 2 s 1 s min s 2 s 3 ii if τ f u 1 0 s 4 s 2 s 1 s s 3 s 4 s s 2 iii if τ f u 1 0 s 1 s 3 max s 1 s 4 s s 2 iv if τ f u 1 0 s 1 s 3 s 1 s s 3 s 4 s s 2 where 24 s 1 2 1 2 ψ ψ 2 4 τ s 3 4 1 2 a 1 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ 2 4 a 1 a 3 note that 23 represents the restrictions provided by the hyperbolic nature of the model that as expected imposes the speed of propagation to be limited indeed in the parabolic limit τ 0 the previous conditions reduce to 25 s s 3 s s 4 s 2 ψ ν s ψ ν g w g w f u s ψ g w ν f u s ν f u g w f w g u 0 where 26 s 3 4 1 2 ψ ν ψ ν 2 4 g w which highlight the absence of an upper limit so allowing the possibility to achieve the paradox of an infinite propagation speed on the other hand violation of the last condition in 22 defines the locus of hopf bifurcation 27 s 2 a 1 s τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ a 3 s a 2 ν f u ψ g w a 3 ν ψ τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 0 as known sherratt 2010 sherratt and lord 2007 sherratt 2011 the occurrence of hopf bifurcation at u s to a small amplitude periodic solution of the odes system 19 corresponds to a travelling wave solution of the pdes system 3 4 unfortunately due to the highly nonlinear structure of the implicit locus 27 on the plant loss b information can only be extracted numerically outcomes of this analysis are shown in fig 8 where the locus of hopf bifurcation is depicted for different values of the inertial time τ considering ν 182 5 ψ 1 and a 2 8 this parameter set falls into setup iii of 23 in the same figure the horizontal lines represent the constraints s s 1 and s s 2 whereas the condition s s 4 is not depicted as it always lies below the hopf locus and brings no contribution considering the whole restrictions the stability region varies with the inertial times as shown in fig 9 where all the quantities have been recast in the original dimensional variables according to klausmeier 1999 the plant mortality b is related to the dimensionless one by b 4 b as it can be noticed despite larger values of inertial times enlarge the region defined by the hopf locus as one can argue from fig 8 they progressively restrict the set of allowed speed according to the stability conditions 23 iii as depicted by the coloured areas in fig 9 finally to gain more insights into this phenomenon we fix the inertial time at τ 0 1 and compare the theoretical predictions 23 iii 27 with the numerical ones extracted from the bifurcation diagram obtained for b 0 5 and built by the xppaut tool ermentrout 2002 results are shown in fig 10 in both panels of this figure the yellow squares define the upper and lower bounds of the admitted wave speed within which the limit cycle represented by blue circles in the right panel is observed as it can be noticed the excellent agreement here obtained provides a further confirmation of the analysis here carried out all the above described results fully agree with the ones depicted in fig 7 and point out that moving far away from the parabolic limit pattern dynamics becomes almost stationary interestingly by direct comparison with field data our findings might in turn provide a strategy to estimate the order of magnitude of inertial effects taking place in dryland vegetation dynamics 5 conclusions in this manuscript we propose a twofold generalization of the klausmeier model that is one of the easiest tools used to describe the formation of vegetation stripes along the slopes of semi arid environments compared to the original parabolic model klausmeier 1999 the one here discussed also accounts for i secondary dispersal of seeds through an additional advection term consolo and valenti 2019 and ii inertial effects on the vegetation component which lead to build up an hyperbolic framework barbera et al 2015 patterned vegetation dynamics are analysed by means of linear stability analysis in order to deduce and characterize the locus of wave instability as a function of all the model parameters moreover additional information on the pattern speed are extracted by means of periodic travelling waves theoretical predictions which are complemented by numerical simulations allow to draw several conclusions first the pattern forming region enlarges reduces as the inertial time seed advection speed increases as depicted in figs 1 and 3 therefore the presence of inertia does not only affect transient dynamics as expected but also plays an active role in allowing pattern dynamics to be observed over a wider range of model parameters moreover the proposed hyperbolic generalization of the klausmeier model may provide a satisfying description of experimental data for both migrating and stationary patterns indeed close to the parabolic limit the model allows to reproduce both directions of pattern propagation as a function of seed advection speed as shown in figs 4 7 on the contrary far from the parabolic limit and independently of secondary seed dispersal the theoretically predicted migration speed approaches the zero value so mimicking the regime of quasi stationary patterns the constraints on the allowed wave speed arising from the hyperbolic nature of the model are particularly tangible in figs 8 9 where the stability region of travelling waves progressively shrinks as the inertial time is increased finally we believe that the results here obtained might shed some light on the current debate on the mechanisms responsible for the effective migration on vegetation bands along slopes of arid terrains at the same time while we are aware of the huge difficulties encountered in addressing such a long term experimental field observations a larger and more accurate availability of field data might provide an indirect estimation of the order of magnitude of plant inertia credit authorship contribution statement giancarlo consolo conceptualization formal analysis

24326,this manuscript tackles the study of vegetation pattern dynamics driven by inertial effects and secondary seed dispersal to achieve this goal an hyperbolic extension of the classical parabolic klausmeier model of vegetation generally used to predict the formation of banded vegetation along the slopes of semiarid environments has been here considered together with an additional advective term mimicking the downslope motion of seeds linear stability analyses have been carried out to inspect the dependence of the wave instability locus on the model parameters with particular emphasis on the role played by inertial time and seed advection speed moreover periodic travelling wave solutions are taken into account to better characterize modulus and direction of the migration speed of striped vegetation patterns theoretical predictions are corroborated by numerical investigations and ecological implications are also discussed in particular it is highlighted how the hyperbolic nature of the model may provide possible justifications about some controversial field observations keywords vegetation stripe patterns hyperbolic reaction advection diffusion models inertial times secondary seed dispersal wave instability travelling wave solutions data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction self organized patchiness in ecosystems is a clear cut example of the occurrence of vegetation patterns in water limited systems von hardenberg et al 2001 gilad et al 2004 meron 2015 zelnik et al 2017 meron 2018 gowda et al 2018 tongway 2001 dunkerley 2018 in particular regular striped patterns formed along the hillsides of many arid and semi arid environments are believed to exhibit a non stationary behaviour which manifests itself as an uphill migration of bands however a larger availability of field data has brought out some controversial interpretations about the effective motion of these patches tongway 2001 dunkerley 2018 many mathematical models and numerical tools have been developed to provide a suitable description of the complex phenomena behind the formation modulation resilience and propagation of such vegetation patterns klausmeier 1999 rietkerk et al 2000 hillerislambers et al 2001 sherratt 2005 siteur 2014 thompson et al 2008 2014 sohoulande djebou and singh 2015 thompson and katul 2009 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 ursino and rulli 2010 langevelde 2016 borgogno et al 2009 sherratt and synodinos 2012 sherratt 2013 van der stelt et al 2013 eigentler and sherratt 2020 marasco et al 2014 gandhi et al 2018 bastiaansen et al 2019 in some previous works thompson et al 2008 2014 thompson and katul 2009 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 ursino and rulli 2010 langevelde 2016 the origin of the above mentioned controversy was attributed to the phenomena of mobilization transport and germination of seeds which can be gathered under the name of secondary seed dispersal it is indeed known that in sloped terrains seeds undergo both a primary dispersal from the plant to the ground followed by a secondary dispersal due to their transport in overland flow this phenomenon has been included in several parabolic models to cite a few hillerislambers et al 2001 saco et al 2007 pueyo et al 2008 thompson et al 2008 thompson and katul 2009 and consolo and valenti 2019 in particular in the work by our group consolo and valenti 2019 secondary dispersal of seeds was included in the framework of the klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 that as known is one of the easiest two compartments models for surface water and vegetation biomass capable of providing a sufficiently adequate description of the formation and movement of vegetation stripes along sloped arid terrains in that work much emphasis was given to the role of initial conditions highlighting how different ecological scenarios can take place when vegetation patterns arise from degradation of homogeneous vegetation or from colonization of bare ground however the parabolic nature of the above model prevented the possibility of taking into account those inertial effects which are observed in the vegetation response in particular for the woody component milchunas and lauenroth 1995 garcia fayos and gasque 2002 deblauwe et al 2011 valentin and d herbés 1999 deblauwe et al 2012 it was indeed emphasized that inertia of existing plant populations namely the tendency to continue residing a given location when the environmental conditions become unfavourable takes an active role in response to climate change and presence of pollutants apart from that inertial effects can even mask future deteriorations in ecosystem conditions so constituting more than just a time lag in response to an ongoing stressor accounting for inertia leads to the development of an hyperbolic framework that as known overcomes the paradox of infinite propagation speed of disturbances and is better suited to describe wave propagation phenomena mendez et al 2010 zemskov and horsthemke 2016 mvogo et al 2018 ai ghoul and eu 1996 hillen 2002 straughan 2011 curró and valenti 2021 the presence of inertia in vegetation dynamics has been considered in some of our previous works consolo et al 2017 2019 2020 2022 consolo and grifó 2022 where it has been emphasized its role both in the transient regime from a spatially homogeneous steady state toward a spatially periodic patterned state and in the modulation of the region of the parameter space in which patterns can be observed however to the best of our knowledge secondary seed dispersal has never been considered in hyperbolic models therefore the aim of the present work is to inspect how the dynamics of non stationary vegetation stripes are affected by the simultaneous action of inertial effects and secondary seed dispersal in detail in order to characterize the features of the emerging migrating patterns linear stability analysis has been performed with particular emphasis on the deduction of the threshold condition for wave instability responsible for the onset of oscillatory periodic patterns moreover to gain more insights into the mechanisms underlying the pattern propagation speed travelling wave solutions have been also taken into account analytical predictions have been corroborated by numerical simulations and by a qualitative comparison with some ecological field observations the manuscript is organized as follows the hyperbolic reaction diffusion advection model is presented in section 2 whereas linear stability analyses focused on non stationary pattern dynamics are addressed in section 3 travelling wave solutions are investigated in section 4 and final remarks are given in section 5 2 model description our analysis originates from the classical parabolic version of the klausmeier model klausmeier 1999 that is one conceptual tool used to mimic striped vegetation dynamics along sloped semi arid environments in its original formulation the model describes the spatio temporal evolution of surface water w x t and vegetation biomass u x t in the presence of an isotropic dispersal of seeds and an anisotropic flow of water through the hillside here water diffusion is neglected since the advection contribution is generally dominant on slopes later in ref consolo and valenti 2019 this model was extended to include the secondary seed dispersal phenomenon and took the 1d dimensionless form 1 u w t 1 0 0 0 u w x x ψ 0 0 ν u w x f u w g u w where the subscript stands for the partial derivative with respect to the indicated variable the x axis points along uphill direction and the advection speeds of plant and water are denoted by ψ and ν respectively the kinetic functions are given by 2 f u w w u 2 b u g u w a w w u 2 where a and b are representative of the rates of average annual rainfall and plant loss respectively note that the original klausmeier model is recovered for ψ 0 to account for the presence of biological inertia brown et al 2001 von holle et al 2003 deblauwe et al 2011 garcia fayos and gasque 2002 milchunas and lauenroth 1995 as well as to provide a better description of pattern propagation hereafter we consider its hyperbolic generalization obtained by means of extended thermodynamics et theory ruggeri and sugiyama 2021 barbera et al 2015 curró and valenti 2021 the model reads 3 u t m u x n u with 4 u u w j m ψ 0 1 0 ν 0 1 τ 0 0 n u f u w g u w 1 τ j being τ and j x t the inertial time and the dissipative flux respectively associated to plant evolution according to et theory the flux is considered as an additional state variable satisfying a thermodynamically consistent balance law τ j t u x j that reduces to the classical gradient based fick s law for vanishing inertial time τ 0 readers interested in the full derivation of the hyperbolic model may refer to ref barbera et al 2015 it is known that for a 2 b the model 3 4 with f u w and g u w given by 2 admits three distinct spatially homogeneous steady states u given by 5 u d 0 a 0 u l u l b u l 0 u s u s b u s 0 where 6 u l a a 2 4 b 2 2 b u s a a 2 4 b 2 2 b 0 u l 1 u s from an ecological viewpoint the first state u d is representative of the desert state whereas the other ones of uniformly vegetated areas note that for a 2 b the desert state is the only admitted one whereas u l u s for a 2 b according to literature realistic values of rainfall and plant loss belong to the ranges b 0 2 and a 0 3 rietkerk 2002 klausmeier 1999 sherratt 2010 moreover water advection speed is generally taken as ν 200 klausmeier 1999 whereas since secondary seed dispersal represents a small percentage of the former mechanism it is realistic to assume ψ ν consolo and valenti 2019 3 wave bifurcation analysis in order to investigate the nature of the steady states 5 a linear stability analysis for the pde system 3 4 is now carried out due to its high variability given by natural human and herbivory effects the plant loss b is considered as the control parameter then by perturbing the steady state namely by looking for solutions in the form of u u u exp ω t i k x we get 7 ω i i k m n u 0 where i denotes the identity matrix u represents the gradient with respect to the field variables and the asterisk indicates the evaluation at u searching non trivial solutions of 7 leads to the following characteristic equation 8 τ ω 3 a 1 i k τ ν ψ ω 2 a 2 i k τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ ω a 3 i k ν f u ψ g w ν k 2 0 where 9 a 1 1 τ f u g w a 2 a 2 k 2 a 2 a 2 1 τ ν ψ a 2 τ f u g w g u f w f u g w a 3 a 3 k 2 a 3 a 3 g w ν ψ a 3 f u g w g u f w let us now focus on the occurrence of the so called wave instability namely the destabilization of a spatially uniform steady state via a perturbation with a non null wavenumber k giving rise to oscillatory in time and periodic in space patterns to this aim we analyse first the local stability under an homogeneous perturbation k 0 in this case the characteristic eq 8 can be factorized and its solutions are 10 ω 1 1 τ 0 ω 2 3 1 2 f u g w f u g w 2 4 f u g w f w g u so that u is stable with respect to homogeneous perturbation iff 11 f u g w 0 f u g w f w g u 0 therefore in the abovementioned range of parameters b 0 2 and a 2 b it can be easily proved that the desert state u d and the vegetated one u s are stable against homogeneous perturbations whereas the vegetated state u l is always unstable thus this latter one cannot gives rise to pattern formation and it will not be further considered in our analysis on the other hand taking into account non homogeneous perturbations around the desert state u d the dispersion relation can be factorized and its solutions are given by 12 ω 1 1 i ν k ω 2 3 1 2 b 1 τ i ψ k b 1 τ 2 k 2 4 τ ψ 2 2 i ψ k 1 τ b consequently u d is always stable under both homogeneous and non homogeneous perturbations being the real parts of all eigenvalues negative k thus the only homogeneously vegetated state configuration that can give rise to oscillatory periodic patterns is u s in particular looking for solutions of the dispersion relation 8 with re ω 0 and im ω 0 for some k 0 setting to zero the real and imaginary parts and combining the resulting equations the critical wavenumber at the onset of instability is ruled by 13 θ 1 k 6 θ 2 k 4 θ 3 k 2 θ 4 0 where 14 θ 1 a 1 β 1 2 β 1 β 3 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ β 3 2 a 3 θ 2 2 β 1 β 2 a 1 β 1 β 4 β 2 β 3 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ 2 β 3 β 4 a 3 β 3 2 a 3 θ 3 a 1 β 2 2 β 2 β 4 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ a 3 β 4 2 2 a 3 β 3 β 4 θ 4 β 4 2 a 3 β 1 τ 2 a 3 ν g w ψ f u ν a 1 2 β 2 τ 2 a 3 ν g w ψ f u a 1 2 ν f u ψ g w β 3 a 1 τ f u 1 τ 2 ν ψ f u g w τ 2 f u ψ g w ν τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ β 4 τ a 1 a 3 a 1 2 a 2 the locus at which wave instability occurs may be obtained by imposing that the cubic eq 13 in k 2 admits three real roots two of which are equal to each other positive and representative of the critical squared wavenumber k c 2 consequently the wave bifurcation locus is implicitly defined by 15 27 θ 4 2 θ 1 2 θ 3 2 θ 2 2 4 θ 3 3 θ 1 4 θ 4 θ 2 3 18 θ 4 θ 3 θ 2 θ 1 0 note that for τ 0 the wave bifurcation locus 15 here obtained reduces to the one found in the parabolic model consolo and valenti 2019 unfortunately due to the highly nonlinear dependence of 15 on the plant loss b information can be extracted from numerical investigations only in fig 1 the loci of wave instability 15 are depicted by solid lines in the b a parameter plane for different inertial times τ 1 100 fixing ν 182 5 and ψ 1 for comparison in the same figure the parabolic locus is also shown red circles pointing out a close agreement with the one obtained in the hyperbolic model for small inertial times τ 1 on the other hand by moving away from the parabolic limit the locus of wave instability shifts up so enlarging the region where oscillatory periodic patterns may be observed in line with our previous results consolo et al 2017 curró and valenti 2021 consolo et al 2022 to confirm this theoretical prediction let us consider the point p 1 0 38 2 8 in the parameter plane see top inset in fig 1 and inspect the wavenumber dependence of real and imaginary parts of the roots of the characteristic equation as the inertial time is varied results shown in fig 2 a reveal that for τ 10 the real part of the largest eigenvalue is always negative so proving that p 1 lies outside the wave instability region on the other hand for τ 20 and τ 100 the existence of ranges of unstable wavenumbers confirm the upward shift of the locus of wave instability that has led p 1 to fall within the instability region see fig 2 b c additional numerical investigations are also performed to better understand the roles of inertial time τ and advection speeds ψ and ν on the bifurcation threshold b c in particular results shown in fig 3 a are obtained for a fixed value of ψ 1 whereas those depicted in fig 3 b correspond to the case ν 182 5 in detail for a fixed value of secondary seed dispersal and independently of the inertial time the decrease of water advection speed leads to an increase of the critical value of the control parameter which in turn represents a reduction of the instability region see fig 3 a this result agrees with the theoretical expectation that the formation of oscillatory patterns requires a non null water advection speed on the other hand for a fixed value of water advection speed the behaviour of the instability threshold depends on the distance from the parabolic limit indeed as depicted in fig 3 b for τ 1 0 1 the critical value of control parameter is almost unaffected by the strength of secondary seed dispersal on the contrary far away from the parabolic limit the role of seeds advection speed becomes more relevant in fact as the parameter ψ decreases the wave instability region enlarges let us now inspect the properties exhibited by oscillatory patterns by moving along the wave bifurcation locus to this aim let us fix three different points on the locus obtained for τ 10 as shown in the bottom inset of fig 1 and precisely p 2 0 244 1 5 p 3 0 270 1 7 and p 4 0 293 1 9 for these points the wavenumber dependence of the most unstable mode at onset characterized by angular frequency ω c and critical wavenumber k c is tracked in fig 4 since the imaginary part determines the modulus and direction of pattern speed s im ω c k c uphill downhill motion is observed for im ω c 0 im ω c 0 whereas stationary patterns originate for im ω c 0 theoretical predictions reveal that downhill motion takes place at the point p 2 see fig 4 a whereas patterns become stationary at p 3 see fig 4 b and move uphill at p 4 see fig 4 c to check the validity of the above results the governing system 3 4 is integrated numerically by means of comsol multiphysics comsol multiphysics in the computational domain x 0 200 over the time window t 0 200 moreover periodic boundary conditions are used and a small perturbation of the steady state u s is taken as initial condition namely patterns originating from degradation of homogeneous vegetation are here considered consolo and valenti 2019 sherratt 2015 results of numerical simulations confirm our predictions as shown in fig 5 the above theoretical results are in line with some body of literature klausmeier 1999 esteban and fairén 2006 which predicts that vegetation groves move upslope as a result of a larger availability of moisture in the upslope margin of the band moreover the presence of downslope seed transport offers a stabilizing mechanism that reduces the bands migration speed and can even reverse the direction of propagation saco et al 2007 thompson et al 2008 2014 however the occurrence of upslope and downslope migration of bands is still under debate due to some controversial field evidences thompson et al 2008 tongway 2001 dunkerley 2018 in particular theoretical observations of downhill movement of bands are sometimes interpreted as a regime in which pattern migration is instead precluded thompson et al 2008 this issue will be investigated in more detail later on in the manuscript according to such ecological considerations let us describe more accurately the occurrence of stationary patterns in a framework enclosing advective terms to this aim let us look for solutions of the dispersion relation 8 characterized by 16 ω 0 re ω k 0 these constraints lead to the following system that defines a turing point in the b a plane and the critical wavenumber k c at which such an instability occurs 17 k c ν f u ψ g w ν ν f u g w f w g u ν f u ψ g w ν ψ g w 0 g w ν ψ 1 τ ν ψ ν f u ψ g w τ ν f u g w f w g u ν f u g w ν ν f u ψ g w τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ 0 as it can be noticed the existence condition arising from 17 1 implies a restriction on the upper limit of seed advection speed 18 ψ b ν 1 u s 2 moreover 17 3 encloses the dependence of the turing point on hyperbolicity indeed by varying the inertial time the occurrence of stationary patterns takes place at different points in the b a plane as represented by the stars in fig 1 in particular decreasing the inertial time the turing point moves upward along the bifurcation locus so enlarging the range in which downhill motion is observed notice that for τ 1 no star is shown since it is out of the meaningful ecological range to describe the inertial time dependence of the turing point b c t we solve system 17 for fixed values of ν and ψ results are shown in fig 6 where the function that best approximates data is also depicted finally let us report some quantitative field estimations of migration speeds of vegetation patches extracted from table 12 2 in tongway 2001 and dunkerley 2018 which gather experimental results from several arid regions those data pointed out that dynamics in sloped terrains range from the quasi stationary case corresponding to almost null migration speed as observed in mexico montaña 1992 mali leprun 1992 somalia boaler and hodge 1964 and australia dunkerley 2018 to uphill motion with speed up to a 1 5 m year as in mexico montaña 1992 mali leprun 1992 and sudan worral 1959 to address a direct comparison with such data let us recast the dimensionless migration speed s and the time t in the original dimensional variables s m year and t year respectively by using the numerical estimates of the ecological parameters provided by klausmeier in klausmeier 1999 we get migration speed s 2 s m year and time t t 4 year note that the inertial time τ scales with the same law as t i e t τ 4 then the dependence of s t is reported in fig 7 for different values of ν and ψ results in panel a reveal that for a fixed value of ν and for small values of inertial times pattern speed s changes progressively sign from positive to negative as the seed advection speed ψ increases on the contrary for large values of inertial times migration speed keeps positive and approaches asymptotically the null value far away from the parabolic limit this behaviour holds independently of the value of the water advection speed as proven in fig 7 b which is obtained for ψ 1 and variable ν these intriguing results allow to claim that the hyperbolic model may provide satisfying interpretations of ecological observations both when patterns migrate uphill tongway 2001 and when they are believed to be stationary dunkerley 2018 indeed in the former case the theoretically predicted maximum speed value about 1 2 m year is in close agreement with the experimental one 1 5 m year reported in sudan tongway 2001 and worral 1959 for ψ 1 this result suggests that the uphill migration of patterns might be associated with a very small percentage of seed advection an increase of which would lead to the opposite behaviour in the latter case the vanishing migration speeds obtained for large values of inertial time yield patterns to behave as they were almost stationary independently of the strength of secondary seed dispersal on the other hand close to the parabolic limit the agreement with field data would require to set both an upper bound 18 to exclude the occurrence of downhill migration thompson et al 2008 and a lower bound to prevent propagation speed to achieve very large values 4 periodic travelling waves the analyses carried out in the previous sections have shed some light on the role played by inertial time and advection terms in the mechanism of formation of oscillatory periodic patterns in this section let us focus in more detail on the characterization of the pattern speed s in the proposed hyperbolic model 3 4 for this reason we look for solutions of the governing system in the form of periodic travelling waves namely u x t u z with z x s t this leads to recast the original pdes system in terms of the following odes one 19 m s i d u d z n u it is trivial to notice that 19 admits the same three steady states 5 moreover since we are interested in the occurrence of wave instability we focus our analysis on the homogeneously vegetated state u s only therefore searching for solutions in the form of u u s u exp ω z the following cubic characteristic equation with real coefficients is obtained 20 ω 3 d 1 ω 2 d 2 ω d 3 0 where 21 d 1 s 2 a 1 s τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ a 3 ν s τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 d 2 s a 2 ν f u ψ g w ν s τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 d 3 a 3 ν s τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 then routh hurwitz criterion is applied to determine the local stability of u s namely 22 re ω 0 ω d 1 0 d 3 0 d 1 d 2 d 3 0 the first two conditions lead to 23 i if τ f u 1 0 s 4 s 2 s 1 s min s 2 s 3 ii if τ f u 1 0 s 4 s 2 s 1 s s 3 s 4 s s 2 iii if τ f u 1 0 s 1 s 3 max s 1 s 4 s s 2 iv if τ f u 1 0 s 1 s 3 s 1 s s 3 s 4 s s 2 where 24 s 1 2 1 2 ψ ψ 2 4 τ s 3 4 1 2 a 1 τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ 2 4 a 1 a 3 note that 23 represents the restrictions provided by the hyperbolic nature of the model that as expected imposes the speed of propagation to be limited indeed in the parabolic limit τ 0 the previous conditions reduce to 25 s s 3 s s 4 s 2 ψ ν s ψ ν g w g w f u s ψ g w ν f u s ν f u g w f w g u 0 where 26 s 3 4 1 2 ψ ν ψ ν 2 4 g w which highlight the absence of an upper limit so allowing the possibility to achieve the paradox of an infinite propagation speed on the other hand violation of the last condition in 22 defines the locus of hopf bifurcation 27 s 2 a 1 s τ ν f u ψ g w ν ψ a 3 s a 2 ν f u ψ g w a 3 ν ψ τ s 2 τ ψ s 1 0 as known sherratt 2010 sherratt and lord 2007 sherratt 2011 the occurrence of hopf bifurcation at u s to a small amplitude periodic solution of the odes system 19 corresponds to a travelling wave solution of the pdes system 3 4 unfortunately due to the highly nonlinear structure of the implicit locus 27 on the plant loss b information can only be extracted numerically outcomes of this analysis are shown in fig 8 where the locus of hopf bifurcation is depicted for different values of the inertial time τ considering ν 182 5 ψ 1 and a 2 8 this parameter set falls into setup iii of 23 in the same figure the horizontal lines represent the constraints s s 1 and s s 2 whereas the condition s s 4 is not depicted as it always lies below the hopf locus and brings no contribution considering the whole restrictions the stability region varies with the inertial times as shown in fig 9 where all the quantities have been recast in the original dimensional variables according to klausmeier 1999 the plant mortality b is related to the dimensionless one by b 4 b as it can be noticed despite larger values of inertial times enlarge the region defined by the hopf locus as one can argue from fig 8 they progressively restrict the set of allowed speed according to the stability conditions 23 iii as depicted by the coloured areas in fig 9 finally to gain more insights into this phenomenon we fix the inertial time at τ 0 1 and compare the theoretical predictions 23 iii 27 with the numerical ones extracted from the bifurcation diagram obtained for b 0 5 and built by the xppaut tool ermentrout 2002 results are shown in fig 10 in both panels of this figure the yellow squares define the upper and lower bounds of the admitted wave speed within which the limit cycle represented by blue circles in the right panel is observed as it can be noticed the excellent agreement here obtained provides a further confirmation of the analysis here carried out all the above described results fully agree with the ones depicted in fig 7 and point out that moving far away from the parabolic limit pattern dynamics becomes almost stationary interestingly by direct comparison with field data our findings might in turn provide a strategy to estimate the order of magnitude of inertial effects taking place in dryland vegetation dynamics 5 conclusions in this manuscript we propose a twofold generalization of the klausmeier model that is one of the easiest tools used to describe the formation of vegetation stripes along the slopes of semi arid environments compared to the original parabolic model klausmeier 1999 the one here discussed also accounts for i secondary dispersal of seeds through an additional advection term consolo and valenti 2019 and ii inertial effects on the vegetation component which lead to build up an hyperbolic framework barbera et al 2015 patterned vegetation dynamics are analysed by means of linear stability analysis in order to deduce and characterize the locus of wave instability as a function of all the model parameters moreover additional information on the pattern speed are extracted by means of periodic travelling waves theoretical predictions which are complemented by numerical simulations allow to draw several conclusions first the pattern forming region enlarges reduces as the inertial time seed advection speed increases as depicted in figs 1 and 3 therefore the presence of inertia does not only affect transient dynamics as expected but also plays an active role in allowing pattern dynamics to be observed over a wider range of model parameters moreover the proposed hyperbolic generalization of the klausmeier model may provide a satisfying description of experimental data for both migrating and stationary patterns indeed close to the parabolic limit the model allows to reproduce both directions of pattern propagation as a function of seed advection speed as shown in figs 4 7 on the contrary far from the parabolic limit and independently of secondary seed dispersal the theoretically predicted migration speed approaches the zero value so mimicking the regime of quasi stationary patterns the constraints on the allowed wave speed arising from the hyperbolic nature of the model are particularly tangible in figs 8 9 where the stability region of travelling waves progressively shrinks as the inertial time is increased finally we believe that the results here obtained might shed some light on the current debate on the mechanisms responsible for the effective migration on vegetation bands along slopes of arid terrains at the same time while we are aware of the huge difficulties encountered in addressing such a long term experimental field observations a larger and more accurate availability of field data might provide an indirect estimation of the order of magnitude of plant inertia credit authorship contribution statement giancarlo consolo conceptualization formal analysis

24327,metacommunities are the product of species dispersal and topology metacommunity studies often use spatially implicit models implemented by fully connected topologies in which the precise spatial arrangement of habitat patches is not specified few studies use spatially explicit models even though real world metacommunities are likely structured by topology here we test whether a spatially implicit resource consumption model based on a fully connected topology could predict the structure of spatially explicit metacommunities having controlled for environmental heterogeneity we focus specifically on the effects of species dispersal and topology on metacommunity structure we classified the topologies according to the shortest path between the most distant nodes i e the graph diameter topologies with small diameters are tightly connected whereas large diameter graphs are loosely connected some general trends emerged with increasing dispersal rate such as a hump shaped pattern in α diversity and a plateau followed by a decline in γ diversity however the importance of topology was also apparent α diversity peaked at low dispersal rates in small diameter topologies but at high dispersal rates in large diameter topologies at low dispersal rates α diversity was higher in spatially implicit than in spatially explicit metacommunities at medium dispersal we detected stronger species sorting in the small diameter than in the large diameter topologies increasing dispersal caused α diversity to decline more dramatically in small diameter topologies smaller metacommunities were dominated by regional competitors whereas larger communities exhibited patterns of species biomass distribution leading to emergent niche structures increasing dispersal caused the mean productivity of each patch to undergo partial declines in spatially implicit metacommunities but continue to decline sharply in spatially explicit metacommunities we conclude that spatially implicit models should be used cautiously when predicting the biodiversity community composition or ecosystem functions of spatially explicit metacommunities at medium and especially at high dispersal rates keywords spatially implicit spatially explicit metacommunity topology dispersal diversity productivity community composition resource consumption model data availability we have shared the research code in the appendices 1 introduction metacommunity theory integrates local and regional community dynamics relating biodiversity and ecosystem functions at different spatial scales leibold chase 2018 thompson et al 2020 fundamental tenets of metacommunity theory include species dispersal and topology which describes the spatial arrangement of patches leibold chase 2018 species dispersal determines the rate of species movement within and between ecological communities massol et al 2017 thompson fronhofer 2019 thompson et al 2020 vilmi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 leibold et al 2017 conceptualized three types of dispersal dispersal limitation dispersal sufficiency and dispersal surplus dispersal limitation prevents species from reaching patches where their productivity is the highest mouquet et al 2002 leibold et al 2017 dispersal sufficiency the product of species sorting allows each species to find its optimum patch which increases the α diversity of individual patches and leads to high productivity loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 leibold et al 2017 dispersal surplus counteracts the effects of dispersal limitation and dispersal sufficiency in the short term poor competitors are able to coexist within patches but eventually mass effects allow the best overall competitors to dominate individual patches causing dramatic declines in both α and γ diversity and reducing mean productivity loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 leibold et al 2017 a key point is that most theoretical studies of dispersal limitation dispersal sufficiency and dispersal surplus have been based on spatially implicit models in which the precise spatial location of habitat patches was not specified in the model leibold et al 2017 suzuki economo 2021 in theoretical studies if the dispersal rate is set to zero all patches are isolated from each other no information is transferred and the system is closed when the system is open dispersal depends on topology economo keitt 2008 topology determines how patches are arranged in relation to one another economo 2011 suzuki economo 2021 in the real world topology describes the spatial distribution and connectedness of landscape patches informing conservation strategies such as reserve size minor urban 2008 van teeffelen et al 2012 and explaining spatial insurance effects where species escape from competition in heterogeneous landscapes thompson et al 2014 a second key point is that spatially implicit models always use fully connected topologies in which all patches are connected directly with other patches loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 suzuki economo 2021 real world metacommunities even those of relatively simple natural microcosms such as ponds or epiphytes are rarely this interconnected which raises the question of whether spatially implicit models can be used to predict the structure of spatially explicit metacommunities while some theoretical studies have applied complicated topologies to fit experimental metacommunities e g hubert et al 2015 thompson gonzalez 2017 thompson et al 2017 these topologies were highly susceptible to disturbance and extensions or modifications were impossible an effective way to model the spatial topologies of metacommunities would be to use graph theory newman 2003 minor urban 2008 relatively new to metacommunity ecology graph theory has been used extensively for the study of computer networks minor urban 2008 given that most studies of metacommunities are based on resource consumption models loreau et al 2003 shanafelt et al 2015 thompson gonzalez 2017 thompson et al 2017 leibold chase 2018 we used a resource consumption model and six simple topologies taken from computing networks i e fully connected spatially implicit star line ring lattice and tree structures fig 1 we asked whether under different levels of species dispersal a spatially implicit model could predict trends in α and γ diversity community composition ecosystem function and even spatial variations in the α diversity and ecosystem function of different patches in any of the six different topologies whilst environmental heterogeneity affects the structure of metacommunities leibold chase 2018 ben hur kadmon 2020 suzuki economo 2021 thompson et al 2021 that is outside the scope of this study and we therefore controlled for environmental effects by assuming that although environmental conditions differ between patches overall environmental heterogeneity would be the same for all topologies we anticipated that our spatially implicit model would predict diversity ecosystem function and community composition under low and high dispersal rates species sorting under low dispersal would result in patches with similar environmental conditions across topologies being dominated by the same best competitor leading to consistent species composition whereas dispersal surplus under high dispersal would result in superior competitors dominating all metacommunities again leading to consistent composition loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 consequently mean productivity within each patch would also be consistent for all topologies with similar environmental conditions we believe relatively low dispersal rates prevented local diversity from declining in the spatially explicit topologies of suzuki and economo 2021 when they asked similar questions to us but measured species diversity patterns only however we also anticipated that our spatially implicit model would fail to predict diversity ecosystem function and community composition at intermediate dispersal rates because of variations in the relative strength of species sorting and mass effects in different topologies 2 methods we use the resource consumption model loreau et al 2003 gonzalez 2009 gonzalez et al 2009 shanafelt et al 2015 which allows environmental conditions to fluctuate with time whilst maintaining species diversity as in previous studies we assume that all species compete for a single limited resource such as nitrogen and convert it into new biomass unlike previous studies our model allows environmental conditions to differ between patches as though each patch was a different landscape but overall environmental conditions remain constant each species has an optimal environmental value superior competitors exhibit a close match between their optimal environmental values and the environmental conditions of a patch and will therefore consume large amounts of resource all metacommunities consisted of the same number of patches with the same levels of environmental heterogeneity different topologies differed only in the connections between patches we set the unit of each parameter as shanafelt et al 2015 2 1 resource consumption model in our resource consumption model biomass of species i on patch j at time t p i j t units as g increases due to the presence of species converting resource into biomass mortality reduces biomass within a patch as does species emigration from a patch biomass within a patch increases as species immigrate from other patches defined as the solution of 1 d p i j t d t e i j c i j r j t p i j t new production m i j p i j t mortality a k 1 k j m j p i k t m k immigration a p i j t emigration r j t unit as ml to distinguish from the unit of biomass is the limited resource on patch j at time t it is supplied from outside of the metacommunity at each time interval and declines due to lost and species consumption defined as the solution of 2 d r j t d t i j l j r j t r j t i 1 s c i j p i j t we numbered all patches from 1 to n n is the number of patches dimensionless and all species from 1 to s where s dimensionless is the initial number of species e i j g ml is the rate of species i

the loss rate of biomass of species i on patch j a 1 h is the dispersal rate of species for the sake of simplicity we assume that all species have the same a which determines the fraction of dispersers at each time interval m j is the number of patches connected with patch j another popular spatially implicit metacommunity model is mouquet and loreau 2003 the main difference between this model and our model is that in their model reproduction depends on dispersal rate and only new species disperse in our model reproduction depends on the available resource and all species have a chance to disperse 2 2 six simple topologies we apply six simple topologies often seen in computer networks fig 1 a brief introduction for each of them is as follows 2 2 1 fully connected topology all patches are connected meaning that species from a patch can disperse to other patches via an edge in the real world constructing a fully connected metacommunity would be laborious and expensive because of the large number of edges n n 1 2 and fully connected metacommunities are not easy to extend or modify however a fully connected topology is the most reliable structure in the event that patches or edges are disturbed we use this topology to represent a spatially implicit structure 2 2 2 star topology all patches are connected to a central patch e g patch 1 in fig 1 and species disperse from one patch to another through the central patch meaning the central patch plays a buffering role with the exception of the central patch this topology is easy to extend and modify the number of edges is n 1 the star topology is less resistant to disturbance than the fully connected topology because when an edge or the central patch is removed connectivity is lost 2 2 3 lattice topology this type of topology is rarely seen in computer networks but is easy to design in experimental metacommunity studies lattice topologies are essentially grids with patches located at the intersection of each edge patches are connected via several paths if n patches are distributed as an n r n c lattice where n r and n c are the number of patches in each row and column respectively then the number of edges in this lattice is n r n c 1 n r 1 n c the lattice topology is more resistant to disturbance because the system remains connected even when several patches or edges are damaged 2 2 4 tree topology the tree topology has root patches and each root patch has two child patches in our model see fig 1 child patches can be added to a root patch which has fewer than two child patches but the child patches will become unconnected if any root patches or edges are removed the number of edges in this topology is n 1 2 2 5 ring topology each patch connects with two neighboring patches which together form a ring shape species can disperse clockwise or counterclockwise meador 2008 either way dispersers must pass through all patches located between the patch they emigrate from and the patch they immigrate to meador 2008 this topology is easy to set up but the ring is temporarily broken during extension of the ring topology the number of edges is n if more than one patch or edge are removed the system becomes unconnected 2 2 6 line topology in the line topology the first and last patch are unconnected so there is only one route along which species can disperse this structure is easy to extend but less resistant to disturbance since it becomes unconnected when any of the intermediate patches or edges are removed the number of edges is n 1 topologies can be classified according to the number of edges of the shortest path between the most distant nodes known as the graph diameter west 2001 the diameters of our topologies can be classified into small medium and large groups the fully connected and star topologies had graph diameters of 1 and 2 the tree and lattice topologies had diameters of 8 and 9 the ring and line topologies had diameters of 15 and 29 topologies with small diameters consist of a series of tight connections whereas larger graph diameters consist of loose connections 2 3 simulations we set the number of patches to n 30 in all topologies and numbered each patch as in fig 1 environmental conditions defined by equation 4 were consistent within patches of a similar color or numbered sequentially for different topologies we set the initial species richness to s 30 and numbered the species from 1 to 30 setting the optimal environmental value of each species according to equation 5 all species had the same e i j and m i j both values set to 0 2 for all patches loreau et al 2003 gonzalez et al 2009 and all patches had the same i j and l j values set to 165 and 10 respectively gonzalez et al 2009 we set these parameters based on previous studies which applied the resource consumption model we set the dispersal rate a to 37 different values ranging from 0 0001 to 0 001 with intervals of 0 0001 ranging from 0 001 to 0 01 with intervals of 0 001 ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 with intervals of 0 01 and ranging from 0 1 to 1 with intervals of 0 1 hence we have 37 dispersal rates 6 topologies 222 simulations with each simulation run for 2 10 7 time steps to reach equilibrium we set a dynamic cutoff at p i j t 0 01 g meaning that species became extinct from a patch if their biomass fell below this value the differential equations of 1 and 2 are simulated by using the forward euler method with dt 0 001 we also tested the results for different dt observing the same patterns when dt was relatively large such as 0 005 and 0 01 see the results of dt 0 01 in the appendices but the system was not at steady state when dt increased for example greater than 0 1 we controlled for spatial heterogeneity using the fully connected spatially implicit topology in which all patches were connected directly 2 4 metrics we used the bray curtis dissimilarity index to measure the community composition of each patch comparing patches of the fully connected topology with all other topologies in addition we measured the total biomass of each species summing the biomass of that species across all patches in the whole metacommunity the α diversity number of species within each patch the γ diversity of the metacommunities and the coefficient of variation hereafter cv defined as standard deviation mean of α diversity across patches we also measured the productivity of each patch j defined as the production of new biomass per unit time g h loreau et al 2003 6 φ j t r j t i 1 s e i j c i j t p i j t as well as productivity per patch we measured the cv of productivity between patches similations were implemented in java topologies and similarity of community composition were generated using the igraph and vegan packages in r and data were analysed in r 4 0 4 r 2021 all codes can be found in the appendices 3 results 3 1 community composition under low dispersal strong species sorting appeared in all topologies see a 0 0001 and a 0 001 in fig 2 under medium dispersal mass effects increased the biomass of the inferior species resulting in slight differences in community composition between topologies see a 0 01 in fig 2 however the best competitor of the central patch in the star topology went extinct i e in fig 2 the color of the first species on the first patch is white when a 0 0001 but is red on all patches where a 0 01 under high dispersal in the fully connected star tree and lattice topologies whole metacommunities were dominated by a few species and the optimal environmental values of these dominant species were located more centrally between 0 and 1 in the fully connected topology than in the other topologies in the line and ring topologies species with extreme environmental values dominated the patches with extreme environmental conditions whereas species with medium environmental values showed dominance in the patches with intermediate environmental conditions see a 1 in fig 2 overall as the diameters of the topologies increased dominant species exhibited more extreme environmental values we compared community composition between two patches with the same environmental conditions one from the fully connected topology and the other from one of the other topologies in all topologies increasing disperal rates caused reduced similarity in community composition fig 3 low dispersal rates resulted in almost the same community composition within patches across all topologies a 0 0001 in fig 3 medium dispersal rates e g a 0 01 increased the similarity between patches with extreme environmental conditions more than other patches high dispersal rates e g a 0 1 caused patches with intermediate environmental conditions to become more similar than patches with extreme environmental condititions when the dispersal rate was 1 the overall similarity was toward zero fig 3 however similarity was greater than zero in the line and ring topologies a 1 in fig 3 in contrast with the other topologies the similarity of patch 1 in the star topology was lowest when dispersal rate was low and highest when dispersal rate was 1 fig 3 at around 100 total biomass of each species in the whole metacommunity was almost identical under low dispersal rates for all topologies see a 0 0001 in fig 4 it differed slightly under medium dispersal rates for the large diameter topologies but remained the same for the fully connected topology see a 0 01 in fig 4 for the star topology the total biomass of species with environmental values of h 1 was zero since they had been outcompeted as the best competitors of the central patch patch 1 see also fig 2 total biomass differed greatly under high dispersal especially for the topologies with medium to large diameters with clumps of species appearing as one would expect from niche partitioning the number of clumps increased from one to four in the tree lattice ring and line topologies respectively a 1 in fig 4 3 2 diversity in line with other studies loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 shanafelt et al 2015 increasing dispersal first increased and then decreased α diversity whereas γ diversity remained constant before eventually decreasing in all topologies fig 5a and b exact trends of α and γ diversity varied between topologies α diversity was highest 30 species in the widest dispersal window of the fully connected topology where the logarithm governing dispersal rates was between 7 5 to 2 5 fig 5a the same result could be seen in the star topology but with a narrower dispersal window from 5 0 to 2 3 and a lower α diversity 29 species for the lattice and tree topologies medium dispersal rates gave the highest α diversity whereas in the line and ring topologies α diversity peaked at relatively higher dispersal rates also dependent on topology were the tipping points at which γ diversity started to decline at high rates of dispersal both α and γ diversity were higher in the line and ring topologies than in other topologies fig 5a and b α diversity varied between patches in the different topologies fig 5c and fig a 1 in all but the star topology dispersal caused the cv of α diversity to increase at first and then decrease fig 5c the key difference between the topologies was the point at which increasing dispersal caused the cv of α diversity to peak this peak occurred at low dispersal in the fully connected topology intermediate dispersal in the lattice and tree topologies and high dispersal in the line and ring topologies see insert panels in fig 5c in the star topology which differed completely from the other topologies increasing dispersal caused a decline in the cv of α diversity within patches fig 5c 3 3 productivity increasing dispersal caused the mean productivity of each patch to decrease in all topologies and the rate of decline became steeper at higher dispersal rates fig 6a see also the productivity of each patch across all topologies in fig a 2 in the fully connected topology even under very high dispersal rates mean productivity remained constant whereas it declined sharply for the star topology and remained relatively flat in the line and ring topologies as with mean productivity the cv of productivity between patches remained constant at first but then increased with dispersal in all but the fully connected topology fig 6b in which it declined slightly at very high dispersal rates under high dispersal rates the cv of productivity increased sharply in the star topology and remained flat in the line and ring topologies 4 discussion we applied a resource consumption model to six simple topologies fully connected spatially implicit star tree lattice ring and line structures with different diameters to investigate whether a spatially implicit model could consistently predict the structures of spatially explicit metacommunities under high dispersal our spatially implicit model failed to predict the structure of spatially explicit metacommunities including community composition exact α and γ diversity patterns of total species biomass distribution productivity and cv of α diversity and productivity some trends were apparent across all models for example at low dispersal strong environmental filtering led each patch to be dominated by its best competitor whereas more inferior competitors appeared in all patches at medium dispersal and whole metacommunities were dominated by several species due to mass effects at high dispersal consequently α diversity first increased and then decreased and γ diversity remained constant and then decreased at low dispersal e g a 0 0001 community compositions of given patches were consistent across topologies fig 2 4 due to strong environmental filtering which allowed each patch to be dominated by its best competitor suzuki economo 2021 γ diversity and mean productivity were also consistent across all topologies and the cv of α diversity between patches was low fig 5 and 6 however the high levels of connectedness between patches in the fully connected topology allowed more inferior species to appear in all patches even under very low dispersal rates which is why the α diversity was higher under the fully connected topology than in other topologies fig 5 our spatially implicit model could not predict the α diversity of spatially explicit metacommunities even under very low dispersal rates hence α diversity remained highest over the greatest range of dispersal in the fully connected topology than in other topologies at medium dispersal a 0 01 the number and identity of inferior species which appeared in each patch differed between patches and between topologies which led the diversity and community composition to fluctuate within patches and topologies figs 2 5 resulting in variable declines in productivity fig 6 mouquet loreau 2003 leibold chase 2018 the central patch patch 1 of the star topology represented a hub meaning that all dispersers had to pass through this patch before reaching their destination and these transient species converted resource and outcompeted the best competitor of the central patch at high dispersal the smallest diameter topologies were dominated by generalist species with medium environmental values fig 2 these species were also the best competitors at the regional scale consistent with other studies mouquet loreau 2002 loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 gonzalez et al 2009 shanafelt et al 2015 contrary to our expectations increasing dispersal caused extreme shifts in the community compositions of medium to large diameter topologies for example the patches with extreme environmental conditions in the large diameter topologies were completely dominated by a few species with extreme environmental values fig 2 fewer connections between patches meant that species could disperse only to neighboring patches particularly at high dispersal rates this process led to the emergent niche structure rael et al 2018 observed in the large diameter topologies fig 4 patches with medium environmental conditions had similarities greater than zero between the fully connected topology and the line and ring topologies fig 3 because generalist species with medium environmental values also achieved greater biomass in patches with medium environmental conditions in the line and ring topologies fig 2 as we predicted both α and γ diversity declined at very high dispersal rates in all topologies but greater numbers of species could be maintained in the line and ring than in other topologies fig 5 delaying the reduction in productivity fig 6 in the fully connected topology the best regional competitors dominated all patches at relative to very high dispersal rates which kept mean productivity constant and caused slight declines in the cv of productivity fig 6 metacommunities are the product of complex interconnections between species dispersal and network topologies governed by environmental factors without these interconnections metacommunities would exist as random patches rather than being the products of species sorting and mass effects leibold et al 2004 suzuki economo 2021 species sorting and mass effects work together and the relative importance of these mechanisms for diversity is contingent upon dispersal rates and environmental filtering suzuki economo 2021 environmental filtering and dispersal play opposite roles in community assembly environmental filtering strengthens interspecific competition allowing the best competitors to exclude less competitive species and dominante in each patch ben hur kadmon 2020 dispersal allows species to escape from competitive exclusion appearing in patches where they could not survive without dispersal amarasekare nisbet 2001 leibold et al 2017 regardless of topology mass effects are proportional to species dispersal whereas species sorting is the opposite in our model suzuki and economo 2021 proposed that topologies with few loops promote species sorting and we have confirmed this at high dispersal rates fig 2 fig 4 and fig a 3 on the contrary under medium dispersal rates e g a 0 01 in figs 2 and 4 we found species sorting to be stronger in the small diameter topologies such as the fully connected and star topologies than in the large diameter topologies see fig 2 fig 4 and fig a 3 under high dispersal the emergent niche structure of species biomass distribution patterns rael et al 2018 appeared in topologies with large diameters a similar feature to that mentioned in suzuki and economo 2021 in previous studies species traits dictated whether niche structures emerged further strengthening the heterogeneity of species interactions rael et al 2018 in our model species trait differences were consistent between topologies but the spatial structure of the topologies altered the species interactions neither dispersal limitation nor dispersal sufficiency played a role in our model only dispersal surplus was occurring with all species appearing in all patches from the start species sorting was at its most powerful when dispersal rate was zero leibold chase 2018 and environmental conditions were filtering out the best competitors from each patch our results appear to conflict with previous studies in which dispersal sufficiency caused species sorting and dispersal surplus generated mass effects leibold et al 2017 leibold chase 2018 however in these studies species were distributed randomly between patches meaning that the best competitors may not have existed in their preferred patches from the start in models like ours all species have equal opportunities to appear in all patches from the beginning 5 conclusion our spatially implicit model successfully predicted community composition γ diversity and productivity at low dispersal rates for all topologies although α diversity was higher in the spatially implicit than in any of the spatially explicit topologies at high dispersal rates and given that the success of each topology depends on the exact structure of metacommunities none of these characteristics were successfully predicted our aim was to test the resource consumption model under various assumptions in the hope of suggesting a general level of accuracy for this one spatially implicit model and further tests involving various other models and parameters are needed in the meantime we tentatively conclude that spatially implicit models may be problematic in the study of spatially explicit metacommunities

24327,metacommunities are the product of species dispersal and topology metacommunity studies often use spatially implicit models implemented by fully connected topologies in which the precise spatial arrangement of habitat patches is not specified few studies use spatially explicit models even though real world metacommunities are likely structured by topology here we test whether a spatially implicit resource consumption model based on a fully connected topology could predict the structure of spatially explicit metacommunities having controlled for environmental heterogeneity we focus specifically on the effects of species dispersal and topology on metacommunity structure we classified the topologies according to the shortest path between the most distant nodes i e the graph diameter topologies with small diameters are tightly connected whereas large diameter graphs are loosely connected some general trends emerged with increasing dispersal rate such as a hump shaped pattern in α diversity and a plateau followed by a decline in γ diversity however the importance of topology was also apparent α diversity peaked at low dispersal rates in small diameter topologies but at high dispersal rates in large diameter topologies at low dispersal rates α diversity was higher in spatially implicit than in spatially explicit metacommunities at medium dispersal we detected stronger species sorting in the small diameter than in the large diameter topologies increasing dispersal caused α diversity to decline more dramatically in small diameter topologies smaller metacommunities were dominated by regional competitors whereas larger communities exhibited patterns of species biomass distribution leading to emergent niche structures increasing dispersal caused the mean productivity of each patch to undergo partial declines in spatially implicit metacommunities but continue to decline sharply in spatially explicit metacommunities we conclude that spatially implicit models should be used cautiously when predicting the biodiversity community composition or ecosystem functions of spatially explicit metacommunities at medium and especially at high dispersal rates keywords spatially implicit spatially explicit metacommunity topology dispersal diversity productivity community composition resource consumption model data availability we have shared the research code in the appendices 1 introduction metacommunity theory integrates local and regional community dynamics relating biodiversity and ecosystem functions at different spatial scales leibold chase 2018 thompson et al 2020 fundamental tenets of metacommunity theory include species dispersal and topology which describes the spatial arrangement of patches leibold chase 2018 species dispersal determines the rate of species movement within and between ecological communities massol et al 2017 thompson fronhofer 2019 thompson et al 2020 vilmi et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 leibold et al 2017 conceptualized three types of dispersal dispersal limitation dispersal sufficiency and dispersal surplus dispersal limitation prevents species from reaching patches where their productivity is the highest mouquet et al 2002 leibold et al 2017 dispersal sufficiency the product of species sorting allows each species to find its optimum patch which increases the α diversity of individual patches and leads to high productivity loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 leibold et al 2017 dispersal surplus counteracts the effects of dispersal limitation and dispersal sufficiency in the short term poor competitors are able to coexist within patches but eventually mass effects allow the best overall competitors to dominate individual patches causing dramatic declines in both α and γ diversity and reducing mean productivity loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 leibold et al 2017 a key point is that most theoretical studies of dispersal limitation dispersal sufficiency and dispersal surplus have been based on spatially implicit models in which the precise spatial location of habitat patches was not specified in the model leibold et al 2017 suzuki economo 2021 in theoretical studies if the dispersal rate is set to zero all patches are isolated from each other no information is transferred and the system is closed when the system is open dispersal depends on topology economo keitt 2008 topology determines how patches are arranged in relation to one another economo 2011 suzuki economo 2021 in the real world topology describes the spatial distribution and connectedness of landscape patches informing conservation strategies such as reserve size minor urban 2008 van teeffelen et al 2012 and explaining spatial insurance effects where species escape from competition in heterogeneous landscapes thompson et al 2014 a second key point is that spatially implicit models always use fully connected topologies in which all patches are connected directly with other patches loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 suzuki economo 2021 real world metacommunities even those of relatively simple natural microcosms such as ponds or epiphytes are rarely this interconnected which raises the question of whether spatially implicit models can be used to predict the structure of spatially explicit metacommunities while some theoretical studies have applied complicated topologies to fit experimental metacommunities e g hubert et al 2015 thompson gonzalez 2017 thompson et al 2017 these topologies were highly susceptible to disturbance and extensions or modifications were impossible an effective way to model the spatial topologies of metacommunities would be to use graph theory newman 2003 minor urban 2008 relatively new to metacommunity ecology graph theory has been used extensively for the study of computer networks minor urban 2008 given that most studies of metacommunities are based on resource consumption models loreau et al 2003 shanafelt et al 2015 thompson gonzalez 2017 thompson et al 2017 leibold chase 2018 we used a resource consumption model and six simple topologies taken from computing networks i e fully connected spatially implicit star line ring lattice and tree structures fig 1 we asked whether under different levels of species dispersal a spatially implicit model could predict trends in α and γ diversity community composition ecosystem function and even spatial variations in the α diversity and ecosystem function of different patches in any of the six different topologies whilst environmental heterogeneity affects the structure of metacommunities leibold chase 2018 ben hur kadmon 2020 suzuki economo 2021 thompson et al 2021 that is outside the scope of this study and we therefore controlled for environmental effects by assuming that although environmental conditions differ between patches overall environmental heterogeneity would be the same for all topologies we anticipated that our spatially implicit model would predict diversity ecosystem function and community composition under low and high dispersal rates species sorting under low dispersal would result in patches with similar environmental conditions across topologies being dominated by the same best competitor leading to consistent species composition whereas dispersal surplus under high dispersal would result in superior competitors dominating all metacommunities again leading to consistent composition loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 consequently mean productivity within each patch would also be consistent for all topologies with similar environmental conditions we believe relatively low dispersal rates prevented local diversity from declining in the spatially explicit topologies of suzuki and economo 2021 when they asked similar questions to us but measured species diversity patterns only however we also anticipated that our spatially implicit model would fail to predict diversity ecosystem function and community composition at intermediate dispersal rates because of variations in the relative strength of species sorting and mass effects in different topologies 2 methods we use the resource consumption model loreau et al 2003 gonzalez 2009 gonzalez et al 2009 shanafelt et al 2015 which allows environmental conditions to fluctuate with time whilst maintaining species diversity as in previous studies we assume that all species compete for a single limited resource such as nitrogen and convert it into new biomass unlike previous studies our model allows environmental conditions to differ between patches as though each patch was a different landscape but overall environmental conditions remain constant each species has an optimal environmental value superior competitors exhibit a close match between their optimal environmental values and the environmental conditions of a patch and will therefore consume large amounts of resource all metacommunities consisted of the same number of patches with the same levels of environmental heterogeneity different topologies differed only in the connections between patches we set the unit of each parameter as shanafelt et al 2015 2 1 resource consumption model in our resource consumption model biomass of species i on patch j at time t p i j t units as g increases due to the presence of species converting resource into biomass mortality reduces biomass within a patch as does species emigration from a patch biomass within a patch increases as species immigrate from other patches defined as the solution of 1 d p i j t d t e i j c i j r j t p i j t new production m i j p i j t mortality a k 1 k j m j p i k t m k immigration a p i j t emigration r j t unit as ml to distinguish from the unit of biomass is the limited resource on patch j at time t it is supplied from outside of the metacommunity at each time interval and declines due to lost and species consumption defined as the solution of 2 d r j t d t i j l j r j t r j t i 1 s c i j p i j t we numbered all patches from 1 to n n is the number of patches dimensionless and all species from 1 to s where s dimensionless is the initial number of species e i j g ml is the rate of species i converting the consumed resource into new biomass on patch j c i j 1 g h is the rate of species i consuming resource on patch j defined as gonzalez et al 2009 3 c i j 0 15 1 h i e j 1 5 where the baseline maximum consumption rate is 0 15 1 g h and it is scaled down based on the difference between h i and e j e j dimensionless is environmental condition of patch j defined as 4 e j 1 j 1 e j 1 1 n 1 2 j n h i dimensionless is the optimal environmental value of species i defined as 5 h i 1 i 1 h i 1 1 s 1 2 i s i j ml h and l j 1 h are the resource input and loss rate respectively m i j 1 h is the loss rate of biomass of species i on patch j a 1 h is the dispersal rate of species for the sake of simplicity we assume that all species have the same a which determines the fraction of dispersers at each time interval m j is the number of patches connected with patch j another popular spatially implicit metacommunity model is mouquet and loreau 2003 the main difference between this model and our model is that in their model reproduction depends on dispersal rate and only new species disperse in our model reproduction depends on the available resource and all species have a chance to disperse 2 2 six simple topologies we apply six simple topologies often seen in computer networks fig 1 a brief introduction for each of them is as follows 2 2 1 fully connected topology all patches are connected meaning that species from a patch can disperse to other patches via an edge in the real world constructing a fully connected metacommunity would be laborious and expensive because of the large number of edges n n 1 2 and fully connected metacommunities are not easy to extend or modify however a fully connected topology is the most reliable structure in the event that patches or edges are disturbed we use this topology to represent a spatially implicit structure 2 2 2 star topology all patches are connected to a central patch e g patch 1 in fig 1 and species disperse from one patch to another through the central patch meaning the central patch plays a buffering role with the exception of the central patch this topology is easy to extend and modify the number of edges is n 1 the star topology is less resistant to disturbance than the fully connected topology because when an edge or the central patch is removed connectivity is lost 2 2 3 lattice topology this type of topology is rarely seen in computer networks but is easy to design in experimental metacommunity studies lattice topologies are essentially grids with patches located at the intersection of each edge patches are connected via several paths if n patches are distributed as an n r n c lattice where n r and n c are the number of patches in each row and column respectively then the number of edges in this lattice is n r n c 1 n r 1 n c the lattice topology is more resistant to disturbance because the system remains connected even when several patches or edges are damaged 2 2 4 tree topology the tree topology has root patches and each root patch has two child patches in our model see fig 1 child patches can be added to a root patch which has fewer than two child patches but the child patches will become unconnected if any root patches or edges are removed the number of edges in this topology is n 1 2 2 5 ring topology each patch connects with two neighboring patches which together form a ring shape species can disperse clockwise or counterclockwise meador 2008 either way dispersers must pass through all patches located between the patch they emigrate from and the patch they immigrate to meador 2008 this topology is easy to set up but the ring is temporarily broken during extension of the ring topology the number of edges is n if more than one patch or edge are removed the system becomes unconnected 2 2 6 line topology in the line topology the first and last patch are unconnected so there is only one route along which species can disperse this structure is easy to extend but less resistant to disturbance since it becomes unconnected when any of the intermediate patches or edges are removed the number of edges is n 1 topologies can be classified according to the number of edges of the shortest path between the most distant nodes known as the graph diameter west 2001 the diameters of our topologies can be classified into small medium and large groups the fully connected and star topologies had graph diameters of 1 and 2 the tree and lattice topologies had diameters of 8 and 9 the ring and line topologies had diameters of 15 and 29 topologies with small diameters consist of a series of tight connections whereas larger graph diameters consist of loose connections 2 3 simulations we set the number of patches to n 30 in all topologies and numbered each patch as in fig 1 environmental conditions defined by equation 4 were consistent within patches of a similar color or numbered sequentially for different topologies we set the initial species richness to s 30 and numbered the species from 1 to 30 setting the optimal environmental value of each species according to equation 5 all species had the same e i j and m i j both values set to 0 2 for all patches loreau et al 2003 gonzalez et al 2009 and all patches had the same i j and l j values set to 165 and 10 respectively gonzalez et al 2009 we set these parameters based on previous studies which applied the resource consumption model we set the dispersal rate a to 37 different values ranging from 0 0001 to 0 001 with intervals of 0 0001 ranging from 0 001 to 0 01 with intervals of 0 001 ranging from 0 01 to 0 1 with intervals of 0 01 and ranging from 0 1 to 1 with intervals of 0 1 hence we have 37 dispersal rates 6 topologies 222 simulations with each simulation run for 2 10 7 time steps to reach equilibrium we set a dynamic cutoff at p i j t 0 01 g meaning that species became extinct from a patch if their biomass fell below this value the differential equations of 1 and 2 are simulated by using the forward euler method with dt 0 001 we also tested the results for different dt observing the same patterns when dt was relatively large such as 0 005 and 0 01 see the results of dt 0 01 in the appendices but the system was not at steady state when dt increased for example greater than 0 1 we controlled for spatial heterogeneity using the fully connected spatially implicit topology in which all patches were connected directly 2 4 metrics we used the bray curtis dissimilarity index to measure the community composition of each patch comparing patches of the fully connected topology with all other topologies in addition we measured the total biomass of each species summing the biomass of that species across all patches in the whole metacommunity the α diversity number of species within each patch the γ diversity of the metacommunities and the coefficient of variation hereafter cv defined as standard deviation mean of α diversity across patches we also measured the productivity of each patch j defined as the production of new biomass per unit time g h loreau et al 2003 6 φ j t r j t i 1 s e i j c i j t p i j t as well as productivity per patch we measured the cv of productivity between patches similations were implemented in java topologies and similarity of community composition were generated using the igraph and vegan packages in r and data were analysed in r 4 0 4 r 2021 all codes can be found in the appendices 3 results 3 1 community composition under low dispersal strong species sorting appeared in all topologies see a 0 0001 and a 0 001 in fig 2 under medium dispersal mass effects increased the biomass of the inferior species resulting in slight differences in community composition between topologies see a 0 01 in fig 2 however the best competitor of the central patch in the star topology went extinct i e in fig 2 the color of the first species on the first patch is white when a 0 0001 but is red on all patches where a 0 01 under high dispersal in the fully connected star tree and lattice topologies whole metacommunities were dominated by a few species and the optimal environmental values of these dominant species were located more centrally between 0 and 1 in the fully connected topology than in the other topologies in the line and ring topologies species with extreme environmental values dominated the patches with extreme environmental conditions whereas species with medium environmental values showed dominance in the patches with intermediate environmental conditions see a 1 in fig 2 overall as the diameters of the topologies increased dominant species exhibited more extreme environmental values we compared community composition between two patches with the same environmental conditions one from the fully connected topology and the other from one of the other topologies in all topologies increasing disperal rates caused reduced similarity in community composition fig 3 low dispersal rates resulted in almost the same community composition within patches across all topologies a 0 0001 in fig 3 medium dispersal rates e g a 0 01 increased the similarity between patches with extreme environmental conditions more than other patches high dispersal rates e g a 0 1 caused patches with intermediate environmental conditions to become more similar than patches with extreme environmental condititions when the dispersal rate was 1 the overall similarity was toward zero fig 3 however similarity was greater than zero in the line and ring topologies a 1 in fig 3 in contrast with the other topologies the similarity of patch 1 in the star topology was lowest when dispersal rate was low and highest when dispersal rate was 1 fig 3 at around 100 total biomass of each species in the whole metacommunity was almost identical under low dispersal rates for all topologies see a 0 0001 in fig 4 it differed slightly under medium dispersal rates for the large diameter topologies but remained the same for the fully connected topology see a 0 01 in fig 4 for the star topology the total biomass of species with environmental values of h 1 was zero since they had been outcompeted as the best competitors of the central patch patch 1 see also fig 2 total biomass differed greatly under high dispersal especially for the topologies with medium to large diameters with clumps of species appearing as one would expect from niche partitioning the number of clumps increased from one to four in the tree lattice ring and line topologies respectively a 1 in fig 4 3 2 diversity in line with other studies loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 shanafelt et al 2015 increasing dispersal first increased and then decreased α diversity whereas γ diversity remained constant before eventually decreasing in all topologies fig 5a and b exact trends of α and γ diversity varied between topologies α diversity was highest 30 species in the widest dispersal window of the fully connected topology where the logarithm governing dispersal rates was between 7 5 to 2 5 fig 5a the same result could be seen in the star topology but with a narrower dispersal window from 5 0 to 2 3 and a lower α diversity 29 species for the lattice and tree topologies medium dispersal rates gave the highest α diversity whereas in the line and ring topologies α diversity peaked at relatively higher dispersal rates also dependent on topology were the tipping points at which γ diversity started to decline at high rates of dispersal both α and γ diversity were higher in the line and ring topologies than in other topologies fig 5a and b α diversity varied between patches in the different topologies fig 5c and fig a 1 in all but the star topology dispersal caused the cv of α diversity to increase at first and then decrease fig 5c the key difference between the topologies was the point at which increasing dispersal caused the cv of α diversity to peak this peak occurred at low dispersal in the fully connected topology intermediate dispersal in the lattice and tree topologies and high dispersal in the line and ring topologies see insert panels in fig 5c in the star topology which differed completely from the other topologies increasing dispersal caused a decline in the cv of α diversity within patches fig 5c 3 3 productivity increasing dispersal caused the mean productivity of each patch to decrease in all topologies and the rate of decline became steeper at higher dispersal rates fig 6a see also the productivity of each patch across all topologies in fig a 2 in the fully connected topology even under very high dispersal rates mean productivity remained constant whereas it declined sharply for the star topology and remained relatively flat in the line and ring topologies as with mean productivity the cv of productivity between patches remained constant at first but then increased with dispersal in all but the fully connected topology fig 6b in which it declined slightly at very high dispersal rates under high dispersal rates the cv of productivity increased sharply in the star topology and remained flat in the line and ring topologies 4 discussion we applied a resource consumption model to six simple topologies fully connected spatially implicit star tree lattice ring and line structures with different diameters to investigate whether a spatially implicit model could consistently predict the structures of spatially explicit metacommunities under high dispersal our spatially implicit model failed to predict the structure of spatially explicit metacommunities including community composition exact α and γ diversity patterns of total species biomass distribution productivity and cv of α diversity and productivity some trends were apparent across all models for example at low dispersal strong environmental filtering led each patch to be dominated by its best competitor whereas more inferior competitors appeared in all patches at medium dispersal and whole metacommunities were dominated by several species due to mass effects at high dispersal consequently α diversity first increased and then decreased and γ diversity remained constant and then decreased at low dispersal e g a 0 0001 community compositions of given patches were consistent across topologies fig 2 4 due to strong environmental filtering which allowed each patch to be dominated by its best competitor suzuki economo 2021 γ diversity and mean productivity were also consistent across all topologies and the cv of α diversity between patches was low fig 5 and 6 however the high levels of connectedness between patches in the fully connected topology allowed more inferior species to appear in all patches even under very low dispersal rates which is why the α diversity was higher under the fully connected topology than in other topologies fig 5 our spatially implicit model could not predict the α diversity of spatially explicit metacommunities even under very low dispersal rates hence α diversity remained highest over the greatest range of dispersal in the fully connected topology than in other topologies at medium dispersal a 0 01 the number and identity of inferior species which appeared in each patch differed between patches and between topologies which led the diversity and community composition to fluctuate within patches and topologies figs 2 5 resulting in variable declines in productivity fig 6 mouquet loreau 2003 leibold chase 2018 the central patch patch 1 of the star topology represented a hub meaning that all dispersers had to pass through this patch before reaching their destination and these transient species converted resource and outcompeted the best competitor of the central patch at high dispersal the smallest diameter topologies were dominated by generalist species with medium environmental values fig 2 these species were also the best competitors at the regional scale consistent with other studies mouquet loreau 2002 loreau et al 2003 mouquet loreau 2003 gonzalez et al 2009 shanafelt et al 2015 contrary to our expectations increasing dispersal caused extreme shifts in the community compositions of medium to large diameter topologies for example the patches with extreme environmental conditions in the large diameter topologies were completely dominated by a few species with extreme environmental values fig 2 fewer connections between patches meant that species could disperse only to neighboring patches particularly at high dispersal rates this process led to the emergent niche structure rael et al 2018 observed in the large diameter topologies fig 4 patches with medium environmental conditions had similarities greater than zero between the fully connected topology and the line and ring topologies fig 3 because generalist species with medium environmental values also achieved greater biomass in patches with medium environmental conditions in the line and ring topologies fig 2 as we predicted both α and γ diversity declined at very high dispersal rates in all topologies but greater numbers of species could be maintained in the line and ring than in other topologies fig 5 delaying the reduction in productivity fig 6 in the fully connected topology the best regional competitors dominated all patches at relative to very high dispersal rates which kept mean productivity constant and caused slight declines in the cv of productivity fig 6 metacommunities are the product of complex interconnections between species dispersal and network topologies governed by environmental factors without these interconnections metacommunities would exist as random patches rather than being the products of species sorting and mass effects leibold et al 2004 suzuki economo 2021 species sorting and mass effects work together and the relative importance of these mechanisms for diversity is contingent upon dispersal rates and environmental filtering suzuki economo 2021 environmental filtering and dispersal play opposite roles in community assembly environmental filtering strengthens interspecific competition allowing the best competitors to exclude less competitive species and dominante in each patch ben hur kadmon 2020 dispersal allows species to escape from competitive exclusion appearing in patches where they could not survive without dispersal amarasekare nisbet 2001 leibold et al 2017 regardless of topology mass effects are proportional to species dispersal whereas species sorting is the opposite in our model suzuki and economo 2021 proposed that topologies with few loops promote species sorting and we have confirmed this at high dispersal rates fig 2 fig 4 and fig a 3 on the contrary under medium dispersal rates e g a 0 01 in figs 2 and 4 we found species sorting to be stronger in the small diameter topologies such as the fully connected and star topologies than in the large diameter topologies see fig 2 fig 4 and fig a 3 under high dispersal the emergent niche structure of species biomass distribution patterns rael et al 2018 appeared in topologies with large diameters a similar feature to that mentioned in suzuki and economo 2021 in previous studies species traits dictated whether niche structures emerged further strengthening the heterogeneity of species interactions rael et al 2018 in our model species trait differences were consistent between topologies but the spatial structure of the topologies altered the species interactions neither dispersal limitation nor dispersal sufficiency played a role in our model only dispersal surplus was occurring with all species appearing in all patches from the start species sorting was at its most powerful when dispersal rate was zero leibold chase 2018 and environmental conditions were filtering out the best competitors from each patch our results appear to conflict with previous studies in which dispersal sufficiency caused species sorting and dispersal surplus generated mass effects leibold et al 2017 leibold chase 2018 however in these studies species were distributed randomly between patches meaning that the best competitors may not have existed in their preferred patches from the start in models like ours all species have equal opportunities to appear in all patches from the beginning 5 conclusion our spatially implicit model successfully predicted community composition γ diversity and productivity at low dispersal rates for all topologies although α diversity was higher in the spatially implicit than in any of the spatially explicit topologies at high dispersal rates and given that the success of each topology depends on the exact structure of metacommunities none of these characteristics were successfully predicted our aim was to test the resource consumption model under various assumptions in the hope of suggesting a general level of accuracy for this one spatially implicit model and further tests involving various other models and parameters are needed in the meantime we tentatively conclude that spatially implicit models may be problematic in the study of spatially explicit metacommunities

24328,natural resources and its enrichment activities are often being associated with the paradoxical effects in ecology such as in predator prey and fishery models several studies have shown that an increase in resources can cause the paradox of enrichment i e the destabilization of certain species population as the system is enriched this situation is rather contradictory to our logical intuition parallel with this view harvesting effort and the intensity of enrichment activities are among crucial factors in shaping the sustainability of fishery activities and natural resources this is because an extreme harvesting effort could lead to resource depletion and threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems in this work we investigate the joint effects of enrichment and harvesting activities in an intraguild predator prey fishery model that incorporates the michaelis menten type of harvesting of predatory fishes we study the existence and stability of the steady states in this system analytically and conduct numerical simulations together with bifurcation analysis to verify our analytical findings our co dimension one bifurcation analysis shows that the system can exhibit local bifurcations such as transcritical saddle node subcritical and supercritical hopf bifurcations co dimension two bifurcation analysis further demonstrates the existence of global dynamics through the appearance of generalized hopf gh and zero hopf zh bifurcations which occur due to the interactions of distinct local bifurcations in this ecological system the limit point bifurcation of cycles that emanates from the gh point has a bounded parameter space region in which tristability phenomenon between stable steady states and stable limit cycles occurs in a scenario where the resources are enriched in the presence of harvesting activity bistability emerges with the long term outcomes lead to the exclusion of either prey or predator population depending on the initial conditions of species based on these findings we propose another interpretation to the paradox of enrichment as postulated in ecological theories this predator prey fishery system can be destabilized through an alternative stable states phenomenon which results in the extinction of certain species as the ecosystem is further enriched keywords ordinary differential equations intraguild predator prey system alternative stable states bifurcation analysis fisheries marine conservation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in recent years scientific researchers start to consider the idea of intraguild predation in ecological systems intraguild predation is defined as an ecological interaction consisting of both competition and predation which happen simultaneously in a food web gotelli et al 2008 for instance in a two species intraguild predation system one species can consume the other species and at the same time they also compete for shared resources ang and safuan 2021 this concept was first introduced in a seminal work polis et al 1989 published in 1989 since then further progresses have been made in this direction to incorporate more realism in formulating the intraguild predation models holt and polis 1997 polis et al 1989 polis and holt 1992 ang and safuan 2021 this interaction can be observed in most trophic levels in marine ecosystems for instance i copepods feeding on other copepods eggs and zooplankton kang et al 2000 ii mixotrophs feeding on and competing with phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients moeller et al 2019 and iii pinnipeds feeding on sharks fallows et al 2015 in a small pelagic fish population some researchers irigoien and de roos 2011 have performed an analysis on the role of intraguild predation dynamics in marine communities it is discovered that this kind of interaction is one of the simplest examples of marine ecosystem complexities which is relevant for size structured populations of fishery communities nevertheless intraguild predation is not limited only to marine ecosystems this interaction is observed across different biological taxon from as small as insects wissinger and mcgrady 1993 borer et al 2003 to mammals fedriani et al 2000 and often this ecological interaction can also be shaped by other external factors such as harvesting and environmental enrichment considering the significant influences of these different factors can exert on the food web dynamics we seek to better understand the combined effects of harvesting and the intensity of enrichment activities on the intraguild predation system from the perspective of economic and ecological standpoints harvesting is one of the important factors to be examined due to its impact on resource and fishery management in modelling fields distinct techniques have been employed to investigate the crucial effects of harvesting on fishery ecosystems for instance a mathematical model chaudhuri 1986 has been introduced to study the harvesting strategies in the form of using the catch per unit effort of two competing fish species a similar approach has been combined with a bionomic and economic equilibrium to analyse a predator prey harvesting model with variable carrying capacity ganguli et al 2017 however few studies have argued that the concept of catch per unit effort for harvesting is rather unrealistic lenzini and rebaza 2010 rebaza et al 2008 bairagi et al 2012 several studies devi 2012 lenzini and rebaza 2010 assert that this concept has some limitations such that it causes an unbounded linear increase for the harvesting magnitude formulation with a given finite species population to overcome this problem previous researchers clark and mangel 1979 bairagi et al 2012 consider the nonlinear type of harvesting since this type of formulation is more realistic than the linear ones for example a nonlinear function called michaelis menten type of harvesting clark and mangel 1979 has been proposed to resolve the aforementioned unboundedness problem numerous studies have been conducted on the incorporation of michaelis menten type of harvesting in distinct ecological models one such systems a modified leslie gower model with the michaelis menten type of harvesting term gupta and chandra 2013 has been employed to uncover the bifurcational changes in dynamics of predator prey interactions such as transcritical saddle node hopf and bognadov taken bifurcations in parallel with this other studies hu 2017 kumar and kharbanda 2019 li et al 2016 have also demonstrated the existence of rich and complex dynamics in the predator prey models when nonlinear harvesting terms e g michaelis menten type is incorporated recently an intraguild predation system ang and safuan 2021 has been developed with the inclusion of michaelis menten type predator harvesting this model is extended from a fishery system safuan et al 2013 that incorporates a natural or biotic resource as one of the population variables with harvesting effects on predatory fish species these modelling studies have provided some evidence on the appearance of alternative stable states in this fishery ecosystem ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 ecological theory also predicts the emergence of alternative stable states or regime shift dynamics in several marine ecosystems e g eutrophic lakes under variations in nutrient concentrations tay et al 2022 often changes to nutrient levels in marine and freshwater habitats can drive shifts between different species tay et al 2022 it has been documented in a limnological work that the risk of instigating a regime shift over a wide range of environmental conditions can be tempered by harvesting activities kuiper et al 2017 on the one hand some empirical studies have shown that harvesting certain marine species such as macrophytes can be effective in reducing disturbance in lakes kuiper et al 2017 but on the other hand it is important to realize that over harvesting of such species can also lead to disruption of marine ecosystems even under nutrient rich conditions verhofstad et al 2017 kuiper et al 2017 additionally the influences of biotic interactions have also shaped these marine community dynamics verity and smetacek 1996 biotic interactions e g predation and competition play an important role in keeping the ecosystem functioning ramesh et al 2021 mohd et al 2017 mohd and noorani 2021 furthermore these interactions between species together with other biological and external processes can significantly affect the occurrence of the alternative stable states and the long term compositions in the natural communities mohd et al 2016 2018 in general natural resources and its enrichment activities such as physical enrichment e g artificial reefs and dietary enrichment e g flavoured feed variable sized pellets are being used to increase the suitability of habitats and environmental conditions thereby providing more choice to fishes over their environments janhunen et al 2021 näslund and johnsson 2016 however these enrichment activities often being associated with the paradoxical effects in ecology such as in predator prey and fishery ecosystems several studies have shown that an increase in resources or enriched environments can cause the paradox of enrichment i e the destabilization or extinction of certain species population as the systems are enriched rosenzweig 1971 gilpin 1972 mohd 2019 tay et al 2022 in aquatic ecosystems scenario paradox of enrichment is also apparent in the presence of eutrophication phenomenon tubay et al 2013 gray et al 2002 korpinen and bonsdorff 2015 eutrophication is a process in which the body of water becomes progressively enriched that leads to destabilization of the ecosystem due to algal blooms and hypoxia chapin iii et al 2002 it has also been reported that eutrophication and fisheries exploitation through harvesting are among the main problems that can influence the fishery industries breitburg et al 2009 considering the consequences of these biological and external factors an evidence based decision making through the use of model based predictions is crucial to be devised to ensure sustainable fishing activities the outputs from such model can be employed to plan effective management strategies so that fisheries can continue to thrive in marine and freshwater habitats motivated by these ecological observations we investigate the joint effects of intraguild predation harvesting and the intensity of enrichment activities on the fishery ecosystems to do this we re visit a predator prey system ang and safuan 2021 consisting of intraguild predation michaelis menten type harvesting together with biotic resources components and perform a detailed bifurcation analysis to discover the bifurcational structures and reveal the overall dynamics of this ecological system apart from performing theoretical analysis to analyse the steady states and its stability properties numerical bifurcation analysis is conducted using xppaut ermentrout and mahajan 2003 omaiye and mohd 2018 and matcont dhooge et al 2008 packages to construct co dimension one and two bifurcation diagrams demonstrating distinct dynamics of species interactions and intriguing ecological phenomena under different parameter variations our aim is to examine how harvesting effort interacts with enrichment activities to shape local and global dynamics of intraguild predation fishery ecosystem across a much wider range of parameter space than considered in the previous work ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 prior researchers ang and safuan 2021 have focussed the analysis of this ecological system on finding the optimal threshold for the predator harvesting by deriving the bionomic equilibrium within the system using pontryagin s maximum principle gamkrelidze 1999 they also highlighted some effects of harvesting process especially in mediating different dynamical behaviour of a fishery prey predator model however most of their analysis only focussed on the occurrence of two local bifurcations i e hopf and transcritical bifurcations with some verifications from numerical simulations as the magnitude of harvesting varies they also did not typically consider numerous ranges of bifurcational changes in dynamics as harvesting and enrichment activities vary in a factorial manner thus precluding a proper investigation of possible interactions between these important external factors in shaping the fishery ecosystem dynamics this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the description of the model and some theoretical analysis on the steady states and its stability properties in the appendix section in section 3 the numerical experimental results e g time series plots one and two parameter bifurcation diagrams are presented as resource enrichment and harvesting magnitudes change the final section i e section 4 concludes and summarizes the important observations of this study and discusses its ecological implications 2 model description and theoretical analysis we employ a three dimensional predator prey system consisting of intraguild predation michaelis menten type harvesting and shared biotic resources components ang and safuan 2021 1 d x d t r 1 x 1 x m z a x y d y d t r 2 y 1 y n z b x y c e y d 1 e d 2 y d z d t z g u x v y where x corresponds to prey and y corresponds to predator populations both of these species have logistic growths with the rates of r 1 and r 2 respectively for the biotic resource population z this shared resource is accessible for both prey and predator populations with the rate of m and n respectively with 0 m 1 0 n 1 in which m n 1 parameter g is referred to the growth rate for biotic resource whereas u and v are the resource consumption rates by prey and predator species respectively parameters a and b are referred to the intensity of interaction between prey and predator species the catchability coefficient of predator fish is denoted by c whereas e is the harvesting effort applied on predator fish with d 1 and d 2 as the positive constants the non dimensionalization transformation ang and safuan 2021 with the scaled variables x a n x m r 2 y a y r 2 z a n z r 2 and τ r 2 t are performed and we obtain the following system 2 d x d τ α x 1 x z x y d y d τ y 1 y z β x y δ y σ y d z d τ z ρ ϵ x μ y where α r 1 r 2 β b m a n δ a c e d 2 r 2 2 ρ g r 2 ϵ m u a n and μ v a all these parameters are assumed to be positive to ensure biological feasibility of the system in the system 2 we concentrate our analysis on the joint effects of harvesting δ and environmental enrichment ρ which play significant impacts in shaping this intraguild predation community dynamics 2 1 existence of steady states by letting d x d τ d y d τ d z d τ 0 there are three possible equilibria found in the system 2 i the prey free equilibrium e 1 0 ρ μ ρ μ σ ρ μ ρ μ σ δ μ ii the predator free equilibrium e 2 ρ ϵ 0 ρ ϵ iii the coexistence equilibrium e 3 ρ μ y ˆ ϵ y ˆ α μ y ˆ ρ ϵ y ˆ α where y ˆ solves the cubic equation of 3 a y ˆ 3 b y ˆ 2 c y ˆ d 0 with a α β μ 2 ϵ 2 b α β μ 2 σ ϵ 2 σ 2 α β μ ρ α ϵ 2 α ϵ μ c α β ρ 2 α δ ϵ μ α ϵ ρ 2 α β μ ρ σ α ϵ 2 σ α ϵ μ σ d α β ρ 2 σ α ϵ ρ σ α δ ϵ ρ to obtain the roots of the cubic equation 3 using cardano s formula nahin 1998 we substitute y ˆ ζ b 3 a to express the equation into the form of 4 ζ 3 s ζ t 0 where 5 s c a b 2 3 a 2 and t d a 2 b 3 27 a 3 b c 3 a 2 to find the solutions we let 6a s 3 u v 6b t v 3 u 3 it turns out that ζ u v is one of the solutions for the reduced cubic equation to describe u and v in terms of s and t we substitute eq 6 a in terms of u into eq 6 b that yields to t v 3 s 3 v 3 0 v 6 t v 3 s 3 27 solving the solution above in terms of v 3 7 v 3 t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 since v 3 u 3 t then 8 u 3 t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 thus s and v are expressed as below u t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 3 and v t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 3 since we have already discovered one of the roots of the equation ζ u v we carry out long division polynomials using the root on eq 4 thus the roots of expressed cubic eq 4 are given as ζ k u v for k 1 v u 2 i 3 2 u v for k 2 3 therefore for k 1 2 3 e k ρ μ y ˆ ϵ ζ k b 3 a α μ y ˆ ρ ϵ y ˆ α in the expression of u and v the equation δ t 2 4 s 3 27 is the discriminant of the depressed cubic equation it is known that when δ 0 then the three roots are distinct and real the feasible criteria for interior equilibrium e 3 to exist in the positive quadrant are ρ μ y ˆ 0 and α y ˆ 0 in other words interior equilibrium e 3 is feasible and can exist in the positive quadrant if min ρ μ α y ˆ since y ˆ 0 is strictly positive for biological feasibility such condition is always necessary and must be satisfied for the stability analysis of each steady state we refer interested readers to appendix section from our theoretical analysis we observed that there are three types of steady states in the model 2 in the appendix section we conducted stability analysis on the equilibria and based on the threshold conditions on stability it is shown that the harvesting δ and resource enrichment ρ magnitudes play an important role in determining the dynamics of an intraguild predation predator prey system this observation is also consistent with previous works on the effects of resource enrichment safuan et al 2013 ganguli et al 2017 and harvesting activities ang and safuan 2021 thus to validate these theoretical results we conducted numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis to further examine the dynamical behaviours of the model 2 the parametrisation of the model 2 is inspired by the previous work ang and safuan 2021 and these parameter values are shown in table 1 using this set of biological parameters we then perform detailed co dimension one and two analysis to discover the bifurcational changes in dynamics of this ecological system as harvesting effort δ and resource enrichment ρ change 3 results numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis in this section we investigate the combined effects of enrichment ρ and harvesting δ activities on this intraguild predation system through numerical bifurcation analysis and simulation techniques 3 1 co dimension one and two bifurcation analysis we begin by examining the influences of resource enrichment ρ on the dynamical behaviour of the model 2 using co dimension one bifurcation analysis as an example fig 1 depicts the equilibria of the model as ρ changes other parameter values are as in shown in table 1 there are several colours curves and label conventions that have been used for this one parameter bifurcation diagram solid red curves represent the stable steady states solid black curves depict the unstable steady states black dotted lines are used to divide the graphs into four regions our continuation result reveals several threshold values of resource enrichment which correspond to hopf bifurcation h b limit point bifurcation l p and transcritical bifurcation t b in particular this system possesses hopf bifurcations in the interval between h b 1 ρ 1 1672 to h b 2 ρ 1 2706 besides there is a limit point bifurcation at l p ρ 1 1618 as ρ increases further the system encounters a transcritical bifurcation at t b ρ 2 45 based on these thresholds we divided the graph into four regions region i 0 ρ l p region ii l p ρ h b 2 region iii h b 2 ρ t b and region iv ρ t b region i 0 ρ l p in region i we observe that there is only one stable steady state which is the predator free equilibrium e 2 based on local stability analysis in the appendix section e 2 is locally stable given δ ϵ β ρ σ ϵ σ 0 the parameter values in table 1 suggest that e 2 is locally asymptotically stable as ρ 28 as the value of ρ increases from zero the population density of prey and resource increasing linearly to ρ refer to fig 1 recall that the predator free equilibrium in this model is e 2 ρ ϵ 0 ρ ϵ in which the density of both populations are proportional to ρ thus it can be seen that our numerical results e g e 2 agree with our theoretical analysis in the previous section in the presence of low enrichment activity ρ 0 5 which results in the scarcity of biotic resources refer to fig 2 we observe that the intraguild predator is being displaced while the prey and resource species persist with limited resources predator could not strive in this condition having a low resource and being harvested in this case the long term trajectories converge to e 2 i e 0 714 0 0 714 from different initial conditions as shown by fig 2 a b region ii l p ρ h b 2 in fig 1 it can be seen that there are two hopf bifurcation points where limit cycles emerge the hopf bifurcation hb is the crucial mechanism that induces oscillatory dynamics in this fishery model with the change in stability in e 3 i e the three species coexistence equilibrium there also occurs a limit point bifurcation l p ρ 1 1618 in the vicinity of h b 1 ρ 1 1672 this interval between l p and h b 1 is rather delicate small difference in ρ where several attractors are stable in this small region to examine the aforementioned observations we consider some values of ρ which lie in the intervals l p ρ 1 h b 1 and h b 1 ρ 2 h b 2 for an illustration purpose on the convergence of steady states for distinct values of ρ e g ρ 1 1 165 respectively ρ 2 1 2 we employ different initial conditions and some of these observations are illustrated in fig 3 respectively fig 4 in our numerical experiments we found two stable steady states which are the three species coexistence fig 3 a e 3 0 570 0 218 0 829 and the predator free equilibrium fig 3 b e 2 1 663 0 1 663 for distinct initial conditions used in this case the bistability behaviour is observed and which steady state is reached depends on the initial conditions of species similar bistability observation emerges for ρ 2 where we discover the occurrence of a stable limit cycle fig 4 a and e 2 1 714 0 1 714 equilibrium fig 4 b for different initial conditions employed the density population destabilized around e 3 and continued to oscillate in the long run for certain initial conditions region iii h b 2 ρ t b for moderate enrichment activities e g ρ 2 the dynamics are similar to region ii except that the periodic behaviour disappears and e 3 becomes a stable steady state thus in region iii there occurs bistability between steady states e 2 fig 5 a and e 3 fig 5 b as initial conditions are varied once ρ hits the value 2 45 transcritical bifurcation occur where there is an exchange of stability between e 3 and e 1 at this point the prey population has gone extinct for e 3 region iv ρ t b in region iv bistability phenomenon is still evident with e 1 and e 2 as the stable steady states in this case the long term behaviour leads to exclusion of either prey or predator depending on the initial conditions of species to illustrate this behaviour we examine the time series diagrams for distinct initial conditions in fig 6 a respectively b where it can be seen that the predator respectively prey species is eliminated in the long run from an ecological perspective this is a different form of destabilization of the species population which can lead to extinction of some species this notion is known as paradox of enrichment which was coined by rosenzweig in 1971 rosenzweig 1971 gilpin 1972 this paradox postulated that the act of enriching the environments can cause counter intuitive effects while logically an enriched environment would be beneficial to ecosystems and favourable to interacting species this situation can cause exclusion of species due to the occurrence of high amplitude of population oscillations i e limit cycles in this case some species may oscillate to a very low density which would increase the likelihood of stochastic extinction for this fishery system instead of limit cycles high resource enrichment causes alternative stable states behaviour with the final community compositions lead to two different communities this situation results in the exclusion either prey or predator populations depending on initial conditions 3 2 intriguing dynamics as magnitudes of harvesting and environmental enrichment change from our previous analysis in fig 1 we observe the occurrence of several bifurcations in this intraguild predation fishery system transcritical limit point and hopf bifurcations these bifurcations form distinct regions with qualitatively different dynamics additionally the interactions of these local bifurcations can engender higher co dimension two bifurcations and extra insights on the dynamical behaviours of the model 2 with the aid of matcont bifurcation analysis package we constructed the regions on two parameters plane δ ρ in fig 7 on which a pair of hopf bifurcation curves i e subcritical hopf brown and supercritical hopf green bifurcations intersect at generalized hopf gh bifurcation point with the corresponding creation a limit point of cycles lpc bifurcation curve purple there also occurs zero hopf zh bifurcation where this co dimension two bifurcation point lies at a tangential intersection of curves of limit point and hopf bifurcations these bifurcational changes in dynamics shape the overall outcomes of the model 2 as the magnitudes of δ and ρ are varied in region ii we can see that only coexistence steady state e 3 is stable in the system in a situation where the harvesting parameter δ and the resource enrichment ρ are low prey and predator species alongside with biotic resource can coexist in this ecological system from the viewpoint of conservation biology this is a favourable outcome since the diversity of species is maintained by ensuring that none of these species in the ecosystems are excluded in region i we observe that only prey free equilibrium e 1 is stable when enrichment activity is intense and harvesting activity on predator is rather low predators can outnumber prey species since the environments are favourable for the predator to thrive in this case prey species cannot survive and will be excluded in a long run in region iv there emerges alternate stable states behaviour as harvesting magnitude increases and as resource enrichment is rather low or moderate there are two possible outcomes i e predator free e 2 or coexistence e 3 equilibria which outcome is reached depends on initial conditions if the initial abundances of predator species is rather high to strive and persist the long term outcome leads to coexistence of three species otherwise the predator species cannot survive since they are being harvested at increasing rates in region iii it is observed that coexistence of three species is not possible in this case when both harvesting activity and resource enrichment are high prey and predator species cannot coexist and the long term outcomes would lead to the exclusion of either species e 1 or e 2 via alternative stable states phenomenon the final community compositions depend on the initial abundances of species if the prey population is initially more abundant and can increase its population the long term outcome leads to predator species exclusion and vice versa for region vi there is only one stable steady state which is predator free equilibrium e 2 when the harvesting magnitude is high and resource enrichment is at a low level this scenario is more favourable for prey with limited resources predators need to compete with prey species while intensely being harvested in a long run predator species could not persist in such environments and would go extinct eventually meanwhile region v shows the occurrence of stable limit cycles in this fishery system in this case stable limit cycles appear and the population densities of these interacting species can coexist via oscillatory dynamics there also occurs another attractor i e stable steady state e 2 and which attractor is reached depends on the initial conditions of species for region vii this region is bounded by a subcritical hopf bifurcation curve brown and limit point bifurcation of cycles curve purple that emanates from generalized hopf gh bifurcation located at δ 0 193 ρ 1 146 in this region we observe tristability behaviour between e 2 e 3 and stable limit cycles which can be seen from a phase portrait in fig 8 with δ 0 255 and ρ 1 6 produced using different initial conditions to further demonstrate this tristability outcome we generate a one parameter bifurcation diagram in fig 9 as δ varies in a small neighbourhood around 0 24 0 3 in this region there are two limit cycles that emerge in the system i e one stable green dots and another one is unstable blue dots there also occurs stable steady states e 2 and e 3 red curves depending on initial conditions the long term outcome either converges to stable e 2 fig 10 a e 3 fig 10 b or stable limit cycles fig 10 c 4 discussion and conclusion in this work we examine the combined influences of harvesting and enrichment activities in an intraguild predation fishery ecosystem though we have re visited and employed a predator prey fishery system from previous work ang and safuan 2021 we managed to perform a detailed numerical continuation analysis to discover the bifurcational structures of this ecological system one of our contributions is to demonstrate different dynamical behaviours of the fishery resources system as the harvesting intensity changes prior researchers ang and safuan 2021 have discovered some of these observations when the harvesting magnitude is varied however these previous observations may be inconclusive and thus inspired this work and our further investigation we extend these observations through detailed co dimension one and two bifurcation analysis techniques and observe that there occurs several intriguing dynamics overall these findings also demonstrate the importance of numerical bifurcation analysis in tracking both stable and unstable steady states limit cycles and distinct bifurcation points in order to gain better understanding of the dynamics of this ecological systems we uncover the occurrence of generalized hopf gh bifurcation numerically due to the collision of subcritical and supercritical hopf bifurcations due to this co dimension two bifurcation point the limit point of cycles lpc emanates from this gh point and this is not evident in the previous analysis ang and safuan 2021 it is observed that the bounded region between the lpc and subcritical hopf bifurcation curves possesses a tristability phenomenon for any magnitudes of harvesting and enrichment activities that fall within this region three distinct outcomes e g stable limit cycles prey free or coexistence equilibria are possible depending on initial conditions a limit point bifurcation curve is also found near the hopf curve and these two bifurcation curves tangentially intersect and produce a zero hopf zh bifurcation point furthermore we also arrive at a different interpretation of paradox of enrichment rosenzweig 1971 when varying the intensity of resources of the system it has been observed that the species populations either prey or predator can be excluded in the case of high abundances of resources in an extreme condition when resources are rather abundant due to enrichment activities prey species could go extinct due to overconsumption by predator which can disrupt the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems similarly the preys may be strong competitors and they are more efficient in competing and utilizing the abundant biotic resources in a long run the predator species can be affected and this situation can lead to their exclusion traditionally this paradoxical effect is caused by the emergence of limit cycles which increases in the amplitudes of oscillation rosenzweig 1971 gilpin 1972 however in this marine ecosystem we have discovered that the system can also be destabilized and led to species exclusion through alternative stable states phenomenon as the ecosystem is enriched further the occurrence of alternative stable states also corresponds to gause s competitive exclusion principle gause 1932 1934 where this theory postulates that coexistence is almost impossible when species compete for the same limited resources in line with the aforementioned observations some experimental findings have demonstrated that the occurrence of alternative stable states can induce catastrophic loss of aquatic species as a consequence of nutrient enrichment morris et al 2003a b in the presence of alternative stable states phenomenon ecological literature also predicts that high nutrient enrichment increases the probability of regime switching between states morris et al 2003a with distinct final compositions and exclusion of species are possible while harvesting effects of marine ecosystems such as in lakes have also been reported to cause a shift in species dominance some limnological works suggest that these effects are rather hard to be anticipated accurately under nutrient enrichment given the complexity of alternative stable states mechanism morris et al 2003b our modelling work is able to quantify these combined effects and the long term distributions or qualitative behaviours of the marine ecosystem under consideration through numerical bifurcation analysis we illustrate that distinct outcomes can emerge in this system consisting of stable multi species coexistence competitive exclusion i e prey free and predator free equilibria stable limit cycles and alternative stable states i e bistable and tristable behaviours these results also extend the observations in previous modelling work and provide some important insights for the observed differences in marine community dynamics in our simulation results and also in a number of different studies ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 from the perspective of fisheries management our two parameter bifurcation analysis suggests that moderate levels of harvesting and nutrient enrichment activities are necessary to ensure the maintenance of biodiversity in this marine ecosystem higher rates of harvesting activity and nutrient enrichment can lead to the occurrences of alternative stable states with the exclusion of species is possible these findings provide some guidances for marine conservation and fisheries management on the sustainable use of fishery stocks this strategy can be enforced through proper rules and legislation that are needed to prevent overfishing and to help overfished stocks rebound hilborn et al 2020 we also caution on the practices of enriching the environment of marine species which can have some counterintuitive effects while several types of environmental enrichment have been adapted in aquaculture and fishery industries and seem to bring positive impacts e g reproduction success of fishes gerber et al 2015 our findings illustrate another possible scenario that can occur in a nutrient rich condition in particular the risk of exclusion of certain species should also be considered in implementing these enrichment activities some studies suggest that little is known about the enrichment effects on fish welfare under production conditions and whether benefits may outweigh the drawbacks like increased operational costs or increased effort for maintenance in the long run gerber et al 2015 in conclusion this study illustrates the significant roles of enrichment and harvesting activities in an intraguild predation fishery model our results also provide some insights on when do the harvesting and enrichment activities matter in mediating distinct outcomes of the fishery ecosystem more investigation is needed into this topic to better understand the consequences of distinct biological and external forces on the marine community dynamics one obvious limitation of this work is that the results may be limited to the parametrisation of the system which is inspired by previous modelling work ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 more analysis is required to investigate the dynamics of this marine ecosystem under different sets of parametrisation including empirical estimates from real data also for future work we plan to examine the effects of eutrophication process in interaction with enrichment and harvesting activities in shaping the dynamics of this intraguild predation system previous literature in fisheries management asserts that eutrophication not just only lower the productivity levels of fishes but this process also limits the spatial dynamics of the fish populations breitburg et al 2009 it has also been proposed that eutrophication or water quality management should be conducted in parallel with the fisheries management and enforcement of related policies zou et al 2020 tay et al 2022 this is because harvesting activity of fishes removes nutrients from the water ecosystem and the size of the fish stock also influences eutrophication through food web effects and other mechanisms iho et al 2017 overall we propose that a detailed knowledge on sustainable harvesting activities environmental enrichment and the consequences of other biological factors is crucial elements to be considered in the modern fisheries management and these issues warrant further studies by scientific communities using both

possess two eigenvalues with a negative real part notice that the third condition ρ μ σ δ μ 0 has to be satisfied for e 1 to exist in positive quadrant mentioned in the earlier part of the discussion since we assumed it to be true e 1 exists the third condition is already satisfied the first condition ρ α μ 0 plays an important role to guarantees the negativeness of the remaining eigenvalue suppose that ρ μ σ 2 δ μ 2 σ 2 δ μ ρ 0 if ρ α μ 0 then e 1 is a locally stable node otherwise e 1 is an unstable saddle point the case when ρ α μ 0 serves as the threshold stability condition or transcritical bifurcation point where e 1 can either gain or loss its stability stability of predator free equilibrium e 2 equilibrium e 2 can always exist in the positive quadrant as ρ ϵ 0 since all parameters used are positive the jacobian matrix is computed at e 2 such that j e 2 α ρ ϵ α 0 1 β ρ ϵ δ σ 0 ρ μ ρ ϵ 0 from j e 2 it is clear that 1 β ρ ϵ δ σ is one of the eigenvalues of equilibrium e

locally stable with the condition of δ ϵ β ρ σ ϵ σ 0 proof from eq 10 since both α and α ρ are strictly positive by routh hurwitz criterion the system in this characteristic equation is stable besides the condition δ ϵ β ρ σ ϵ σ 0 ensures the negative real part of the eigenvalue 1 β ρ ϵ δ σ with given conditions predator free equilibrium e 2 is locally stable stability of coexistence equilibrium e

due to numerous parameters involved in the j e 3 it is hard to construct the necessary condition for the stability of equilibrium e 3 thus we construct an appropriate lyapunov function to examine the

24328,natural resources and its enrichment activities are often being associated with the paradoxical effects in ecology such as in predator prey and fishery models several studies have shown that an increase in resources can cause the paradox of enrichment i e the destabilization of certain species population as the system is enriched this situation is rather contradictory to our logical intuition parallel with this view harvesting effort and the intensity of enrichment activities are among crucial factors in shaping the sustainability of fishery activities and natural resources this is because an extreme harvesting effort could lead to resource depletion and threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems in this work we investigate the joint effects of enrichment and harvesting activities in an intraguild predator prey fishery model that incorporates the michaelis menten type of harvesting of predatory fishes we study the existence and stability of the steady states in this system analytically and conduct numerical simulations together with bifurcation analysis to verify our analytical findings our co dimension one bifurcation analysis shows that the system can exhibit local bifurcations such as transcritical saddle node subcritical and supercritical hopf bifurcations co dimension two bifurcation analysis further demonstrates the existence of global dynamics through the appearance of generalized hopf gh and zero hopf zh bifurcations which occur due to the interactions of distinct local bifurcations in this ecological system the limit point bifurcation of cycles that emanates from the gh point has a bounded parameter space region in which tristability phenomenon between stable steady states and stable limit cycles occurs in a scenario where the resources are enriched in the presence of harvesting activity bistability emerges with the long term outcomes lead to the exclusion of either prey or predator population depending on the initial conditions of species based on these findings we propose another interpretation to the paradox of enrichment as postulated in ecological theories this predator prey fishery system can be destabilized through an alternative stable states phenomenon which results in the extinction of certain species as the ecosystem is further enriched keywords ordinary differential equations intraguild predator prey system alternative stable states bifurcation analysis fisheries marine conservation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in recent years scientific researchers start to consider the idea of intraguild predation in ecological systems intraguild predation is defined as an ecological interaction consisting of both competition and predation which happen simultaneously in a food web gotelli et al 2008 for instance in a two species intraguild predation system one species can consume the other species and at the same time they also compete for shared resources ang and safuan 2021 this concept was first introduced in a seminal work polis et al 1989 published in 1989 since then further progresses have been made in this direction to incorporate more realism in formulating the intraguild predation models holt and polis 1997 polis et al 1989 polis and holt 1992 ang and safuan 2021 this interaction can be observed in most trophic levels in marine ecosystems for instance i copepods feeding on other copepods eggs and zooplankton kang et al 2000 ii mixotrophs feeding on and competing with phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients moeller et al 2019 and iii pinnipeds feeding on sharks fallows et al 2015 in a small pelagic fish population some researchers irigoien and de roos 2011 have performed an analysis on the role of intraguild predation dynamics in marine communities it is discovered that this kind of interaction is one of the simplest examples of marine ecosystem complexities which is relevant for size structured populations of fishery communities nevertheless intraguild predation is not limited only to marine ecosystems this interaction is observed across different biological taxon from as small as insects wissinger and mcgrady 1993 borer et al 2003 to mammals fedriani et al 2000 and often this ecological interaction can also be shaped by other external factors such as harvesting and environmental enrichment considering the significant influences of these different factors can exert on the food web dynamics we seek to better understand the combined effects of harvesting and the intensity of enrichment activities on the intraguild predation system from the perspective of economic and ecological standpoints harvesting is one of the important factors to be examined due to its impact on resource and fishery management in modelling fields distinct techniques have been employed to investigate the crucial effects of harvesting on fishery ecosystems for instance a mathematical model chaudhuri 1986 has been introduced to study the harvesting strategies in the form of using the catch per unit effort of two competing fish species a similar approach has been combined with a bionomic and economic equilibrium to analyse a predator prey harvesting model with variable carrying capacity ganguli et al 2017 however few studies have argued that the concept of catch per unit effort for harvesting is rather unrealistic lenzini and rebaza 2010 rebaza et al 2008 bairagi et al 2012 several studies devi 2012 lenzini and rebaza 2010 assert that this concept has some limitations such that it causes an unbounded linear increase for the harvesting magnitude formulation with a given finite species population to overcome this problem previous researchers clark and mangel 1979 bairagi et al 2012 consider the nonlinear type of harvesting since this type of formulation is more realistic than the linear ones for example a nonlinear function called michaelis menten type of harvesting clark and mangel 1979 has been proposed to resolve the aforementioned unboundedness problem numerous studies have been conducted on the incorporation of michaelis menten type of harvesting in distinct ecological models one such systems a modified leslie gower model with the michaelis menten type of harvesting term gupta and chandra 2013 has been employed to uncover the bifurcational changes in dynamics of predator prey interactions such as transcritical saddle node hopf and bognadov taken bifurcations in parallel with this other studies hu 2017 kumar and kharbanda 2019 li et al 2016 have also demonstrated the existence of rich and complex dynamics in the predator prey models when nonlinear harvesting terms e g michaelis menten type is incorporated recently an intraguild predation system ang and safuan 2021 has been developed with the inclusion of michaelis menten type predator harvesting this model is extended from a fishery system safuan et al 2013 that incorporates a natural or biotic resource as one of the population variables with harvesting effects on predatory fish species these modelling studies have provided some evidence on the appearance of alternative stable states in this fishery ecosystem ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 ecological theory also predicts the emergence of alternative stable states or regime shift dynamics in several marine ecosystems e g eutrophic lakes under variations in nutrient concentrations tay et al 2022 often changes to nutrient levels in marine and freshwater habitats can drive shifts between different species tay et al 2022 it has been documented in a limnological work that the risk of instigating a regime shift over a wide range of environmental conditions can be tempered by harvesting activities kuiper et al 2017 on the one hand some empirical studies have shown that harvesting certain marine species such as macrophytes can be effective in reducing disturbance in lakes kuiper et al 2017 but on the other hand it is important to realize that over harvesting of such species can also lead to disruption of marine ecosystems even under nutrient rich conditions verhofstad et al 2017 kuiper et al 2017 additionally the influences of biotic interactions have also shaped these marine community dynamics verity and smetacek 1996 biotic interactions e g predation and competition play an important role in keeping the ecosystem functioning ramesh et al 2021 mohd et al 2017 mohd and noorani 2021 furthermore these interactions between species together with other biological and external processes can significantly affect the occurrence of the alternative stable states and the long term compositions in the natural communities mohd et al 2016 2018 in general natural resources and its enrichment activities such as physical enrichment e g artificial reefs and dietary enrichment e g flavoured feed variable sized pellets are being used to increase the suitability of habitats and environmental conditions thereby providing more choice to fishes over their environments janhunen et al 2021 näslund and johnsson 2016 however these enrichment activities often being associated with the paradoxical effects in ecology such as in predator prey and fishery ecosystems several studies have shown that an increase in resources or enriched environments can cause the paradox of enrichment i e the destabilization or extinction of certain species population as the systems are enriched rosenzweig 1971 gilpin 1972 mohd 2019 tay et al 2022 in aquatic ecosystems scenario paradox of enrichment is also apparent in the presence of eutrophication phenomenon tubay et al 2013 gray et al 2002 korpinen and bonsdorff 2015 eutrophication is a process in which the body of water becomes progressively enriched that leads to destabilization of the ecosystem due to algal blooms and hypoxia chapin iii et al 2002 it has also been reported that eutrophication and fisheries exploitation through harvesting are among the main problems that can influence the fishery industries breitburg et al 2009 considering the consequences of these biological and external factors an evidence based decision making through the use of model based predictions is crucial to be devised to ensure sustainable fishing activities the outputs from such model can be employed to plan effective management strategies so that fisheries can continue to thrive in marine and freshwater habitats motivated by these ecological observations we investigate the joint effects of intraguild predation harvesting and the intensity of enrichment activities on the fishery ecosystems to do this we re visit a predator prey system ang and safuan 2021 consisting of intraguild predation michaelis menten type harvesting together with biotic resources components and perform a detailed bifurcation analysis to discover the bifurcational structures and reveal the overall dynamics of this ecological system apart from performing theoretical analysis to analyse the steady states and its stability properties numerical bifurcation analysis is conducted using xppaut ermentrout and mahajan 2003 omaiye and mohd 2018 and matcont dhooge et al 2008 packages to construct co dimension one and two bifurcation diagrams demonstrating distinct dynamics of species interactions and intriguing ecological phenomena under different parameter variations our aim is to examine how harvesting effort interacts with enrichment activities to shape local and global dynamics of intraguild predation fishery ecosystem across a much wider range of parameter space than considered in the previous work ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 prior researchers ang and safuan 2021 have focussed the analysis of this ecological system on finding the optimal threshold for the predator harvesting by deriving the bionomic equilibrium within the system using pontryagin s maximum principle gamkrelidze 1999 they also highlighted some effects of harvesting process especially in mediating different dynamical behaviour of a fishery prey predator model however most of their analysis only focussed on the occurrence of two local bifurcations i e hopf and transcritical bifurcations with some verifications from numerical simulations as the magnitude of harvesting varies they also did not typically consider numerous ranges of bifurcational changes in dynamics as harvesting and enrichment activities vary in a factorial manner thus precluding a proper investigation of possible interactions between these important external factors in shaping the fishery ecosystem dynamics this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the description of the model and some theoretical analysis on the steady states and its stability properties in the appendix section in section 3 the numerical experimental results e g time series plots one and two parameter bifurcation diagrams are presented as resource enrichment and harvesting magnitudes change the final section i e section 4 concludes and summarizes the important observations of this study and discusses its ecological implications 2 model description and theoretical analysis we employ a three dimensional predator prey system consisting of intraguild predation michaelis menten type harvesting and shared biotic resources components ang and safuan 2021 1 d x d t r 1 x 1 x m z a x y d y d t r 2 y 1 y n z b x y c e y d 1 e d 2 y d z d t z g u x v y where x corresponds to prey and y corresponds to predator populations both of these species have logistic growths with the rates of r 1 and r 2 respectively for the biotic resource population z this shared resource is accessible for both prey and predator populations with the rate of m and n respectively with 0 m 1 0 n 1 in which m n 1 parameter g is referred to the growth rate for biotic resource whereas u and v are the resource consumption rates by prey and predator species respectively parameters a and b are referred to the intensity of interaction between prey and predator species the catchability coefficient of predator fish is denoted by c whereas e is the harvesting effort applied on predator fish with d 1 and d 2 as the positive constants the non dimensionalization transformation ang and safuan 2021 with the scaled variables x a n x m r 2 y a y r 2 z a n z r 2 and τ r 2 t are performed and we obtain the following system 2 d x d τ α x 1 x z x y d y d τ y 1 y z β x y δ y σ y d z d τ z ρ ϵ x μ y where α r 1 r 2 β b m a n δ a c e d 2 r 2 2 ρ g r 2 ϵ m u a n and μ v a all these parameters are assumed to be positive to ensure biological feasibility of the system in the system 2 we concentrate our analysis on the joint effects of harvesting δ and environmental enrichment ρ which play significant impacts in shaping this intraguild predation community dynamics 2 1 existence of steady states by letting d x d τ d y d τ d z d τ 0 there are three possible equilibria found in the system 2 i the prey free equilibrium e 1 0 ρ μ ρ μ σ ρ μ ρ μ σ δ μ ii the predator free equilibrium e 2 ρ ϵ 0 ρ ϵ iii the coexistence equilibrium e 3 ρ μ y ˆ ϵ y ˆ α μ y ˆ ρ ϵ y ˆ α where y ˆ solves the cubic equation of 3 a y ˆ 3 b y ˆ 2 c y ˆ d 0 with a α β μ 2 ϵ 2 b α β μ 2 σ ϵ 2 σ 2 α β μ ρ α ϵ 2 α ϵ μ c α β ρ 2 α δ ϵ μ α ϵ ρ 2 α β μ ρ σ α ϵ 2 σ α ϵ μ σ d α β ρ 2 σ α ϵ ρ σ α δ ϵ ρ to obtain the roots of the cubic equation 3 using cardano s formula nahin 1998 we substitute y ˆ ζ b 3 a to express the equation into the form of 4 ζ 3 s ζ t 0 where 5 s c a b 2 3 a 2 and t d a 2 b 3 27 a 3 b c 3 a 2 to find the solutions we let 6a s 3 u v 6b t v 3 u 3 it turns out that ζ u v is one of the solutions for the reduced cubic equation to describe u and v in terms of s and t we substitute eq 6 a in terms of u into eq 6 b that yields to t v 3 s 3 v 3 0 v 6 t v 3 s 3 27 solving the solution above in terms of v 3 7 v 3 t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 since v 3 u 3 t then 8 u 3 t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 thus s and v are expressed as below u t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 3 and v t 2 t 2 4 s 3 27 3 since we have already discovered one of the roots of the equation ζ u v we carry out long division polynomials using the root on eq 4 thus the roots of expressed cubic eq 4 are given as ζ k u v for k 1 v u 2 i 3 2 u v for k 2 3 therefore for k 1 2 3 e k ρ μ y ˆ ϵ ζ k b 3 a α μ y ˆ ρ ϵ y ˆ α in the expression of u and v the equation δ t 2 4 s 3 27 is the discriminant of the depressed cubic equation it is known that when δ 0 then the three roots are distinct and real the feasible criteria for interior equilibrium e 3 to exist in the positive quadrant are ρ μ y ˆ 0 and α y ˆ 0 in other words interior equilibrium e 3 is feasible and can exist in the positive quadrant if min ρ μ α y ˆ since y ˆ 0 is strictly positive for biological feasibility such condition is always necessary and must be satisfied for the stability analysis of each steady state we refer interested readers to appendix section from our theoretical analysis we observed that there are three types of steady states in the model 2 in the appendix section we conducted stability analysis on the equilibria and based on the threshold conditions on stability it is shown that the harvesting δ and resource enrichment ρ magnitudes play an important role in determining the dynamics of an intraguild predation predator prey system this observation is also consistent with previous works on the effects of resource enrichment safuan et al 2013 ganguli et al 2017 and harvesting activities ang and safuan 2021 thus to validate these theoretical results we conducted numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis to further examine the dynamical behaviours of the model 2 the parametrisation of the model 2 is inspired by the previous work ang and safuan 2021 and these parameter values are shown in table 1 using this set of biological parameters we then perform detailed co dimension one and two analysis to discover the bifurcational changes in dynamics of this ecological system as harvesting effort δ and resource enrichment ρ change 3 results numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis in this section we investigate the combined effects of enrichment ρ and harvesting δ activities on this intraguild predation system through numerical bifurcation analysis and simulation techniques 3 1 co dimension one and two bifurcation analysis we begin by examining the influences of resource enrichment ρ on the dynamical behaviour of the model 2 using co dimension one bifurcation analysis as an example fig 1 depicts the equilibria of the model as ρ changes other parameter values are as in shown in table 1 there are several colours curves and label conventions that have been used for this one parameter bifurcation diagram solid red curves represent the stable steady states solid black curves depict the unstable steady states black dotted lines are used to divide the graphs into four regions our continuation result reveals several threshold values of resource enrichment which correspond to hopf bifurcation h b limit point bifurcation l p and transcritical bifurcation t b in particular this system possesses hopf bifurcations in the interval between h b 1 ρ 1 1672 to h b 2 ρ 1 2706 besides there is a limit point bifurcation at l p ρ 1 1618 as ρ increases further the system encounters a transcritical bifurcation at t b ρ 2 45 based on these thresholds we divided the graph into four regions region i 0 ρ l p region ii l p ρ h b 2 region iii h b 2 ρ t b and region iv ρ t b region i 0 ρ l p in region i we observe that there is only one stable steady state which is the predator free equilibrium e 2 based on local stability analysis in the appendix section e 2 is locally stable given δ ϵ β ρ σ ϵ σ 0 the parameter values in table 1 suggest that e 2 is locally asymptotically stable as ρ 28 as the value of ρ increases from zero the population density of prey and resource increasing linearly to ρ refer to fig 1 recall that the predator free equilibrium in this model is e 2 ρ ϵ 0 ρ ϵ in which the density of both populations are proportional to ρ thus it can be seen that our numerical results e g e 2 agree with our theoretical analysis in the previous section in the presence of low enrichment activity ρ 0 5 which results in the scarcity of biotic resources refer to fig 2 we observe that the intraguild predator is being displaced while the prey and resource species persist with limited resources predator could not strive in this condition having a low resource and being harvested in this case the long term trajectories converge to e 2 i e 0 714 0 0 714 from different initial conditions as shown by fig 2 a b region ii l p ρ h b 2 in fig 1 it can be seen that there are two hopf bifurcation points where limit cycles emerge the hopf bifurcation hb is the crucial mechanism that induces oscillatory dynamics in this fishery model with the change in stability in e 3 i e the three species coexistence equilibrium there also occurs a limit point bifurcation l p ρ 1 1618 in the vicinity of h b 1 ρ 1 1672 this interval between l p and h b 1 is rather delicate small difference in ρ where several attractors are stable in this small region to examine the aforementioned observations we consider some values of ρ which lie in the intervals l p ρ 1 h b 1 and h b 1 ρ 2 h b 2 for an illustration purpose on the convergence of steady states for distinct values of ρ e g ρ 1 1 165 respectively ρ 2 1 2 we employ different initial conditions and some of these observations are illustrated in fig 3 respectively fig 4 in our numerical experiments we found two stable steady states which are the three species coexistence fig 3 a e 3 0 570 0 218 0 829 and the predator free equilibrium fig 3 b e 2 1 663 0 1 663 for distinct initial conditions used in this case the bistability behaviour is observed and which steady state is reached depends on the initial conditions of species similar bistability observation emerges for ρ 2 where we discover the occurrence of a stable limit cycle fig 4 a and e 2 1 714 0 1 714 equilibrium fig 4 b for different initial conditions employed the density population destabilized around e 3 and continued to oscillate in the long run for certain initial conditions region iii h b 2 ρ t b for moderate enrichment activities e g ρ 2 the dynamics are similar to region ii except that the periodic behaviour disappears and e 3 becomes a stable steady state thus in region iii there occurs bistability between steady states e 2 fig 5 a and e 3 fig 5 b as initial conditions are varied once ρ hits the value 2 45 transcritical bifurcation occur where there is an exchange of stability between e 3 and e 1 at this point the prey population has gone extinct for e 3 region iv ρ t b in region iv bistability phenomenon is still evident with e 1 and e 2 as the stable steady states in this case the long term behaviour leads to exclusion of either prey or predator depending on the initial conditions of species to illustrate this behaviour we examine the time series diagrams for distinct initial conditions in fig 6 a respectively b where it can be seen that the predator respectively prey species is eliminated in the long run from an ecological perspective this is a different form of destabilization of the species population which can lead to extinction of some species this notion is known as paradox of enrichment which was coined by rosenzweig in 1971 rosenzweig 1971 gilpin 1972 this paradox postulated that the act of enriching the environments can cause counter intuitive effects while logically an enriched environment would be beneficial to ecosystems and favourable to interacting species this situation can cause exclusion of species due to the occurrence of high amplitude of population oscillations i e limit cycles in this case some species may oscillate to a very low density which would increase the likelihood of stochastic extinction for this fishery system instead of limit cycles high resource enrichment causes alternative stable states behaviour with the final community compositions lead to two different communities this situation results in the exclusion either prey or predator populations depending on initial conditions 3 2 intriguing dynamics as magnitudes of harvesting and environmental enrichment change from our previous analysis in fig 1 we observe the occurrence of several bifurcations in this intraguild predation fishery system transcritical limit point and hopf bifurcations these bifurcations form distinct regions with qualitatively different dynamics additionally the interactions of these local bifurcations can engender higher co dimension two bifurcations and extra insights on the dynamical behaviours of the model 2 with the aid of matcont bifurcation analysis package we constructed the regions on two parameters plane δ ρ in fig 7 on which a pair of hopf bifurcation curves i e subcritical hopf brown and supercritical hopf green bifurcations intersect at generalized hopf gh bifurcation point with the corresponding creation a limit point of cycles lpc bifurcation curve purple there also occurs zero hopf zh bifurcation where this co dimension two bifurcation point lies at a tangential intersection of curves of limit point and hopf bifurcations these bifurcational changes in dynamics shape the overall outcomes of the model 2 as the magnitudes of δ and ρ are varied in region ii we can see that only coexistence steady state e 3 is stable in the system in a situation where the harvesting parameter δ and the resource enrichment ρ are low prey and predator species alongside with biotic resource can coexist in this ecological system from the viewpoint of conservation biology this is a favourable outcome since the diversity of species is maintained by ensuring that none of these species in the ecosystems are excluded in region i we observe that only prey free equilibrium e 1 is stable when enrichment activity is intense and harvesting activity on predator is rather low predators can outnumber prey species since the environments are favourable for the predator to thrive in this case prey species cannot survive and will be excluded in a long run in region iv there emerges alternate stable states behaviour as harvesting magnitude increases and as resource enrichment is rather low or moderate there are two possible outcomes i e predator free e 2 or coexistence e 3 equilibria which outcome is reached depends on initial conditions if the initial abundances of predator species is rather high to strive and persist the long term outcome leads to coexistence of three species otherwise the predator species cannot survive since they are being harvested at increasing rates in region iii it is observed that coexistence of three species is not possible in this case when both harvesting activity and resource enrichment are high prey and predator species cannot coexist and the long term outcomes would lead to the exclusion of either species e 1 or e 2 via alternative stable states phenomenon the final community compositions depend on the initial abundances of species if the prey population is initially more abundant and can increase its population the long term outcome leads to predator species exclusion and vice versa for region vi there is only one stable steady state which is predator free equilibrium e 2 when the harvesting magnitude is high and resource enrichment is at a low level this scenario is more favourable for prey with limited resources predators need to compete with prey species while intensely being harvested in a long run predator species could not persist in such environments and would go extinct eventually meanwhile region v shows the occurrence of stable limit cycles in this fishery system in this case stable limit cycles appear and the population densities of these interacting species can coexist via oscillatory dynamics there also occurs another attractor i e stable steady state e 2 and which attractor is reached depends on the initial conditions of species for region vii this region is bounded by a subcritical hopf bifurcation curve brown and limit point bifurcation of cycles curve purple that emanates from generalized hopf gh bifurcation located at δ 0 193 ρ 1 146 in this region we observe tristability behaviour between e 2 e 3 and stable limit cycles which can be seen from a phase portrait in fig 8 with δ 0 255 and ρ 1 6 produced using different initial conditions to further demonstrate this tristability outcome we generate a one parameter bifurcation diagram in fig 9 as δ varies in a small neighbourhood around 0 24 0 3 in this region there are two limit cycles that emerge in the system i e one stable green dots and another one is unstable blue dots there also occurs stable steady states e 2 and e 3 red curves depending on initial conditions the long term outcome either converges to stable e 2 fig 10 a e 3 fig 10 b or stable limit cycles fig 10 c 4 discussion and conclusion in this work we examine the combined influences of harvesting and enrichment activities in an intraguild predation fishery ecosystem though we have re visited and employed a predator prey fishery system from previous work ang and safuan 2021 we managed to perform a detailed numerical continuation analysis to discover the bifurcational structures of this ecological system one of our contributions is to demonstrate different dynamical behaviours of the fishery resources system as the harvesting intensity changes prior researchers ang and safuan 2021 have discovered some of these observations when the harvesting magnitude is varied however these previous observations may be inconclusive and thus inspired this work and our further investigation we extend these observations through detailed co dimension one and two bifurcation analysis techniques and observe that there occurs several intriguing dynamics overall these findings also demonstrate the importance of numerical bifurcation analysis in tracking both stable and unstable steady states limit cycles and distinct bifurcation points in order to gain better understanding of the dynamics of this ecological systems we uncover the occurrence of generalized hopf gh bifurcation numerically due to the collision of subcritical and supercritical hopf bifurcations due to this co dimension two bifurcation point the limit point of cycles lpc emanates from this gh point and this is not evident in the previous analysis ang and safuan 2021 it is observed that the bounded region between the lpc and subcritical hopf bifurcation curves possesses a tristability phenomenon for any magnitudes of harvesting and enrichment activities that fall within this region three distinct outcomes e g stable limit cycles prey free or coexistence equilibria are possible depending on initial conditions a limit point bifurcation curve is also found near the hopf curve and these two bifurcation curves tangentially intersect and produce a zero hopf zh bifurcation point furthermore we also arrive at a different interpretation of paradox of enrichment rosenzweig 1971 when varying the intensity of resources of the system it has been observed that the species populations either prey or predator can be excluded in the case of high abundances of resources in an extreme condition when resources are rather abundant due to enrichment activities prey species could go extinct due to overconsumption by predator which can disrupt the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems similarly the preys may be strong competitors and they are more efficient in competing and utilizing the abundant biotic resources in a long run the predator species can be affected and this situation can lead to their exclusion traditionally this paradoxical effect is caused by the emergence of limit cycles which increases in the amplitudes of oscillation rosenzweig 1971 gilpin 1972 however in this marine ecosystem we have discovered that the system can also be destabilized and led to species exclusion through alternative stable states phenomenon as the ecosystem is enriched further the occurrence of alternative stable states also corresponds to gause s competitive exclusion principle gause 1932 1934 where this theory postulates that coexistence is almost impossible when species compete for the same limited resources in line with the aforementioned observations some experimental findings have demonstrated that the occurrence of alternative stable states can induce catastrophic loss of aquatic species as a consequence of nutrient enrichment morris et al 2003a b in the presence of alternative stable states phenomenon ecological literature also predicts that high nutrient enrichment increases the probability of regime switching between states morris et al 2003a with distinct final compositions and exclusion of species are possible while harvesting effects of marine ecosystems such as in lakes have also been reported to cause a shift in species dominance some limnological works suggest that these effects are rather hard to be anticipated accurately under nutrient enrichment given the complexity of alternative stable states mechanism morris et al 2003b our modelling work is able to quantify these combined effects and the long term distributions or qualitative behaviours of the marine ecosystem under consideration through numerical bifurcation analysis we illustrate that distinct outcomes can emerge in this system consisting of stable multi species coexistence competitive exclusion i e prey free and predator free equilibria stable limit cycles and alternative stable states i e bistable and tristable behaviours these results also extend the observations in previous modelling work and provide some important insights for the observed differences in marine community dynamics in our simulation results and also in a number of different studies ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 from the perspective of fisheries management our two parameter bifurcation analysis suggests that moderate levels of harvesting and nutrient enrichment activities are necessary to ensure the maintenance of biodiversity in this marine ecosystem higher rates of harvesting activity and nutrient enrichment can lead to the occurrences of alternative stable states with the exclusion of species is possible these findings provide some guidances for marine conservation and fisheries management on the sustainable use of fishery stocks this strategy can be enforced through proper rules and legislation that are needed to prevent overfishing and to help overfished stocks rebound hilborn et al 2020 we also caution on the practices of enriching the environment of marine species which can have some counterintuitive effects while several types of environmental enrichment have been adapted in aquaculture and fishery industries and seem to bring positive impacts e g reproduction success of fishes gerber et al 2015 our findings illustrate another possible scenario that can occur in a nutrient rich condition in particular the risk of exclusion of certain species should also be considered in implementing these enrichment activities some studies suggest that little is known about the enrichment effects on fish welfare under production conditions and whether benefits may outweigh the drawbacks like increased operational costs or increased effort for maintenance in the long run gerber et al 2015 in conclusion this study illustrates the significant roles of enrichment and harvesting activities in an intraguild predation fishery model our results also provide some insights on when do the harvesting and enrichment activities matter in mediating distinct outcomes of the fishery ecosystem more investigation is needed into this topic to better understand the consequences of distinct biological and external forces on the marine community dynamics one obvious limitation of this work is that the results may be limited to the parametrisation of the system which is inspired by previous modelling work ang and safuan 2021 safuan et al 2013 more analysis is required to investigate the dynamics of this marine ecosystem under different sets of parametrisation including empirical estimates from real data also for future work we plan to examine the effects of eutrophication process in interaction with enrichment and harvesting activities in shaping the dynamics of this intraguild predation system previous literature in fisheries management asserts that eutrophication not just only lower the productivity levels of fishes but this process also limits the spatial dynamics of the fish populations breitburg et al 2009 it has also been proposed that eutrophication or water quality management should be conducted in parallel with the fisheries management and enforcement of related policies zou et al 2020 tay et al 2022 this is because harvesting activity of fishes removes nutrients from the water ecosystem and the size of the fish stock also influences eutrophication through food web effects and other mechanisms iho et al 2017 overall we propose that a detailed knowledge on sustainable harvesting activities environmental enrichment and the consequences of other biological factors is crucial elements to be considered in the modern fisheries management and these issues warrant further studies by scientific communities using both

possess two eigenvalues with a negative real part notice that the third condition ρ μ σ δ μ 0 has to be satisfied for e 1 to exist in positive quadrant mentioned in the earlier part of the discussion since we assumed it to be true e 1 exists the third condition is already satisfied the first condition ρ α μ 0 plays an important role to guarantees the negativeness of the remaining eigenvalue suppose that ρ μ σ 2 δ μ 2 σ 2 δ μ ρ 0 if ρ α μ 0 then e 1 is a locally stable node otherwise e 1 is an unstable saddle point the case when ρ α μ 0 serves as the threshold stability condition or

due to numerous parameters involved in the j e 3 it is hard to construct the necessary condition for the stability of equilibrium e 3 thus we construct an appropriate lyapunov function to examine the

24329,determining whether species richness protects host species against infectious diseases transmission i e dilution effect within established communities is a core concern of disease ecology previous modeling studies have focused on pairwise transmission between hosts largely ignoring the impact of neighboring species on pathogen transmission here we modified the multi host susceptible infected recovered sir model to investigate the effects of higher order interactions on the dilution effect we found that compared with direct transmission higher order interactions that impede pathogen transmission can disproportionately decrease disease risk at high species richness levels under additive community assembly and thereby enhance a dilution effect or neutralizing an amplification effect into a unimodal species richness disease relationship conversely higher order interactions that promote infection among host neighbors can enlarge an amplification effect and diminish a dilution effect or even reverse it higher order interactions did not affect the emergence of the dilution effect for substitutive community assembly our results provide a unified framework for understanding the dilution and amplification effects and emphasize the importance of taking higher order interactions into account for understanding mechanisms underlying the dilution effect keywords amplification effect density dependent transmission dilution effects frequency dependent transmission identity effects neighboring effects data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the accelerating worldwide biodiversity loss has drawn the attention of researchers to the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions services cardinale et al 2012 the nature of which the spread of diseases may be amplified during biodiversity loss is of particular interest as it is a critical factor for maintaining the health of natural ecosystems and human beings keesing and ostfeld 2021 increasing biodiversity can either lessen i e the dilution effect keesing et al 2006 ostfeld and keesing 2012 magnify i e the amplification effect or have no effect on disease risk keesing et al 2006 liu et al 2016 halliday and rohr 2019 recent meta analyses of empirical studies have shown that although the dilution effect is more prevalent civitello et al 2015 liu et al 2020 the occurrence of the dilution effect is context dependent and strongly related to both the spatial scale of the investigation and the environmental conditions of the site liu et al 2020 magnusson et al 2020 rohr et al 2020 vadell et al 2020 theoretical studies using the multi host susceptible infected recovered sir epidemiological models and pairwise pathogen transmission show that a dilution effect is always expected when the transmission is frequency dependent while the dilution effect occurring depends on the nature of host community assembly disassembly when pathogen transmission is density dependent rudolf and antonovics 2005 therefore we can still expect a dilution effect under substitutive community assembly i e the abundance of each host species decreases proportionately with increasing species richness under a zero sum principle even when the pathogen transmission is density dependent dobson 2004 rudolf and antonovics 2005 mihaljevic et al 2014 alternatively increasing host species richness will amplify disease risk for additive host community assembly i e the total abundance of constituent host species increases linearly with species richness rudolf and antonovics 2005 joseph et al 2013 mihaljevic et al 2014 although these predictions have been partially verified in nature reviewed in ostfeld and keesing 2012 liu et al 2020 rohr et al 2020 they are not always consistent with empirical studies for example the severity of foliar fungal disease a disease with a transmission route that is density dependent decreased as host species richness increased for an additive host community assembly system in a tibetan alpine meadow liu et al 2016 the discrepancy found with the given example may be a result of neglecting the influence of other host species on pathogen transmission between pairwise host species in previous theoretical models particularly in species rich communities de deyn et al 2004 sobek et al 2009 nadrowski et al 2010 the presence of heterospecific individuals within the vicinity of a species may substantially inhibit or promote pathogen transmission with the outcome largely dependent on their identity and local abundance barbosa et al 2009 huang et al 2014 for example fungal diseases caused by passalora microsora on tilia cordata increases with increment in the proportion of coexisting fagus sylvatica while decreases with more coniferous species pinus sylvestris hantsch et al 2014 another study confirmed that oaks quercus spp are more resistant to anthracnose in diverse communities while juniperus virginiana are more susceptible to gall rust when surrounded by diverse neighbors grossman et al 2018 a similar effect mediated by neighboring species has also been found in old fields mitchell et al 2002 in these cases pathogen transmission onto the target host species is influenced by the indirect interaction induced by neighboring species which has been termed as higher order interactions wootton 1993 higher order interactions emerge when the per capita effect of one species on another depends on interactions with a third species wootton 1993 billick and case 1994 levine et al 2017 higher order interactions have gained attention in species coexistence theory with a wide range of possible effects bairey et al 2016 grilli et al 2017 mayfield and stouffer 2017 for example it has been well demonstrated that species coexistence will be favored when the presence of a third species reduces the intensity of competition between two species bairey et al 2016 grilli et al 2017 singh and baruah 2021 however higher order interactions are not limited to species within the same trophic level huang and sih 1990 beckerman et al 1997 liao et al 2020 in pairwise pathogen transmission a third species is likely to persist and either inhibit or promote pathogen transmission calonnec et al 2013 costes et al 2013 hantsch et al 2014 for example low susceptibility of neighboring species may affect fungal spore transmission allowing the target species to be shielded from spores and slow the spread of disease jactel et al 2009 liu et al 2016 although the overall prevalence of higher order interactions is yet to be quantified it is apparent that not considering higher order interactions may not only fail to predict the prevalence of the dilution effect but also not identify the underlying factors causing errors in predictions in this study we modified the multi host sir model to investigate the effect of the higher order interactions on the dilution effect specifically we hypothesize that within pathogen transmission and community assembly methods higher order interactions that impede pathogen transmission hereafter negative higher order interactions may enhance a dilution effect or neutralize an amplification effect into an unimodal species richness disease relationship while higher order interactions that promote infection among host neighbors hereafter positive higher order interactions can enlarge an amplification effect and diminish a dilution effect or even reverse it 2 materials and methods first we built a global species pool of 49 host species with different ecological and epidemiological attributes we then constructed local communities by randomly selecting 3 49 species with an interval of 2 from the global species pool pathogen transmission process was described by a multi host susceptible infectious recovered sir model for each local community we calculated community level basic reproduction number r 0 as a predictor for disease risk 2 1 the global species pool and basic assumptions to construct a global host species pool 49 species we assume that species abundance follows a lognormal distribution joseph et al 2013 mihaljevic et al 2014 the number of species of the p th rank in abundance will be s p y 0 e z p m 2 where z is a scaling constant s is the number of species of the p th rank in abundance m is the rank with the largest number of species and y 0 is the number of species in that rank the allometric scaling of host species birth and death rates pathogen induced death rates α i and equilibrium density k i are defined following established methods dobson 2004 joseph et al 2013 mihaljevic et al 2014 table 1 briefly birth rate b i and death rate d i of host species i scale allometrically with body size which is usually measured by biomass or weight individual body size of a species is determined by its rank in abundance with the most common species being the smallest and reproducing most frequently we also assume that pathogen induced mortality rate α i is proportional to the background mortality rate of the species with larger species having lower death rate due to infection dobson 2004 recovery rate σ i is assumed to be proportional to the mortality rate so that larger species need more time to recover from infection de leo and dobson 1996 dobson 2004 bolzoni et al 2008 mihaljevic et al 2014 we use the basic reproduction number r 0 i to measure the competence of species i that is the capacity of a host to acquire and transmit infection given exposure to a pathogen keesing et al 2006 joseph et al 2013 we assume the basic reproduction number follows a truncated gamma distribution that can be expressed as β i i k i α i σ i d i where β i i is the intraspecific transmission rate according to this equation populations of most species would not be invaded by the pathogens on their own while some species would experience severe epidemics in the absence of other species rudolf and antonovics 2005 given the generality of growth defense trade offs cappelli et al 2020 we assume smaller species receive higher values of r 0 i roche et al 2012 roche et al 2013 the interspecific transmission rate between different species is calculated as the pairwise average of intraspecific transmission rates of species i and j i e β i j c i j β i i β j j 2 where c i j is a scaling parameter that represents the strength of interspecific pathogen transmission relative to intraspecific transmission dobson 2004 2 2 the multi host sir model with higher order interactions to consider the higher order interactions in pathogen transmission process we constructed our model by modifying the susceptible infected recovered sir epidemiological model to account for multi host communities dobson 2004 d s i d t b i α i n i n i d i s i s i j 1 n β i j k 1 n γ i j k n k i j 1 d i i d t s i j 1 n β i j k 1 n γ i j k n k i j σ i v i d i i i d r i d t σ i i i d i r i where s i i i r i and n i s i i i r i represent the density of susceptible infected recovered and total individuals of host species i respectively compared with the general multi host sir model dobson 2004 the above model model 1 has an additional transmission component that contains a higher order interaction coefficient of γ i j k which is defined as the change in the transmission rate between two species i and j in the presence of an individual of the third species k because the higher order interaction term k 1 n γ i j k n k is parallel to per capita direct transmission rate β i j in the model γ i j k might be relatively smaller than β i j the presence of the neighboring species k can either intensify or alleviate the pairwise transmission between susceptible individuals of species i and infected individuals of species j therefore γ i j k could be either positive negative or zero i e no higher order interaction without loss of generality we assumed that γ i j k followed normal or uniform distribution in our simulations relevant literature suggests that species with higher abundance and smaller body size may have weaker per capita higher order interaction intensity on other species calonnec et al 2013 however the opposite may also occur because species with bigger body size and lower abundance may have less chance to interact with other species and thus exert lower per capita higher order interaction on other species here without loss of generality we sorted these values of γ i j k and assigned them to each species by assuming either positive negative or random rank ordering between the abundance of species k and the absolute value of γ i j k for each scenario simulated we considered three types of higher order interactions symmetric higher order interactions i e both positive and negative values of higher order interactions symmetrically distributed around zero negative or positive higher order interactions i e all the values of higher order interactions are negative or positive for example a distribution of u 0 00002 0 00008 defines the number of susceptible individuals transmitted by each infected individual will be increased by 0 002 to 0 008 in each transmission pair due to the influence of the higher order interaction mediated by an individual of a third species 2 3 constructing local host communities we simulated species loss by constructing local communities with species richness of odd numbers ranging from 3 to 49 for each species richness level we randomly selected species from the global species pool we modeled both density and frequency dependent pathogen transmission for each transmission mode we considered both additive and substitutive community assembly scenarios since the real system generally occur between the two extremes we further considered a partially substitutive community assembly method termed saturating method assembly mihaljevic et al 2014 the relationship between community abundance and species richness was a partially logistic curve the abundance of a community increased with number of species but the growth rate slowed with species richness and finally approached an asymptote the relationship can be simulated as a a 0 1 1 e 0 08 n 1 2 where a is the total abundance of the community a 0 is the value of the asymptote and n is the number of host species for each generated local community we calculated community level basic reproduction number r 0 as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix to indicate disease risk dobson 2004 allen et al 2012 mihaljevic et al 2014 in the case where only direct transmission is considered the next generation matrix is diekmann et al 1990 dobson 2004 diekmann et al 2010 rudge et al 2013 g d β 11 p 11 α 1 σ 1 d 1 β n 1 p n 1 α 1 σ 1 d 1 β 1 n p 1 n α n σ n d n β n n p n n α n σ n d n where p is the abundance of infecting species at the disease free equilibrium i e k i for density dependent transmission and is equal to relative abundance of the infecting species i e k i j 1 n k j for frequency dependent transmission dobson 2004 allen et al 2012 mihaljevic et al 2014 when the propagation process is mediated by higher order interactions the next generation matrices g h will be g i j h g i j d p i j k 1 n γ i j k n k α j σ j d j for each parameter set we simulated 500 replications totally 24500 replications for the entire species richness gradient and reported the mean value and standard deviation of r 0 2 4 global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the model to assess how r 0 responds to variation of different input factors i e abundance species richness intra species transmission rate and higher order interactions we performed global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua of our model we used pawn method pianosi and wagener 2018 to define sensitivity index based on cumulative distribution functions which makes the numerical approximation of sensitivity indices easy and robust the pawn sensitivity index for the i th input factor is defined as s i stat x i max r 0 f r 0 r 0 f r 0 x i r 0 x i where f r 0 r 0 and f r 0 x i r 0 x i are the unconditional and conditional cumulative distribution functions of r 0 we used an open source matlab toolbox called safe sensitivity analysis for everybody https www safetoolbox info info and documentation pianosi et al 2015 to calculate the sensitivity indices 3 results we found that the dilution effect occurring or not remained similar for both normal and uniform distributions of the higher order interactions although the higher order interactions had the strongest effects on the dilution effect for a positive relationship between species abundance and γ i j k followed by random and then negative relationships the patterns were quantitively similar under three scenarios therefore we only report the results for the uniform distribution and negative relationship between species abundance and γ i j k unless specified otherwise under the additive community assembly and density dependent transmission community level r 0 monotonically increased with host species richness when there was no higher order interaction or with symmetric higher order interactions fig 1 a c introducing negative higher order interactions led to a non monotonic trend with a clear hump shape in the host species richness disease relationship while the amplification effect of host species richness on disease risk was largely enhanced for positive higher order interactions fig 1a c under additive community assembly and frequency dependent transmission host species richness reduced the disease risk with no higher order interactions or with negative or symmetric high order interactions figs 1d f however in the presence of positive higher order interactions the pattern of the host species richness disease relationship can be completely reversed forming an amplification effect fig 1d f the results were similar when the higher order interactions followed a normal distribution fig s1 under substitutive community assembly r 0 was much smaller when pathogen transmission was frequency dependent when compared to density dependent figs 2 and s2 r 0 also increased for positive higher order interactions and decreased for negative higher order interactions however a dilution effect always emerged regardless of the pathogen transmission methods i e density and frequency dependent transmission or the presence of the higher order interactions figs 2 and s2 in other words substitutive community assembly itself predominantly regulated the relationship between biodiversity and disease risk under saturating community assembly the effect of the higher order interactions on the dilution effect fell between those found under additive and substitutive community assembly under density dependent transmission host species richness had almost no effect on r 0 with symmetric or no higher order interactions whereas a dilution effect and an amplification effect emerged for negative and positive higher order interactions respectively fig 3 a c however unlike the additive community assembly the amplification effect gradually leveled off at high host species richness levels under saturating community assembly under frequency dependent transmission a dilution effect was always expected though r 0 was largely increased when there were positive higher order interactions fig 3d e to test the robustness of our results we considered the situation that 90 of the higher order interaction values were zero representing the condition that most of the neighboring species had no higher order effect on the pairwise transmission in this case under additive community assembly and density dependent transmission for the inherent amplification effect to occur a unimodal host species richness disease relationship still appeared when the intensity of the small fraction of the higher order interactions i e 10 was strong enough figs 4 a and s3a similarly under additive community assembly with frequency dependent transmission even a small fraction of non zero higher order interactions i e 10 could switch the inherent dilution effect to an amplification effect if it was strong enough figs 4b and s3b the global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis showed that intra specific transmission rate and higher order interaction were the two most influential and significant factors for r 0 figs 5 s5 and s6 the sensitivity of r 0 in response to higher order interaction was even larger than that of intra specific transmission rate in the case of density dependent transmission and additive community assembly method 4 discussion previous theoretical studies have made predictions on when host species richness buffers against disease prevalence rudolf and antonovics 2005 but the dilution effect from empirical studies has been proven to be complex and context dependent liu et al 2020 magnusson et al 2020 rohr et al 2020 vadell et al 2020 much remains to be explored about the factors that influence the dilution process halliday et al 2020 keesing and ostfeld 2021 in this study we extended the multi host sir model to assess the role of higher order interactions in explaining the variations in the dilution effect we found that negative higher order interactions i e higher order interactions that reduce pairwise pathogen diffusion disproportionately decreased disease risk at high species richness levels under additive community assembly negative higher order interactions can therefore enhance a dilution effect change an amplification effect into a nonlinear biodiversity disease relationship or even gradually flatten out the amplification effect compared with multi host ecosystems without higher order interactions in pathogen transmission in contrast positive higher order interactions i e higher order interactions that enhance pairwise transmission disproportionately increased disease risk at high species richness levels thus enlarging an amplification effect or diminishing a dilution effect the above conclusions hold true for higher order interactions with both uniform and normal distributions models involving only a small number of species or with models demonstrating different relationship between species abundance and the per capita higher order interactions i e γ i j k demonstrating the robustness of the results this happens because under additive community assembly although the abundance of the extant species remains unchanged the whole community size increases with species richness thereby the effect of the higher order interactions is reinforced due to the increase in the number of individuals that potentially influence this effect these results provide an alternative explanation for specific species richness disease patterns and advise caution in inferring with the dilution effect by only detecting methods of community assembly and pathogen transmission johnson et al 2019 additionally we showed that although higher order interactions affect community level r 0 it did not affect the emergence of the dilution effect under substitutive community assembly in this case when the total size of the host community remains unchanged as species richness varies the existence of higher order interactions in a community does not reverse or neutralize a dilution effect in other words there is no change in the number of individuals that can have higher order interactions during pathogen transmission as a result the variation in the per capita higher order interaction i e variation in γ i j k is not able to reverse the dilution pattern as expected the effect of the higher order interactions on the dilution effect under saturating community assembly fell between those found under additive and substitutive community assembly higher order interactions may reconcile the discrepancy between previous theoretical expectations and empirical observations on the debate of dilution and amplification effect for example for density dependent transmission of foliar fungal disease disease severity decreased as host species richness increased under additive host community assembly in a removal experiment in an alpine meadow the consequent results may have been due to the interception of spores by non hosts in speciose communities liu et al 2016 despite the linear dilution or amplification effects understanding the hump shaped i e nonlinear biodiversity disease relationships remain challenging wood et al 2014 johnson et al 2015 halliday and rohr 2019 a nonlinear biodiversity disease relationship may be expected in few scenarios first if there are trade offs between the hosts growth or reproduction and disease resistance a host community may tend to start with abundant fast growing and less resistant hosts and later be colonized by rarer diluting hosts leading to a unimodal host diversity disease relationship johnson et al 2013 halliday and rohr 2019 secondly the dilution effect of biodiversity may weaken with increase in spatial scale resulting in a hump shaped biodiversity disease pattern along multiple spatial scales halliday and rohr 2019 but see magnusson et al 2020 finally a unimodal pattern is also expected under an asymptotic saturation method that is set between the two extreme community assembly methods i e additive and substitutive methods mihaljevic et al 2014 here we propose an alternative mechanism that negative higher order interactions can produce a unimodal relationship between host species richness and disease risk under additive community assembly and density dependent transmission in this scenario the disproportionately stronger effect of the higher order interactions at higher diversity levels can effectively weaken the amplification effect and thus result in a nonlinear species richness disease relationship there is sufficient empirical evidence that pathogen transmission in a host community can be influenced by neighboring species calonnec et al 2013 costes et al 2013 hantsch et al 2014 neighboring host species can directly alter the rate of pathogen transmission by encounter reduction transmission interference susceptible host regulation and recovery augmentation keesing et al 2006 alternatively the presence of other host species can indirectly alter pathogen transmission among species by changing the biotic or abiotic conditions for example microclimatic conditions are fundamental for fungal pathogen development since

24329,determining whether species richness protects host species against infectious diseases transmission i e dilution effect within established communities is a core concern of disease ecology previous modeling studies have focused on pairwise transmission between hosts largely ignoring the impact of neighboring species on pathogen transmission here we modified the multi host susceptible infected recovered sir model to investigate the effects of higher order interactions on the dilution effect we found that compared with direct transmission higher order interactions that impede pathogen transmission can disproportionately decrease disease risk at high species richness levels under additive community assembly and thereby enhance a dilution effect or neutralizing an amplification effect into a unimodal species richness disease relationship conversely higher order interactions that promote infection among host neighbors can enlarge an amplification effect and diminish a dilution effect or even reverse it higher order interactions did not affect the emergence of the dilution effect for substitutive community assembly our results provide a unified framework for understanding the dilution and amplification effects and emphasize the importance of taking higher order interactions into account for understanding mechanisms underlying the dilution effect

request 1 introduction the accelerating worldwide biodiversity loss has drawn the attention of researchers to the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions services cardinale et al 2012 the nature of which the spread of diseases may be amplified during biodiversity loss is of particular interest as it is a critical factor for maintaining the health of natural ecosystems and human beings keesing and ostfeld 2021 increasing biodiversity can either lessen i e the dilution effect keesing et al 2006 ostfeld and keesing 2012 magnify i e the amplification effect or have no effect on disease risk keesing et al 2006 liu et al 2016 halliday and rohr 2019 recent meta analyses of empirical studies have shown that although the dilution effect is more prevalent civitello et al 2015 liu et al 2020 the occurrence of the dilution effect is context dependent and strongly related to both the spatial scale of the investigation and the environmental conditions of the site liu et al 2020 magnusson et al 2020 rohr et al 2020 vadell et al 2020 theoretical studies using the multi host susceptible infected recovered sir epidemiological models and pairwise pathogen transmission show that a dilution effect is always expected when the transmission is frequency dependent while the dilution effect occurring depends on the nature of host community assembly disassembly when pathogen transmission is density dependent rudolf and antonovics 2005 therefore we can still expect a dilution effect under substitutive community assembly i e the abundance of each host species decreases proportionately with increasing species richness under a zero sum principle even when the pathogen transmission is density dependent dobson 2004 rudolf and antonovics 2005 mihaljevic et al 2014 alternatively increasing host species richness will amplify disease risk for additive host community assembly i e the total abundance of constituent host species increases linearly with species richness rudolf and antonovics 2005 joseph et al 2013 mihaljevic et al 2014 although these predictions have been partially verified in nature reviewed in ostfeld and keesing 2012 liu et al 2020 rohr et al 2020 they are not always consistent with empirical studies for example the severity of foliar fungal disease a disease with a transmission route that is density dependent decreased as host species richness increased for an additive host community assembly system in a tibetan alpine meadow liu et al 2016 the discrepancy found with the given example may be a result of neglecting the influence of other host species on pathogen transmission between pairwise host species in previous theoretical models particularly in species rich communities de deyn et al 2004 sobek et al 2009 nadrowski et al 2010 the presence of heterospecific individuals within the vicinity of a species may substantially inhibit or promote pathogen transmission with the outcome largely dependent on their identity and local abundance barbosa et al 2009 huang et al 2014 for example fungal diseases caused by passalora microsora on tilia cordata increases with increment in the proportion of coexisting fagus sylvatica while decreases with more coniferous species pinus sylvestris hantsch et al 2014 another study confirmed that oaks quercus spp are more resistant to anthracnose in diverse communities while juniperus virginiana are more susceptible to gall rust when surrounded by diverse neighbors grossman et al 2018 a similar effect mediated by neighboring species has also been found in old fields mitchell et al 2002 in these cases pathogen transmission onto the target host species is influenced by the indirect interaction induced by neighboring species which has been termed as higher order interactions wootton 1993 higher order interactions emerge when the per capita effect of one species on another depends on interactions with a third species wootton 1993 billick and case 1994 levine et al 2017 higher order interactions have gained attention in species coexistence theory with a wide range of possible effects bairey et al 2016 grilli et al 2017 mayfield and stouffer 2017 for example it has been well demonstrated that species coexistence will be favored when the presence of a third species reduces the intensity of competition between two species bairey et al 2016 grilli et al 2017 singh and baruah 2021 however higher order interactions are not limited to species within the same trophic level huang and sih 1990 beckerman et al 1997 liao et al 2020 in pairwise pathogen transmission a third species is likely to persist and either inhibit or promote pathogen transmission calonnec et al 2013 costes et al 2013 hantsch et al 2014 for example low susceptibility of neighboring species may affect fungal spore transmission allowing the target species to be shielded from spores and slow the spread of disease jactel et al 2009 liu et al 2016 although the overall prevalence of higher order interactions is yet to be quantified it is apparent that not considering higher order interactions may not only fail to predict the prevalence of the dilution effect but also not identify the underlying factors causing errors in predictions in this study we modified the multi host sir model to investigate the effect of the higher order interactions on the dilution effect specifically we hypothesize that within pathogen transmission and community assembly methods higher order interactions that impede pathogen transmission hereafter negative higher order interactions may enhance a dilution effect or neutralize an amplification effect into an unimodal species richness disease relationship while higher order interactions that promote infection among host neighbors hereafter positive higher order interactions can enlarge an amplification effect and diminish a dilution effect or even reverse it 2 materials and methods first we built a global species pool of 49 host species with different ecological and epidemiological attributes we then constructed local communities by randomly selecting 3 49 species with an interval of 2 from the global species pool pathogen transmission process was described by a multi host susceptible infectious recovered sir model for each local community we calculated community level basic reproduction number r 0 as a predictor for disease risk 2 1 the global species pool and basic assumptions to construct a global host species pool 49 species we assume that species abundance follows a lognormal distribution joseph et al 2013 mihaljevic et al 2014 the number of species of the p th rank in abundance will be s p y 0 e z p m 2 where z is a scaling constant s is the number of species of the p th rank in abundance m is the rank with the largest number of species and y 0 is the number of species in that rank the allometric scaling of host species birth and death rates pathogen induced death rates α i and equilibrium density k i are defined following established methods dobson 2004 joseph et al 2013 mihaljevic et al 2014 table 1 briefly birth rate b i and death rate d i of host species i scale allometrically with body size which is usually measured by biomass or weight individual body size of a species is determined by its rank in abundance with the most common species being the smallest and reproducing most frequently we also assume that pathogen induced mortality rate α i is proportional to the background mortality rate of the species with larger species having lower death rate due to infection dobson 2004 recovery rate σ i is assumed to be proportional to the mortality rate so that larger species need more time to recover from infection de leo and dobson 1996 dobson 2004 bolzoni et al 2008 mihaljevic et al 2014 we use the basic reproduction number r 0 i to measure the competence of species i that is the capacity of a host to acquire and transmit infection given exposure to a pathogen keesing et al 2006 joseph et al 2013 we assume the basic reproduction number follows a truncated gamma distribution that can be expressed as β i i k i α i σ i d i where β i i is the intraspecific transmission rate according to this equation populations of most species would not be invaded by the pathogens on their own while some species would experience severe epidemics in the absence of other species rudolf and antonovics 2005 given the generality of growth defense trade offs cappelli et al 2020 we assume smaller species receive higher values of r 0 i roche et al 2012 roche et al 2013 the interspecific transmission rate between different species is calculated as the pairwise average of intraspecific transmission rates of species i and j i e β i j c i j β i i β j j 2 where c i j is a scaling parameter that represents the strength of interspecific pathogen transmission relative to intraspecific transmission dobson 2004 2 2 the multi host sir model with higher order interactions to consider the higher order interactions in pathogen transmission process we constructed our model by modifying the susceptible infected recovered sir epidemiological model to account for multi host communities dobson 2004 d s i d t b i α i n i n i d i s i s i j 1 n β i j k 1 n γ i j k n k i j 1 d i i d t s i j 1 n β i j k 1 n γ i j k n k i j σ i v i d i i i d r i d t σ i i i d i r i where s i i i r i and n i s i i i r i represent the density of susceptible infected recovered and total individuals of host species i respectively compared with the general multi host sir model dobson 2004 the above model model 1 has an additional transmission component that contains a higher order interaction coefficient of γ i j k which is defined as the change in the transmission rate between two species i and j in the presence of an individual of the third species k because the higher order interaction term k 1 n γ i j k n k is parallel to per capita direct transmission rate β i j in the model γ i j k might be relatively smaller than β i j the presence of the neighboring species k can either intensify or alleviate the pairwise transmission between susceptible individuals of species i and infected individuals of species j therefore γ i j k could be either positive negative or zero i e no higher order interaction without loss of generality we assumed that γ i j k followed normal or uniform distribution in our simulations relevant literature suggests that species with higher abundance and smaller body size may have weaker per capita higher order interaction intensity on other species calonnec et al 2013 however the opposite may also occur because species with bigger body size and lower abundance may have less chance to interact with other species and thus exert lower per capita higher order interaction on other species here without loss of generality we sorted these values of γ i j k and assigned them to each species by assuming either positive negative or random rank ordering between the abundance of species k and the absolute value of γ i j k for each scenario simulated we considered three types of higher order interactions symmetric higher order interactions i e both positive and negative values of higher order interactions symmetrically distributed around zero negative or positive higher order interactions i e all the values of higher order interactions are negative or positive for example a distribution of u 0 00002 0 00008 defines the number of susceptible individuals transmitted by each infected individual will be increased by 0 002 to 0 008 in each transmission pair due to the influence of the higher order interaction mediated by an individual of a third species 2 3 constructing local host communities we simulated species loss by constructing local communities with species richness of odd numbers ranging from 3 to 49 for each species richness level we randomly selected species from the global species pool we modeled both density and frequency dependent pathogen transmission for each transmission mode we considered both additive and substitutive community assembly scenarios since the real system generally occur between the two extremes we further considered a partially substitutive community assembly method termed saturating method assembly mihaljevic et al 2014 the relationship between community abundance and species richness was a partially logistic curve the abundance of a community increased with number of species but the growth rate slowed with species richness and finally approached an asymptote the relationship can be simulated as a a 0 1 1 e 0 08 n 1 2 where a is the total abundance of the community a 0 is the value of the asymptote and n is the number of host species for each generated local community we calculated community level basic reproduction number r 0 as the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix to indicate disease risk dobson 2004 allen et al 2012 mihaljevic et al 2014 in the case where only direct transmission is considered the next generation matrix is diekmann et al 1990 dobson 2004 diekmann et al 2010 rudge et al 2013 g d β 11 p 11 α 1 σ 1 d 1 β n 1 p n 1 α 1 σ 1 d 1 β 1 n p 1 n α n σ n d n β n n p n n α n σ n d n where p is the abundance of infecting species at the disease free equilibrium i e k i for density dependent transmission and is equal to relative abundance of the infecting species i e k i j 1 n k j for frequency dependent transmission dobson 2004 allen et al 2012 mihaljevic et al 2014 when the propagation process is mediated by higher order interactions the next generation matrices g h will be g i j h g i j d p i j k 1 n γ i j k n k α j σ j d j for each parameter set we simulated 500 replications totally 24500 replications for the entire species richness gradient and reported the mean value and standard deviation of r 0 2 4 global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the model to assess how r 0 responds to variation of different input factors i e abundance species richness intra species transmission rate and higher order interactions we performed global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua of our model we used pawn method pianosi and wagener 2018 to define sensitivity index based on cumulative distribution functions which makes the numerical approximation of sensitivity indices easy and robust the pawn sensitivity index for the i th input factor is defined as s i stat x i max r 0 f r 0 r 0 f r 0 x i r 0 x i where f r 0 r 0 and f r 0 x i r 0 x i are the unconditional and conditional cumulative distribution functions of r 0 we used an open source matlab toolbox called safe sensitivity analysis for everybody https www safetoolbox info info and documentation pianosi et al 2015 to calculate the sensitivity indices 3 results we found that the dilution effect occurring or not remained similar for both normal and uniform distributions of the higher order interactions although the higher order interactions had the strongest effects on the dilution effect for a positive relationship between species abundance and γ i j k followed by random and then negative relationships the patterns were quantitively similar under three scenarios therefore we only report the results for the uniform distribution and negative relationship between species abundance and γ i j k unless specified otherwise under the additive community assembly and density dependent transmission community level r 0 monotonically increased with host species richness when there was no higher order interaction or with symmetric higher order interactions fig 1 a c introducing negative higher order interactions led to a non monotonic trend with a clear hump shape in the host species richness disease relationship while the amplification effect of host species richness on disease risk was largely enhanced for positive higher order interactions fig 1a c under additive community assembly and frequency dependent transmission host species richness reduced the disease risk with no higher order interactions or with negative or symmetric high order interactions figs 1d f however in the presence of positive higher order interactions the pattern of the host species richness disease relationship can be completely reversed forming an amplification effect fig 1d f the results were similar when the higher order interactions followed a normal distribution fig s1 under substitutive community assembly r 0 was much smaller when pathogen transmission was frequency dependent when compared to density dependent figs 2 and s2 r 0 also increased for positive higher order interactions and decreased for negative higher order interactions however a dilution effect always emerged regardless of the pathogen transmission methods i e density and frequency dependent transmission or the presence of the higher order interactions figs 2 and s2 in other words substitutive community assembly itself predominantly regulated the relationship between biodiversity and disease risk under saturating community assembly the effect of the higher order interactions on the dilution effect fell between those found under additive and substitutive community assembly under density dependent transmission host species richness had almost no effect on r 0 with symmetric or no higher order interactions whereas a dilution effect and an amplification effect emerged for negative and positive higher order interactions respectively fig 3 a c however unlike the additive community assembly the amplification effect gradually leveled off at high host species richness levels under saturating community assembly under frequency dependent transmission a dilution effect was always expected though r 0 was largely increased when there were positive higher order interactions fig 3d e to test the robustness of our results we considered the situation that 90 of the higher order interaction values were zero representing the condition that most of the neighboring species had no higher order effect on the pairwise transmission in this case under additive community assembly and density dependent transmission for the inherent amplification effect to occur a unimodal host species richness disease relationship still appeared when the intensity of the small fraction of the higher order interactions i e 10 was strong enough figs 4 a and s3a similarly under additive community assembly with frequency dependent transmission even a small fraction of non zero higher order interactions i e 10 could switch the inherent dilution effect to an amplification effect if it was strong enough figs 4b and s3b the global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis showed that intra specific transmission rate and higher order interaction were the two most influential and significant factors for r 0 figs 5 s5 and s6 the sensitivity of r 0 in response to higher order interaction was even larger than that of intra specific transmission rate in the case of density dependent transmission and additive community assembly method 4 discussion previous theoretical studies have made predictions on when host species richness buffers against disease prevalence rudolf and antonovics 2005 but the dilution effect from empirical studies has been proven to be complex and context dependent liu et al 2020 magnusson et al 2020 rohr et al 2020 vadell et al 2020 much remains to be explored about the factors that influence the dilution process halliday et al 2020 keesing and ostfeld 2021 in this study we extended the multi host sir model to assess the role of higher order interactions in explaining the variations in the dilution effect we found that negative higher order interactions i e higher order interactions that reduce pairwise pathogen diffusion disproportionately decreased disease risk at high species richness levels under additive community assembly negative higher order interactions can therefore enhance a dilution effect change an amplification effect into a nonlinear biodiversity disease relationship or even gradually flatten out the amplification effect compared with multi host ecosystems without higher order interactions in pathogen transmission in contrast positive higher order interactions i e higher order interactions that enhance pairwise transmission disproportionately increased disease risk at high species richness levels thus enlarging an amplification effect or diminishing a dilution effect the above conclusions hold true for higher order interactions with both uniform and normal distributions models involving only a small number of species or with models demonstrating different relationship between species abundance and the per capita higher order interactions i e γ i j k demonstrating the robustness of the results this happens because under additive community assembly although the abundance of the extant species remains unchanged the whole community size increases with species richness thereby the effect of the higher order interactions is reinforced due to the increase in the number of individuals that potentially influence this effect these results provide an alternative explanation for specific species richness disease patterns and advise caution in inferring with the dilution effect by only detecting methods of community assembly and pathogen transmission johnson et al 2019 additionally we showed that although higher order interactions affect community level r 0 it did not affect the emergence of the dilution effect under substitutive community assembly in this case when the total size of the host community remains unchanged as species richness varies the existence of higher order interactions in a community does not reverse or neutralize a dilution effect in other words there is no change in the number of individuals that can have higher order interactions during pathogen transmission as a result the variation in the per capita higher order interaction i e variation in γ i j k is not able to reverse the dilution pattern as expected the effect of the higher order interactions on the dilution effect under saturating community assembly fell between those found under additive and substitutive community assembly higher order interactions may reconcile the discrepancy between previous theoretical expectations and empirical observations on the debate of dilution and amplification effect for example for density dependent transmission of foliar fungal disease disease severity decreased as host species richness increased under additive host community assembly in a removal experiment in an alpine meadow the consequent results may have been due to the interception of spores by non hosts in speciose communities liu et al 2016 despite the linear dilution or amplification effects understanding the hump shaped i e nonlinear biodiversity disease relationships remain challenging wood et al 2014 johnson et al 2015 halliday and rohr 2019 a nonlinear biodiversity disease relationship may be expected in few scenarios first if there are trade offs between the hosts growth or reproduction and disease resistance a host community may tend to start with abundant fast growing and less resistant hosts and later be colonized by rarer diluting hosts leading to a unimodal host diversity disease relationship johnson et al 2013 halliday and rohr 2019 secondly the dilution effect of biodiversity may weaken with increase in spatial scale resulting in a hump shaped biodiversity disease pattern along multiple spatial scales halliday and rohr 2019 but see magnusson et al 2020 finally a unimodal pattern is also expected under an asymptotic saturation method that is set between the two extreme community assembly methods i e additive and substitutive methods mihaljevic et al 2014 here we propose an alternative mechanism that negative higher order interactions can produce a unimodal relationship between host species richness and disease risk under additive community assembly and density dependent transmission in this scenario the disproportionately stronger effect of the higher order interactions at higher diversity levels can effectively weaken the amplification effect and thus result in a nonlinear species richness disease relationship there is sufficient empirical evidence that pathogen transmission in a host community can be influenced by neighboring species calonnec et al 2013 costes et al 2013 hantsch et al 2014 neighboring host species can directly alter the rate of pathogen transmission by encounter reduction transmission interference susceptible host regulation and recovery augmentation keesing et al 2006 alternatively the presence of other host species can indirectly alter pathogen transmission among species by changing the biotic or abiotic conditions for example microclimatic conditions are fundamental for fungal pathogen development since growth of mycelia sexual and asexual reproduction and the spread of spores depend on critical temperature and air humidity tainter and baker 1996 makowski et al 2011 peñuelas et al 2012 liu et al 2018 therefore microclimatic changes caused by neighboring species differing in canopy sizes or crown architecture are considered to be a very important factor in forest communities calonnec et al 2013 costes et al 2013 hantsch et al 2014 resistance or susceptibility due to neighborhood effects can also be mediated by changes in sun exposure and soil conditions soil nutrient uptake by the target species may be affected by interactions with different neighboring species northfield et al 2010 and the resultant changes in the chemical composition of plant tissues may lead to increased or decreased resistance to infection bahnweg et al 2005 species functional traits that are captured by the host phylogeny may also have significant effects as is known in a wide range of situations from foliar fungal pathogens liu et al 2016 to h5n1 in wild birds huang et al 2019 this effect may be mediated through allelopathy or the three dimensional space filling capacity of plant communities and associated resistance zhu et al 2000 nevertheless how such higher order interactions relate to the functional or phylogenetic relatedness between interacting species in natural ecosystems remains unclear future investigations should focus on the explicit mechanisms and consequences of higher order interactions as such knowledge is needed for predicting the patterns of biodiversity disease
