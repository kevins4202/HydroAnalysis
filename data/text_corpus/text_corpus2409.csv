12045,ensuring access to improved sources of water and safe drinking water for all has been the nation s concern groundwater is one of the valuable sources of freshwater however groundwater resources especially in shallow aquifers are susceptible to contamination in this regard the quality of groundwater in the study watershed has deteriorated due to industrial effluents and domestic wastes of gondar city and extensive use of fertilizers for agriculture purpose once the groundwater gets polluted treatment is very difficult and expensive therefore the most effective and realistic solution is to protect groundwater from contamination assessing the level of groundwater vulnerability is crucial for effective groundwater management with this in mind the aim of this study is to assess the aquifer vulnerability of megech watershed to pollution using modified drastic model the modified drastic model uses eight attributes including depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone land use land cover and hydraulic conductivity of aquifer these layers were integrated using raster calculator tool in a gis environment fifteen groundwater composite samples were also collected and used to validate the model the results of vulnerability analysis reveal that more than 85 of the groundwater of the study watershed is under medium to high vulnerability to water pollution aquifers highly vulnerable to pollution 5 74 are mainly found in urban areas while majority of the aquifers 80 34 which are moderately vulnerable are dominantly found in the cultivated lands in the highly vulnerable part of the aquifer the concentration of nitrate 17 mg and total coliform 21 mg exceeded who permissible limit which agrees with the vulnerability map effective management of groundwater resources has now become a critical issue thus the study will be helpful for the proper management and protection of the available groundwater resources in the study watershed graphical abstract image 1 keywords modified drastic model groundwater pollution sustainable management megech watershed 1 introduction groundwater is a major source of water for human activities cassardo and jones 2011 salman et al 2019 a quarter of the world population relies on aquifers for their drinking water supply dochartaigh et al 2000 davie 2008 in developed countries such as england and usa groundwater covers 30 liu et al 2011 and 25 madler 2017 cheryl et al 2018 of their freshwater demand respectively sub saharan african countries depend highly on groundwater for domestic water supply and livestock rearing fdre ministry of water resources fdre mwr 2011 in ethiopia for instance more than 90 of water demand for industries and domestic use and about 80 of total national water supply are covered by water drawn from the aquifer fdre mwe 2013 seifu 2013 however recently with rapid population growth urban expansion and industrialization groundwater resources have been threatened and it has become a serious environmental problem bushra 2011 shirazi et al 2012 this is evidenced by studies conducted in usa epa 2016 china wu and sun 2016 india atiqur 2008 jaseela et al 2016 and ghana zimbabwe south africa and kenya yongxin and brent 2006 similar studies were also conducted in ethiopia kahssay et al 2005 yongxin and brent 2006 abate 2010 fdre mwe 2013 seifu 2013 abiy et al 2016 akale et al 2017 sahele et al 2018 and confirmed the presence of contamination and vulnerability of aquifers to pollution groundwater contamination causes a persistent impact on the adequate and safe water supply and health of the societies in turn it leads to permanent loss of agricultural productivity and industrial activities akhtar et al 2014 pawari and sagar 2015 moreover as the contaminated water discharged into the surface water it damages the aquatic ecosystem the impact of groundwater pollution is severe in developing countries and rural communities which rely on untreated groundwater tuinhof et al 2011 this imposes a burden on the government s attempt to meet the un 2030 sustainable development goals sdgs especially access to safe drinking water for all which is central to goal six fao 2015 un 2015 therefore proper and early groundwater resource management is vital to preserve the natural quality of this resource however comprehensive information about the actual status of groundwater vulnerability is not available because of the complex nature of groundwater insufficient data and lack of skilled manpower oke and fourie 2017 studies conducted in megech watershed and its environs singh 2005 mengesha et al 2013 damtie et al 2014 misganaw 2015 akale et al 2017 2018 showed that the area has experienced a high concentration of nitrate and microbes even though these studies presented the status of groundwater quality and level of pollutant concentration they did not show the spatial distribution and prioritise and delineate areas according to their vulnerability level for proper management and resource allocation in this regard intrinsic aquifer vulnerability model is vital in providing information about the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution within a short period and minimum cost over extensive areas shirazi et al 2012 jang et al 2017 drastic aquifer vulnerability model is the most commonly used and environmentally compatible vulnerability assessment model which considers the hydrological geological and topographic nature of the aquifer aller et al 1987 gogu and dassargues 2000 shirazi et al 2012 kumar et al 2018 the model was implemented in studies conducted in lake tana sub basin dire dawa and other parts of the country abiye 2008 tilahun and merkel 2010 abiy et al 2016 recently drastic model has been modified by integrating it with artificial neural network ann baghapour et al 2016 multi criteria analysis analytical hierarchical process mca ahp model jovanovic et al 2006 mogaji et al 2014 al abadi et al 2017 saida et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2019 the modified model also considers anthropogenic influence singh et al 2015 zafane et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 however most studies singh et al 2015 zafane et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 did not properly represented the human factor in their analysis like other parameters of the drastic model the influence of land use land cover lulc on groundwater contamination is also another parameter which gets lesser attention by most researchers studies saha and alam 2014 ebrahimi 2015 muhammad et al 2015 al abadi et al 2017 ramaraju and krishna 2017 for instance did not consider the impact of lulc on the aquifer vulnerability and its contribution to the groundwater contamination however the impact of lulc is indispensable in aquifer vulnerability study since a change in land use has potential impact on groundwater vulnerability to contamination dávila et al 2014 megech watershed has experienced significant lulc change it is also drained by different streams that cross agricultural and urban areas which collect contaminates from agricultural lands nearby industries landfills and urban swages on the other hand groundwater is the main source of fresh water supply in the study watershed including gondar city and other small towns such as dembia kola diba and tseda therefore assessing aquifer vulnerability to pollution at the watershed level is timely for sustainable groundwater management and priorities for intervention the present study is an attempt to assess the vulnerability of megech watershed aquifer to pollution with spatial variation using the modified drastic model 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area megech watershed is located in the northwestern highlands of ethiopia in amhara national regional state it is part of lake tana sub basin which extends from the southern fringes of northern central massif near semeine mountains national park to the northern shore of lake tana the study watershed is drained by megech and little angereb rivers geographically megech watershed is located between 12 16 to 12 45 north latitude and 37 22 to 37 38 east longitude fig 1 megech watershed consists gondar city and part of gondar zuria dembia wegera and lay armhacho woredas districts its elevation ranges from 1785 to 2978 m above sea level and has a total area of 664 74 square km the watershed has experienced mean annual maximum and minimum temperature ranging from 26 to 28 8 c and 9 9 14 2 c respectively rainfall of the watershed and its surrounding region is characterized by a unimodal pattern that falls in the summer kiremt season which extends from june to september the mean annual rainfall of the watershed ranges from 973 9 to 1100 mm the geological structure of the watershed is dominantly formed by two major geological structures the termaber and aiba basalts fig 2 the termaber basalt covers majority of the watershed the lowland along the periphery of the lake tana is covered by thick quaternary alluvial and lacustrine deposits and colluvium workineh et al 2011 based on the lithology and structural formation the watershed has three major aquifer systems the tertiary volcanics mostly including the aiba and termaber basalts the quaternary basalt aquifer and the quaternary alluvial and colluvium deposits smec 2007 workineh et al 2011 soil is the result of geological and geomorphic processes that describe the hydrogeological nature of an area according to fao 2006 soil classification luvisols fluvisols leptosols vertisols cambisols xerosols regosols and nitisols are major soil groups in the study watershed 2 2 data type and sources in order to assess vulnerability of the aquifer in megech watershed eight datasets from different sources as described in table 1 were used global positioning system gps ph meter and total dissolved substance tds meter were used to collect water samples while erdas 1 1 earth resources data analysis system software used to process and analyze satellite images imagine 2015 and arcgis 10 5 1 were used to process the collected data the spatial resolution of data used in this study varies from 10 m sentinel satellite imageries to 30 m dem however nearest neighbor resampling technique canty 2009 was employed to bring all the data layers involved in the analysis into the cell size of 30 m by 30 m hence the spatial resolution of each parameter in the analysis and the final aquifer vulnerability map of the watershed was 30 m by 30 m information associated with depth to water table d was obtained from borehole data a total of 27 wells and springs which are distributed in and near the study watershed were utilized for identifying specific depths of the water table the site of wells and springs were identified via geological triangulation method macdonald et al 2002 based on their spatial coordinates and depth attributes a point shapefile was created subsequently using inverse distance weight idw interpolation technique paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 the spatial distribution of depth to the water table was generated the depth to the water table varies from 3 15 to 105 m net recharge media r was also computed from 30 years 1988 2018 mean annual rainfall of five meteorological stations by using equation 3 and ordinary kriging interpolation method kalkhan 2011 was employed to generate the spatial distribution of r media 2 3 data analysis and model description 2 3 1 modified drastic model drastic model was developed under the united states environmental protection agency us epa in association with the national water well association aller et al 1987 it was developed based on the concept of all major geological and hydrological factors that affect and control in and out movement of groundwater merchant 1994 shirazi et al 2012 zafane et al 2017 it was used to evaluate an area more than 40 5 ha as per aller et al 1987 drastic model takes into account seven physical parameters from the geological and hydrological environment that controls and determines the groundwater pollution potential however change in lulc from natural vegetation into agricultural activity industrial activity and settlement generates waste and pollutant chemicals that contaminate poorly maintained springs and boreholes eldrandaly et al 2005 dávila et al 2014 therefore in order to relate the impacts of human activities to the aquifer vulnerability analysis lulc was incorporated as one parameter drastic model was modified so as to consider lulc change and expressed as modified drastic model di dávila et al 2014 singh et al 2015 ahmed et al 2018 hosseini and saremi 2018 and described mathematically as 1 di i 1 8 w i r i where di modified drastic model w weight of parameter i th r rate of parameter i th i parameter 2 4 weight and rate of modified drastic model parameters the relative weights and ratings assigned to parameters based on their phylogenetic relations to the contaminants accordingly the relative weight assigned ranges from 1 to 5 aller et al 1987 saha and alam 2014 baghapour et al 2016 majolagbe et al 2016 hosseini and saremi 2018 kumar et al 2018 this shows the relative importance and susceptibility of a parameter to contaminants the most significant and more susceptible parameter is weighted to 5 whereas the least significant and less susceptible parameter is weighted to 5 table 2 based on the level of susceptibility each parameter also classified into sub classes range and assigned value of rate which ranges between 1 least important and 10 most important aller et al 1987 baghapour et al 2016 ramaraju and krishna 2017 ahmed et al 2018 this indicates the relative importance and susceptibility of the sub classes of each parameter to contaminants atiqur 2008 zafane et al 2017 2 5 vulnerability index and vulnerability class after a thematic layer for each parameter was prepared equation 1 was used for the analysis and the result of the model was categorized into different vulnerability levels based on the vulnerability index table 3 2 6 model validation and sensitivity analysis groundwater vulnerability map is the result of eight hydrological geological and anthropogenic related parameters conducting sensitivity analysis is imperative to identify the most effective vulnerability parameters so as to plan for sustainable aquifer crisis management moslem and ashournia 2017 thapa et al 2018 moreover it avoids subjectivity and identifies important and influential parameters from the model shirazi et al 2012 baghapour et al 2016 djémin et al 2016 it also measures the robustness associated with the model output with manipulated input variables and the influence of individual input parameters on the model s output by estimating the change in output map with each change in input parameters in this study single parameter sensitivity analysis method was used to identify relevant parameters in assessing the intrinsic vulnerability of megech watershed aquifer it was developed by napolitano and fabbri 1996 to detect sensitive parameters from the analytical model this method was applied in different studies hamby 1994 djémin et al 2016 modabberi et al 2017 zafane et al 2017 oroji 2018 thapa et al 2018 wu et al 2018 hasan et al 2019 tomer et al 2019 thus the impact and effective weight of each parameter was determined by using equation 2 2 w p r p w v 100 where w the actual weight of the parameter pr the rating of the parameter p pw the weight of the parameter p v intrinsic vulnerability index subjecting aquifer vulnerability maps to validation assessment is vital for producing reliable and valid aquifer vulnerability maps mogaji et al 2014 majolagbe et al 2016 even though there are a number of physicochemical and biological parameters that indicate water quality the concentration of nitrate no3 and microbes are the most common groundwater contaminants which deteriorate water quality and cause health problems tadesse 2014 water aid 2016 these contaminants are commonly generated by human activities agricultural intensification sewage discharge septic tank landfill and industrial and municipal and therefore used for validating aquifer vulnerability maps abdelmadjid and omar 2013 dávila et al 2014 mogaji et al 2014 boufekane and saighi 2018 different studies tilahun and merkel 2010 alwathaf and mansouri 2011 shirazi et al 2012 allah et al 2017 jang et al 2017 moslem and ashournia 2017 hosseini and saremi 2018 thapa et al 2018 chamanehpour et al 2020 have employed these parameters for validating the groundwater vulnerability maps in groundwater the physiochemical substances vary very slowly over time thus a single sample per year is adequate for groundwater quality analysis who 2008 therefore as this study focuses on groundwater a one time sample was taken from water wells and springs the samples were collected purposely from the highly vulnerable and moderately vulnerable part of the watershed in the study watershed a total of 31 water wells and springs were identified and of which 9 of them were located in the highly vulnerable and 22 were in the moderately vulnerable part of the watershed since the water sources were located in a similar vulnerability level composite sampling technique heald 2009 were used to collect water samples therefore six water samples from highly vulnerable and nine water samples from moderately vulnerable totally fifteen composite samples from 31 water wells and springs were collected the water samples were taken from the identified wells and springs after 6 10 min of pumping fetched up and collected in a clean plastic bottle and kept in the cold box and were transported to angereb dam water laboratory and debre tabor university chemistry laboratory within 48 h the samples were analyzed for nitrate no3 tds total dissolved substance and total coliform tcf in the laboratory and the ph was determined using portable ph meter in in situ on the site because its status change as it was transported finally the result was compared with the drinking water quality standard described in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 result 3 1 1 depth to water table d depth to water table determines the depth through which a contaminant travels before reaching the aquifer and it determines the contact time with the surrounding media aller et al 1987 jang et al 2017 thus a greater chance for attenuation occurs as the depth to water table increases because the deeper water table implies longer travel times and less vulnerable to contamination khemiri et al 2013 the depth to water table was generated from 27 wells and springs distributed in the watershed with a maximum depth of 105 m and a minimum depth of 3 15 m since the depth to water table changes depending on the time season of the year in response to recharge and discharge vongphachanh et al 2017 arya et al 2018 the measurement was taken at dry or pre rainy season of the year the depth to water table was classified into ranges defined by the drastic model and assigned rates ranging from 1 minimum impact on vulnerability to 10 maximum impact on the vulnerability as shown in table 2 and fig 3 a 3 1 2 net recharge n net recharge is the amount of surface water that infiltrated into the ground and reaches the groundwater chitsazan and akhtari 2009 it indicates the amount of water from precipitation that is available for vertical transport dispersion and dilution of pollutants from a specific point of application aller et al 1987 recharged water serves as a medium for transporting contaminants within vadose zone to the aquifer the higher the recharge the more vulnerable is the groundwater hasan et al 2019 data for the net recharge was not available thus it was derived from mean annual rainfall where 30 years 1988 2018 of five meteorological stations were considered net recharge of each station was computed based on the model of chaturvedi equation chaturvedi 1973 3 r 6 75 p 14 0 5 where r net recharge and p mean rainfall mm year the model was developed for tropical regions based on water level fluctuations and rainfall depth it was implemented in several studies adelana et al 2006 misstear et al 2009 aliran et al 2013 mogaji et al 2014 the result showed that the net recharge value of the watershed ranges from a minimum of 236 55 mm year to a maximum of 308 126 mm year fig 3b shows the rate of net recharge of megech watershed 3 1 3 aquifer media a aquifer media refers to a rock in the ground that serves as water storage ersoy and gültekin 2013 it indicates materials property which controls pollutant attenuation processes based on the permeability of each layer jang et al 2017 the attenuation characteristic of the aquifer material is reflected by the mobility of the contaminants through aquifer media megech watershed is dominated by tarmaber and aiba basalt deposit and alluvial and colluvial sediment deposit workineh et al 2011 thus its aquifer is an unconfined fractured aquifer and hydrologically very good source of groundwater paul et al 2012 seifu 2013 asrie and sebhat 2016 landtschoote 2017 as shown in table 2 and fig 3c the watershed aquifer media is grouped into two categories and rated according to the attenuation nature of the layers 3 1 4 soil media s in the modified drastic model the soil media represents the capabilities of soil to infiltrate water and contaminants vertically down to the unsaturated zone it transports the contaminant and water from the soil surface to the aquifer this is based on the permeable character of the soil which inherited from the parent material and materials constitute al abadi et al 2017 soils with clay and silt particles increase the travel time of pollutants nitosols liptosols regosols xerosols fluvisols vertisols and cambisols are major soils of the watershed based on the permeability the soils of the study watershed were rated as shown in table 2 and fig 4 a 3 1 5 topography media t topography refers to the slope of an area it controls the likelihood of a pollutant to be transported by runoff or to remain on the ground where it may infiltrate into the surface aller et al 1987 voudouris et al 2010 souleymane and zhonghua 2017 the gentler the slope slope of 0 2 the higher retaining capacity of water and or pollutants while the steeper the slope slope of 18 have lower retention capacity of water and or pollutants souleymane and zhonghua 2017 as shown in fig 4b and table 2 the slope of the study watershed was rated from 0 slope of 18 to 10 0 2 3 1 6 impact of vadose zone media i vadose zone is the unsaturated zone materials lying below the soil horizon and above the water table it determines the attenuation characteristics of contaminants aller et al 1987 atiqur 2008 the movement of the contaminants to the saturated zone is controlled by this parameter according to aller et al 1987 and maria 2018 if clay content of the vadose zone is higher the pollution potential is lower while with an increase of silt and sand concentration the pollution potential of the vadose zone increases based on this notion impact of vadose zone of megech watershed was derived from the distribution of soil textures accordingly the watershed is dominantly covered by clay loam 358 18 sq km and clay 255 32 sq km soils the remaining part of the watershed is covered by sand clay loam and loam soils based on the soil texture characteristics the impact of vadose zone was rated from 1 to 5 classes as shown in table 2 and fig 4c 3 1 7 hydraulic conductivity c hydraulic conductivity is described as the ability of aquifer materials to transmit water in turn controls the rate of groundwater and contaminant material flow under a given hydraulic gradient khemiri et al 2013 it depends on the amount and interconnection of void spaces within the aquifer it controls the contaminant migration and dispersion from the injection point within the saturated zone hydraulic property of the watershed was determined based on the average soil texture properties rawls et al 1982 smedema and rycroft 1983 oosterbaan and nijland 1994 davie 2008 healy and scanlon 2010 dávila et al 2014 zekaiz 2015 malik and shukla 2019 clay and clay loam soils consist more fine soil particles that are characterized by low porosity and less permeable thus the watershed has low hydraulic conductivity tables 2 and 5 and low pollution potential on the other hand sand and loam soil texture classes have less clay particle content implying more permeable and relatively higher vulnerability potential to pollution fig 5 a 3 1 8 land use land cover lu lulc of megech watershed was prepared from sentinel 2 satellite image based on anderson land use classification system andorson et al 1983 the watershed was classified into five major lulc classes namely water body built up area settlement cultivated land grazing land and forest and plantation tree table 6 and fig 5b lulc has a strong impact on the surface and groundwater quality al rawabdeh et al 2014 singh et al 2015 baghapour et al 2016 ouedraogo et al 2016 this shows the impact of human activities to aquifer vulnerability 3 1 9 aquifer vulnerability map all thematic layers of the parameters were rated according to their relative importance and their susceptibility to contaminants these layers were multiplied by their weight table 2 which were assigned according to their significance and contribution to contamination aller et al 1987 baghapour et al 2016 the analysis of intrinsic aquifer vulnerability was computed by summing the product of each parameter using equation 1 according to the result shown in fig 6 a the total vulnerability index value of the study watershed ranges from 102 to 202 the higher the value of the drastic index the greater is the aquifer vulnerability for pollution witkowsk et al 2007 dávila et al 2014 djémin et al 2016 abiy and melesse 2017 thus the aquifer of the study watershed is vulnerable to contaminants table 3 as shown in table 7 and fig 6b the values of the modified drastic aquifer vulnerability index were classified into three classes such as low moderate and highly vulnerable zones out of the total area of the study watershed about 9256 41ha 13 92 is in the low vulnerable zone with a drastic index ranging between 102 and 145 moderate vulnerable zone with a drastic index ranging between 146 and 190 and highly vulnerable zone with drastic index ranging between 191 and 202 cover about 53 404 83ha 80 34 and about 3813 22ha 5 74 respectively the aquifers at a high vulnerability level are mainly found in built up areas settlement of gondar city and gondar zuria woreda district where industrial effluents from factories and domestic wastes significantly polluting the groundwater moderately vulnerable areas 80 34 are dominantly found in cultivated lands of the southern part dembia and gondar zuria woredas of the watershed for the assessment of the impact of individual parameters towards an aquifer vulnerability a single parameter sensitivity analysis was performed the single parameter sensitivity analysis compares the effective and theoretical weights thereby evaluates the degree of the influence of an individual parameter for the vulnerability of groundwater in megech watershed effective weights of net recharge 26 20 and land use land cover 18 24 were higher than their theoretical weights 14 29 and 17 86 respectively table 8 this implies that net recharge and land use land cover are the most influential parameters in the aquifer vulnerability analysis followed by aquifer media a and groundwater depth d with an effective weight of 17 91 and 17 18 respectively table 8 groundwater physicochemical and biological properties of the study watershed were examined through 15 composite samples taken from 31 wells and springs the result of physicochemical and biological properties is presented in table 9 as shown in table 9 the average ph value ranges between 6 2 and 8 3 with an average value of 7 8 this indicates that the ph value in the study watershed is within who and fao permissible level for drinking table 4 the geographical distribution of tds no3 and total coliforms were compared with vulnerability maps attempts have been made to validate the drastic model using the tds no3 and total coliforms concentration in groundwater the tds values for the water samples taken from highly and moderately vulnerable areas ranged from 145 mg l to 472 mg l which was below the concertation level expected in potable water table 9 however the concentration of tds was higher in the moderately vulnerable part of the aquifer the average concentration of nitrate no3 was 21 mg l in cultivated land of the highly vulnerable part of the aquifer and 11 mg l in an urban area of moderately vulnerable part of the watershed table 9 similarly 21 100 ml total coliforms were found from samples taken from highly vulnerable and 4 100 ml in samples taken from moderately vulnerable parts of the watershed the highest level of nitrate concentration and the total number of coliforms coincide with the results of the modified drastic vulnerable index which demonstrates the deterioration of groundwater quality of the watershed and validates the use of the drastic model in the study watershed with the given data set in line with this result gondar city water and sanitation service office report showed that 60 100 ml and 9 100 ml total bacteria and 3 100 ml fecal coliform was found in the water water before distribution from angereb dam and 6 100 ml up to 9 100 ml fecal coliform from boreholes the report confirmed that groundwater of gondar city highly vulnerable urban area is at risk of pollution 3 2 discussion in the present study the modified drastic model was used to assess the degree of vulnerability to pollution of groundwater in the megech watershed drastic vulnerability index values range were arranged into different classes low 102 145 moderate 146 190 and high 191 202 the areas under the high vulnerability level 5 74 are mainly in built up settlement areas where gondar city and gondar zuria woreda district were identified as a maximum protection area that requires extreme protection the majority of the study watershed is characterized by moderate vulnerability level which is mainly associated with cultivated land that demands high protection witkowsk et al 2007 the result of the present study is in harmony with the result of singh et al 2015 who conducted a study in lucknow city india using a modified drastic model drastica where anthropogenic influence exhibited a significant contribution for groundwater pollution likewise a groundwater vulnerability assessment conducted in algeria khemis miliana plain using drastic lu model showed the influence of human activities on groundwater pollution zafane et al 2017 similar studies by al rawabdeh et al 2014 dávila et al 2014 and gómez et al 2017 also confirmed the strong influence of human activities on the groundwater quality manifested via lulc change in the vulnerability analysis a groundwater vulnerability evaluation was conducted in india kerala region near solid waste disposal site using drastic model and was reported the drastic index values ranged between 120 and 243 where the eastern and southeastern part of the dumping site was highly vulnerable to contaminants due to the lower slope of the terrains which allows percolation of contaminants into the groundwater jaseela et al 2016 another study conducted in southern côte d ivoire djémin et al 2016 reported a vulnerability index values ranging from 95 to 187 where about 63 93 of the areas are under very high to highly vulnerable zone which is mainly in the central part of the region similarly moslem and ashournia 2017 reported that a large extent 48 64 of guilan aquifer in iran is highly vulnerable to pollution analogous to the results of the present study ebadati et al 2012 al abadi et al 2017 souleymane and zhonghua 2017 hasan et al 2019 reported a groundwater map with three vulnerability classes ranging from very high to low vulnerable to pollution the vulnerability class ranging from moderately to the very highly vulnerable part of the region categorized as an extreme protection region voudouris et al 2010 and wu et al 2018 reported that the shallower part the aquifer and beihai city fall within high and very high vulnerability zones in which intensive rain and slope of the terrain were influencing factors in the vulnerability analysis bhuvaneswaran and ganesh 2019 also reported that shallow groundwater level permeability of vadose zone and high rate of net recharge resulted in high vulnerability of groundwater in uppar odai sub watershed of india in the megech watershed high vulnerability is associated with the built up settlement area contrary to this finding a research conducted in lahore pakistan by muhammad et al 2015 reported that low vulnerability is associated with the dense human settlements and low water level areas while high vulnerability which covers 28 8 of the region associated with agricultural areas previous studies conducted in megech watershed mengesha et al 2013 damtie et al 2014 getahun et al 2014 misganaw 2015 feleke et al 2018 using laboratory method confirmed that groundwater wells and springs and surface water rivers reservoirs and tap water of gondar city have experienced high risk of pollution this is because the city has suffered from discharges from human activities industrial effluent landfill sewages which contributes to the pollution and contamination of the groundwater this report coincides with the result of the modified drastic model where built up urban areas are delineated as a highly vulnerable part of the study watershed similarly a study conducted in guna tana watershed using water quality experiment techniques revealed that agricultural activity is the major contributor to the higher concentration of nitrate in the groundwater akale et al 2017 2018 this is in line with the notion that excessive agricultural activities generate pollutants for contaminating groundwater paul et al 2012 zafane et al 2017 gómez et al 2017 merchant 1994 also indicated that human activity which discharges contaminants to the surface and infiltrates down to the aquifer has a significant contribution to groundwater pollution in this regard hosseini and saremi 2018 baghapour et al 2016 and nazzal et al 2019 were incorporated lulc as a parameter and found that the modified drastic model performed better in delineating groundwater vulnerability to pollution dávila et al 2014 also compared the conventional drastic model with the modified drastic model and came up with a better result for the modified drastic model according to the result from single parameter sensitivity analysis net recharge n and land use land cover lu were identified as parameters which have a significant influence on megech watershed aquifer vulnerability analysis similarly other parameters such as geology soil and land use abiy et al 2016 depth to water table moslem and ashournia 2017 vadose zone and depth to water table djémin et al 2016 mfonka et al 2018 tomer et al 2019 aquifer media and vadose zone thapa et al 2018 depth to water table oroji 2018 rainfall recharge aquifer media soil type and topography wu et al 2018 were identified as significant parameters in groundwater vulnerability analysis this implies that accurate and detailed information about these significant parameters needs to be obtained for aquifer vulnerability analysis all these revealed that the results of the modified drastic model are viable and representative of the groundwater vulnerability of the study watershed likewise shirazi et al 2012 anornu and kabo bah 2013 djémin et al 2016 jang et al 2017 were found the model appropriate for groundwater vulnerability assessment and it serves as a tool for monitoring human activities for the sustainable conservation of groundwater quality 4 conclusions groundwater is a promising source of freshwater however point and non point sources of pollutants generated from human activities degrade the quality of groundwater which bring socio economic and health problem this water quality issue became one of the 17 sustainable development goals of the un this is to be achieved by 2030 where reducing pollution and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals is a prior task to realize universal and equitable access to safe water proper planning and directing efforts for groundwater management requires delineating vulnerable areas and identifying the source of contaminants therefore this study implemented a modified drastic model to delineate and identify the spatial extent of megech watershed aquifer vulnerability to pollution apart from the conventional drastic model the modified drastic model incorporated lulc as a parameter to consider the impact of human activity on the groundwater pollution the result of the study showed that megech watershed aquifer vulnerability ranges from a lower vulnerable level 102 145 to a highly vulnerable level 191 202 moderately vulnerable covers 81 24 53 404 83 ha and highly vulnerable covers 5 74 3813 22 ha of the total watershed aquifer the central part of the watershed which covered by built up settlement areas is highly vulnerable for pollution the majority of the watershed which is dominated by cultivated land is moderately vulnerable to pollution the sensitivity analysis of the model revealed that net recharge r and lulc lu were the highest contributors for groundwater contamination in the study watershed therefore planners and local administrates should give priority for the highly vulnerable part gondar city of the watershed to manage the groundwater so as to meet the millennium development goal information on the current status of contamination of groundwater might be used as an early warning for the responsible authorities to take judicious measures to prevent further stress on this invaluable resource in this study the combined use of drastic model and geographical information system gis demonstrated as an effective method for groundwater vulnerability assessment furthermore this study suggests similar studies to be conducted in different agro climatic and management conditions declaration of competing interest the authors

12045,ensuring access to improved sources of water and safe drinking water for all has been the nation s concern groundwater is one of the valuable sources of freshwater however groundwater resources especially in shallow aquifers are susceptible to contamination in this regard the quality of groundwater in the study watershed has deteriorated due to industrial effluents and domestic wastes of gondar city and extensive use of fertilizers for agriculture purpose once the groundwater gets polluted treatment is very difficult and expensive therefore the most effective and realistic solution is to protect groundwater from contamination assessing the level of groundwater vulnerability is crucial for effective groundwater management with this in mind the aim of this study is to assess the aquifer vulnerability of megech watershed to pollution using modified drastic model the modified drastic model uses eight attributes including depth to water table net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone land use land cover and hydraulic conductivity of aquifer these layers were integrated using raster calculator tool in a gis environment fifteen groundwater composite samples were also collected and used to validate the model the results of vulnerability analysis reveal that more than 85 of the groundwater of the study watershed is under medium to high vulnerability to water pollution aquifers highly vulnerable to pollution 5 74 are mainly found in urban areas while majority of the aquifers 80 34 which are moderately vulnerable are dominantly found in the cultivated lands in the highly vulnerable part of the aquifer the concentration of nitrate 17 mg and total coliform 21 mg exceeded who permissible limit which agrees with the vulnerability map effective management of groundwater resources has now become a critical issue thus the study will be helpful for the proper management and protection of the available groundwater resources in the study watershed graphical abstract image 1 keywords modified drastic model groundwater pollution sustainable management megech watershed 1 introduction groundwater is a major source of water for human activities cassardo and jones 2011 salman et al 2019 a quarter of the world population relies on aquifers for their drinking water supply dochartaigh et al 2000 davie 2008 in developed countries such as england and usa groundwater covers 30 liu et al 2011 and 25 madler 2017 cheryl et al 2018 of their freshwater demand respectively sub saharan african countries depend highly on groundwater for domestic water supply and livestock rearing fdre ministry of water resources fdre mwr 2011 in ethiopia for instance more than 90 of water demand for industries and domestic use and about 80 of total national water supply are covered by water drawn from the aquifer fdre mwe 2013 seifu 2013 however recently with rapid population growth urban expansion and industrialization groundwater resources have been threatened and it has become a serious environmental problem bushra 2011 shirazi et al 2012 this is evidenced by studies conducted in usa epa 2016 china wu and sun 2016 india atiqur 2008 jaseela et al 2016 and ghana zimbabwe south africa and kenya yongxin and brent 2006 similar studies were also conducted in ethiopia kahssay et al 2005 yongxin and brent 2006 abate 2010 fdre mwe 2013 seifu 2013 abiy et al 2016 akale et al 2017 sahele et al 2018 and confirmed the presence of contamination and vulnerability of aquifers to pollution groundwater contamination causes a persistent impact on the adequate and safe water supply and health of the societies in turn it leads to permanent loss of agricultural productivity and industrial activities akhtar et al 2014 pawari and sagar 2015 moreover as the contaminated water discharged into the surface water it damages the aquatic ecosystem the impact of groundwater pollution is severe in developing countries and rural communities which rely on untreated groundwater tuinhof et al 2011 this imposes a burden on the government s attempt to meet the un 2030 sustainable development goals sdgs especially access to safe drinking water for all which is central to goal six fao 2015 un 2015 therefore proper and early groundwater resource management is vital to preserve the natural quality of this resource however comprehensive information about the actual status of groundwater vulnerability is not available because of the complex nature of groundwater insufficient data and lack of skilled manpower oke and fourie 2017 studies conducted in megech watershed and its environs singh 2005 mengesha et al 2013 damtie et al 2014 misganaw 2015 akale et al 2017 2018 showed that the area has experienced a high concentration of nitrate and microbes even though these studies presented the status of groundwater quality and level of pollutant concentration they did not show the spatial distribution and prioritise and delineate areas according to their vulnerability level for proper management and resource allocation in this regard intrinsic aquifer vulnerability model is vital in providing information about the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution within a short period and minimum cost over extensive areas shirazi et al 2012 jang et al 2017 drastic aquifer vulnerability model is the most commonly used and environmentally compatible vulnerability assessment model which considers the hydrological geological and topographic nature of the aquifer aller et al 1987 gogu and dassargues 2000 shirazi et al 2012 kumar et al 2018 the model was implemented in studies conducted in lake tana sub basin dire dawa and other parts of the country abiye 2008 tilahun and merkel 2010 abiy et al 2016 recently drastic model has been modified by integrating it with artificial neural network ann baghapour et al 2016 multi criteria analysis analytical hierarchical process mca ahp model jovanovic et al 2006 mogaji et al 2014 al abadi et al 2017 saida et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2019 the modified model also considers anthropogenic influence singh et al 2015 zafane et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 however most studies singh et al 2015 zafane et al 2017 ahmed et al 2018 did not properly represented the human factor in their analysis like other parameters of the drastic model the influence of land use land cover lulc on groundwater contamination is also another parameter which gets lesser attention by most researchers studies saha and alam 2014 ebrahimi 2015 muhammad et al 2015 al abadi et al 2017 ramaraju and krishna 2017 for instance did not consider the impact of lulc on the aquifer vulnerability and its contribution to the groundwater contamination however the impact of lulc is indispensable in aquifer vulnerability study since a change in land use has potential impact on groundwater vulnerability to contamination dávila et al 2014 megech watershed has experienced significant lulc change it is also drained by different streams that cross agricultural and urban areas which collect contaminates from agricultural lands nearby industries landfills and urban swages on the other hand groundwater is the main source of fresh water supply in the study watershed including gondar city and other small towns such as dembia kola diba and tseda therefore assessing aquifer vulnerability to pollution at the watershed level is timely for sustainable groundwater management and priorities for intervention the present study is an attempt to assess the vulnerability of megech watershed aquifer to pollution with spatial variation using the modified drastic model 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area megech watershed is located in the northwestern highlands of ethiopia in amhara national regional state it is part of lake tana sub basin which extends from the southern fringes of northern central massif near semeine mountains national park to the northern shore of lake tana the study watershed is drained by megech and little angereb rivers geographically megech watershed is located between 12 16 to 12 45 north latitude and 37 22 to 37 38 east longitude fig 1 megech watershed consists gondar city and part of gondar zuria dembia wegera and lay armhacho woredas districts its elevation ranges from 1785 to 2978 m above sea level and has a total area of 664 74 square km the watershed has experienced mean annual maximum and minimum temperature ranging from 26 to 28 8 c and 9 9 14 2 c respectively rainfall of the watershed and its surrounding region is characterized by a unimodal pattern that falls in the summer kiremt season which extends from june to september the mean annual rainfall of the watershed ranges from 973 9 to 1100 mm the geological structure of the watershed is dominantly formed by two major geological structures the termaber and aiba basalts fig 2 the termaber basalt covers majority of the watershed the lowland along the periphery of the lake tana is covered by thick quaternary alluvial and lacustrine deposits and colluvium workineh et al 2011 based on the lithology and structural formation the watershed has three major aquifer systems the tertiary volcanics mostly including the aiba and termaber basalts the quaternary basalt aquifer and the quaternary alluvial and colluvium deposits smec 2007 workineh et al 2011 soil is the result of geological and geomorphic processes that describe the hydrogeological nature of an area according to fao 2006 soil classification luvisols fluvisols leptosols vertisols cambisols xerosols regosols and nitisols are major soil groups in the study watershed 2 2 data type and sources in order to assess vulnerability of the aquifer in megech watershed eight datasets from different sources as described in table 1 were used global positioning system gps ph meter and total dissolved substance tds meter were used to collect water samples while erdas 1 1 earth resources data analysis system software used to process and analyze satellite images imagine 2015 and arcgis 10 5 1 were used to process the collected data the spatial resolution of data used in this study varies from 10 m sentinel satellite imageries to 30 m dem however nearest neighbor resampling technique canty 2009 was employed to bring all the data layers involved in the analysis into the cell size of 30 m by 30 m hence the spatial resolution of each parameter in the analysis and the final aquifer vulnerability map of the watershed was 30 m by 30 m information associated with depth to water table d was obtained from borehole data a total of 27 wells and springs which are distributed in and near the study watershed were utilized for identifying specific depths of the water table the site of wells and springs were identified via geological triangulation method macdonald et al 2002 based on their spatial coordinates and depth attributes a point shapefile was created subsequently using inverse distance weight idw interpolation technique paramasivam and venkatramanan 2019 the spatial distribution of depth to the water table was generated the depth to the water table varies from 3 15 to 105 m net recharge media r was also computed from 30 years 1988 2018 mean annual rainfall of five meteorological stations by using equation 3 and ordinary kriging interpolation method kalkhan 2011 was employed to generate the spatial distribution of r media 2 3 data analysis and model description 2 3 1 modified drastic model drastic model was developed under the united states environmental protection agency us epa in association with the national water well association aller et al 1987 it was developed based on the concept of all major geological and hydrological factors that affect and control in and out movement of groundwater merchant 1994 shirazi et al 2012 zafane et al 2017 it was used to evaluate an area more than 40 5 ha as per aller et al 1987 drastic model takes into account seven physical parameters from the geological and hydrological environment that controls and determines the groundwater pollution potential however change in lulc from natural vegetation into agricultural activity industrial activity and settlement generates waste and pollutant chemicals that contaminate poorly maintained springs and boreholes eldrandaly et al 2005 dávila et al 2014 therefore in order to relate the impacts of human activities to the aquifer vulnerability analysis lulc was incorporated as one parameter drastic model was modified so as to consider lulc change and expressed as modified drastic model di dávila et al 2014 singh et al 2015 ahmed et al 2018 hosseini and saremi 2018 and described mathematically as 1 di i 1 8 w i r i where di modified drastic model w weight of parameter i th r rate of parameter i th i parameter 2 4 weight and rate of modified drastic model parameters the relative weights and ratings assigned to parameters based on their phylogenetic relations to the contaminants accordingly the relative weight assigned ranges from 1 to 5 aller et al 1987 saha and alam 2014 baghapour et al 2016 majolagbe et al 2016 hosseini and saremi 2018 kumar et al 2018 this shows the relative importance and susceptibility of a parameter to contaminants the most significant and more susceptible parameter is weighted to 5 whereas the least significant and less susceptible parameter is weighted to 5 table 2 based on the level of susceptibility each parameter also classified into sub classes range and assigned value of rate which ranges between 1 least important and 10 most important aller et al 1987 baghapour et al 2016 ramaraju and krishna 2017 ahmed et al 2018 this indicates the relative importance and susceptibility of the sub classes of each parameter to contaminants atiqur 2008 zafane et al 2017 2 5 vulnerability index and vulnerability class after a thematic layer for each parameter was prepared equation 1 was used for the analysis and the result of the model was categorized into different vulnerability levels based on the vulnerability index table 3 2 6 model validation and sensitivity analysis groundwater vulnerability map is the result of eight hydrological geological and anthropogenic related parameters conducting sensitivity analysis is imperative to identify the most effective vulnerability parameters so as to plan for sustainable aquifer crisis management moslem and ashournia 2017 thapa et al 2018 moreover it avoids subjectivity and identifies important and influential parameters from the model shirazi et al 2012 baghapour et al 2016 djémin et al 2016 it also measures the robustness associated with the model output with manipulated input variables and the influence of individual input parameters on the model s output by estimating the change in output map with each change in input parameters in this study single parameter sensitivity analysis method was used to identify relevant parameters in assessing the intrinsic vulnerability of megech watershed aquifer it was developed by napolitano and fabbri 1996 to detect sensitive parameters from the analytical model this method was applied in different studies hamby 1994 djémin et al 2016 modabberi et al 2017 zafane et al 2017 oroji 2018 thapa et al 2018 wu et al 2018 hasan et al 2019 tomer et al 2019 thus the impact and effective weight of each parameter was determined by using equation 2 2 w p r p w v 100 where w the actual weight of the parameter pr the rating of the parameter p pw the weight of the parameter p v intrinsic vulnerability index subjecting aquifer vulnerability maps to validation assessment is vital for producing reliable and valid aquifer vulnerability maps mogaji et al 2014 majolagbe et al 2016 even though there are a number of physicochemical and biological parameters that indicate water quality the concentration of nitrate no3 and microbes are the most common groundwater contaminants which deteriorate water quality and cause health problems tadesse 2014 water aid 2016 these contaminants are commonly generated by human activities agricultural intensification sewage discharge septic tank landfill and industrial and municipal and therefore used for validating aquifer vulnerability maps abdelmadjid and omar 2013 dávila et al 2014 mogaji et al 2014 boufekane and saighi 2018 different studies tilahun and merkel 2010 alwathaf and mansouri 2011 shirazi et al 2012 allah et al 2017 jang et al 2017 moslem and ashournia 2017 hosseini and saremi 2018 thapa et al 2018 chamanehpour et al 2020 have employed these parameters for validating the groundwater vulnerability maps in groundwater the physiochemical substances vary very slowly over time thus a single sample per year is adequate for groundwater quality analysis who 2008 therefore as this study focuses on groundwater a one time sample was taken from water wells and springs the samples were collected purposely from the highly vulnerable and moderately vulnerable part of the watershed in the study watershed a total of 31 water wells and springs were identified and of which 9 of them were located in the highly vulnerable and 22 were in the moderately vulnerable part of the watershed since the water sources were located in a similar vulnerability level composite sampling technique heald 2009 were used to collect water samples therefore six water samples from highly vulnerable and nine water samples from moderately vulnerable totally fifteen composite samples from 31 water wells and springs were collected the water samples were taken from the identified wells and springs after 6 10 min of pumping fetched up and collected in a clean plastic bottle and kept in the cold box and were transported to angereb dam water laboratory and debre tabor university chemistry laboratory within 48 h the samples were analyzed for nitrate no3 tds total dissolved substance and total coliform tcf in the laboratory and the ph was determined using portable ph meter in in situ on the site because its status change as it was transported finally the result was compared with the drinking water quality standard described in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 result 3 1 1 depth to water table d depth to water table determines the depth through which a contaminant travels before reaching the aquifer and it determines the contact time with the surrounding media aller et al 1987 jang et al 2017 thus a greater chance for attenuation occurs as the depth to water table increases because the deeper water table implies longer travel times and less vulnerable to contamination khemiri et al 2013 the depth to water table was generated from 27 wells and springs distributed in the watershed with a maximum depth of 105 m and a minimum depth of 3 15 m since the depth to water table changes depending on the time season of the year in response to recharge and discharge vongphachanh et al 2017 arya et al 2018 the measurement was taken at dry or pre rainy season of the year the depth to water table was classified into ranges defined by the drastic model and assigned rates ranging from 1 minimum impact on vulnerability to 10 maximum impact on the vulnerability as shown in table 2 and fig 3 a 3 1 2 net recharge n net recharge is the amount of surface water that infiltrated into the ground and reaches the groundwater chitsazan and akhtari 2009 it indicates the amount of water from precipitation that is available for vertical transport dispersion and dilution of pollutants from a specific point of application aller et al 1987 recharged water serves as a medium for transporting contaminants within vadose zone to the aquifer the higher the recharge the more vulnerable is the groundwater hasan et al 2019 data for the net recharge was not available thus it was derived from mean annual rainfall where 30 years 1988 2018 of five meteorological stations were considered net recharge of each station was computed based on the model of chaturvedi equation chaturvedi 1973 3 r 6 75 p 14 0 5 where r net recharge and p mean rainfall mm year the model was developed for tropical regions based on water level fluctuations and rainfall depth it was implemented in several studies adelana et al 2006 misstear et al 2009 aliran et al 2013 mogaji et al 2014 the result showed that the net recharge value of the watershed ranges from a minimum of 236 55 mm year to a maximum of 308 126 mm year fig 3b shows the rate of net recharge of megech watershed 3 1 3 aquifer media a aquifer media refers to a rock in the ground that serves as water storage ersoy and gültekin 2013 it indicates materials property which controls pollutant attenuation processes based on the permeability of each layer jang et al 2017 the attenuation characteristic of the aquifer material is reflected by the mobility of the contaminants through aquifer media megech watershed is dominated by tarmaber and aiba basalt deposit and alluvial and colluvial sediment deposit workineh et al 2011 thus its aquifer is an unconfined fractured aquifer and hydrologically very good source of groundwater paul et al 2012 seifu 2013 asrie and sebhat 2016 landtschoote 2017 as shown in table 2 and fig 3c the watershed aquifer media is grouped into two categories and rated according to the attenuation nature of the layers 3 1 4 soil media s in the modified drastic model the soil media represents the capabilities of soil to infiltrate water and contaminants vertically down to the unsaturated zone it transports the contaminant and water from the soil surface to the aquifer this is based on the permeable character of the soil which inherited from the parent material and materials constitute al abadi et al 2017 soils with clay and silt particles increase the travel time of pollutants nitosols liptosols regosols xerosols fluvisols vertisols and cambisols are major soils of the watershed based on the permeability the soils of the study watershed were rated as shown in table 2 and fig 4 a 3 1 5 topography media t topography refers to the slope of an area it controls the likelihood of a pollutant to be transported by runoff or to remain on the ground where it may infiltrate into the surface aller et al 1987 voudouris et al 2010 souleymane and zhonghua 2017 the gentler the slope slope of 0 2 the higher retaining capacity of water and or pollutants while the steeper the slope slope of 18 have lower retention capacity of water and or pollutants souleymane and zhonghua 2017 as shown in fig 4b and table 2 the slope of the study watershed was rated from 0 slope of 18 to 10 0 2 3 1 6 impact of vadose zone media i vadose zone is the unsaturated zone materials lying below the soil horizon and above the water table it determines the attenuation characteristics of contaminants aller et al 1987 atiqur 2008 the movement of the contaminants to the saturated zone is controlled by this parameter according to aller et al 1987 and maria 2018 if clay content of the vadose zone is higher the pollution potential is lower while with an increase of silt and sand concentration the pollution potential of the vadose zone increases based on this notion impact of vadose zone of megech watershed was derived from the distribution of soil textures accordingly the watershed is dominantly covered by clay loam 358 18 sq km and clay 255 32 sq km soils the remaining part of the watershed is covered by sand clay loam and loam soils based on the soil texture characteristics the impact of vadose zone was rated from 1 to 5 classes as shown in table 2 and fig 4c 3 1 7 hydraulic conductivity c hydraulic conductivity is described as the ability of aquifer materials to transmit water in turn controls the rate of groundwater and contaminant material flow under a given hydraulic gradient khemiri et al 2013 it depends on the amount and interconnection of void spaces within the aquifer it controls the contaminant migration and dispersion from the injection point within the saturated zone hydraulic property of the watershed was determined based on the average soil texture properties rawls et al 1982 smedema and rycroft 1983 oosterbaan and nijland 1994 davie 2008 healy and scanlon 2010 dávila et al 2014 zekaiz 2015 malik and shukla 2019 clay and clay loam soils consist more fine soil particles that are characterized by low porosity and less permeable thus the watershed has low hydraulic conductivity tables 2 and 5 and low pollution potential on the other hand sand and loam soil texture classes have less clay particle content implying more permeable and relatively higher vulnerability potential to pollution fig 5 a 3 1 8 land use land cover lu lulc of megech watershed was prepared from sentinel 2 satellite image based on anderson land use classification system andorson et al 1983 the watershed was classified into five major lulc classes namely water body built up area settlement cultivated land grazing land and forest and plantation tree table 6 and fig 5b lulc has a strong impact on the surface and groundwater quality al rawabdeh et al 2014 singh et al 2015 baghapour et al 2016 ouedraogo et al 2016 this shows the impact of human activities to aquifer vulnerability 3 1 9 aquifer vulnerability map all thematic layers of the parameters were rated according to their relative importance and their susceptibility to contaminants these layers were multiplied by their weight table 2 which were assigned according to their significance and contribution to contamination aller et al 1987 baghapour et al 2016 the analysis of intrinsic aquifer vulnerability was computed by summing the product of each parameter using equation 1 according to the result shown in fig 6 a the total vulnerability index value of the study watershed ranges from 102 to 202 the higher the value of the drastic index the greater is the aquifer vulnerability for pollution witkowsk et al 2007 dávila et al 2014 djémin et al 2016 abiy and melesse 2017 thus the aquifer of the study watershed is vulnerable to contaminants table 3 as shown in table 7 and fig 6b the values of the modified drastic aquifer vulnerability index were classified into three classes such as low moderate and highly vulnerable zones out of the total area of the study watershed about 9256 41ha 13 92 is in the low vulnerable zone with a drastic index ranging between 102 and 145 moderate vulnerable zone with a drastic index ranging between 146 and 190 and highly vulnerable zone with drastic index ranging between 191 and 202 cover about 53 404 83ha 80 34 and about 3813 22ha 5 74 respectively the aquifers at a high vulnerability level are mainly found in built up areas settlement of gondar city and gondar zuria woreda district where industrial effluents from factories and domestic wastes significantly polluting the groundwater moderately vulnerable areas 80 34 are dominantly found in cultivated lands of the southern part dembia and gondar zuria woredas of the watershed for the assessment of the impact of individual parameters towards an aquifer vulnerability a single parameter sensitivity analysis was performed the single parameter sensitivity analysis compares the effective and theoretical weights thereby evaluates the degree of the influence of an individual parameter for the vulnerability of groundwater in megech watershed effective weights of net recharge 26 20 and land use land cover 18 24 were higher than their theoretical weights 14 29 and 17 86 respectively table 8 this implies that net recharge and land use land cover are the most influential parameters in the aquifer vulnerability analysis followed by aquifer media a and groundwater depth d with an effective weight of 17 91 and 17 18 respectively table 8 groundwater physicochemical and biological properties of the study watershed were examined through 15 composite samples taken from 31 wells and springs the result of physicochemical and biological properties is presented in table 9 as shown in table 9 the average ph value ranges between 6 2 and 8 3 with an average value of 7 8 this indicates that the ph value in the study watershed is within who and fao permissible level for drinking table 4 the geographical distribution of tds no3 and total coliforms were compared with vulnerability maps attempts have been made to validate the drastic model using the tds no3 and total coliforms concentration in groundwater the tds values for the water samples taken from highly and moderately vulnerable areas ranged from 145 mg l to 472 mg l which was below the concertation level expected in potable water table 9 however the concentration of tds was higher in the moderately vulnerable part of the aquifer the average concentration of nitrate no3 was 21 mg l in cultivated land of the highly vulnerable part of the aquifer and 11 mg l in an urban area of moderately vulnerable part of the watershed table 9 similarly 21 100 ml total coliforms were found from samples taken from highly vulnerable and 4 100 ml in samples taken from moderately vulnerable parts of the watershed the highest level of nitrate concentration and the total number of coliforms coincide with the results of the modified drastic vulnerable index which demonstrates the deterioration of groundwater quality of the watershed and validates the use of the drastic model in the study watershed with the given data set in line with this result gondar city water and sanitation service office report showed that 60 100 ml and 9 100 ml total bacteria and 3 100 ml fecal coliform was found in the water water before distribution from angereb dam and 6 100 ml up to 9 100 ml fecal coliform from boreholes the report confirmed that groundwater of gondar city highly vulnerable urban area is at risk of pollution 3 2 discussion in the present study the modified drastic model was used to assess the degree of vulnerability to pollution of groundwater in the megech watershed drastic vulnerability index values range were arranged into different classes low 102 145 moderate 146 190 and high 191 202 the areas under the high vulnerability level 5 74 are mainly in built up settlement areas where gondar city and gondar zuria woreda district were identified as a maximum protection area that requires extreme protection the majority of the study watershed is characterized by moderate vulnerability level which is mainly associated with cultivated land that demands high protection witkowsk et al 2007 the result of the present study is in harmony with the result of singh et al 2015 who conducted a study in lucknow city india using a modified drastic model drastica where anthropogenic influence exhibited a significant contribution for groundwater pollution likewise a groundwater vulnerability assessment conducted in algeria khemis miliana plain using drastic lu model showed the influence of human activities on groundwater pollution zafane et al 2017 similar studies by al rawabdeh et al 2014 dávila et al 2014 and gómez et al 2017 also confirmed the strong influence of human activities on the groundwater quality manifested via lulc change in the vulnerability analysis a groundwater vulnerability evaluation was conducted in india kerala region near solid waste disposal site using drastic model and was reported the drastic index values ranged between 120 and 243 where the eastern and southeastern part of the dumping site was highly vulnerable to contaminants due to the lower slope of the terrains which allows percolation of contaminants into the groundwater jaseela et al 2016 another study conducted in southern côte d ivoire djémin et al 2016 reported a vulnerability index values ranging from 95 to 187 where about 63 93 of the areas are under very high to highly vulnerable zone which is mainly in the central part of the region similarly moslem and ashournia 2017 reported that a large extent 48 64 of guilan aquifer in iran is highly vulnerable to pollution analogous to the results of the present study ebadati et al 2012 al abadi et al 2017 souleymane and zhonghua 2017 hasan et al 2019 reported a groundwater map with three vulnerability classes ranging from very high to low vulnerable to pollution the vulnerability class ranging from moderately to the very highly vulnerable part of the region categorized as an extreme protection region voudouris et al 2010 and wu et al 2018 reported that the shallower part the aquifer and beihai city fall within high and very high vulnerability zones in which intensive rain and slope of the terrain were influencing factors in the vulnerability analysis bhuvaneswaran and ganesh 2019 also reported that shallow groundwater level permeability of vadose zone and high rate of net recharge resulted in high vulnerability of groundwater in uppar odai sub watershed of india in the megech watershed high vulnerability is associated with the built up settlement area contrary to this finding a research conducted in lahore pakistan by muhammad et al 2015 reported that low vulnerability is associated with the dense human settlements and low water level areas while high vulnerability which covers 28 8 of the region associated with agricultural areas previous studies conducted in megech watershed mengesha et al 2013 damtie et al 2014 getahun et al 2014 misganaw 2015 feleke et al 2018 using laboratory method confirmed that groundwater wells and springs and surface water rivers reservoirs and tap water of gondar city have experienced high risk of pollution this is because the city has suffered from discharges from human activities industrial effluent landfill sewages which contributes to the pollution and contamination of the groundwater this report coincides with the result of the modified drastic model where built up urban areas are delineated as a highly vulnerable part of the study watershed similarly a study conducted in guna tana watershed using water quality experiment techniques revealed that agricultural activity is the major contributor to the higher concentration of nitrate in the groundwater akale et al 2017 2018 this is in line with the notion that excessive agricultural activities generate pollutants for contaminating groundwater paul et al 2012 zafane et al 2017 gómez et al 2017 merchant 1994 also indicated that human activity which discharges contaminants to the surface and infiltrates down to the aquifer has a significant contribution to groundwater pollution in this regard hosseini and saremi 2018 baghapour et al 2016 and nazzal et al 2019 were incorporated lulc as a parameter and found that the modified drastic model performed better in delineating groundwater vulnerability to pollution dávila et al 2014 also compared the conventional drastic model with the modified drastic model and came up with a better result for the modified drastic model according to the result from single parameter sensitivity analysis net recharge n and land use land cover lu were identified as parameters which have a significant influence on megech watershed aquifer vulnerability analysis similarly other parameters such as geology soil and land use abiy et al 2016 depth to water table moslem and ashournia 2017 vadose zone and depth to water table djémin et al 2016 mfonka et al 2018 tomer et al 2019 aquifer media and vadose zone thapa et al 2018 depth to water table oroji 2018 rainfall recharge aquifer media soil type and topography wu et al 2018 were identified as significant parameters in groundwater vulnerability analysis this implies that accurate and detailed information about these significant parameters needs to be obtained for aquifer vulnerability analysis all these revealed that the results of the modified drastic model are viable and representative of the groundwater vulnerability of the study watershed likewise shirazi et al 2012 anornu and kabo bah 2013 djémin et al 2016 jang et al 2017 were found the model appropriate for groundwater vulnerability assessment and it serves as a tool for monitoring human activities for the sustainable conservation of groundwater quality 4 conclusions groundwater is a promising source of freshwater however point and non point sources of pollutants generated from human activities degrade the quality of groundwater which bring socio economic and health problem this water quality issue became one of the 17 sustainable development goals of the un this is to be achieved by 2030 where reducing pollution and minimizing the release of hazardous chemicals is a prior task to realize universal and equitable access to safe water proper planning and directing efforts for groundwater management requires delineating vulnerable areas and identifying the source of contaminants therefore this study implemented a modified drastic model to delineate and identify the spatial extent of megech watershed aquifer vulnerability to pollution apart from the conventional drastic model the modified drastic model incorporated lulc as a parameter to consider the impact of human activity on the groundwater pollution the result of the study showed that megech watershed aquifer vulnerability ranges from a lower vulnerable level 102 145 to a highly vulnerable level 191 202 moderately vulnerable covers 81 24 53 404 83 ha and highly vulnerable covers 5 74 3813 22 ha of the total watershed aquifer the central part of the watershed which covered by built up settlement areas is highly vulnerable for pollution the majority of the watershed which is dominated by cultivated land is moderately vulnerable to pollution the sensitivity analysis of the model revealed that net recharge r and lulc lu were the highest contributors for groundwater contamination in the study watershed therefore planners and local administrates should give priority for the highly vulnerable part gondar city of the watershed to manage the groundwater so as to meet the millennium development goal information on the current status of contamination of groundwater might be used as an early warning for the responsible authorities to take judicious measures to prevent further stress on this invaluable resource in this study the combined use of drastic model and geographical information system gis demonstrated as an effective method for groundwater vulnerability assessment furthermore this study suggests similar studies to be conducted in different agro climatic and management conditions declaration of competing interest the authors

12046,groundwater quality and water table fluctuation baseline study were carried out along doukkala plain one of largest agricultural regions in morocco bringing together and comparing information from 1995s to 2016s analysis the depths of wells the ph electrical conductivity and temperature of groundwater were measured in situ for 160 groundwater samples in may 2016 the study of water table fluctuation between 1995 and 2016 showed a continuous rise of the piezometric level from 0 7 to 0 8 m year in large irrigation schemes while in the rainfed agriculture area the piezometric level was decreased from 5 to 10 m the obtained results showed that the level of water table was affected by seasonal variations in consequence to rainfall irrigation water and groundwater over pumping groundwater chemistry was also carried out in this research using laboratory analyses of major cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions cl hco3 no3 and so4 2 electrical conductivity nitrate levels and total hardness were used as indicators to determine groundwater quality and suitability for drinking purposes the values of these indicators were ranged from 640 to 11950 μs cm 0 152 10 mg l and from 149 2 to 2081 6 mg l respectively while the suitability of groundwater for agricultural use was determined using sodium adsorption ratio sar and sodium percentage na sar values ranged from 1 96 to 17 96 meq l and sodium percentage values ranged from 22 28 to 86 09 these results showed that the chemical composition of groundwater fell above acceptable limits recommended by who 2011 for drinking water suitability in contrast groundwater is suitable for agriculture use at most locations the unconfined doukkala aquifer is under stress due to the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate change therefore widely sharing these results will enable farmers public and government departments to adopt sustainable solutions for the management of doukkala aquifer graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water table fluctuations plio quaternary aquifer doukkala plain morocco 1 introduction in recent years the intensive groundwater contamination and exploitation generated by the population growth and the extensive demand of agricultural and industrial sectors have become a global concern tao et al 2013 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 groundwater can be directly or indirectly impacted and depleted by climate change and human activities such as the over pumping of groundwater and the infiltration of pollutants in the recharge area of aquifers bundschuh et al 2017 under this pressure hydrogeologists focused the attention and studies on the effects of climate change and human activities on groundwater resources tadesse et al 2011 ben abbou et al 2014 banajarani et al 2017 bhattacharjee et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 in morocco as arid to semi arid country groundwater is a valuable resource mainly in rural areas for irrigation as well as for human and animal consumption however these natural resources greatly influenced by climatic variations agriculture activities groundwater pumping industrial discharges urban activities and disposal of waste navarra and tubiana 2013 fadili et al 2018 therefore the renewable water resources could halve from 800 m3 in 1990 to 400 m3 in 2020 for each inhabitant therefore morocco has been considered as a country under chronic water stress berdai 1997 the doukkala plain as morocco s semi arid region belongs to privileged geographical framework characterized by fertile agricultural soil and contains very important water reserves including both groundwater and surface water oum er rabia river fig 1 likewise this area is considered as one of the largest agricultural zones including irrigated and rainfed agriculture according to the hydraulic basin agency of oum er rabia the average annual volume of surface water inputs in doukkala plain is estimated at 2 695 mm3 besides groundwater reserve is estimated at 125 mm3 year the total volume of groundwater used for irrigation is significant comparing to other uses especially in dry seasons furthermore groundwater is the main source of drinking water in rural areas where the population counts for more than 80 of the total population in doukkala plain 452448 people in 2014 and the access to drinking water is defined by a minimum service level of 20 l per inhabitant as a result the groundwater of the doukkala plain is negatively impacted by the implementation of large irrigation schemes and intensive pumping accompanied by rainfall deficit el achheb 1993 in light of this situation numerous studies showed that diffuse pollution after farming activities and fertilizer use represent the principal irrigation impact on groundwater quality el amrani et al 2007 boy roura et al 2013 this paper aims to assess the groundwater quality and quantity evolution between 1995 1996 and 2016 in doukkala plain in order to discover the determining factors that can affect the level of the water table and to discuss the pollution sources and the degree of groundwater contamination in other words this study explored different software hydrogeochemical tools and calculated indices to determine the degree of groundwater suitability for irrigation and drinking water purposes 2 presentation of the study area the study area belongs doukkala plain around sidi bennour province west morocco degrees minutes and seconds dms latitude and longitude coordinates for sidi bennour are 32 39 8 5 n 8 25 39 68 w the doukkala plain is bounded to the east by oum er rabia river to the south east by rehamna to the south by mouisset and to the west by sahel and abda fig 1 the doukkala plain is one of most important agricultural areas in morocco it has a considerable agricultural potential including large irrigation schemes 96 000 ha and rainfed agriculture areas 323757 ha the irrigation schemes of doukkala plain fig 1 is managed by the regional office of agricultural development in doukkala ormvad these schemes are composed of two irrigated sub areas via water surface which is the perimeter of low service and the perimeter of high service geologically the doukkala basin belongs to the large geological unit known as the moroccan meseta which is framed by the atlasic and rifain ranges the doukkala area included two distinct geological entities the precambrian and paleozoic basement and a geological cover formed by quaternary terrains ferre and ruhard 1975 gigout 1965 gives a detailed stratigraphic study allowed to find under a massive sequence of gypsum marl the following trilogy of the neocomian clayey sandy superior layers with a marly limestone and gypsum limestone deposits relatively marly and basic red layers formed of sandstone fine red clay and conglomerates from the pedological point of view and according to the french classification cpcs 1967 there are six major soil types found in the study area which are isohumic soils vertisols calcimagnesic soils poorly evolved soils iron sesquioxide soils and hydromorphic soils badraoui et al 1993 such soils can be moderately productive and generally have a balanced surface texture becomes clayey at depth and dominated by the sandy fraction in particular fine sands rahoui et al 1999 on the hydrogeological level doukkala plain contains a 3250 km2 water table recharged by rainwater and irrigation water el achheb 1993 it contains three types of water tables which are 1 deep water tables are an ascending and non exploitable water tables because of poor physico chemical quality of their groundwater presence of gypsum deposits ferre and ruhard 1975 including the rising water table located in the permo triassic basalts and the rising water table located at a depth of 350 m in the neocomian limestone 2 upper water table it circulates mainly in the plio quaternary detritic limestone 3 perched water table it is represented by small lens located in the superficial part of the silt the study area climate is typically semi arid to warm and relatively dry in summer may november whereas in winter the climate is generally temperate and mild november april according to the climate recorded data at the three different stations doukkala plain is characterized by moderate precipitation fig 2 rainfall is characterized by a seasonal and significant inter and intra annual variability which amounts to an average of 350 mm year in doukkala plain the rainiest months are november december and january in contrasts june july and august are the dry months in addition the potential annual evapotranspiration is 790 900 mm year exceeding the annual medium rainfall broadly 3 materials and methods sampled and exploited boreholes were chosen in such a way to cover the entirety plio quaternary aquifer of doukkala plain with a relatively higher density at irrigated perimeters fig 1 a total of 160 groundwater samples were collected in may 2016 water levels were measured using a 100 m piezometric probe the electrical conductivity ec temperature and ph of the groundwater were measured in situ using handheld multipurpose meters con 150 subsequently at each station groundwater samples were conserved in polyethylene bottles with a 250 ml capacity and preserved at 4 c then the major chemical elements analysis was performed ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 were analyzed by titrimetric methods while no3 and so4 2 were determined using absorption uv visible spectrophotometer finally na and k were determined using flame photometers ion balances were calculated and examined for each groundwater sample as a quality assurance check of the chemical analyses in which ion balances were ranged from 0 to 5 in the percent error satellite images coupled with geographical information system gis were applied to delimit and compute the irrigated plots surface by groundwater in the rainfed agriculture area using the polygon technique the determined surfaces of this irrigated plots were exploited to estimate the monthly and annual volume of pumped groundwater along 7992 ha of rainfed area the result of this research was checked and validated by the survey data about monthly groundwater volumes exploited by area and by crop on may 2016 moreover the software s like diagrammes surfer 13 and arcgis10 4 were used in the statistical data analysis in order to reveal a spatial distribution of the studied elements 4 results and discussion 4 1 piezometry study the piezometric state is established in may 2016 from a network of 160 wells covering the entire plio quaternary aquifer system the piezometric map fig 3 shows that the water table of the doukkala plain flows from south east to north west with exception of the downstream part of faregh where the flow direction is from south east to east west water level measurements have shown that the depth of wells ranged from 11 77 m to 100 m the low depths of the water table between 11 77 and 45 m are observed in agricultural areas with the presence of the perched water table then again the deepens water table between 45 and 100 m moving toward upstream over the 1995 2016 periods most of the piezometers show an almost generalized rise of the piezometric level in the irrigated perimeters fig 3 the rise of water table varied from 0 70 to 0 80 m year especially in the east south east and south of the irrigated areas sidi bennour moreover in the faregh area and rainfed agriculture area the level of water table declined from 5 to 15 m fig 4 in which the monthly volume of pumped groundwater was estimated at 11 58 mm3 month on 2016 this makes a total of 69 5 mm3 year to irrigate 7992 ha of cropping in rainfed area table 1 the piezometric level rise was accelerated by the return flow of surface water as soon as the first agricultural sectors were put in irrigation and could be sped up by losses and illegal exploitation of surface water brought by irrigation canals this finding collaborates with those obtained by el achheb 1993 that estimated the irrigation water return flow at 144 mm equivalent to drainage rates of 15 towards aquifer while the piezometric level decline was caused by the groundwater overuse for irrigation as well as for human and animal consumption following the succession of drought years fig 4 fig 5 in fact in dry periods the excessive pumping of groundwater for private irrigation is the major activity that cause stress as previously reported by foster and shah 2012 foster and garduño 2013 4 2 groundwater quality and sources of contamination the study of physicochemical parameters and hydrochemical concepts can help to evaluate and to clarify flow and infiltration processes responsible for changes in the groundwater quality alam 2014 the physicochemical data of the doukkala plain groundwater are summarized in table 2 the statistical study of the different analyzed parameters shows a wide lateral variation in the chemical composition the ph varies between a minimal of 6 40 and a maximum of 7 98 with an average of 7 28 and a very low standard deviation of 0 25 suggesting that the groundwater in the study area is in the normal range and of a light alkalinity the temperature ranges from 16 60 to 28 70 c with an average of 22 13 c and a standard deviation of 1 79 c the variation of the groundwater temperature is influenced by climate change and the depth of wells as proposed by rosen and jones 1998 indeed the temperature of groundwater is more influenced by climatic changes when the depth of well is less than 5 m similarly castany 1982 suggests that the temperature of groundwater increase depends on the depth of well 1 c for each 33 m water electric conductivity ec showed values ranging from 640 to 11950 μs cm with an average of 3738 μs cm and a standard deviation of 1669 μs cm according to moroccan standards 2002 and based on the analysis of the ec four classes could be distinguished excellent class ec 750 μs cm middle class 1300 ec 2700 μs cm polluted class 2700 ec 3000 μs cm and highly polluted class 3000 μs cm ec which describe respectively low medium moderate and high salt according to this classification 0 63 23 30 9 43 and 66 64 of groundwater samples are respectively low medium moderate and high salt fig 6 reports the spatial variation of water electrical conductivity during year 2016 and shows the significant increase of water ec from upstream to downstream indeed the high contents are recorded in the large irrigation schemes with values exceeding 3000 μs cm the comparison between ec spatio temporal variation for water samples collected in 1996 and those collected in 2016 showed an unusual increase in groundwater mineralization estimated at 350 μs cm year fig 6 the high groundwater mineralization in doukkala plain which may often exceed the recommended limits by who 2011 and specified by moroccan standards ec 750 μs cm is caused mainly by the intensified agricultural practices such as the overuse of mineral and organic fertilizers and irrigation by the surface water of a sodium chloride facies cl 798 75 mg l and na 478 mg l also the substratum evaporite marl swept by groundwater provides the mineralization of the water as substantiated by el achheb 1993 el achheb et al 2003 using the hydrochemical approach these results represent an indication of the groundwater contamination of doukkala aquifer as also confirmed by the boreholes rates values of 10 and 66 25 as ec table 3 fig 10 which represent respectively poor and very poor quality similar results were reported by the previous studies of el achheb 1993 2002 which considered the doukkala aquifer as a saline aquifer consequently the groundwater of doukkala plaine requires a normal or intensive treatment for the production of drinking water because the higher ec values in water may cause a gastro intestinal irritation to consumers howard and bartram 2003 the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 show slightly high contents with variation from 40 to 414 mg l and from 12 to 277 22 mg l respectively table 2 indeed the main sources of ca2 and mg2 in doukkala plain include the dissolution of plio quaternary and cretaceous aquifers carbonate formations reported by el achheb et al 2003 the major reactions responsible to enrich the groundwater with magnesium and calcium are firstly the ca mg exchanges due to water carbonate rock interaction and secondly the ca2 and mg2 ion exchange with na and vice versa fidelibus and tulipano 1996 quino lima et al 2020 the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in water determines its hardness the hardness of water can be calculated by substituting the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in the following equation eaton et al 1995 1 h a r d n e s s 2 5 c a 2 4 1 m g 2 where ca2 and mg2 concentrations are expressed in mg l the factors 2 5 and 4 1 are the ratio of caco3 formula mass to ca atomic mass and mg atomic mass respectively the hardness of groundwater in doukkala plain was ranging between a minimum of 149 20 mg l to a maximum of 2081 60 mg l these values are higher than the value of 150 mg l reported by benefield and morgan 1990 hence the groundwater in doukkala plain is considered hard and the excessive consumption of this hard water can cause some serious diseases to the consumers such as anencephaly urolithiasis some types of cancer and cardiovascular disorders durvey et al 1991 bhardwaj and singh 2011 the concentrations of na and k vary from 68 5 to 1893 mg l and from 2 6 to 28 40 mg l respectively the high concentration of na is measured in the groundwater of the zmamra area and in the north of sidi bennour fig 8 the potential sources of elevated sodium levels in groundwater could be the infiltration of surface waters charged with salts and the natural erosion of salt deposits the sodium can come also from the mineral rocks bermond and perrdon 1979 rodier et al 2009 the potassium concentrations in the groundwater of doukkala plain are generally less than 10 mg l except of a few samples in sidi bennour center and zmamra north fig 8 this result validates the research of chow 1964 who reported that the concentrations of k in most natural water are generally less than 10 mg l in contrast the high potassium content 10 mg l refers to agricultural sources and to the use of fertilizers in the form of potassium sulfate potassium chloride or potassium nitrate as confirmed by nouayti et al 2015 anions are dominantly represented by cl ranging from 133 13 to 3922 75 mg l the chloride map in fig 8 shows a significant concentration of cl in downstream where the concentrations are higher than 750 mg l chloride ions are the main components in saline groundwater in doukkala plain their concentration influence directly the ec values as evidenced by peinado guevara et al 2012 the enrichment of cl in groundwater samples could be resulted from irrigation and the dissolution of salty sediments ramos et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2009 the comparison between the spatial distribution map of chlorides concentrations and that of water ec indicates a similar distribution of both parameters figs 6 and 8 therefore the concentration of chloride could be used as a pollution index table 3 fig 10 because the exposure to extreme levels of chlorides could cause sneezing headaches and dizziness and irritation of the skin as documented demba n diaye et al 2014 otherwise numerous studies demonstrate that chlorides were considered as conservative elements in groundwater and do not contribute to chemical reactions like ion exchange or form insoluble precipitates davis et al 1998 hsissou et al 1999 daniele et al 2011 najib et al 2016 the concentration of so4 2 varies from 2 50 to 1011 83 mg l table 2 however more than 30 of the analyzed groundwater samples showed concentrations that exceeded the maximum permissible limit prescribed by who 250 mg l and presented a bad to a very bad quality the spatial distribution map of sulfate fig 8 proves a high level of so4 2 particularly in the east of sidi smaïl in the south west and in the north of sidi bennour these high concentrations of sulfate in groundwater can be explained by the evaporate minerals dissolution caso4 of the aquifer the contact of the water with the gypsum marl that forms the ground of the aquifer and the presence of diffuse pollution caused by uncontrolled application of fertilizers el achheb 2002 ben abbou et al 2014 the concentration of hco3 varies from 128 10 to 707 60 mg l table 2 the high concentrations of bicarbonates 300 mg l are located in the south and the east of sidi bennour in the north east of zmamra as well as in the north west of a aounate fig 8 bicarbonate map the presence of this element is essentially due to the dissolution of carbon dioxide resulting from the attack of weak acids to carbonate rocks el achheb 1993 2002 mukherjee et al 2008 najib et al 2017 the range of no3 concentration was from 0 00 to 152 10 mg l table 2 in which 4 38 of groundwater samples have a concentration of no3 above international standards 50 mg l prescribed by who table 2 the highest concentrations of nitrate were detected in the center of zmamra as well as in the south west and the center of sidi smail these areas are considered as a mixture of residential and agricultural areas fig 7 map 2016 in this case nitrate contamination occurs from man made sources as septic tanks or fertilizer likewise the obtained results are in agreement with those found by numerous studies chapman and kimstach 1996 berdai et al 2004 el asslouj et al 2007 jabal et al 2014 kihumba et al 2016 alcaine et al 2020 these studies have demonstrated that the origin of nitric pollution in groundwater is linked to the nitrites oxidation by nitrification bacteria caused by the infiltration of wastewater as well as the excessive use of chemicals or animal fertilizers remedial actions should be taken to obtain drinking water with lower nitrate content because long term intake of water with high nitrate concentrations can cause gastric cancer methemoglobinemia goiter and hypertension chabukdhara et al 2017 also drinking water with high level of nitrates 10 mg l caused and developed children s blue baby illness as reported by galmiche tejeda et al 2012 the low nitrate concentration measured in more than 95 of the analyzed samples from doukkala plain confirmed the results of nitrate spatial temporal distribution map obtained in 2016 as compared to that obtained in 1996 which show a very remarkable regression in the nitrate concentration of groundwater fig 7 meanwhile the average precipitation recorded in 2016 245 mm was less than that recorded in 1996 619 mm as well as the 2015 2016 crop years were considered as a dry season ormvad which confirms that the drought decreases the seepage of nitrates to do not reach aquifers speedily besides the nitrates can take a long time to appear in groundwater depending on the precipitation rate and the depth of water table as well as the presence of silt that can prevent the percolation of nitrates towards doukkala aquifer el achheb 1993 the cations and anions data of the groundwater sampled from doukkala plain are plotted in the piper s diagram piper 1944 fig 9 the obtained results pointed out that the majority of samples are characterized by sodium chloride facies and mixed type facies anions diagram indicates the important concentration of points towards the pole cl with a few wells have shown an so4 2 dominance the cations diagram suggests a remarkable concentration of points towards the sodico potassium pole fig 9 for this purpose a comparison of hydrochemical analysis of groundwater was carried out before the setting up of the second large irrigation scheme more than 25 years in the study performed by el achheb 1993 and that of 2016s the results illustrated a noticeable change in chemical facies which are marked by the regression of calcium chloride sulfate calcium and magnesium calcium chloride facies in favor of sodium chloride facies this water is highly mineralized and their ec reaches more than 5000 μs cm in the majority of wells water facies amendment is a result of water rock interaction besides these facies are representative of water very marked by pollution of anthropic origin i e agricultural activities and irrigation with surface water of high chlorides and sodium concentrations in which the irrigation water rich in chloride and sodium brings a significant amount of salt to the soil solution then to groundwater el achheb 2002 giambastiani et al 2013 fadili et al 2015 4 3 assessment of groundwater suitability for irrigation use the assessment of the water quality and its suitability for irrigation purposes can be determined using different parameters such as ec sodium adsorption ratio sar and sodium percentage na sappa et al 2015 the total concentration of soluble salts can be classified as low ec 250 μs cm medium 250 ec 750 μs cm high 750 ec 2250 μs cm and very high 2250 μs cm ec salinity values in water supplied for irrigation richards 1954 a high concentration of salt in water irrigation or soil will negatively affect crop yields cause soil degradation and groundwater pollution the excessive amounts of exchangeable sodium in the soil replace calcium and magnesium adsorbed on clays and promote the dispersion and swelling of clay minerals as well as affect soil permeability and cause infiltration problems frenkel et al 1978 the soluble sodium percent ssp for groundwater was calculated by using wilcox 1955 equation 2 n a n a 2 k c a 2 m g 2 n a 2 k 100 where the concentrations of ca2 mg2 k and na are expressed in milli equivalents per liter meq l the sodium percentage na in the study area ranges between 22 70 and 86 77 average of 51 92 in groundwater samples and shows four classes of groundwater quality following wilcox 1955 classification which are good permissible doubtful and unsuitable for irrigation purposes representing respectively 11 95 71 70 15 72 and 0 63 of sampled wells rates table 4 following wilcox 1955 classification in previous research studies naseem et al 2010 nasher et al 2013 authors showed that the irrigation with water having a load of soluble sodium higher than 60 may lead to sodium accumulation and therefore destroys soil structure groundwater of doukkala plain shows high to very high content of soluble salts and it can be considered as permissible to unsuitable for irrigation according to the diagram na vs water ec fig 11 the sodium absorption ratio sar indicates the sodium hazard in the irrigation water it is computed by using richards 1954 formula 3 s a r n a 2 1 2 c a 2 m g 2 in the equation sodium calcium and magnesium concentrations are expressed in meq l according to the classification of the united states department of agriculture usda richards 1954 irrigation water with sar 10 meq l regarded as excellent for irrigation sar values ranged from 10 to 18 qualify water as good for irrigation and sar between 18 and 26 meq l indicate that the water is acceptable for irrigation water could be not suitable for irrigation if the sar value exceeds 26 in current study sar values varied from 1 96 to 17 96 meq l in which 85 44 of inspected wells show sar 10 meq l and 14 56 of sampled wells have sar range around 10 18 meq l table 5 fig 12 the results of sar combined to those of ec of groundwater in which low ec 250 μs cm medium 250 ec 750 μs cm high 750 ec 2250 μs cm and very high 2250 μs cm ec water salinity values are affected respectively to the different classes c1 c2 c3 and c4 while the different classes s1 s2 s3 and s4 were determined basing on the sar values and represent respectively 0 sar 10 meq l 10 sar 18 meq l 18 sar 26 meq l and 26 meq l sar the s1 classes indicate water with low sodium and practically there is no risk of exchangeable sodium the s2 classes indicate water with medium sodium and can cause significant risk as well as s3 and s4 classes represent respectively the water with high and very high sodium and can cause damaging levels of exchangeable sodium in the soil consequently this last character produces the undesirable effect on the chemical composition of soil structure by reducing its permeability richards 1954 ayers and westcot 1985 toumi et al 2015 furthermore the projection of the result on ussl 1954 graphic fig 13 shows that the majority of water samples arranged into categories of c3 s1 and c4 s2 while c4 s2 are the dominant categories indicating a wide range of medium high and very high water salinity based on these results it can be suggested that the groundwater of doukkala plain can be graded as inappropriate for use under ordinary conditions but may be used occasionally under very special circumstances if soils are permeable and when the irrigation water is applied in excess to provide considerable leaching and for very salt tolerant crops 5 conclusions the collected and analyzed data during this study provided a portrait of water table fluctuations and an evolution of groundwater quality in the doukkala plain using quality and quantity indicators the analysis of piezometric level fluctuation during the period between 1995 and 2016 showed a level rise of water table in large irrigation schemes from 0 70 to 0 80 m year indeed the return of irrigation water excess is the major factor affecting the fluctuation of doukkala aquifer in irrigated areas in parallel the results revealed a level decline of the water table in rainfed areas and faregh zone from 5 to 10 m as a result of drought as well as groundwater over pumping to support irrigation and public supply purposes besides this study showed that to irrigate 7992 ha of the rainfed area a 69 50 mm3 year of groundwater was pumped during 2016 hence the measurements of wells depth and the calculates of pumped groundwater volume indicate that the main input and output flows of the doukkala aquifer are continuously in imbalance the groundwater quality of doukkala aquifer has also experienced an imbalance at an alarming rate this can be evidenced by the comparison of the analyses results from 1995s to 2016s which showed an increase and expansion of groundwater mineralization confirmed by the water ec values indicating high to very high salinity hazard in most of the wells also the concentrations of most chemical elements as chloride sodium and sulfate exceeded the maximum permissible limit set by who besides high nitrate concentrations were recorded at two locations with a maximum value of 152 10 mg l the potential groundwater quality problems were mostly from agriculture activity as well as disposal of wastewater and household trash without treatment consequently groundwater of doukkal plain is of poor quality and does not meet drinking water quality standards notably in the rural areas where people drink groundwater from their wells besides the hydrochemical analysis indices sar and na confirm that more than 85 of the analyzed groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation purposes only under very special circumstances the current state of doukkala aquifer imposes the treatment of groundwater for the production of drinking water in rural areas and the regular monitoring of sodium and salinity hazard for irrigation purposes there is therefore a need for sustainable management of doukkala aquifer in which the rationalization uses of irrigation water and agricultural inputs as well as regulation of groundwater pumping and waste treatment are a first order approach to protect groundwater as a part of the environment declaration of interests the authors declare that

12046,groundwater quality and water table fluctuation baseline study were carried out along doukkala plain one of largest agricultural regions in morocco bringing together and comparing information from 1995s to 2016s analysis the depths of wells the ph electrical conductivity and temperature of groundwater were measured in situ for 160 groundwater samples in may 2016 the study of water table fluctuation between 1995 and 2016 showed a continuous rise of the piezometric level from 0 7 to 0 8 m year in large irrigation schemes while in the rainfed agriculture area the piezometric level was decreased from 5 to 10 m the obtained results showed that the level of water table was affected by seasonal variations in consequence to rainfall irrigation water and groundwater over pumping groundwater chemistry was also carried out in this research using laboratory analyses of major cations na k ca2 and mg2 and anions cl hco3 no3 and so4 2 electrical conductivity nitrate levels and total hardness were used as indicators to determine groundwater quality and suitability for drinking purposes the values of these indicators were ranged from 640 to 11950 μs cm 0 152 10 mg l and from 149 2 to 2081 6 mg l respectively while the suitability of groundwater for agricultural use was determined using sodium adsorption ratio sar and sodium percentage na sar values ranged from 1 96 to 17 96 meq l and sodium percentage values ranged from 22 28 to 86 09 these results showed that the chemical composition of groundwater fell above acceptable limits recommended by who 2011 for drinking water suitability in contrast groundwater is suitable for agriculture use at most locations the unconfined doukkala aquifer is under stress due to the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate change therefore widely sharing these results will enable farmers public and government departments to adopt sustainable solutions for the management of doukkala aquifer graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality water table fluctuations plio quaternary aquifer doukkala plain morocco 1 introduction in recent years the intensive groundwater contamination and exploitation generated by the population growth and the extensive demand of agricultural and industrial sectors have become a global concern tao et al 2013 bhattacharya and bundschuh 2015 groundwater can be directly or indirectly impacted and depleted by climate change and human activities such as the over pumping of groundwater and the infiltration of pollutants in the recharge area of aquifers bundschuh et al 2017 under this pressure hydrogeologists focused the attention and studies on the effects of climate change and human activities on groundwater resources tadesse et al 2011 ben abbou et al 2014 banajarani et al 2017 bhattacharjee et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 in morocco as arid to semi arid country groundwater is a valuable resource mainly in rural areas for irrigation as well as for human and animal consumption however these natural resources greatly influenced by climatic variations agriculture activities groundwater pumping industrial discharges urban activities and disposal of waste navarra and tubiana 2013 fadili et al 2018 therefore the renewable water resources could halve from 800 m3 in 1990 to 400 m3 in 2020 for each inhabitant therefore morocco has been considered as a country under chronic water stress berdai 1997 the doukkala plain as morocco s semi arid region belongs to privileged geographical framework characterized by fertile agricultural soil and contains very important water reserves including both groundwater and surface water oum er rabia river fig 1 likewise this area is considered as one of the largest agricultural zones including irrigated and rainfed agriculture according to the hydraulic basin agency of oum er rabia the average annual volume of surface water inputs in doukkala plain is estimated at 2 695 mm3 besides groundwater reserve is estimated at 125 mm3 year the total volume of groundwater used for irrigation is significant comparing to other uses especially in dry seasons furthermore groundwater is the main source of drinking water in rural areas where the population counts for more than 80 of the total population in doukkala plain 452448 people in 2014 and the access to drinking water is defined by a minimum service level of 20 l per inhabitant as a result the groundwater of the doukkala plain is negatively impacted by the implementation of large irrigation schemes and intensive pumping accompanied by rainfall deficit el achheb 1993 in light of this situation numerous studies showed that diffuse pollution after farming activities and fertilizer use represent the principal irrigation impact on groundwater quality el amrani et al 2007 boy roura et al 2013 this paper aims to assess the groundwater quality and quantity evolution between 1995 1996 and 2016 in doukkala plain in order to discover the determining factors that can affect the level of the water table and to discuss the pollution sources and the degree of groundwater contamination in other words this study explored different software hydrogeochemical tools and calculated indices to determine the degree of groundwater suitability for irrigation and drinking water purposes 2 presentation of the study area the study area belongs doukkala plain around sidi bennour province west morocco degrees minutes and seconds dms latitude and longitude coordinates for sidi bennour are 32 39 8 5 n 8 25 39 68 w the doukkala plain is bounded to the east by oum er rabia river to the south east by rehamna to the south by mouisset and to the west by sahel and abda fig 1 the doukkala plain is one of most important agricultural areas in morocco it has a considerable agricultural potential including large irrigation schemes 96 000 ha and rainfed agriculture areas 323757 ha the irrigation schemes of doukkala plain fig 1 is managed by the regional office of agricultural development in doukkala ormvad these schemes are composed of two irrigated sub areas via water surface which is the perimeter of low service and the perimeter of high service geologically the doukkala basin belongs to the large geological unit known as the moroccan meseta which is framed by the atlasic and rifain ranges the doukkala area included two distinct geological entities the precambrian and paleozoic basement and a geological cover formed by quaternary terrains ferre and ruhard 1975 gigout 1965 gives a detailed stratigraphic study allowed to find under a massive sequence of gypsum marl the following trilogy of the neocomian clayey sandy superior layers with a marly limestone and gypsum limestone deposits relatively marly and basic red layers formed of sandstone fine red clay and conglomerates from the pedological point of view and according to the french classification cpcs 1967 there are six major soil types found in the study area which are isohumic soils vertisols calcimagnesic soils poorly evolved soils iron sesquioxide soils and hydromorphic soils badraoui et al 1993 such soils can be moderately productive and generally have a balanced surface texture becomes clayey at depth and dominated by the sandy fraction in particular fine sands rahoui et al 1999 on the hydrogeological level doukkala plain contains a 3250 km2 water table recharged by rainwater and irrigation water el achheb 1993 it contains three types of water tables which are 1 deep water tables are an ascending and non exploitable water tables because of poor physico chemical quality of their groundwater presence of gypsum deposits ferre and ruhard 1975 including the rising water table located in the permo triassic basalts and the rising water table located at a depth of 350 m in the neocomian limestone 2 upper water table it circulates mainly in the plio quaternary detritic limestone 3 perched water table it is represented by small lens located in the superficial part of the silt the study area climate is typically semi arid to warm and relatively dry in summer may november whereas in winter the climate is generally temperate and mild november april according to the climate recorded data at the three different stations doukkala plain is characterized by moderate precipitation fig 2 rainfall is characterized by a seasonal and significant inter and intra annual variability which amounts to an average of 350 mm year in doukkala plain the rainiest months are november december and january in contrasts june july and august are the dry months in addition the potential annual evapotranspiration is 790 900 mm year exceeding the annual medium rainfall broadly 3 materials and methods sampled and exploited boreholes were chosen in such a way to cover the entirety plio quaternary aquifer of doukkala plain with a relatively higher density at irrigated perimeters fig 1 a total of 160 groundwater samples were collected in may 2016 water levels were measured using a 100 m piezometric probe the electrical conductivity ec temperature and ph of the groundwater were measured in situ using handheld multipurpose meters con 150 subsequently at each station groundwater samples were conserved in polyethylene bottles with a 250 ml capacity and preserved at 4 c then the major chemical elements analysis was performed ca2 mg2 cl and hco3 were analyzed by titrimetric methods while no3 and so4 2 were determined using absorption uv visible spectrophotometer finally na and k were determined using flame photometers ion balances were calculated and examined for each groundwater sample as a quality assurance check of the chemical analyses in which ion balances were ranged from 0 to 5 in the percent error satellite images coupled with geographical information system gis were applied to delimit and compute the irrigated plots surface by groundwater in the rainfed agriculture area using the polygon technique the determined surfaces of this irrigated plots were exploited to estimate the monthly and annual volume of pumped groundwater along 7992 ha of rainfed area the result of this research was checked and validated by the survey data about monthly groundwater volumes exploited by area and by crop on may 2016 moreover the software s like diagrammes surfer 13 and arcgis10 4 were used in the statistical data analysis in order to reveal a spatial distribution of the studied elements 4 results and discussion 4 1 piezometry study the piezometric state is established in may 2016 from a network of 160 wells covering the entire plio quaternary aquifer system the piezometric map fig 3 shows that the water table of the doukkala plain flows from south east to north west with exception of the downstream part of faregh where the flow direction is from south east to east west water level measurements have shown that the depth of wells ranged from 11 77 m to 100 m the low depths of the water table between 11 77 and 45 m are observed in agricultural areas with the presence of the perched water table then again the deepens water table between 45 and 100 m moving toward upstream over the 1995 2016 periods most of the piezometers show an almost generalized rise of the piezometric level in the irrigated perimeters fig 3 the rise of water table varied from 0 70 to 0 80 m year especially in the east south east and south of the irrigated areas sidi bennour moreover in the faregh area and rainfed agriculture area the level of water table declined from 5 to 15 m fig 4 in which the monthly volume of pumped groundwater was estimated at 11 58 mm3 month on 2016 this makes a total of 69 5 mm3 year to irrigate 7992 ha of cropping in rainfed area table 1 the piezometric level rise was accelerated by the return flow of surface water as soon as the first agricultural sectors were put in irrigation and could be sped up by losses and illegal exploitation of surface water brought by irrigation canals this finding collaborates with those obtained by el achheb 1993 that estimated the irrigation water return flow at 144 mm equivalent to drainage rates of 15 towards aquifer while the piezometric level decline was caused by the groundwater overuse for irrigation as well as for human and animal consumption following the succession of drought years fig 4 fig 5 in fact in dry periods the excessive pumping of groundwater for private irrigation is the major activity that cause stress as previously reported by foster and shah 2012 foster and garduño 2013 4 2 groundwater quality and sources of contamination the study of physicochemical parameters and hydrochemical concepts can help to evaluate and to clarify flow and infiltration processes responsible for changes in the groundwater quality alam 2014 the physicochemical data of the doukkala plain groundwater are summarized in table 2 the statistical study of the different analyzed parameters shows a wide lateral variation in the chemical composition the ph varies between a minimal of 6 40 and a maximum of 7 98 with an average of 7 28 and a very low standard deviation of 0 25 suggesting that the groundwater in the study area is in the normal range and of a light alkalinity the temperature ranges from 16 60 to 28 70 c with an average of 22 13 c and a standard deviation of 1 79 c the variation of the groundwater temperature is influenced by climate change and the depth of wells as proposed by rosen and jones 1998 indeed the temperature of groundwater is more influenced by climatic changes when the depth of well is less than 5 m similarly castany 1982 suggests that the temperature of groundwater increase depends on the depth of well 1 c for each 33 m water electric conductivity ec showed values ranging from 640 to 11950 μs cm with an average of 3738 μs cm and a standard deviation of 1669 μs cm according to moroccan standards 2002 and based on the analysis of the ec four classes could be distinguished excellent class ec 750 μs cm middle class 1300 ec 2700 μs cm polluted class 2700 ec 3000 μs cm and highly polluted class 3000 μs cm ec which describe respectively low medium moderate and high salt according to this classification 0 63 23 30 9 43 and 66 64 of groundwater samples are respectively low medium moderate and high salt fig 6 reports the spatial variation of water electrical conductivity during year 2016 and shows the significant increase of water ec from upstream to downstream indeed the high contents are recorded in the large irrigation schemes with values exceeding 3000 μs cm the comparison between ec spatio temporal variation for water samples collected in 1996 and those collected in 2016 showed an unusual increase in groundwater mineralization estimated at 350 μs cm year fig 6 the high groundwater mineralization in doukkala plain which may often exceed the recommended limits by who 2011 and specified by moroccan standards ec 750 μs cm is caused mainly by the intensified agricultural practices such as the overuse of mineral and organic fertilizers and irrigation by the surface water of a sodium chloride facies cl 798 75 mg l and na 478 mg l also the substratum evaporite marl swept by groundwater provides the mineralization of the water as substantiated by el achheb 1993 el achheb et al 2003 using the hydrochemical approach these results represent an indication of the groundwater contamination of doukkala aquifer as also confirmed by the boreholes rates values of 10 and 66 25 as ec table 3 fig 10 which represent respectively poor and very poor quality similar results were reported by the previous studies of el achheb 1993 2002 which considered the doukkala aquifer as a saline aquifer consequently the groundwater of doukkala plaine requires a normal or intensive treatment for the production of drinking water because the higher ec values in water may cause a gastro intestinal irritation to consumers howard and bartram 2003 the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 show slightly high contents with variation from 40 to 414 mg l and from 12 to 277 22 mg l respectively table 2 indeed the main sources of ca2 and mg2 in doukkala plain include the dissolution of plio quaternary and cretaceous aquifers carbonate formations reported by el achheb et al 2003 the major reactions responsible to enrich the groundwater with magnesium and calcium are firstly the ca mg exchanges due to water carbonate rock interaction and secondly the ca2 and mg2 ion exchange with na and vice versa fidelibus and tulipano 1996 quino lima et al 2020 the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in water determines its hardness the hardness of water can be calculated by substituting the concentration of ca2 and mg2 in the following equation eaton et al 1995 1 h a r d n e s s 2 5 c a 2 4 1 m g 2 where ca2 and mg2 concentrations are expressed in mg l the factors 2 5 and 4 1 are the ratio of caco3 formula mass to ca atomic mass and mg atomic mass respectively the hardness of groundwater in doukkala plain was ranging between a minimum of 149 20 mg l to a maximum of 2081 60 mg l these values are higher than the value of 150 mg l reported by benefield and morgan 1990 hence the groundwater in doukkala plain is considered hard and the excessive consumption of this hard water can cause some serious diseases to the consumers such as anencephaly urolithiasis some types of cancer and cardiovascular disorders durvey et al 1991 bhardwaj and singh 2011 the concentrations of na and k vary from 68 5 to 1893 mg l and from 2 6 to 28 40 mg l respectively the high concentration of na is measured in the groundwater of the zmamra area and in the north of sidi bennour fig 8 the potential sources of elevated sodium levels in groundwater could be the infiltration of surface waters charged with salts and the natural erosion of salt deposits the sodium can come also from the mineral rocks bermond and perrdon 1979 rodier et al 2009 the potassium concentrations in the groundwater of doukkala plain are generally less than 10 mg l except of a few samples in sidi bennour center and zmamra north fig 8 this result validates the research of chow 1964 who reported that the concentrations of k in most natural water are generally less than 10 mg l in contrast the high potassium content 10 mg l refers to agricultural sources and to the use of fertilizers in the form of potassium sulfate potassium chloride or potassium nitrate as confirmed by nouayti et al 2015 anions are dominantly represented by cl ranging from 133 13 to 3922 75 mg l the chloride map in fig 8 shows a significant concentration of cl in downstream where the concentrations are higher than 750 mg l chloride ions are the main components in saline groundwater in doukkala plain their concentration influence directly the ec values as evidenced by peinado guevara et al 2012 the enrichment of cl in groundwater samples could be resulted from irrigation and the dissolution of salty sediments ramos et al 2014 mukherjee et al 2009 the comparison between the spatial distribution map of chlorides concentrations and that of water ec indicates a similar distribution of both parameters figs 6 and 8 therefore the concentration of chloride could be used as a pollution index table 3 fig 10 because the exposure to extreme levels of chlorides could cause sneezing headaches and dizziness and irritation of the skin as documented demba n diaye et al 2014 otherwise numerous studies demonstrate that chlorides were considered as conservative elements in groundwater and do not contribute to chemical reactions like ion exchange or form insoluble precipitates davis et al 1998 hsissou et al 1999 daniele et al 2011 najib et al 2016 the concentration of so4 2 varies from 2 50 to 1011 83 mg l table 2 however more than 30 of the analyzed groundwater samples showed concentrations that exceeded the maximum permissible limit prescribed by who 250 mg l and presented a bad to a very bad quality the spatial distribution map of sulfate fig 8 proves a high level of so4 2 particularly in the east of sidi smaïl in the south west and in the north of sidi bennour these high concentrations of sulfate in groundwater can be explained by the evaporate minerals dissolution caso4 of the aquifer the contact of the water with the gypsum marl that forms the ground of the aquifer and the presence of diffuse pollution caused by uncontrolled application of fertilizers el achheb 2002 ben abbou et al 2014 the concentration of hco3 varies from 128 10 to 707 60 mg l table 2 the high concentrations of bicarbonates 300 mg l are located in the south and the east of sidi bennour in the north east of zmamra as well as in the north west of a aounate fig 8 bicarbonate map the presence of this element is essentially due to the dissolution of carbon dioxide resulting from the attack of weak acids to carbonate rocks el achheb 1993 2002 mukherjee et al 2008 najib et al 2017 the range of no3 concentration was from 0 00 to 152 10 mg l table 2 in which 4 38 of groundwater samples have a concentration of no3 above international standards 50 mg l prescribed by who table 2 the highest concentrations of nitrate were detected in the center of zmamra as well as in the south west and the center of sidi smail these areas are considered as a mixture of residential and agricultural areas fig 7 map 2016 in this case nitrate contamination occurs from man made sources as septic tanks or fertilizer likewise the obtained results are in agreement with those found by numerous studies chapman and kimstach 1996 berdai et al 2004 el asslouj et al 2007 jabal et al 2014 kihumba et al 2016 alcaine et al 2020 these studies have demonstrated that the origin of nitric pollution in groundwater is linked to the nitrites oxidation by nitrification bacteria caused by the infiltration of wastewater as well as the excessive use of chemicals or animal fertilizers remedial actions should be taken to obtain drinking water with lower nitrate content because long term intake of water with high nitrate concentrations can cause gastric cancer methemoglobinemia goiter and hypertension chabukdhara et al 2017 also drinking water with high level of nitrates 10 mg l caused and developed children s blue baby illness as reported by galmiche tejeda et al 2012 the low nitrate concentration measured in more than 95 of the analyzed samples from doukkala plain confirmed the results of nitrate spatial temporal distribution map obtained in 2016 as compared to that obtained in 1996 which show a very remarkable regression in the nitrate concentration of groundwater fig 7 meanwhile the average precipitation recorded in 2016 245 mm was less than that recorded in 1996 619 mm as well as the 2015 2016 crop years were considered as a dry season ormvad which confirms that the drought decreases the seepage of nitrates to do not reach aquifers speedily besides the nitrates can take a long time to appear in groundwater depending on the precipitation rate and the depth of water table as well as the presence of silt that can prevent the percolation of nitrates towards doukkala aquifer el achheb 1993 the cations and anions data of the groundwater sampled from doukkala plain are plotted in the piper s diagram piper 1944 fig 9 the obtained results pointed out that the majority of samples are characterized by sodium chloride facies and mixed type facies anions diagram indicates the important concentration of points towards the pole cl with a few wells have shown an so4 2 dominance the cations diagram suggests a remarkable concentration of points towards the sodico potassium pole fig 9 for this purpose a comparison of hydrochemical analysis of groundwater was carried out before the setting up of the second large irrigation scheme more than 25 years in the study performed by el achheb 1993 and that of 2016s the results illustrated a noticeable change in chemical facies which are marked by the regression of calcium chloride sulfate calcium and magnesium calcium chloride facies in favor of sodium chloride facies this water is highly mineralized and their ec reaches more than 5000 μs cm in the majority of wells water facies amendment is a result of water rock interaction besides these facies are representative of water very marked by pollution of anthropic origin i e agricultural activities and irrigation with surface water of high chlorides and sodium concentrations in which the irrigation water rich in chloride and sodium brings a significant amount of salt to the soil solution then to groundwater el achheb 2002 giambastiani et al 2013 fadili et al 2015 4 3 assessment of groundwater suitability for irrigation use the assessment of the water quality and its suitability for irrigation purposes can be determined using different parameters such as ec sodium adsorption ratio sar and sodium percentage na sappa et al 2015 the total concentration of soluble salts can be classified as low ec 250 μs cm medium 250 ec 750 μs cm high 750 ec 2250 μs cm and very high 2250 μs cm ec salinity values in water supplied for irrigation richards 1954 a high concentration of salt in water irrigation or soil will negatively affect crop yields cause soil degradation and groundwater pollution the excessive amounts of exchangeable sodium in the soil replace calcium and magnesium adsorbed on clays and promote the dispersion and swelling of clay minerals as well as affect soil permeability and cause infiltration problems frenkel et al 1978 the soluble sodium percent ssp for groundwater was calculated by using wilcox 1955 equation 2 n a n a 2 k c a 2 m g 2 n a 2 k 100 where the concentrations of ca2 mg2 k and na are expressed in milli equivalents per liter meq l the sodium percentage na in the study area ranges between 22 70 and 86 77 average of 51 92 in groundwater samples and shows four classes of groundwater quality following wilcox 1955 classification which are good permissible doubtful and unsuitable for irrigation purposes representing respectively 11 95 71 70 15 72 and 0 63 of sampled wells rates table 4 following wilcox 1955 classification in previous research studies naseem et al 2010 nasher et al 2013 authors showed that the irrigation with water having a load of soluble sodium higher than 60 may lead to sodium accumulation and therefore destroys soil structure groundwater of doukkala plain shows high to very high content of soluble salts and it can be considered as permissible to unsuitable for irrigation according to the diagram na vs water ec fig 11 the sodium absorption ratio sar indicates the sodium hazard in the irrigation water it is computed by using richards 1954 formula 3 s a r n a 2 1 2 c a 2 m g 2 in the equation sodium calcium and magnesium concentrations are expressed in meq l according to the classification of the united states department of agriculture usda richards 1954 irrigation water with sar 10 meq l regarded as excellent for irrigation sar values ranged from 10 to 18 qualify water as good for irrigation and sar between 18 and 26 meq l indicate that the water is acceptable for irrigation water could be not suitable for irrigation if the sar value exceeds 26 in current study sar values varied from 1 96 to 17 96 meq l in which 85 44 of inspected wells show sar 10 meq l and 14 56 of sampled wells have sar range around 10 18 meq l table 5 fig 12 the results of sar combined to those of ec of groundwater in which low ec 250 μs cm medium 250 ec 750 μs cm high 750 ec 2250 μs cm and very high 2250 μs cm ec water salinity values are affected respectively to the different classes c1 c2 c3 and c4 while the different classes s1 s2 s3 and s4 were determined basing on the sar values and represent respectively 0 sar 10 meq l 10 sar 18 meq l 18 sar 26 meq l and 26 meq l sar the s1 classes indicate water with low sodium and practically there is no risk of exchangeable sodium the s2 classes indicate water with medium sodium and can cause significant risk as well as s3 and s4 classes represent respectively the water with high and very high sodium and can cause damaging levels of exchangeable sodium in the soil consequently this last character produces the undesirable effect on the chemical composition of soil structure by reducing its permeability richards 1954 ayers and westcot 1985 toumi et al 2015 furthermore the projection of the result on ussl 1954 graphic fig 13 shows that the majority of water samples arranged into categories of c3 s1 and c4 s2 while c4 s2 are the dominant categories indicating a wide range of medium high and very high water salinity based on these results it can be suggested that the groundwater of doukkala plain can be graded as inappropriate for use under ordinary conditions but may be used occasionally under very special circumstances if soils are permeable and when the irrigation water is applied in excess to provide considerable leaching and for very salt tolerant crops 5 conclusions the collected and analyzed data during this study provided a portrait of water table fluctuations and an evolution of groundwater quality in the doukkala plain using quality and quantity indicators the analysis of piezometric level fluctuation during the period between 1995 and 2016 showed a level rise of water table in large irrigation schemes from 0 70 to 0 80 m year indeed the return of irrigation water excess is the major factor affecting the fluctuation of doukkala aquifer in irrigated areas in parallel the results revealed a level decline of the water table in rainfed areas and faregh zone from 5 to 10 m as a result of drought as well as groundwater over pumping to support irrigation and public supply purposes besides this study showed that to irrigate 7992 ha of the rainfed area a 69 50 mm3 year of groundwater was pumped during 2016 hence the measurements of wells depth and the calculates of pumped groundwater volume indicate that the main input and output flows of the doukkala aquifer are continuously in imbalance the groundwater quality of doukkala aquifer has also experienced an imbalance at an alarming rate this can be evidenced by the comparison of the analyses results from 1995s to 2016s which showed an increase and expansion of groundwater mineralization confirmed by the water ec values indicating high to very high salinity hazard in most of the wells also the concentrations of most chemical elements as chloride sodium and sulfate exceeded the maximum permissible limit set by who besides high nitrate concentrations were recorded at two locations with a maximum value of 152 10 mg l the potential groundwater quality problems were mostly from agriculture activity as well as disposal of wastewater and household trash without treatment consequently groundwater of doukkal plain is of poor quality and does not meet drinking water quality standards notably in the rural areas where people drink groundwater from their wells besides the hydrochemical analysis indices sar and na confirm that more than 85 of the analyzed groundwater samples were suitable for irrigation purposes only under very special circumstances the current state of doukkala aquifer imposes the treatment of groundwater for the production of drinking water in rural areas and the regular monitoring of sodium and salinity hazard for irrigation purposes there is therefore a need for sustainable management of doukkala aquifer in which the rationalization uses of irrigation water and agricultural inputs as well as regulation of groundwater pumping and waste treatment are a first order approach to protect groundwater as a part of the environment declaration of interests the authors declare that

whereas positive alteration processes plap are present in dense forest degraded forest and wetland with this validation twenty five sites were selected nine sites have negative gwpl change for nlap four sites have positive gwpl change for plap but gwpl change does not found in five sites for the same and low land alteration in rest sites model validation does not agree with gwpl change however other hydrological parameters are more dominated in this change therefore luclca does not only control the gwpl but other thematic parameters are signified the potential level moreover this study also

supplies fresh water resources 34 to human civilization throughout the world dar and dar et al 2010 ghosh et al 2016 murmu et al 2019 in respect to overgrowing population various adverse human activities including inverse climate change uneven spatio temporal water resource distribution unplanned economic development are causes of huge demand for fresh water resource day by day which have makes such harmful effects like water scarcity and groundwater deterioration in different parts of the world ozdemir 2011 patra et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 in indian perspective 230 km3 yr1 annual groundwater extraction biswas et al 2013 comprised on domestic use 90 rural population 50 urban population agriculture 70 and mismanagement of water this amount of water will serve more than 0 6 million people which have led to abruptly falling of groundwater level throughout the country last two decades niti aayog 2018 murmu et al 2019 as a result most of the household 3 4th in india do not have access to portable fresh water with their useable location where world s renewable water resources have only 4 for 18 world s population national water policy 2012 in this context groundwater conservation is important to improve the groundwater prosperity as well as increases of water level by relevant artificial recharge and sustainable utilization at national regional and local level kaliraj et al 2014 maity and mandal 2019 generally groundwater replenishment process in earth aquifer is entirely dependent on surface and subsurface water storage khan and jhariya 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 lamichhane and shakya 2019 rivers lakes and ponds are supplies of surface water storage whereas surface and sub surface runoff are supplies of subsurface storage kaliraj et al 2014 although several hydrological factors like rainfall intensity geomorphological setup drainage density slope elevation geological structure and its formation soil and groundwater recharge level lulc are intensively influenced on ground water potentiality gwpl khan and jhariya 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 haque et al 2020 integrated geospatial techniques of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis are useful tools for the assessment monitoring and management of groundwater resources and also helps to take decision making on the spatial distribution of gwpz including their engineering and environmental fields das et al 2019 jasrotia et al 2019 das and pal 2020 although rs and gis do not directly detect in gwpl but the presence of gwpl is indirectly accessed from different surface features derived from hydrologic thematic attributes i e geology landforms soils land cover and surface water bodies maity and mandal 2019 singh et al 2018 recently several researchers were successfully delineated in gwpzs using rs and gis techniques solomon and quiel 2006 khan and jhariya 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 geospatial techniques are applied to integrate thematic layers such as lithology geomorphology drainage pattern lineament density soil and topographic slope for delineation of gwpzs including their prospective status sreedevi et al 2005 israil et al 2006 dar and dar et al 2010 mahato and pal 2019 multi criteria decision making mcdm model like analytical hierarchical process ahp thomas and duraisamy 2018 patra et al 2017 das and pal 2019 and probabilistic models namely multiple logistic regression mlr kaliraj et al 2014 fuzzy ahp maity and mandal 2019 sahoo et al 2017 frequency ratio fr manap et al 2014 das 2019 are merged with gis technique in the demarcating of groundwater potentiality ahp is one of the suitable techniques of multi criteria decision making mcdm strategy which effectively detects the relative significance of various thematic layers on gwpl maity and mandal 2019 patra et al 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 however studies about the analysis of potential change of groundwater recharge caused by lulc change which is carried out by few researchers jhariya et al 2016 khan and jhariya 2018 patra et al 2018 lamichhane and shakya 2019 previous literature reveals that integration of thematic parameters has more or less influenced on gwpl but fluctuation rate of recharge level has mainly depended on land cover dynamics however from above review of literature two important research gaps are founds 1 how do land use change and land cover alteration luclca process has impacts on groundwater recharge and discharge rate 2 what kinds of land cover alteration processes either negative or positive have influences on gwpl in this context kangsabati basin as a most populated south bengal river basin in india is the most prominent site for those analyses the aim of this paper is therefore to assess the impact of luclca on gwpl change in the kangsabati basin furthermore this research tries to detect effective luclca on gwpl change and also identify water scarcity sites for taking long term action plan 2 study areas kangsabati basin is a tropical plateau fringe basin which started from chotonagpur plateau in jharkhand to inter fluvial site of rupnarayan and kheliaghai basin in lower gangetic plain latitudinal extension in this basin has extended from 21 45 n to 23 30 n and longitudinal extended from 85 45 e to 88 15 e with cove an area of 9658 km2 including three major districts of purulia bankura paschim and purba midnapore in west bengal bhattacharya 2018 hydro meteorological characteristic in this basin basically sub tropical humid nature however maximum rainfall occurs only monsoon season which varies from 1804 mm y to 1077 mm y imd consequently this basin gradually shifted into drought prone site caused by maximum summer temperature lack of water holding capacity in laterite tract and huge evapo transpiration rate respectively mittal et al 2016 hydro geologic setting in this study area is constituted by various stratigraphic units that started from pre cambrian achaeans fractured hard crystalline rocks to younger tertiary quaternary formations porous older alluvium and younger alluvial plains mukhopadhyay 1992 due to presence of thin veneer weathered residuum of hard crystalline strata water level depth in fractured rocks are varies from 2 m bgl to 13 mbgl during pre monsoon season in upper basin during pre monsoon period water level in shallow phreatic aquifers of porous older allurium ranges from 4 m bgl to 10 m bgl due to presence of thick sequence of sand silt and clay in upland laterite tract furthermore water table in deeper aquifers under confined and semi confined strata and piezometric surface are ranges from 5 m bgl to 9 m bgl due to huge younger alluvium deposition water level in alluvial plain ranges from 130 m to 164 m in lower basin cgwb 2008 2014 aquifer system in the entire basin is more diversified characteristic in different hydro geological units each aquifer structure has arranged of upper and lower aquifers under unconfined and confined condition chowdhury et al 2010 ghosh et al 2016 upper aquifer has 40 m bgl water level depth under unconfined condition whereas lower aquifer has 50 m water depth under confined condition granular zone tapped by ldtw which ranges from 12 m to 15 m where 50 m bgl depths considered of 15 25 m3 h water yield in contrary mdtw tapping granular zone ranges from 30 m to 40 m where 200 m bgl depths are considered up to 100 m3 h water yield cgwb 2008 2014 for this study khatra to rajnagar rupnarayan branch and panskura confluence kheliaghai branch has been selected from the kangsabati basin according to geo environmental properties in study area catchment area has been categories into two broad parts as upper basin khatra to lalgarh and lower basin salboni to lowada in fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 generation of thematic layers several hydrological parameters i e land use land cover geology geomorphology soil slope elevation drainage density and groundwater recharge level during post monsoon were used for delineation of gwpzs in the kangsabati basin table 1 wgs 84 datum 30 m spatial resolution of landsat 8 tm oli survey of india soi toposheet map geological survey of india gsi geological map and srtm dem shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model were used to prepare of thematic layers from input parameters and then those are converted into raster format projected under 45 n zone of utm projection for the assessment of gwpl in different lulc two gis software erdas imagine 2010 arcgis10 2 one statistical software spss 19 and global positioning system gps were used to make a correlation between luclca and simulated model result during 2002 2016 in this study overall methodological flow chart has been presented following a systematic manner in fig 2 3 2 weight assignment and geo informatics based modeling using ahp groundwater potential map has been prepared from appropriate weight assignment of geological formation and its structure geomorphic set up soil physical properties drainage density slope with elevation lulc and groundwater recharge level respectively ghosh et al 2016 maity and mandal 2019 patra et al 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 in order of weight assignment individual layers were assigned by the giving of weightage value in respect to their relative dominance on gwpl lamichhane and shakya 2019 analytical hierarchy process ahp was applied to obtain the normal weights from dominant themes and their individual features using saaty s hierarchical order 1980 to compute the final weights from all thematic layers several equation steps were adopted as follows murmu et al 2019 pair wise matrix table also helps to take decision from the respective relative thematic themes under ahp approach sahoo et al 2017 pair wise comparison matrix pcm was obtained from geometric mean of different themes table 2 1 l j i j 1 n c i j where lj refers every column total values from pair wise matrix table cij stand for every criterion assigned number taken from ith row and jth column normalized pair wise matrix was computed as division of every thematic element value by its total column values from matrix table table 3 2 x i j c i j l i j where xij indicate that each value at ith row and jth column is taken from normalized pair wise matrix table this step is involved mainly computation of standard weights as measured by the division of criterion number n with total normalized row values in matrix table using this formula murmu et al 2019 3 w i x i j n where wi means standard weight consistency vector was measured by multiply of two different matrix values from selected thematic layers namely pair wise comparison matrix value and normalized pair wise matrix value muralitharan and palanivel 2015 murmu et al 2019 computation formula of consistence vector as follows 4 λ c i j x i j where λ mean consistency vector level of consistency matrix cl was computed from an order n whereas consistency index was conducted as maity and mandal 2019 sahoo et al 2017 5 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ m a x as the highest matrix eigen value in case any consistence does not found in matrix table so λ m a x will be taken as equal value of n as a result ci will be zero however ci must be depend on n consistence ratio cr was measured from coherence of pair wise comparison as follows kurttila et al 2000 maity and mandal 2019 6 c r c i r i where ri means average consistence index computed from random comparison matrix which is varies from an order to another order saaty 1980 in this case cr 0 1 is considerable acceptance value for consistence matrix whereas all comparison value must be repeated for inconsistence matrix determination then all criteria weights w were computed from consistency ratio cr to integrate of all individual features from each themes using arc gis software integration process was computed as weights assignment in each polygon from eight thematic parameters derived from included polygon weights of two original layers table 4 final integrated layer in each dominated parameters were computed using polygon overlay weightage method muralitharan and palanivel 2015 murmu et al 2019 7 g w p t s w i r where gwpts means groundwater potential total score wi means standard weight of thematic layers and r stand for feature based thematic layers 3 3 integration of thematic layers and assessment of gwpzs according to their relative influence on groundwater potentiality with a scale of 1 9 eight thematic layers were weights assigned hence highest weight assigned denotes more potential and suitable gwpz and lowest weight assigned denotes poor and unsuitable gwpz ghosh et al 2016 maity and mandal 2019 in respect of weight assignment gwpl rank in thematic themes has categorized as very poor below 1 poor 1 2 moderately poor 2 3 5 moderate 3 5 4 moderately good 4 5 good 5 5 5 very good 5 5 6 and excellent above 6 respectively a pair wise comparison matrix was setup to calculate the normalized weights of each theme and their features using saaty s analytical hierarchy process 1980 all of the assigning thematic layers were integrated overlaid to generate different groundwater zones using arc gis 10 2 software therefore groundwater potential index gwpi was derived from integrated weightage values of different polygon layers maity and mandal 2019 das et al 2019 8 g w p i g g w g g w i g m w g m w i g r w g r w i d w d w i s t w s l w s l w i l c w l c w i where gwpi means groundwater potential index gg means geological structure and its formation gm means geomorphological setup gr means groundwater recharge during pre and post monsoon d means drainage density st stand for soil types sl denotes slope with elevation lc refers land use and land cover exponent value of w denotes weight normalization of dominant themes and wi indicates weight normalization of the individual features in each theme 3 4 model validation on groundwater potential zone validation of groundwater potentiality is very necessary to establishment the relationship between groundwater recharge level and gwpzs map maity and mandal 2019 mahato and pal 2019 receiving operating curve roc was applied to determine the validation of groundwater potentiality in order to luclca using well depth water level data from ninety sample sites in kangsabati basin area under curve aoc of roc curve was used to compute the sensitivity of real groundwater recharge level plotted against x and y axes x axis denotes as false positive rates 1 specificity and y axis denotes as sensitivity analysis aoc area presents the goodness of fit from estimated roc value that ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 means as wrong result 0 5 means as worthless results and 1 means as good fit mahato and pal 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrologic thematic layers used in gis ahp analysis 4 1 1 geology with the control of porosity and permeability capabilities of aquifer rocks strata geological structure and its formation plays a vital role to determine the groundwater prospective zones as well as assessment of recharge rate throughout the basin muralitharan and palanivel 2015 maity and mandal 2019 in kangsabati basin fifteen hydro geological structure and sixteen geological formations were obtained from geological quadrangle map 73 n o j fig 3 a and b demonstrated that panskura sijua arambag and lalgarh formation are predominant geological formation in the entire basin whereas mica schist occasionally garnetiferous 36 16 oxidized sand silt and clay with insitu caliche groups 21 14 and laterite tracts 12 are predominant geological structure in this basin in addition mica schists oxidized sand silt clay and hornblende schist have high deformation with foliation that causes of more cracks and low water level 5 10 m in upland laterite soil gsi 2006 chowdhury et al 2010 these structures have been assigned as lowest weightage values for low groundwater prosperity table 4 in contrast floodplain area in upper basin formed by sijua formation with presence of huge oxidized insitu caliche groups which allowed deeper aquifer and moderate water level 15 20 m gsi 2006 das and pal 2020 moreover floodplain area in lower basin composed by panskura formation based on oxidized sand silt clay which allowed huge younger alluvium deposition and maximum depth of water 130 164 m cgwb 2008 2014 chowdhury et al 2010 hence these structures have been given highest weightage value for good groundwater prosperity table 4 it is point that hard crystalline rocks foliation joint planes does not allow good groundwater prosperity but huge alluvial deposition allows good prosperity of potentiality 4 1 2 geomorphology landforms and structural features under geomorphological setup are considered as important indicator to determine the groundwater level and its prospect controlled by subsurface groundwater movement shekhar and pandey 2014 patra et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 geomorphological feature in kangsabati basin is categorized into six units like buried pediments with lateritic capping 24 07 and deep buried pediments 4 89 pediment with laterite capping 5 48 rocky outcrop 27 15 flood plain deposits 25 87 and valley fill deposits 12 52 in fig 3c due to high recharge rate and peak flow of river water during monsoon period flood plain deposits and valley fill deposits both have rich groundwater prosperity that covers as 1466 31 km2 in lower basin in contrast due to hard rock terrain and high surface runoff rocky outcrop and buried pediments with lateritic capping both have poor groundwater prosperity that covers as 1956 18 km2 in upper basin cgwb 2008 2014 moreover deep buried pediment and pediment with laterite capping have moderate groundwater prospect caused by gently undulating plains and less alluvial plan which areal extent of 396 24 km2 according to groundwater prosperity in different geomorphological feature final weights are assigned in table 4 4 1 3 land slope slope variation intensively influenced on water retention capacity and infiltration intensity from precipitation throughout the basin patra et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017 das and pal 2020 in this study there has four kinds of slope category such as good 16 moderate 16 10 moderate poor 10 4 and poor 4 based on slope break points fig 3d e most of the good 0 55 and moderate slope 1 68 categories are observed in rajmahal trap basalt and chotonagpur formation furthermore poor category 74 79 has been extended in flood plain area of arambag and panskura formation near lower basin good class is associated in gentle slope as very good for groundwater storage due to high infiltration rate and low runoff ghosh et al 2016 moderate class is associated in gentle to moderate slope as good water storage for sensible infiltration rate and low runoff whereas moderate poor class is situated in moderate to steep slope as poor water storage for low infiltration and moderate runoff ghosh et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 in addition very poor class is assigned in steep slope for more run off and least infiltration rate shekhar and pandey 2014 assigned weightage values of slope are addresses in table 4 4 1 4 elevation elevation play crucial role to control the stream gradient that determined the groundwater potentiality from highest to lowest altitude per unit area in a drainage basin patra et al 2017 das and pal 2020 elevation range in kangsabati basin has been classified into seven classes i e above 334 m 0 36 250 300 m 2 02 200 250 m 8 73 150 200 m 13 32 100 150 m 18 55 50 100 m 27 27 and 4 50 m 29 72 in fig 3f the altitude in this basin ranges from 6 m murasthi to 397 m jhilimili due to high altitude and less infiltration capacity concentration of low groundwater ranges from 334 m to 250 m above mean sea level amsl of upper basin however maximum concentration has ranges from 50 m to 4m amsl of lower basin caused by huge water logging and low gradient ratio in lower basin cgwb 2008 2014 therefore different weightage values are given in different elevation table 4 4 1 5 drainage density drainage density in an area reflects the surface runoff and permeable capacity of underlying rock strata which plays crucial role in assessing of groundwater potentiality avinash et al 2014 based on inverse relationship between permeability and drainage density less permeable rock tends to be high drainage density promotes as low infiltration rate and more permeable rock promotes low drainage density and vice versa shekhar and pandey 2014 murmu et al 2019 drainage density d in kangsabati basin is divided into five class a 0 21 0 58 km km2 37 39 b 0 59 0 97 km km2 25 21 c 0 98 1 4 km km2 13 67 d 1 5 1 9 km km2 15 98 and e 2 2 6 km km2 7 73 fig 3g showed that d values are range from 0 37 km km2 to 1 78 km km2 maximum sites in this basin have resistant less permeable rocks stratum under medium and dense vegetation cover with moderate relief higher density class concentrated in upper basin for less permeable rocks strata whereas low density class concentrated in the entire lower basin for more permeable alluvium valley fill deposition therefore weightage values are given in five different density classes table 4 4 1 6 soil occurrence of groundwater recharge is entirely dependent on soil physical properties that are directly related with infiltration and permeability rate in a drainage basin where more permeability rate associated in coarse texture soil and low permeability rate is associated in finer texture soil ghosh et al 2016 patra et al 2017 das and pal 2020 dominant soils in kangsabati basin are fine loamy type haplustafs 21 52 fine aeric ochraquepts 15 93 and fine loamy ulti paleustalfs 9 47 out of sixteen textural soil covers bhattacharya et al 2019 fine loamy type haplustafs 599 32 km2 loamy skeletal lethic ustorthents 281 47 km2 are mostly found in upper basin khatra raipur lalgarh whereas very fine vertic haplaquepts 345 67 km2 and fine vertic ochraqualfs 201 2 km2 are mostly found in lower basin kapastikri and panskura fig 3h due to high infiltration capacity and low runoff potentiality hence sandy clay loam soil yellowish brown clay laomy soil and fine aeric ochraqualfs soil are given maximum weights while fine loamy type haplustafs and loamy skeletal lethic ustorthents are given minimum weights for their least infiltration rate and more runoff potentiality table 4 4 1 7 land use land cover analysis using kappa statistic occurrence and development of groundwater prosperity has largely influenced by substantial land use land cover change younis and ammar 2018 khan and jhariya 2018 patra et al 2018 lamichhane and shakya 2019 land use types are distinctly governed by laterite upland rocky outcrop and dense forest in upper basin followed by degraded forest and mono crop land in middle basin and intensive settlement density double crop land along with water bodies in lower kangsabati basin bhattacharya et al 2020 laterite cover play significant role to control the movement of water through cracks and its join to deeper stratum in kangsabati basin ghosh et al 2016 settlement site prevents to penetrate water to reach groundwater reservoirs dar and dar et al 2010 khan and jhariya 2018 maximum rate of evaporation is seen in crop area which led less chance in percolation rate to the subsurface layers patra et al 2017 roy et al 2019 therefore river water inland water bare land wet land and dense forest are given the higher weights of gwpl while lower weights are assigned to settlement degraded forest crop land fallow land and laterite cover respectively table 4 in this study nine different lulc names as crop land degraded forest dense forest and fallow land laterite out crop water body bare land settlement vegetation and wet land were prepared from landsat images during 2002 and 2016 using supervised classification maximum likelihood classifier fig 4 a b for this validation kappa statistics was applied to compute the overall accuracy of error matrices lamichhane and shakya 2019 overall accuracy is 0 93 with 94 03 for the image of 2002 whereas it becomes 0 95 with 96 44 of 2016 image change analyses of nine lulcs are computed from table 5 2002 and table 6 2016 maximum positive change occurs in crop land 334 km2 inland water 97 km2 and fallow land 51 km2 while maximum negative change occurs in dense forest 221 km2 bare land 139 km2 and degraded forest 82 km2 4 1 8 groundwater depth during pre and post monsoon season 2002 2016 fluctuation of water depth level is assessed from unconfined and semi confined aquifer during pre and post monsoon season sahoo et al 2017 movement of groundwater recharge level in the entire basin is estimated using local polynomial interpolation method patra et al 2017 das et al 2019 spatial distribution of groundwater depth in this study area is divided into six classes i e a excellent above 4 7 m bgl b very good 4 2 4 7 m bgl c good 3 8 4 1 m bgl d moderate 3 2 3 7 m bgl e poor 2 8 3 1 m bgl and f very poor below 2 7 m bgl moderate to very poor of water depth levels are found in patamda banduan and jhilimili of upper basin while very god to moderate water depth levels are found in keshpur narajole and tabageria of lower basin during 2002 2016 fig 5 a d in addition of change analysis between 2002 and 2016 water depth level drastically decreases in upper basin but depth level gradually increases in lower basin therefore maximum weights are given in excellent to good recharge level while minimum weights are given in poor to very poor recharge level table 4 4 2 spatial delineation and assessment of groundwater potential zone at lulc level saaty s ahp model was applied for the delineation of gwpzs in kangsabati basin using integrated thematic layers and their features from 2002 to 2016 gwpzs are classified into three class i e high medium and low potential class fig 6 a b most of the potential zones are concerned in high and medium potential class 3685 km2 than low potential class 117 km2 during 2002 whereas low potential zone is poorly concentrated 621 km2 than high and medium potential zone 3176 km2 during 2016 table 7 so maximum fluctuation of potentiality is observed in lower class increases of 13 27 however higher class extremely fall down of 13 11 between 2002 and 2016 gwpl is varies from one land use to another land use pattern in the entire kangsabati basin chowdhury et al 2010 maity and mandal 2019 land use change has highly impacts on groundwater potentiality younis and ammar 2018 patra et al 2018 lamichhane and shakya 2019 fig 7 showing the fluctuation of gwpl of the study area which classified into four categorical changes namely negative high negative low no change and positive low and high change high positive change has concentrated in lower potential class 13 25 while high negative change has concentrated in higher potential class 13 03 during 2002 2016 table 7 positive land use change highly occurs in crop land 9 and fallow land 2 while negative fluctuation rate is also shown in bare land 57 67 crop land 38 73 laterite out crop 29 and fallow land 25 6 in contrast negative land use change occurs in dense forest 6 01 and degraded forest 3 while positive fluctuation rate is shown in dense forest 2 and degraded forest respectively however crop land laterite outcrop settlement fallow land and bare lands are major lulc hence they are acted as negative holder of groundwater potentiality on the other hand rest types of lulc namely dense forest degraded forest river water wet land and inland water are considered as positive holder of potentiality 4 3 validation of this analytical model in this study ninety tube well samples were used to fulfill the goal as signified the relation between recharge level and gwpl in each lulc change from 2002 to 2016 auc value in roc varies from 0 777 2002 to 0 835 2016 in fig 8 moreover prediction accuracy during 2002 77 72 and 2016 83 5 have significant level following curve values roc results demonstrated that ahp model is successfully predicted power on groundwater potentiality incorporate with lulc change table 8 according to well data sets groundwater levels are stabilized at 4 705 m during pre monsoon season but it drop down up to 2 52 m during post monsoon in inland water whereas maximum groundwater level reaches up to 7 495 m in river bed in the entire downstream fig 5a b in order to lulc maximum groundwater lowering is seen at 3 675 m pre monsoon in laterite out crop but recharge level fall down at 3 m post monsoon therefore it is point that maximum water level lowering has occurs in laterite out crop whereas rising water level occurs in river bed wet land and inland water 4 4 land use change and land cover alteration luclca and its impact on gwpl change after the computation of geometric mean and normalized weight on input thematic multiple datasets for the analysis of hierarchical process chowdhury et al 2010 sahoo et al 2017 maity and mandal 2019 pcm was used to establish the correlation between land cover alteration and gwpl in this study seven land alteration processes name as laterite out crop alteration degraded forest alteration crop land alteration fallow land alteration bare land alteration and settlement with vegetation alteration are considered for effective alteration processes during 2002 2016 fig 9 a g due to small spatial extent inland water wet land and river water does not consider in this land alteration process but rests of land covers are consider for alteration process bhattacharya et al 2020 fig 9a demonstrated that most of the significance alteration processes in laterite out crop are wetland r 0 74 degraded forest to crop land r 0 84 dense forest to laterite out crop r 0 96 bare land to river water r 0 89 and dense forest to fallow land r 0 56 fig 9b demonstrated that alteration process of degraded forest has been significant in crop land r 0 79 dense forest r 0 78 fallow land r 0 81 laterite out crop r 0 66 dense forest r 0 62 to inland water r 0 84 laterite out crop r 0 93 fallow land to laterite out crop r 0 93 degraded forest to dense forest r 0 87 laterite out crop r 0 85 r 0 69 and fallow land r 0 86 in crop land are significant alteration process fig 9c on the other hand crop land r 0 72 degraded forest r 0 91 laterite out crop r 0 68 in dense forest are significant land cover alteration processes whereas crop land to settlement r 0 79 degraded forest to laterite out crop r 0 97 in fallow land alteration processes have significant correlation fig 9d e land alteration of bare land has significant correlation with crop land r 0 85 degraded forest r 0 77 settlement r 0 96 fallow land r 0 66 and laterite out crop r 0 69 fig 9f one of the remarkable land alteration processes in this basin is settlement alteration process degraded forest r 0 97 dense forest r 0 97 fallow land r 0 59 laterite out crop r 0 79 have significant correlation in crop land alteration under settlement alteration process dense forest r 0 98 fallow land r 0 59 laterite out crop r 0 81 in degraded forest alteration process have negative correlation with settlement alteration process in fig 9g it can be said that laterite out crop fallow land settlement and crop land have nlap on the gwpl due to resisting of groundwater recharge and over water utilization table 9 on the other hand dense forest degraded forest and wet land have plap on potential level due to penetrating of surface runoff and groundwater recharge as a result groundwater potentiality gradually increases in these land covers throughout the basin in term of model accuracy assessment of gwpl change on luclca during post monsoon season twenty five sites s1 25 were selected in the entire study area groundwater recharge level at s1 binpur s19 raniband s25 jhilimili are drastically reduces in the year of 2002 and 2016 in contrast recharge level at s6 jhilimili s10 khatra s14 mohanpur tw s21 routhkhunda are slightly increases in the year of 2002 and 2016 table 9 according to luclca nlap are mostly found in s1 laterite outcrop to laterite outcrop s19 settlement with vegetation to crop land s3 dense forest to degraded forest whereas plap are mostly found in s6 crop land to degraded forest s10 crop land to river water s14 settlement to river water and s21 crop land to degraded forest rest of sites such as s5 harda s8 keshpur s17 pirargaril s22 salboni have negative change of groundwater recharge level caused by laterite out crop alteration in addition no groundwater potential changes are founds in s3 dherua s9 kharkasul s11 ledhapukor s16 panchgeria s20 rahmandal caused by lower alteration of laterite outcrop s3 s16 wetland s20 fallow land s9 and same alteration of degraded forest s11 respectively on the other hand ahp predicted groundwater potential change does not agree with recharge level during post monsoon period in selected sites like s2 dahijuri s4 gorabari s7 kechanda s15 murasthi s18 raipur s23 sarenga and s24 sukhadali based on sample sites location s7 18 23 and 24 are situated in upper basin where thematic parameters namely mahadeva formation buried pediment with laterite capping landforms feature moderate ground slope and high drainage density are governs the lowering of recharge level during post monsoon period table 9 in contrast s15 is situated in lower basin where thematic parameters like arambag formation flood plain deposits low ground slope and low drainage density are helps to increases of recharge level during post monsoon period despite such sites location in upper and lower basin plap and nlap are leads to inverse change on recharge level in the entire basin moreover maximum sites in upper basin falls under low potential level due to huge presence of nlap whereas maximum sites in lower basin falls under high potential level caused by higher association of plap this result demonstrated that luclca does not only crucial factor but also others thematic parameters play vital role to determine the potential level in the entire basin 5 conclusions to determine the impact of land use change and land cover alteration on groundwater potential zone integrated geospatial techniques and ahp method were applied for delineation of groundwater potential zone in the entire kangsabati basin taking such thematic parameters namely geology geomorphology slope elevation soil lulc groundwater recharge level potential zone in this study area has been classified into three zones i e high moderate and low hence in the year 2002 three zones are covers as 48 03 48 81 and 3 097 in the year 2016 three zones are covers as 29 65 52 75 and 17 59 respectively it is found that the kangsabati basin has experienced extensive changes in land use and alteration in land covers than others thematic parameters in order of fluctuation rate from 2002 to 2016 negative land use change and land cover alteration processes like fallow land laterite out crop crop land settlement and fallow land are helps to declining of higher potential zone 490 km2 consequently increases the lower potential zone 505 km2 furthermore positive land use change and land cover alteration processes like dense forest and degraded forest are sustaining the middle potential zone 1856 km2 1828 km2 moreover according to validation of sample sites there has such sites does not support that land use change does not only has significance role but also other hydrological thematic parameters play crucial role for delineation of potential level more importantly this study also helps to planner for the determination of correlation between land use change and potential level which suggested such sustainable land use patterns for conservation of potential level

12047,land use land cover change continuously occurs at locally regionally and globally over the last few decades for excessive demand of mankind this change creates adverse effects on groundwater potential level gwpl due to interruption of recharge process hence this study has attempt to assess the impact of land use change and land cover alteration luclca on gwpl furthermore to find out such effective land alteration processes in kangsabati basin india hydrological parameters were taken for delineation of groundwater potential zones gwpzs using saaty s analytical hierarchy process ahp whereas pearson correlation matrix pcm was used to determine the effective luclca processes on gwpl change results revealed that high gwpz decreases from 1828 km2 to 1333 km2 but low gwpz increases from 117 km2 to 622 km2 during 2002 and 2016 in order of gwpl change pcm demonstrated that negative land alteration processes nlap are present in laterite outcrop fallow land settlement and cropland whereas positive alteration processes plap are present in dense forest degraded forest and wetland with this validation twenty five sites were selected nine sites have negative gwpl change for nlap four sites have positive gwpl change for plap but gwpl change does not found in five sites for the same and low land alteration in rest sites model validation does not agree with gwpl change however other hydrological parameters are more dominated in this change therefore luclca does not only control the gwpl but other thematic parameters are signified the potential level moreover this study also helps the planner to predict sustainable land use management for groundwater conservation graphical abstract image 1 keywords land use change and land cover alteration luclca groundwater potentiality

supplies fresh water resources 34 to human civilization throughout the world dar and dar et al 2010 ghosh et al 2016 murmu et al 2019 in respect to overgrowing population various adverse human activities including inverse climate change uneven spatio temporal water resource distribution unplanned economic development are causes of huge demand for fresh water resource day by day which have makes such harmful effects like water scarcity and groundwater deterioration in different parts of the world ozdemir 2011 patra et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 in indian perspective 230 km3 yr1 annual groundwater extraction biswas et al 2013 comprised on domestic use 90 rural population 50 urban population agriculture 70 and mismanagement of water this amount of water will serve more than 0 6 million people which have led to abruptly falling of groundwater level throughout the country last two decades niti aayog 2018 murmu et al 2019 as a result most of the household 3 4th in india do not have access to portable fresh water with their useable location where world s renewable water resources have only 4 for 18 world s population national water policy 2012 in this context groundwater conservation is important to improve the groundwater prosperity as well as increases of water level by relevant artificial recharge and sustainable utilization at national regional and local level kaliraj et al 2014 maity and mandal 2019 generally groundwater replenishment process in earth aquifer is entirely dependent on surface and subsurface water storage khan and jhariya 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 lamichhane and shakya 2019 rivers lakes and ponds are supplies of surface water storage whereas surface and sub surface runoff are supplies of subsurface storage kaliraj et al 2014 although several hydrological factors like rainfall intensity geomorphological setup drainage density slope elevation geological structure and its formation soil and groundwater recharge level lulc are intensively influenced on ground water potentiality gwpl khan and jhariya 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 haque et al 2020 integrated geospatial techniques of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis are useful tools for the assessment monitoring and management of groundwater resources and also helps to take decision making on the spatial distribution of gwpz including their engineering and environmental fields das et al 2019 jasrotia et al 2019 das and pal 2020 although rs and gis do not directly detect in gwpl but the presence of gwpl is indirectly accessed from different surface features derived from hydrologic thematic attributes i e geology landforms soils land cover and surface water bodies maity and mandal 2019 singh et al 2018 recently several researchers were successfully delineated in gwpzs using rs and gis techniques solomon and quiel 2006 khan and jhariya 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 geospatial techniques are applied to integrate thematic layers such as lithology geomorphology drainage pattern lineament density soil and topographic slope for delineation of gwpzs including their prospective status sreedevi et al 2005 israil et al 2006 dar and dar et al 2010 mahato and pal 2019 multi criteria decision making mcdm model like analytical hierarchical process ahp thomas and duraisamy 2018 patra et al 2017 das and pal 2019 and probabilistic models namely multiple logistic regression mlr kaliraj et al 2014 fuzzy ahp maity and mandal 2019 sahoo et al 2017 frequency ratio fr manap et al 2014 das 2019 are merged with gis technique in the demarcating of groundwater potentiality ahp is one of the suitable techniques of multi criteria decision making mcdm strategy which effectively detects the relative significance of various thematic layers on gwpl maity and mandal 2019 patra et al 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 however studies about the analysis of potential change of groundwater recharge caused by lulc change which is carried out by few researchers jhariya et al 2016 khan and jhariya 2018 patra et al 2018 lamichhane and shakya 2019 previous literature reveals that integration of thematic parameters has more or less influenced on gwpl but fluctuation rate of recharge level has mainly depended on land cover dynamics however from above review of literature two important research gaps are founds 1 how do land use change and land cover alteration luclca process has impacts on groundwater recharge and discharge rate 2 what kinds of land cover alteration processes either negative or positive have influences on gwpl in this context kangsabati basin as a most populated south bengal river basin in india is the most prominent site for those analyses the aim of this paper is therefore to assess the impact of luclca on gwpl change in the kangsabati basin furthermore this research tries to detect effective luclca on gwpl change and also identify water scarcity sites for taking long term action plan 2 study areas kangsabati basin is a tropical plateau fringe basin which started from chotonagpur plateau in jharkhand to inter fluvial site of rupnarayan and kheliaghai basin in lower gangetic plain latitudinal extension in this basin has extended from 21 45 n to 23 30 n and longitudinal extended from 85 45 e to 88 15 e with cove an area of 9658 km2 including three major districts of purulia bankura paschim and purba midnapore in west bengal bhattacharya 2018 hydro meteorological characteristic in this basin basically sub tropical humid nature however maximum rainfall occurs only monsoon season which varies from 1804 mm y to 1077 mm y imd consequently this basin gradually shifted into drought prone site caused by maximum summer temperature lack of water holding capacity in laterite tract and huge evapo transpiration rate respectively mittal et al 2016 hydro geologic setting in this study area is constituted by various stratigraphic units that started from pre cambrian achaeans fractured hard crystalline rocks to younger tertiary quaternary formations porous older alluvium and younger alluvial plains mukhopadhyay 1992 due to presence of thin veneer weathered residuum of hard crystalline strata water level depth in fractured rocks are varies from 2 m bgl to 13 mbgl during pre monsoon season in upper basin during pre monsoon period water level in shallow phreatic aquifers of porous older allurium ranges from 4 m bgl to 10 m bgl due to presence of thick sequence of sand silt and clay in upland laterite tract furthermore water table in deeper aquifers under confined and semi confined strata and piezometric surface are ranges from 5 m bgl to 9 m bgl due to huge younger alluvium deposition water level in alluvial plain ranges from 130 m to 164 m in lower basin cgwb 2008 2014 aquifer system in the entire basin is more diversified characteristic in different hydro geological units each aquifer structure has arranged of upper and lower aquifers under unconfined and confined condition chowdhury et al 2010 ghosh et al 2016 upper aquifer has 40 m bgl water level depth under unconfined condition whereas lower aquifer has 50 m water depth under confined condition granular zone tapped by ldtw which ranges from 12 m to 15 m where 50 m bgl depths considered of 15 25 m3 h water yield in contrary mdtw tapping granular zone ranges from 30 m to 40 m where 200 m bgl depths are considered up to 100 m3 h water yield cgwb 2008 2014 for this study khatra to rajnagar rupnarayan branch and panskura confluence kheliaghai branch has been selected from the kangsabati basin according to geo environmental properties in study area catchment area has been categories into two broad parts as upper basin khatra to lalgarh and lower basin salboni to lowada in fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 generation of thematic layers several hydrological parameters i e land use land cover geology geomorphology soil slope elevation drainage density and groundwater recharge level during post monsoon were used for delineation of gwpzs in the kangsabati basin table 1 wgs 84 datum 30 m spatial resolution of landsat 8 tm oli survey of india soi toposheet map geological survey of india gsi geological map and srtm dem shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model were used to prepare of thematic layers from input parameters and then those are converted into raster format projected under 45 n zone of utm projection for the assessment of gwpl in different lulc two gis software erdas imagine 2010 arcgis10 2 one statistical software spss 19 and global positioning system gps were used to make a correlation between luclca and simulated model result during 2002 2016 in this study overall methodological flow chart has been presented following a systematic manner in fig 2 3 2 weight assignment and geo informatics based modeling using ahp groundwater potential map has been prepared from appropriate weight assignment of geological formation and its structure geomorphic set up soil physical properties drainage density slope with elevation lulc and groundwater recharge level respectively ghosh et al 2016 maity and mandal 2019 patra et al 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 in order of weight assignment individual layers were assigned by the giving of weightage value in respect to their relative dominance on gwpl lamichhane and shakya 2019 analytical hierarchy process ahp was applied to obtain the normal weights from dominant themes and their individual features using saaty s hierarchical order 1980 to compute the final weights from all thematic layers several equation steps were adopted as follows murmu et al 2019 pair wise matrix table also helps to take decision from the respective relative thematic themes under ahp approach sahoo et al 2017 pair wise comparison matrix pcm was obtained from geometric mean of different themes table 2 1 l j i j 1 n c i j where lj refers every column total values from pair wise matrix table cij stand for every criterion assigned number taken from ith row and jth column normalized pair wise matrix was computed as division of every thematic element value by its total column values from matrix table table 3 2 x i j c i j l i j where xij indicate that each value at ith row and jth column is taken from normalized pair wise matrix table this step is involved mainly computation of standard weights as measured by the division of criterion number n with total normalized row values in matrix table using this formula murmu et al 2019 3 w i x i j n where wi means standard weight consistency vector was measured by multiply of two different matrix values from selected thematic layers namely pair wise comparison matrix value and normalized pair wise matrix value muralitharan and palanivel 2015 murmu et al 2019 computation formula of consistence vector as follows 4 λ c i j x i j where λ mean consistency vector level of consistency matrix cl was computed from an order n whereas consistency index was conducted as maity and mandal 2019 sahoo et al 2017 5 c i λ m a x n n 1 where λ m a x as the highest matrix eigen value in case any consistence does not found in matrix table so λ m a x will be taken as equal value of n as a result ci will be zero however ci must be depend on n consistence ratio cr was measured from coherence of pair wise comparison as follows kurttila et al 2000 maity and mandal 2019 6 c r c i r i where ri means average consistence index computed from random comparison matrix which is varies from an order to another order saaty 1980 in this case cr 0 1 is considerable acceptance value for consistence matrix whereas all comparison value must be repeated for inconsistence matrix determination then all criteria weights w were computed from consistency ratio cr to integrate of all individual features from each themes using arc gis software integration process was computed as weights assignment in each polygon from eight thematic parameters derived from included polygon weights of two original layers table 4 final integrated layer in each dominated parameters were computed using polygon overlay weightage method muralitharan and palanivel 2015 murmu et al 2019 7 g w p t s w i r where gwpts means groundwater potential total score wi means standard weight of thematic layers and r stand for feature based thematic layers 3 3 integration of thematic layers and assessment of gwpzs according to their relative influence on groundwater potentiality with a scale of 1 9 eight thematic layers were weights assigned hence highest weight assigned denotes more potential and suitable gwpz and lowest weight assigned denotes poor and unsuitable gwpz ghosh et al 2016 maity and mandal 2019 in respect of weight assignment gwpl rank in thematic themes has categorized as very poor below 1 poor 1 2 moderately poor 2 3 5 moderate 3 5 4 moderately good 4 5 good 5 5 5 very good 5 5 6 and excellent above 6 respectively a pair wise comparison matrix was setup to calculate the normalized weights of each theme and their features using saaty s analytical hierarchy process 1980 all of the assigning thematic layers were integrated overlaid to generate different groundwater zones using arc gis 10 2 software therefore groundwater potential index gwpi was derived from integrated weightage values of different polygon layers maity and mandal 2019 das et al 2019 8 g w p i g g w g g w i g m w g m w i g r w g r w i d w d w i s t w s l w s l w i l c w l c w i where gwpi means groundwater potential index gg means geological structure and its formation gm means geomorphological setup gr means groundwater recharge during pre and post monsoon d means drainage density st stand for soil types sl denotes slope with elevation lc refers land use and land cover exponent value of w denotes weight normalization of dominant themes and wi indicates weight normalization of the individual features in each theme 3 4 model validation on groundwater potential zone validation of groundwater potentiality is very necessary to establishment the relationship between groundwater recharge level and gwpzs map maity and mandal 2019 mahato and pal 2019 receiving operating curve roc was applied to determine the validation of groundwater potentiality in order to luclca using well depth water level data from ninety sample sites in kangsabati basin area under curve aoc of roc curve was used to compute the sensitivity of real groundwater recharge level plotted against x and y axes x axis denotes as false positive rates 1 specificity and y axis denotes as sensitivity analysis aoc area presents the goodness of fit from estimated roc value that ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 means as wrong result 0 5 means as worthless results and 1 means as good fit mahato and pal 2019 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrologic thematic layers used in gis ahp analysis 4 1 1 geology with the control of porosity and permeability capabilities of aquifer rocks strata geological structure and its formation plays a vital role to determine the groundwater prospective zones as well as assessment of recharge rate throughout the basin muralitharan and palanivel 2015 maity and mandal 2019 in kangsabati basin fifteen hydro geological structure and sixteen geological formations were obtained from geological quadrangle map 73 n o j fig 3 a and b demonstrated that panskura sijua arambag and lalgarh formation are predominant geological formation in the entire basin whereas mica schist occasionally garnetiferous 36 16 oxidized sand silt and clay with insitu caliche groups 21 14 and laterite tracts 12 are predominant geological structure in this basin in addition mica schists oxidized sand silt clay and hornblende schist have high deformation with foliation that causes of more cracks and low water level 5 10 m in upland laterite soil gsi 2006 chowdhury et al 2010 these structures have been assigned as lowest weightage values for low groundwater prosperity table 4 in contrast floodplain area in upper basin formed by sijua formation with presence of huge oxidized insitu caliche groups which allowed deeper aquifer and moderate water level 15 20 m gsi 2006 das and pal 2020 moreover floodplain area in lower basin composed by panskura formation based on oxidized sand silt clay which allowed huge younger alluvium deposition and maximum depth of water 130 164 m cgwb 2008 2014 chowdhury et al 2010 hence these structures have been given highest weightage value for good groundwater prosperity table 4 it is point that hard crystalline rocks foliation joint planes does not allow good groundwater prosperity but huge alluvial deposition allows good prosperity of potentiality 4 1 2 geomorphology landforms and structural features under geomorphological setup are considered as important indicator to determine the groundwater level and its prospect controlled by subsurface groundwater movement shekhar and pandey 2014 patra et al 2017 murmu et al 2019 geomorphological feature in kangsabati basin is categorized into six units like buried pediments with lateritic capping 24 07 and deep buried pediments 4 89 pediment with laterite capping 5 48 rocky outcrop 27 15 flood plain deposits 25 87 and valley fill deposits 12 52 in fig 3c due to high recharge rate and peak flow of river water during monsoon period flood plain deposits and valley fill deposits both have rich groundwater prosperity that covers as 1466 31 km2 in lower basin in contrast due to hard rock terrain and high surface runoff rocky outcrop and buried pediments with lateritic capping both have poor groundwater prosperity that covers as 1956 18 km2 in upper basin cgwb 2008 2014 moreover deep buried pediment and pediment with laterite capping have moderate groundwater prospect caused by gently undulating plains and less alluvial plan which areal extent of 396 24 km2 according to groundwater prosperity in different geomorphological feature final weights are assigned in table 4 4 1 3 land slope slope variation intensively influenced on water retention capacity and infiltration intensity from precipitation throughout the basin patra et al 2017 sahoo et al 2017 das and pal 2020 in this study there has four kinds of slope category such as good 16 moderate 16 10 moderate poor 10 4 and poor 4 based on slope break points fig 3d e most of the good 0 55 and moderate slope 1 68 categories are observed in rajmahal trap basalt and chotonagpur formation furthermore poor category 74 79 has been extended in flood plain area of arambag and panskura formation near lower basin good class is associated in gentle slope as very good for groundwater storage due to high infiltration rate and low runoff ghosh et al 2016 moderate class is associated in gentle to moderate slope as good water storage for sensible infiltration rate and low runoff whereas moderate poor class is situated in moderate to steep slope as poor water storage for low infiltration and moderate runoff ghosh et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 in addition very poor class is assigned in steep slope for more run off and least infiltration rate shekhar and pandey 2014 assigned weightage values of slope are addresses in table 4 4 1 4 elevation elevation play crucial role to control the stream gradient that determined the groundwater potentiality from highest to lowest altitude per unit area in a drainage basin patra et al 2017 das and pal 2020 elevation range in kangsabati basin has been classified into seven classes i e above 334 m 0 36 250 300 m 2 02 200 250 m 8 73 150 200 m 13 32 100 150 m 18 55 50 100 m 27 27 and 4 50 m 29 72 in fig 3f the altitude in this basin ranges from 6 m murasthi to 397 m jhilimili due to high altitude and less infiltration capacity concentration of low groundwater ranges from 334 m to 250 m above mean sea level amsl of upper basin however maximum concentration has ranges from 50 m to 4m amsl of lower basin caused by huge water logging and low gradient ratio in lower basin cgwb 2008 2014 therefore different weightage values are given in different elevation table 4 4 1 5 drainage density drainage density in an area reflects the surface runoff and permeable capacity of underlying rock strata which plays crucial role in assessing of groundwater potentiality avinash et al 2014 based on inverse relationship between permeability and drainage density less permeable rock tends to be high drainage density promotes as low infiltration rate and more permeable rock promotes low drainage density and vice versa shekhar and pandey 2014 murmu et al 2019 drainage density d in kangsabati basin is divided into five class a 0 21 0 58 km km2 37 39 b 0 59 0 97 km km2 25 21 c 0 98 1 4 km km2 13 67 d 1 5 1 9 km km2 15 98 and e 2 2 6 km km2 7 73 fig 3g showed that d values are range from 0 37 km km2 to 1 78 km km2 maximum sites in this basin have resistant less permeable rocks stratum under medium and dense vegetation cover with moderate relief higher density class concentrated in upper basin for less permeable rocks strata whereas low density class concentrated in the entire lower basin for more permeable alluvium valley fill deposition therefore weightage values are given in five different density classes table 4 4 1 6 soil occurrence of groundwater recharge is entirely dependent on soil physical properties that are directly related with infiltration and permeability rate in a drainage basin where more permeability rate associated in coarse texture soil and low permeability rate is associated in finer texture soil ghosh et al 2016 patra et al 2017 das and pal 2020 dominant soils in kangsabati basin are fine loamy type haplustafs 21 52 fine aeric ochraquepts 15 93 and fine loamy ulti paleustalfs 9 47 out of sixteen textural soil covers bhattacharya et al 2019 fine loamy type haplustafs 599 32 km2 loamy skeletal lethic ustorthents 281 47 km2 are mostly found in upper basin khatra raipur lalgarh whereas very fine vertic haplaquepts 345 67 km2 and fine vertic ochraqualfs 201 2 km2 are mostly found in lower basin kapastikri and panskura fig 3h due to high infiltration capacity and low runoff potentiality hence sandy clay loam soil yellowish brown clay laomy soil and fine aeric ochraqualfs soil are given maximum weights while fine loamy type haplustafs and loamy skeletal lethic ustorthents are given minimum weights for their least infiltration rate and more runoff potentiality table 4 4 1 7 land use land cover analysis using kappa statistic occurrence and development of groundwater prosperity has largely influenced by substantial land use land cover change younis and ammar 2018 khan and jhariya 2018 patra et al 2018 lamichhane and shakya 2019 land use types are distinctly governed by laterite upland rocky outcrop and dense forest in upper basin followed by degraded forest and mono crop land in middle basin and intensive settlement density double crop land along with water bodies in lower kangsabati basin bhattacharya et al 2020 laterite cover play significant role to control the movement of water through cracks and its join to deeper stratum in kangsabati basin ghosh et al 2016 settlement site prevents to penetrate water to reach groundwater reservoirs dar and dar et al 2010 khan and jhariya 2018 maximum rate of evaporation is seen in crop area which led less chance in percolation rate to the subsurface layers patra et al 2017 roy et al 2019 therefore river water inland water bare land wet land and dense forest are given the higher weights of gwpl while lower weights are assigned to settlement degraded forest crop land fallow land and laterite cover respectively table 4 in this study nine different lulc names as crop land degraded forest dense forest and fallow land laterite out crop water body bare land settlement vegetation and wet land were prepared from landsat images during 2002 and 2016 using supervised classification maximum likelihood classifier fig 4 a b for this validation kappa statistics was applied to compute the overall accuracy of error matrices lamichhane and shakya 2019 overall accuracy is 0 93 with 94 03 for the image of 2002 whereas it becomes 0 95 with 96 44 of 2016 image change analyses of nine lulcs are computed from table 5 2002 and table 6 2016 maximum positive change occurs in crop land 334 km2 inland water 97 km2 and fallow land 51 km2 while maximum negative change occurs in dense forest 221 km2 bare land 139 km2 and degraded forest 82 km2 4 1 8 groundwater depth during pre and post monsoon season 2002 2016 fluctuation of water depth level is assessed from unconfined and semi confined aquifer during pre and post monsoon season sahoo et al 2017 movement of groundwater recharge level in the entire basin is estimated using local polynomial interpolation method patra et al 2017 das et al 2019 spatial distribution of groundwater depth in this study area is divided into six classes i e a excellent above 4 7 m bgl b very good 4 2 4 7 m bgl c good 3 8 4 1 m bgl d moderate 3 2 3 7 m bgl e poor 2 8 3 1 m bgl and f very poor below 2 7 m bgl moderate to very poor of water depth levels are found in patamda banduan and jhilimili of upper basin while very god to moderate water depth levels are found in keshpur narajole and tabageria of lower basin during 2002 2016 fig 5 a d in addition of change analysis between 2002 and 2016 water depth level drastically decreases in upper basin but depth level gradually increases in lower basin therefore maximum weights are given in excellent to good recharge level while minimum weights are given in poor to very poor recharge level table 4 4 2 spatial delineation and assessment of groundwater potential zone at lulc level saaty s ahp model was applied for the delineation of gwpzs in kangsabati basin using integrated thematic layers and their features from 2002 to 2016 gwpzs are classified into three class i e high medium and low potential class fig 6 a b most of the potential zones are concerned in high and medium potential class 3685 km2 than low potential class 117 km2 during 2002 whereas low potential zone is poorly concentrated 621 km2 than high and medium potential zone 3176 km2 during 2016 table 7 so maximum fluctuation of potentiality is observed in lower class increases of 13 27 however higher class extremely fall down of 13 11 between 2002 and 2016 gwpl is varies from one land use to another land use pattern in the entire kangsabati basin chowdhury et al 2010 maity and mandal 2019 land use change has highly impacts on groundwater potentiality younis and ammar 2018 patra et al 2018 lamichhane and shakya 2019 fig 7 showing the fluctuation of gwpl of the study area which classified into four categorical changes namely negative high negative low no change and positive low and high change high positive change has concentrated in lower potential class 13 25 while high negative change has concentrated in higher potential class 13 03 during 2002 2016 table 7 positive land use change highly occurs in crop land 9 and fallow land 2 while negative fluctuation rate is also shown in bare land 57 67 crop land 38 73 laterite out crop 29 and fallow land 25 6 in contrast negative land use change occurs in dense forest 6 01 and degraded forest 3 while positive fluctuation rate is shown in dense forest 2 and degraded forest respectively however crop land laterite outcrop settlement fallow land and bare lands are major lulc hence they are acted as negative holder of groundwater potentiality on the other hand rest types of lulc namely dense forest degraded forest river water wet land and inland water are considered as positive holder of potentiality 4 3 validation of this analytical model in this study ninety tube well samples were used to fulfill the goal as signified the relation between recharge level and gwpl in each lulc change from 2002 to 2016 auc value in roc varies from 0 777 2002 to 0 835 2016 in fig 8 moreover prediction accuracy during 2002 77 72 and 2016 83 5 have significant level following curve values roc results demonstrated that ahp model is successfully predicted power on groundwater potentiality incorporate with lulc change table 8 according to well data sets groundwater levels are stabilized at 4 705 m during pre monsoon season but it drop down up to 2 52 m during post monsoon in inland water whereas maximum groundwater level reaches up to 7 495 m in river bed in the entire downstream fig 5a b in order to lulc maximum groundwater lowering is seen at 3 675 m pre monsoon in laterite out crop but recharge level fall down at 3 m post monsoon therefore it is point that maximum water level lowering has occurs in laterite out crop whereas rising water level occurs in river bed wet land and inland water 4 4 land use change and land cover alteration luclca and its impact on gwpl change after the computation of geometric mean and normalized weight on input thematic multiple datasets for the analysis of hierarchical process chowdhury et al 2010 sahoo et al 2017 maity and mandal 2019 pcm was used to establish the correlation between land cover alteration and gwpl in this study seven land alteration processes name as laterite out crop alteration degraded forest alteration crop land alteration fallow land alteration bare land alteration and settlement with vegetation alteration are considered for effective alteration processes during 2002 2016 fig 9 a g due to small spatial extent inland water wet land and river water does not consider in this land alteration process but rests of land covers are consider for alteration process bhattacharya et al 2020 fig 9a demonstrated that most of the significance alteration processes in laterite out crop are wetland r 0 74 degraded forest to crop land r 0 84 dense forest to laterite out crop r 0 96 bare land to river water r 0 89 and dense forest to fallow land r 0 56 fig 9b demonstrated that alteration process of degraded forest has been significant in crop land r 0 79 dense forest r 0 78 fallow land r 0 81 laterite out crop r 0 66 dense forest r 0 62 to inland water r 0 84 laterite out crop r 0 93 fallow land to laterite out crop r 0 93 degraded forest to dense forest r 0 87 laterite out crop r 0 85 r 0 69 and fallow land r 0 86 in crop land are significant alteration process fig 9c on the other hand crop land r 0 72 degraded forest r 0 91 laterite out crop r 0 68 in dense forest are significant land cover alteration processes whereas crop land to settlement r 0 79 degraded forest to laterite out crop r 0 97 in fallow land alteration processes have significant correlation fig 9d e land alteration of bare land has significant correlation with crop land r 0 85 degraded forest r 0 77 settlement r 0 96 fallow land r 0 66 and laterite out crop r 0 69 fig 9f one of the remarkable land alteration processes in this basin is settlement alteration process degraded forest r 0 97 dense forest r 0 97 fallow land r 0 59 laterite out crop r 0 79 have significant correlation in crop land alteration under settlement alteration process dense forest r 0 98 fallow land r 0 59 laterite out crop r 0 81 in degraded forest alteration process have negative correlation with settlement alteration process in fig 9g it can be said that laterite out crop fallow land settlement and crop land have nlap on the gwpl due to resisting of groundwater recharge and over water utilization table 9 on the other hand dense forest degraded forest and wet land have plap on potential level due to penetrating of surface runoff and groundwater recharge as a result groundwater potentiality gradually increases in these land covers throughout the basin in term of model accuracy assessment of gwpl change on luclca during post monsoon season twenty five sites s1 25 were selected in the entire study area groundwater recharge level at s1 binpur s19 raniband s25 jhilimili are drastically reduces in the year of 2002 and 2016 in contrast recharge level at s6 jhilimili s10 khatra s14 mohanpur tw s21 routhkhunda are slightly increases in the year of 2002 and 2016 table 9 according to luclca nlap are mostly found in s1 laterite outcrop to laterite outcrop s19 settlement with vegetation to crop land s3 dense forest to degraded forest whereas plap are mostly found in s6 crop land to degraded forest s10 crop land to river water s14 settlement to river water and s21 crop land to degraded forest rest of sites such as s5 harda s8 keshpur s17 pirargaril s22 salboni have negative change of groundwater recharge level caused by laterite out crop alteration in addition no groundwater potential changes are founds in s3 dherua s9 kharkasul s11 ledhapukor s16 panchgeria s20 rahmandal caused by lower alteration of laterite outcrop s3 s16 wetland s20 fallow land s9 and same alteration of degraded forest s11 respectively on the other hand ahp predicted groundwater potential change does not agree with recharge level during post monsoon period in selected sites like s2 dahijuri s4 gorabari s7 kechanda s15 murasthi s18 raipur s23 sarenga and s24 sukhadali based on sample sites location s7 18 23 and 24 are situated in upper basin where thematic parameters namely mahadeva formation buried pediment with laterite capping landforms feature moderate ground slope and high drainage density are governs the lowering of recharge level during post monsoon period table 9 in contrast s15 is situated in lower basin where thematic parameters like arambag formation flood plain deposits low ground slope and low drainage density are helps to increases of recharge level during post monsoon period despite such sites location in upper and lower basin plap and nlap are leads to inverse change on recharge level in the entire basin moreover maximum sites in upper basin falls under low potential level due to huge presence of nlap whereas maximum sites in lower basin falls under high potential level caused by higher association of plap this result demonstrated that luclca does not only crucial factor but also others thematic parameters play vital role to determine the potential level in the entire basin 5 conclusions to determine the impact of land use change and land cover alteration on groundwater potential zone integrated geospatial techniques and ahp method were applied for delineation of groundwater potential zone in the entire kangsabati basin taking such thematic parameters namely geology geomorphology slope elevation soil lulc groundwater recharge level potential zone in this study area has been classified into three zones i e high moderate and low hence in the year 2002 three zones are covers as 48 03 48 81 and 3 097 in the year 2016 three zones are covers as 29 65 52 75 and 17 59 respectively it is found that the kangsabati basin has experienced extensive changes in land use and alteration in land covers than others thematic parameters in order of fluctuation rate from 2002 to 2016 negative land use change and land cover alteration processes like fallow land laterite out crop crop land settlement and fallow land are helps to declining of higher potential zone 490 km2 consequently increases the lower potential zone 505 km2 furthermore positive land use change and land cover alteration processes like dense forest and degraded forest are sustaining the middle potential zone 1856 km2 1828 km2 moreover according to validation of sample sites there has such sites does not support that land use change does not only has significance role but also other hydrological thematic parameters play crucial role for delineation of potential level more importantly this study also helps to planner for the determination of correlation between land use change and potential level which suggested such sustainable land use patterns for conservation of potential level

and 2 the methodology adopted during the study is explained schematically in fig 3 a brief description of the data and methods used for preparation of each thematic layer is discussed below 4 1 drainage map drainage map represents network of drainages streamlets and tributaries a drainage network is formed by combining a number of tributaries of different orders drainage map has been prepared by digitization of drainages tributaries and streamlets from the survey of india topographic sheets the watershed forms dendritic drainage pattern with sixth drainage order drainage map with stream order is presented in fig 4 a which was further divided into seven sub watersheds namely sw1 sw2 sw3 sw4 sw5 sw6 sw7 and sw8 which is unclassified because of the absence of drainage order further drainage density map has been prepared and was classified into five classes five classes i e poor low moderate good and very good fig 4b drainage density reflects the permeability of the underlying rock and soil media high drainage density is the signature of impervious subsurface media with steep slope drainage density is inversely proportional to groundwater recharge high drainage density is signature of low groundwater recharge and much surface runoff generation whereas low drainage density is the signature of good porous media and good groundwater recharge therefore following the drainage characteristics of the area to minimize the surface runoff at high drainage density areas development of the water conservation and recharge structures were suggested at appropriate sites 4 2 geomorphology geomorphologic landscape features of the area have been derived by processing of the gsi map gsi 2002 geomorphology map fig 5 has been prepared by extraction of the each landscape feature present in the area using arcgis the different geomorphic units exposed in the area include flood plain deposits of fluvial origin this landform has gentle to plain topography formed along the rivers valleys the geomorphic unit has occupied a small part of the area 19 33 km2 another geomorphic unit exposed in the area is the structural depression i e a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area the landform is formed by erosional and depositional processes taken place in the area this landform has occupied the central most part of the area accounts 164 88 km2 of the total geographical area this geomorphic unit has been regularly modified by sediment accumulation transferred from the surrounding high lands and forms a sedimentation basin structural plateau hill is the third geomorphic unit present in the area formed by different tectonic actives and endogenic processes taken place in the past this geomorphic landform has occupied the periphery part of the watershed comprise of hard rock formations basalt sandstone etc this geomorphic unit covers the major part of the area 498 79 km2occupied by dense and mixed forests this geomorphic unit has least significance in water resources development activities because of its steep slope irregular shape and bare impervious rocks 4 3 slope analysis slope is generally mapped in three ways slope angle slope form and slope morphology in the study slope has been extracted from srtm satellite imagery using the spatial analysis tool of arcgis in the area slope varies from 0 to 18 respectively slope map fig 6 of the area has been prepared which were further classified into five classes i nearly level slope which represents the flat and plain topography the slope of this class varies from 0 to 2 and covers 417 53 km2 of area this slope class favours to groundwater recharge ii gentleslop in generally represents the gentle slope areas where slope varies from 2 to 6 this slope class accounts 155 92 km2 of total geographical area iii moderate sloping is usually found in undulating hilly areas the slope of this class varies from 6 to 12 and covers 73 71 km2 area iv strongslop inggenerally represents high peaks with rugged topography the slope of this class varies from 12 to 18 this slope class accounts 27 85 km2 of the area this slope class is less favorable for groundwater recharge practices and supports high surface runoff v very steep slope the slope of this class varies from 18 this slope class accounts very small 7 99 km2 part of the area this slope class is mostly found in hilly and cliff areas due to the very steep slope of the class huge surface runoff is generated in those areas therefore slope has been considered for development of water conservation structures in the area 4 4 soil soil map has been derived by processing of the soil map of national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup 1996 various soil classes existing in the area were extracted from it by analysis in

mountainous parts of the area soil types were also followed during the formation of the action plan 4 5 land use land cover lu lc land use defined as how the people are utilizing the landscape for their socio economic development and land cover is the surface material which covers the earth e g vegetation water body built up etc each lu lc class led direct impact on recharge of groundwater and surface runoff detailed lu lc cover mapping of the area were carried out using the landsat 8 satellite imagery of 2017 verified by google earth imagery visual interpretation process and field observations the major lu lc classes extracted by processing of the satellite data using the maximum likelihood classification tool of arcgis includes i agriculture land ii evergreen forest iii mixed forest land iv industrial area v open scrub land vi ponds vii reservoirs viii built up including residential area and ix streams and canals fig 8 the major part of the area is covered by forests which accounts 53 06 of the total geographical area further forest area has been categorized into two sub categories i e evergreen forest which covers 71 14 km2 and mixed forest accounts 290 70 km2area forests have occupied the marginal part of the area the total geographical area covered by forest is 361 85 followed by agriculture 273 33 km2 agriculture has occupied the central fertile alluvium part of the area residential including the built up both urban and rural settlements i e roads bridges railway tracks and buildings has cover 11 02 km2 of the area open scrub includes scrubs and thorns has covered 3 47 km2of area wet lands includes water bodies such as rivers canals lakes reservoirs and ponds together accounts 22 21 km2 of the area these wet lands supports to groundwater recharge through seepage process 4 6 lineament density lineaments are the liner features describing the surface structures and have good significance in groundwater studies lineament density indirectly represents the groundwater recharge zones because the presence of these linear structures usually denotes a good potential groundwater zone lineament mapping of the area was carried out using landsat 8 oli band 1 having resolution of 30 m by multi software processing in arcgis envi pci geomatica and rockworks 16 in the study total 493 lineaments of varying size has been identified and interpreted from the imagery further from lineament map lineament density map has been prepared using the line density tool of arcgis lineament density map fig 9 prepared was further classified into 5 classes with lineament density varying from 0 to 1 poor 1 2 low 2 3 moderate 3 4 good and 4 high respectively high lineament density 4 was usually observed in small parts of the area composed of hard rock formations along with steep slope the major part of the area is characterized by low lineament density 0 1 so that there is need of development of water conservation and recharge structures in order to minimize the surface runoff and increase the groundwater recharge potential 5 results and discussion 5 1 proposed sites and structures for artificial groundwater recharge

et al 2012 the study area is situated in the semi arid region of obedullahganj block raisen district m p india is a hard rock terrain densely populated and industrialized the major part of the area covers hard rock formations with steep topography that does not support to groundwater recharge in the area the area receives mean annual rainfall of above 1200 mm in the area withdrawal of groundwater on regular basis for irrigation domestic and industrial purposes have results in depletion of the groundwater level thelong term analysis of groundwater level conducted by cgwb bhopal 2013 has shown that there occur sharp decline in groundwater level from past one decade due to the decline in water table at rapid pace a number of groundwater productivity wells has stop functioning at several places of the area the main aim of the study is to increase the groundwater recharge potential by identification of the suitable groundwater recharge sites and proposed site specific water conservation structures in the area the proposed site specific water conservation structures that enhance the recharge practices of groundwater in the area includes contour bunds percolation tank check dams gully plug etc the proposed water conservation structures were selected following the existing geology topography geomorphology drainage lineaments lu lc of the area in addition cgwb ministry of water resources guide on artificial recharge to groundwater criteria and decision criteria for water resources action plan nrsa 1995 has been taken in consideration for selection of the suitable artificial recharge structures thus implementation of the developed action plan of artificial groundwater recharge will help for the better management and development of groundwater resources in the area 2 study area the area under study comprises the upper part of betwa river with total geographical area of 683 km2 the study area falls in survey of india soi toposheet no s 55 e 8 55 e 12 55 f 5 55 f 9 the study area lies between latitude 22 51 00 to 23 64 00 n and longitude 77 20 00 to 77 45 00 e the watershed forms the upper part of betwa river hence it is named as upper betwa watershed the watershed covers the parts of obedullahganj block raisen district m p india the area is a hard rock terrain undulating topography with varying geological formations comprises of both soft and hard rock formations in plain tracts of the area along the river valleys highly agricultural practices are carried in the area climate generally remains hot and dry during the summer season and wet during the south west monsoon season the annual maximum temperature of area is 32 0 c and annual minimum temperature is 17 5 c respectively the average annual rainfall of the area is 1207 3 mm the maximum rainfall of 92 2 falls during the monsoon period and 7 8 of the annual rainfall results during october to may the maximum recharge to groundwater happens in the rainy season because of availability of water during the rainy season district groundwater information booklet cgwb 2013 thus the study has found the scope of development of the groundwater resources of the area the location

upper bhander sandstone 149 89 km2 a part this small patches of sirbu shale covers 12 62 km2 ganurgarh shale covers 3 03 km2 and bhander limestone covers 0 51 km2 are exposed in the area fig 2 alluvium has occupied the central most part of the area with gentle slope and represents good groundwater formation zone sandstone has occupied the periphery hilly tract of area with steep slope supporting to less groundwater recharge basalt lava flows are exposed at foot hills parts of the area by virtue of their hydrological properties it discourages to groundwater recharge sirbu shale and ganurgarh shale are exposed in small patches and are also least supportive to groundwater recharge 4 materials and methods during the study survey of india soi toposheet no s 55 e 8 55 e 12 and 55 f 5 were geo referenced and processed in arcgis environment for the preparation of the drainage and drainage density map of the area geology and geomorphology has been derived by processing of the gsi district resource map drm edition 2002 from which various rock units and landforms were extracted national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup of indian council of agricultural research icar 1996 map has been analyzed for the preparation of soil map of the area topography has been derived by processing of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm satellite imagery land use land cover lulc mapping were carried out by processing of the landsat 8 imagery 2017 supported by google earth visual image interpretation lineament mapping was carried by using landsat 8 operational land imager oli band 1 with resolution of 30 m all the data sets were converted in to digital format from their source map further ministry of water resources guide on artificial recharge to groundwater may 2000 2011 and decision criteria for water resources action plan nrsa 1995 has been followed for selection of artificial groundwater recharge structures and sites in the area tables 1 and 2 the methodology adopted during the study is explained schematically in fig 3 a brief description of the data and methods used for preparation of each thematic layer is discussed below 4 1 drainage map drainage map represents network of drainages streamlets and tributaries a drainage network is formed by combining a number of tributaries of different orders drainage map has been prepared by digitization of drainages tributaries and streamlets from the survey of india topographic sheets the watershed forms dendritic drainage pattern with sixth drainage order drainage map with stream order is presented in fig 4 a which was further divided into seven sub watersheds namely sw1 sw2 sw3 sw4 sw5 sw6 sw7 and sw8 which is unclassified because of the absence of drainage order further drainage density map has been prepared and was classified into five classes five classes i e poor low moderate good and very good fig 4b drainage density reflects the permeability of the underlying rock and soil media high drainage density is the signature of impervious subsurface media with steep slope drainage density is inversely proportional to groundwater recharge high drainage density is signature of low groundwater recharge and much surface runoff generation whereas low drainage density is the signature of good porous media and good groundwater recharge therefore following the drainage characteristics of the area to minimize the surface runoff at high drainage density areas development of the water conservation and recharge structures were suggested at appropriate sites 4 2 geomorphology geomorphologic landscape features of the area have been derived by processing of the gsi map gsi 2002 geomorphology map fig 5 has been prepared by extraction of the each landscape feature present in the area using arcgis the different geomorphic units exposed in the area include flood plain deposits of fluvial origin this landform has gentle to plain topography formed along the rivers valleys the geomorphic unit has occupied a small part of the area 19 33 km2 another geomorphic unit exposed in the area is the structural depression i e a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area the landform is formed by erosional and depositional processes taken place in the area this landform has occupied the central most part of the area accounts 164 88 km2 of the total geographical area this geomorphic unit has been regularly modified by sediment accumulation transferred from the surrounding high lands and forms a sedimentation basin structural plateau hill is the third geomorphic unit present in the area formed by different tectonic actives and endogenic processes taken place in the past this geomorphic landform has occupied the periphery part of the watershed comprise of hard rock formations basalt sandstone etc this geomorphic unit covers the major part of the area 498 79 km2occupied by dense and mixed forests this geomorphic unit has least significance in water resources development activities because of its steep slope irregular shape and bare impervious rocks 4 3 slope analysis slope is generally mapped in three ways slope angle slope form and slope morphology in the study slope has been extracted from srtm satellite imagery using the spatial analysis tool of arcgis in the area slope varies from 0 to 18 respectively slope map fig 6 of the area has been prepared which were further classified into five classes i nearly level slope which represents the flat and plain topography the slope of this class varies from 0 to 2 and covers 417 53 km2 of area this slope class favours to groundwater recharge ii gentleslop in generally represents the gentle slope areas where slope varies from 2 to 6 this slope class accounts 155 92 km2 of total geographical area iii moderate sloping is usually found in undulating hilly areas the slope of this class varies from 6 to 12 and covers 73 71 km2 area iv strongslop inggenerally represents high peaks with rugged topography the slope of this class varies from 12 to 18 this slope class accounts 27 85 km2 of the area this slope class is less favorable for groundwater recharge practices and supports high surface runoff v very steep slope the slope of this class varies from 18 this slope class accounts very small 7 99 km2 part of the area this slope class is mostly found in hilly and cliff areas due to the very steep slope of the class huge surface runoff is generated in those areas therefore slope has been considered for development of water conservation structures in the area 4 4 soil soil map has been derived by processing of the soil map of national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup 1996 various soil classes existing in the area were extracted from it by analysis in arcgis the different soil types present in the area are shown in fig 7 sandy loam and clayey soil are exposed in most parts of the area in plain tracts while stony soils were found in hilly mountainous parts of the area soil types were also followed during the formation of the action plan 4 5 land use land cover lu lc land use defined as how the people are utilizing the landscape for their socio economic development and land cover is the surface material which covers the earth e g vegetation water body built up etc each lu lc class led direct impact on recharge of groundwater and surface runoff detailed lu lc cover mapping of the area were carried out using the landsat 8 satellite imagery of 2017 verified by google earth imagery visual interpretation process and field observations the major lu lc classes extracted by processing of the satellite data using the maximum likelihood classification tool of arcgis includes i agriculture land ii evergreen forest iii mixed forest land iv industrial area v open scrub land vi ponds vii reservoirs viii built up including residential area and ix streams and canals fig 8 the major part of the area is covered by forests which accounts 53 06 of the total geographical area further forest area has been categorized into two sub categories i e evergreen forest which covers 71 14 km2 and mixed forest accounts 290 70 km2area forests have occupied the marginal part of the area the total geographical area covered by forest is 361 85 followed by agriculture 273 33 km2 agriculture has occupied the central fertile alluvium

thorns has covered 3 47 km2of area wet lands includes water bodies such as rivers canals lakes reservoirs and ponds together accounts 22 21 km2 of the area these wet lands supports to groundwater recharge through seepage process 4 6 lineament density lineaments are the liner features describing the surface structures and have good significance in groundwater studies lineament density indirectly represents the groundwater recharge zones because the presence of these linear structures usually denotes a good potential groundwater zone lineament mapping of the area was carried out using landsat 8 oli band 1 having resolution of 30 m by multi software processing in arcgis envi pci geomatica and rockworks 16 in the study total 493 lineaments of varying size has been identified and interpreted from the imagery further from lineament map lineament density map has been prepared using the line density tool of arcgis lineament density map fig 9 prepared was further classified into 5 classes with lineament density varying from 0 to 1 poor 1 2 low 2 3 moderate 3 4 good and 4 high respectively high lineament density 4 was usually observed in small parts of the area composed of hard rock formations along with steep slope the major part of the area is characterized by low lineament density 0 1 so that there is need of development of water conservation and recharge structures in order to minimize the surface runoff and increase the groundwater recharge potential 5 results and discussion 5 1 proposed sites and structures for artificial groundwater recharge detailed information regarding geology geomorphology topography lineaments soil slope land use land cover drainage network and drainage density and other structural features were evaluated as thematic maps from various data sets using the arcgis further following the criteria given by ministry of water resources guide on artificial recharge to ground water may 2000 2011 and decision criteria for development of water resource action plan given by nrsa 1995 were followed for development of sub watershed wise action plan of the area the proposed action plan addresses construction of the water conservation structures at appropriate sites for the development and management of the groundwater resources of the area the whole area has been divided into seven sub watersheds in sub watershed sw1 4 check dams and 2 gully plug structures were proposed fig 10 a in sub watershed 2 we have proposed 10 check dams and 19 gully plug structures for better management of the groundwater fig 10b similarly in sub watershed 3 25 check dams and 5 gully plug structures were proposed at their suitable sites fig 10c however 8 check dams and 12 gully plug structures were proposed in sub watershed 4 fig 10d in sub watershed 5 check dam no s 10 and11gully plug structures were proposed fig 10e in sub watershed 6 we have proposed 8 check dams and 11 gully plug structures at identified suitable sites fig 10f further development of 12 check dams and 3 gully plug structures were proposed in sub watershed 7 fig 10g these structures will provide a good measure of artificial recharge in this hard rock terrain by collecting of the surface runoff and increasing the surface area of infiltration the location of these proposed artificial recharge structures are given in table 3 thus execution of this proposed sub watershed wise action plan will be effective for development and management of ground water resources in the area in addition construction of these proposed structures at identified suitable sites will help in protection of soil erosion in the area the proposed sub watershed wise action plan will also help to the concerned authorities and local people for the better management and planning of the water resources in the region further the proposed action plan will be helpful in groundwater prospect mapping of the area sub watershed wise action plan map has been generated are shown in fig 10a g further with the help of the google earth visual image interpretation process locations of these proposed artificial recharge structures were verified and plotted in the map 6 conclusion in the study an integrated approach of remote sensing and gis were carried out for development of action plan for groundwater resource management in the area the various parameters which affects to surface runoff and govern the groundwater movement and occurrence were evaluated includes geology geomorphology drainage topography land use land cover soil and geological structures lineaments these parameters have been evaluated as thematic layers in arcgis environment from various data sources following the criteria suggested by ministry of water resources guide on artificial recharge to ground water and nrsa 1995 along with the developed thematic layers suitable site specific artificial groundwater recharge structures were proposed in the area in sw1 4 check dams and 2 gully plug structures were proposed whereas 10 check dams and 19 gully plug structures were proposed in sw2 similarly in sw3 25 check dams and 5 gully plug structures has been proposed however 8 check

12049,imbalance between water supply and demand is increasing in many parts of the world lack of water security is attributed to climate change population growth and unsustainable abstraction of groundwater managed aquifer recharge mar can increase groundwater recharge facilitate higher water availability and accessibility and hence reduce water supply deficit this paper investigates the potential of mar in a karstic and semi arid region with the use of gis multi criteria decision analysis gis mcda while previous studies have focused on mar techniques and mar suitably mapping separately this paper combines technique selection and suitability mapping to emphasize the importance of considering both the methodology was applied for a karstic and semi arid region using the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa as case study mar suitability mapping of the selected mar technique was carried out with six thematic layers using weighted linear combination wlc decision rule the objective was to identify suitable areas for implementation of spreading methods and generate mar suitability maps to guide decision making in such implementation the suitable areas were identified at the border between botswana and south africa the study develops a methodology for gis mcda considering spreading method for a karstic aquifer but more research is needed to assess the methodological transferability to other karstic and semi arid regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords mar suitability analysis suitability mapping water scarcity groundwater remote sensing 1 introduction a changing climate encompasses uncertainty about the future however although uncertain more extreme weather events are expected with dry areas getting dryer and wet areas getting wetter at the same time rapid population growth is a generic characteristic of many developing countries together they put people in developing countries at risk of water scarcity as an increasing water demand is met by a stagnant or declining water supply managed aquifer recharge mar can be used as a counteracting and sustainable step towards filling the gap between water supply and demand particularly in karstic aquifers because 20 25 of the global drinkable water supply is abstracted from these aquifers daher et al 2011 the choice of mar technique depends on physical landscape characteristics at the implementation site agostinetto et al 2013 dillon et al 2009 de jeude 2016 however although mar comprises widely researched and implemented techniques to the knowledge of authors there is a lack of knowledge on mar in karstic regions bakalowicz 2011 daher et al 2011 consequently a globally consistent and clear mar methodology for karstic regions in the literature is missing this paper investigates the potential of mar in the karstic and semi arid ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa with the use of gis multi criteria decision analysis gis mcda to identify suitable methods and locations for mar implementation in this context of balancing water demand and supply mar suitability maps are provided as a tool for decision making support while previous studies have exclusively focused on mar techniques bakalowicz 2011 daher et al 2011 el fadel et al 2016 escalante et al 2016 masciopinto et al 2012 xanke et al 2015 2016 or mar suitability mapping andreo et al 2008 chenini et al 2010 ioannidou 2016 karami et al 2016 kattaa et al 2010 oikonomidis et al 2015 rahman et al 2012 sener et al 2005 this study included both to capture linkages and dependencies between the selected mar technique and the mar suitability mapping procedure which affects the outcomes of the final mar suitability map the methodology presented synthesizes existing frameworks in a manner that allows for remote assessment of potential for mar in a karstic and semi arid region gale 2005 and igrac 2007 defined five main mar techniques spreading method induced bank infiltration well shaft and borehole recharge run off and rainwater harvesting and in channel modifications application of mar schemes in arid and semi arid regions was illustrated by gale 2005 and steinel 2012 these applications included floodwater spreading leaky dams check dams injection boreholes inter dune filtration rainwater harvesting irrigation channels bank filtration and injection wells while mar techniques posit interesting possibilities for exploiting groundwater resources in karstic aquifers daher et al 2011 humphreys 2011 milanovic 2005 particularly in mediterranean areas stevanovic 2015 they have mainly been implemented in australia nwqms 2009 vanderzalm et al 2009 with a few similar pilot projects in the usa dillon 2005 dillon et al 2009 sparse implementation of mar in karstic areas reverberates the current lack of knowledge below follows a short description of the most frequent mar techniques used in karstic regions 1 well shaft and borehole recharge rely on directly induced infiltration for instance through injection wells this technique may be applied in areas with deep aquifers escalante et al 2016 it does however need thorough primary investigation and pre treatment de jeude 2016 advantages include minimal evaporation losses rambags et al 2013 applicability in complex geology regardless of topography igrac 2007 and low spatial requirements for implementation steenbergen and tuinhof 2012 primary costs are relatively high escalante et al 2014 2 in channel modification systems enhance groundwater recharge by retaining surface water and controlling releases to facilitate high infiltration rates into the aquifer this technique may be applied to both shallow and deep aquifers in arid climates with ephemeral river streams steinel 2012 advantages include applicability in forested regions escalante et al 2016 which is an acknowledged constraint for most main mar techniques and small scale simple construction demands tuinhof et al 2012 however clogging and sedimentation call for continuous maintenance challenging economic justification given the short life span of the systems escalante et al 2016 xanke et al 2016 primary costs range from low to medium de jeude 2016 3 spreading methods involve the distribution of surface water in areas with high infiltration capacity and potential for percolation this technique may be applied to shallow aquifers in areas with sufficient surface layers of suitable material epikarst and mild slopes daher et al 2011 it is not suitable for recharging deep aquifers and requires large spatial extents for implementation escalante et al 2016 de jeude 2016 steinel 2012 as the oldest and most well established mar technique advantages include low requirements of technical expertise and prior knowledge as well as effective water purification processes initiated during the phases of infiltration and percolation primary costs are low as emphasized by several studies bakalowicz 2011 daher et al 2011 the selection of the appropriate site for mar implementation is vital environmental and social concerns in site selection should therefore be regarded in an early stage the complexity and heterogeneity of karstic regions makes it particularly challenging to generalize characteristic landscape features that reveal preferable mar locations remote sensing allows for retrieval of spatiotemporal data in vast or physically inaccessible areas such spatiotemporal data is effectively managed and analyzed in geographical information systems gis russo et al 2015 this justifies the growing popularity of gis in mar suitability analyses satellite data provide quick and useful baseline data on diverse factors directly or indirectly influencing groundwater movement through aquifers soil and rock types lineament and drainage density slope lithology geology and geomorphology with resolutions ranging from meters to kilometers consequently gis proves to be one of most effective tools for groundwater studies ghayoumian et al 2007 karami et al 2016 krishnamurthy et al 1996 rahman et al 2012 valverde et al 2016 although trade offs are inevitably made between accuracy precision and data availability van berkum 2010 in gis while various thematic layers have been considered in mar suitability mapping there is no consistent methodological approach applicable for all conditions the mar methodology must be defined according to main objectives data availability locally available material environmental and social concerns and so on although karstic regions are found on all continents not all inhibit semi arid climate in europe only the karstic mediterranean regions portray similarity to semi arid climate and are hence of relevance to this paper including countries like greece ioannidou 2016 oikonomidis et al 2015 italy cucchi et al 2008 polemio et al 2009 portugal rahman et al 2012 spain andreo et al 2008 and turkey sener et al 2005 in asia and the middle east karstic and semi arid regions were investigated in bangladesh adham et al 2010 shahid et al 2000 india dutta 2015 krishnamurthy et al 1996 machiwal et al 2011 mukherjee et al 2012 iran ghayoumian et al 2007 karami et al 2016 jordan alraggad and jasem 2010 lebanon daher et al 2011 and syria kattaa et al 2010 in africa although karstic zones play an important role for water supply in countries like south africa botswana and countries located near the mediterranean sea like tunisia chenini et al 2010 lack of research restricts existence of suitable papers investigating karstic and semi arid regions however semi arid regions in ethiopia fenta et al 2015 ghana forkuor et al 2013 and nigeria fashae et al 2014 have been studied table 1 summarizes the most cited papers investigating karstic and semi arid regions around the world fathi 2017 as can be seen 28 distinct thematic layers were identified and categorized as in situ observational and remotely sensed the nine most frequent thematic layers mentioned in the 21 peer reviewed papers are slope lineament density drainage density lithology precipitation geology proximity to surface water bodies depth to groundwater and land use land cover lulc in decreasing order likewise specifically for karst the most frequent thematic layers are slope lithology drainage and lineament density precipitation and infiltration altitude rock type soil and lulc three frameworks are currently prevalent for mar suitability mapping aquifer recharge assessment in karst and epikarst arak was developed by daher et al 2011 to solve theoretical and practical difficulties implementing mar systems in karstic regions this approach combines rock type infiltration and degree of karstification as thematic layers with gis restore maps such as geological and topographical maps in addition to field observations for comprehensive decision support in implementation of mar specifically for karstic regions limestone and dolomite are favored rock types whereas the degree of karstification reflects conduits in system field observations from tracer tests hydraulic spring tests geophysical techniques geological surveys and geochemical analysis restrict the framework to studies in which the area can be physically inspected daher et al 2011 proposed the following equation for weighting thematic layers for karstic regions 1 r e c h a r g e 0 6 e 0 2 r 0 1 i 0 1 k in which e is epikarst r is rock type i is infiltration and k is degree of karstification it was concluded that urbanization highly restricts the implementation of mar systems pointing to the value of land use and land cover for carbonate aquifers the altitude slope lithology infiltration soil aplis framework was proposed by andreo et al 2008 aplis estimates the mean annual recharge based on studies of eight carbonate aquifers in the south of spain mediterranean climate specifically for mar suitability mapping in karstic regions limestone and dolomite are favored with higher weight of the lithology map and recharge is increased with abundant exokarstic infiltration landforms the following weighting of thematic layers for karstic regions was proposed 2 r e c h a r g e a p 3 l 2 i s 0 9 in which a is altitude p is slope l is lithology i is infiltration and s is soil using this approach andreo et al 2008 concluded that evapotranspiration is not a key variable for recharge into groundwater in carbonate aquifers reservoir rock infiltration potential soil development and behavior of karst and epikarst riske is the third framework which was developed by kattaa et al 2010 to investigate potential groundwater recharge and vulnerability in karstic regions this approach considers land use and field tests for improving interpolation accuracy as in the two above mentioned frameworks limestone and dolomite are favored rock types and the degree of karstification and epikarst is considered representative for conduits in the system riske is an extension of epik dorfliger and zwahlen 1998 which was developed by zwahlen 2003 without consideration of soil layers kattaa et al 2010 proposed the following weighting of thematic layers for karstic regions 3 r e c h a r g e 0 1 r 0 5 i 0 1 s 0 2 k 0 2 e in which r is rock type i is infiltration s is soil k is degree of karstification and e is epikarst although distinctly named the frameworks bear high resemblance for instance the same classifications were applied for rock type maps in arak and lithology maps in aplis and the degree of karstification is considered in both arak riske and epik thus appraising differences between the aforementioned frameworks as nuances the following thematic layers are arguably identified as essential criteria for mar suitability analysis in karstic regions geology maps including karstic classes like limestone and dolomite lineament density maps reflecting the conduits in the system and soil maps with classes adapted to karstic regions in considering infiltration as a thematic layer the temporal evolution of diffusion which depends on rainfall intensity and duration is neglected infiltration is considered to have the highest rate in gentle slopes and lowest in steep slopes which favor surface run off however the authors of this paper argue that infiltration capacity alone as a thematic layer is not crucial for mar suitability analysis as infiltration is indirectly incorporated in slope and soil map layers building on the frameworks described above this paper presents a mar suitability analysis with a case study on the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa 1 1 case study the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa is shared between south eastern districts of botswana and north eastern parts of south africa see fig 1 the region suffers from water shortage due to erratic rainfall patterns and over exploitation of aquifers along with poorly managed water resources the botswanan side is characterized by urbanization development and rapid population growth staudt 2003 the south african side on the other hand is characterized by stabilized economic conditions and rural settlements with unclear water demand and supply ramoeli et al 2010 staudt 2002 the rtaa is located in a karstic and semi arid region subject to variation in surface water availability comparable to dryland areas in such dry areas rainfall is low 500 mm yr and inconsistent lópez and arrúe 1997 this may lead to low water productivity and increased risk of water insecurity habiba et al 2015 even if precipitation were to be fairly high 500 850 mm yr high rates of evapotranspiration would counteractively cause significant annual water losses alazard et al 2015 lópez and arrúe 1997 again prescribing risk of water insecurity the climate of the rtaa ranges from semi arid in the east to dry in the west overall classified as a semi arid region altchenko et al 2017 staudt 2003 rainfall is seasonally dependent with storms occurring in the months of october and april mean annual rainfall ranges between 100 mm and 1000 mm decreasing from east to west altchenko et al 2017 although uncertain climate change projections predict a probable increase in rainfall intensity altchenko et al 2017 taylor et al 2011 mean annual temperature ranges between 18 and 20 c staudt 2003 with maximum and minimum temperatures occurring in january and july respectively the rtaa presents a complex geology and topography xri blue 2017 particularly interesting geological formations are found in the flight zone the boundaries inside the rtaa where mainly dolomite with portions of chert have been subjected to karstification xri blue 2016 two aquifer systems are considered the ramotswa dolomite and the lephala formation comprising a vast area of the bushveld basin both aquifers are locally regarded as hydraulically linked through the pre dominant north south moving fracture zones altchenko et al 2017 staudt 2003 in the dolomites the active groundwater cycle initiates local karstification through structural lineaments creating large transmissivities and storativities altchenko et al 2017 geology maps of the rtaa and the flight zone are provided in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively while a detailed description of geological formations is given elsewhere altchenko et al 2017 staudt 2003 xri blue 2017 2 material and methods 2 1 geographic information system multi criteria decision analysis gis mcda gis mcda comprises a collection of methods and tools used to integrate spatially distributed geographical data with respect to established preferences and value judgements gis allows for automation interpretation and spatially extensive analysis management whilst mcda combines criteria of varying units through standardization and weight assignment ranking of potential mar areas can be done more thoroughly rahman et al 2012 and at lower cost karami et al 2016 oikonomidis et al 2015 valverde et al 2016 yeh et al 2016 by carrying out the mcda in gis gis mcda has been applied globally in countries with varying climate hydro patterns and geology such as greece ioannidou 2016 india kumar et al 2007 iran karami et al 2016 italy cucchi et al 2008 jordan alraggad and jasem 2010 portugal rahman et al 2012 spain andreo et al 2008 tunisia chenini et al 2010 and the usa russo et al 2015 gis mcda for mar suitability analysis consists of four structural components problem statement screening of suitable areas suitability mapping and sensitivity analysis see fig 4 these steps are subsequently presented below 2 1 1 problem statement the first step in gis mcda for mar suitability analysis is identification of issues to be addressed as mar may serve various purposes malczewski 1999 the problem statement forms foundation for establishing objective s intended to be reached with mar for the rtaa spreading method is considered more suitable with respect to practical aspects of implementation and associated costs 2 1 2 screening of suitable areas the second step in gis mcda for mar suitability analysis is the screening of suitable areas this step is carried out using boolean logic algebra rahman et al 2012 in gis operators and and or are used to obtain reflections of suitable and unsuitable areas cells with respect to selected criteria valverde et al 2016 i e cells that do not fulfill specified threshold values are removed from the analysis this is particularly useful for removal of cells with environmental and social concerns in cases where the nature of true false selection is problematic fuzzy logic methods should be considered feizizadeh et al 2014 in which member functions and kernels may be tailored to the area at hand three criteria were selected for the screening of suitable regions land use land cover slope and soil usda texture according to the e soter regional slope classification van engelen and dijkshoorn 2013 terrains with slopes exceeding 30 are defined as steep terrains mild slopes are favored for implementation of spreading methods meanwhile according to the textural soil triangle and its water holding capacity table provided by van engelen and dijkshoorn 2013 areas with clayey soils are regarded unsuitable furthermore the fao 2 2 food and agriculture organization of the united nations land use land cover was used to classify suitable and unsuitable areas as following areas with sparse vegetation bare lands cropland grassland and non cultivated were regarded suitable whereas water bodies urban areas evergreen and deciduous forest 40 and forest and shrub land 15 40 were regarded unsuitable a logical was used to derive suitable areas fulfilling the conditions of mild slopes 30 and absence of clay texture in the designated land cover classes 2 1 3 suitability mapping the third step in gis mcda for mar suitability analysis is suitability mapping this step is performed to estimate the degree to which mar objectives specified in the problem statement may be reached valverde et al 2016 suitability mapping requires specification of i criteria ii decision rule iii normalization and iv weight allocation the rtaa and the flight zone fz were subject to separate suitability mapping using lithology maps of low resolution 1000 m for the former and high resolution 50 m for the latter 2 1 3 1 criteria the criteria are a set of selected environmental factors that influence and hence represent the likely occurrence and movement of water in a zone with respect to the selected mar technique such influencing factors include lithology andreo et al 2008 karami et al 2016 geology fashae et al 2014 geomorphology fenta et al 2015 land cover and land use sener et al 2005 precipitation oikonomidis et al 2015 hydraulic groundwater head russo et al 2015 topography rahman et al 2012 soil mukherjee et al 2012 and so on the term criterion conceptualizes both targets and properties consequently adequate selection of criteria requires investigations of the area either in situ remotely or with the use of literature review as highlighted by malczewski and rinner 2016 selected criteria should be compressive and quantifiable meanwhile it is advised that selected criteria be non redundant and nominal van berkum 2010 nine criteria have been investigated with respect to karstic and semi arid regions as previously presented in table 1 out of these six criteria were chosen to identify the appropriate sites for implementing the spreading method in rtaa and the flight zone see fig 5 rainfall was not included due to low spatio temporal variability fathi 2017 furthermore proximity to water bodies and depth to groundwater were not included due to the seasonal ephemeral nature of surface water and lack of quality data respectively fathi 2017 2 1 3 2 decision rule the decision rule instructs the ranking of alternatives malczewski 1999 weighted linear combination wlc is based on linear aggregation of the results obtained with each criterion malczewski and rinner 2016 and is one of the most widely applied decision rules malczewski 1999 2000 valverde et al 2016 in the present study wlc was applied as a decision rule 2 1 3 3 normalization normalization is needed to extract relative suitability classifications before combining criteria in the resulting suitability map malczewski and rinner 2016 normalization may be carried out with step wise or linear functions malczewski 1999 with the latter being recommended for normalization of combined criteria rahman et al 2012 in the present study the six selected criteria were normalized as following step wise functions were applied for lithology land use land cover and soil piecewise linear functions were applied for slope and a single linear function was applied for drainage and lineament density see fig 6 table 2 provides an overview of selected thresholds for suitability classification of each thematic layer as spreading method relies on direct infiltration sandy loam and sand were assigned the highest value with respect to soil for the rtaa the highest value was assigned to dolomite and limestone due to high potential for water retention in addition to high secondary porosity andreo et al 2008 karami et al 2016 the lowest value was assigned to volcanic extrusive rock which has low infiltration rate mukherjee et al 2012 sener et al 2005 for the flight zone mud rock and shale were assigned the lowest value due to difficulties in implementing spreading methods karami et al 2016 whereas alluvium was assigned the highest value due to high primary porosity altchenko et al 2017 2 1 3 4 weight allocation weight allocation refers to the assignation of weights to each criterion for integration of the thematic layers this is essential as the relative importance of the criteria vary ghayoumian et al 2007 in the present study multi influencing factor mif shaban et al 2006 valverde et al 2016 was used to derive these weights first major and minor effects resulting from the interaction between the thematic layers were identified see fig 7 then the number of major effects score 1 and minor effects score 0 5 were summed finally the relative importance of each criterion division by total sum constituted the weights for each criterion as can be seen in table 3 a total of nine major effects and seven minor effects were identified resulting in a cumulative score of 12 5 points and the highest weight assigned to lithology an elaboration of the detection of major and minor effects is provided below lithology has a major effect on soil lineament density drainage density and land use and land cover lulc the major effect on soil arises as soil decisively emerges by geological processes matsukura et al 2002 wakatsuki and matsukura 2008 while the major effect on drainage density is due to the observed influence by geologic formation on drainage network as well as the development of river streams nickolas et al 2017 in addition the major effect on lineament is explained by the effect of geological process in development and genesis of formation of faults steen and andresen 1999 while there is a direct connection between lithology and lulc for instance in areas with alluvium forested areas or volcanic formations no roots briassoulis 2009 soil has a major effect on drainage density and lulc the major effect of soil on lulc arises due to the strong connection between roots and soil and the further related ecological succession and human exploitation briassoulis 2009 while soil plays a key role on hydraulic conductivity and therefore on recharge process as well as the path of river beds livneh et al 2015 lulc has a major effect on drainage density and minor effects on soil lineament density and slope respectively lulc plays a key role in determination of rainfall interception and runoff and therefore drainage density in addition vegetation can have direct impact on the soil as soils formed under forests are prone to weathering because forests grow in higher rainfall areas therefore more water movements in the root zone lamb and rehm 2017 lulc has a minor effect on lineament density as vegetation alignment is used for recognition of faults singhal and gupta 2010 and slope as the presence of vegetation directly influences slope stability slope has a major and a minor effect on drainage density and lulc respectively nadal romero et al 2014 showed the effects of slope angle and aspect of plant cover with respect to species richness besides slope plays an essential role in genesis of streams bansal and das 2009 the lineament density has a major effect on drainage density and a minor effect on lulc river beds can be affected by tectonic forces aghai et al 2008 vegetation appears in line of lineaments robinson et al 1983 for drainage density two minor effects on lineament and lulc respectively were considered due to the indirect impact of drainage density on human exploitation of land riis and biggs 2003 and the role in recognition of faults singhal and gupta 2010 in regions formed by karstification the weights resulting from the mif method varied by a fourfold lithology was given the highest weight 32 reflecting pertinence of the lithological parameters that govern recharge to the saturated zone karami et al 2016 and storativity in rocks with respect to its related secondary porosity andreo et al 2008 karami et al 2016 kattaa et al 2010 the second highest weight was given to land use land cover 20 followed by soil 16 slope 12 and lineament density 12 the lowest weight was given to drainage density 8 the synthesized recharge equation hence reads 4 r e c h a r g e 0 32 li 0 16 so 0 12 sl 0 20 lulc 0 12 ld 0 08 dd in which li is lithology so is soil sl is slope lulc is land use land cover ld is lineament density and dd is drainage density these weights fall within ranges used in previous studies on mar suitability in karstic and semi arid regions see fig 8 3 sensitivity analysis the fourth step in gis mcda for mar suitability mapping is sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is used to obtain a measure of the robustness of the results the main source of uncertainty in gis mcda arise from the selected criteria and the defined weights malczewski 1999 if highly sensitive criteria are revealed in the sensitivity analysis the deterministic approach to mar suitability mapping may be altered to a probabilistic approach a vast number of methodologies for sensitivity analysis in gis mcda are described in the literature malczewski 1999 malczewski and rinner 2016 rahman et al 2012 shaban et al 2006 valverde et al 2016 one approach is the re assignation of criterion values as proposed by shankar and mohan 2005 in the present study the approach described by store and kangas 2001 and valverde et al 2016 was used the weights of the criteria were systematically changed by increments appraising effects on dynamic interlinkages between the selected criteria 3 1 data collection and preparation table 4 displays the data sources used to generate the input maps for the gis mcda a digital elevation model dem was obtained from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster data the dem was used to generate the slope map in qgis for this two directional gradient filters x direction and y direction were applied to the dem using in built linear filters from the ilwis software jaiswal et al 2003 slopes were computed from the resulting map as following 5 s l o p e 100 d x 2 d y 2 p i x e l s i z e d e m in which dx filtered dem with x gradient filter dy filtered dem with y gradient filter the lithology maps were assembled from two sources sadc hydrological map for rtaa and merged simplified geology map provided by xri blue lulc was obtained from the fao global land use and land cover map fao globcover with 300 m horizontal resolution soil atlas of africa was provided from the european soil data centre this was overlaid by layers from the harmonized world soil database the input maps are shown in fig 9 4 results and discussion 4 1 suitable areas fig 10 shows the map resulting from screening of suitable areas as can be seen the distinction between suitable and unsuitable areas is poorly pronounced and merely gives a rough indication of areas suitable for implementation of spreading methods the final mar suitability map of the rtaa is shown in fig 11 very high suitability is identified north of the flight zone at the border between botswana and south africa and south west on the botswanan side table 5 summarizes the mar suitability classes i relative to suitable areas of the rtaa and the flight zone and ii relative to the total areas of the rtaa and the flight zone as can be seen there are substantially more moderately suitable areas than very suitable areas in the rtaa this relative difference is however smaller for the flight zone relative to the total areas the dominant mar suitability class in the rtaa is moderately suitable while more than half of the flight zone is suitable however a slightly larger percentage of the rtaa is very suitable as compared to the flight zone the mar suitability map of the flight zone is shown in fig 12 although there is an agreement regarding highly suitable areas at the border between botswana and south africa flight zone more suitable areas are identified with higher resolution particularly the extent of very suitable and suitable areas identified at the country borders is interesting to the transboundary nature of the aquifer fig 13 illustrates the effect of a finer resolution lithology in the flight zone 4 2 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis are provided in fig 14 as can be seen the most sensitive criteria were lithology li and land use and land cover lulc for the rtaa and lithology and drainage density for the flight zone the overall least sensitive criterion was soil so while neither drainage density dd lineament density ld nor slope sl were particularly sensitive the sensitivity analysis concludes that robust results were obtained with respect to the most suitable areas for mar using spreading method this points to the potential of the methodology proposed for karstic and semi arid regions with similar data availability for actual planning and implementation of spreading method in the rtaa the maps can be used as a decision making tool to consolidate the south african and the botswanan sides in a collaborative approach furthermore such maps can be used in a stakeholder approach identify unknown social concerns and gain public consent with the implementation of mar 5 conclusion in this paper gis mcda was used for mar suitability mapping of a transboundary aquifer in a karstic and semi arid region while previous studies have focused on the selection of mar technique s or the methodology of mar suitability mapping exclusively this paper combines both in systematic development of a karst specific methodology to generate mar suitability maps as a decision making tool mar suitability maps can be of exquisite value for the implementation of mar in transboundary aquifers where contrasting objectives from two or more sides often occur in this study the most suitable areas for spreading methods were identified at the border between south africa and botswana and in the flight zone of the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area the methodology presented in this paper consolidates and further builds on three prevalent frameworks in mar suitability mapping with documented use in karstic and semi arid areas although the method cannot be generalized for karstic aquifers in semi arid regions using only one case study it can be used to gain further insight to more karst specific features dictating potential for mar in such regions as more case studies are considered in this study two karst specific considerations were made lithology and lineament density firstly high lineament density has been found to coincide with high fractures and hence more conduits and windows towards the karstic aquifer this implies a higher recharge to the aquifer secondly while other studies have considered alluvium only as very suitable areas for recharge this paper additionally considered dolomite and limestone specifically found in karstic regions however it is stressed that more case studies are needed to verify the actual methodological transferability to other karstic and semi arid regions in order to draw conclusions about the generalization of the methodology furthermore the use of satellite data embeds a trade off between precision and accuracy at various spatiotemporal scales the uncertainty in inputs to the gis mcda slope soil land use land cover lithology drainage density lineament density was not quantitatively assessed further development of the methodology presented in this paper would include a quantitative uncertainty analysis following the sensitivity analysis this is however left for future studies future research should also adapt the method to other mar techniques such as well shaft and borehole recharge or in channel modifications with specific application to karstic regions this paper has argued the significance of considering both the mar technique and the mar suitability mapping procedure when identifying the potential for mar in a karstic and semi arid region and furthermore unified existing prevalent frameworks for suitability mapping on a case study with limited data availability as thus the present paper adds a small step on which future research can build on declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

12049,imbalance between water supply and demand is increasing in many parts of the world lack of water security is attributed to climate change population growth and unsustainable abstraction of groundwater managed aquifer recharge mar can increase groundwater recharge facilitate higher water availability and accessibility and hence reduce water supply deficit this paper investigates the potential of mar in a karstic and semi arid region with the use of gis multi criteria decision analysis gis mcda while previous studies have focused on mar techniques and mar suitably mapping separately this paper combines technique selection and suitability mapping to emphasize the importance of considering both the methodology was applied for a karstic and semi arid region using the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa as case study mar suitability mapping of the selected mar technique was carried out with six thematic layers using weighted linear combination wlc decision rule the objective was to identify suitable areas for implementation of spreading methods and generate mar suitability maps to guide decision making in such implementation the suitable areas were identified at the border between botswana and south africa the study develops a methodology for gis mcda considering spreading method for a karstic aquifer but more research is needed to assess the methodological transferability to other karstic and semi arid regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords mar suitability analysis suitability mapping water scarcity groundwater remote sensing 1 introduction a changing climate encompasses uncertainty about the future however although uncertain more extreme weather events are expected with dry areas getting dryer and wet areas getting wetter at the same time rapid population growth is a generic characteristic of many developing countries together they put people in developing countries at risk of water scarcity as an increasing water demand is met by a stagnant or declining water supply managed aquifer recharge mar can be used as a counteracting and sustainable step towards filling the gap between water supply and demand particularly in karstic aquifers because 20 25 of the global drinkable water supply is abstracted from these aquifers daher et al 2011 the choice of mar technique depends on physical landscape characteristics at the implementation site agostinetto et al 2013 dillon et al 2009 de jeude 2016 however although mar comprises widely researched and implemented techniques to the knowledge of authors there is a lack of knowledge on mar in karstic regions bakalowicz 2011 daher et al 2011 consequently a globally consistent and clear mar methodology for karstic regions in the literature is missing this paper investigates the potential of mar in the karstic and semi arid ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa with the use of gis multi criteria decision analysis gis mcda to identify suitable methods and locations for mar implementation in this context of balancing water demand and supply mar suitability maps are provided as a tool for decision making support while previous studies have exclusively focused on mar techniques bakalowicz 2011 daher et al 2011 el fadel et al 2016 escalante et al 2016 masciopinto et al 2012 xanke et al 2015 2016 or mar suitability mapping andreo et al 2008 chenini et al 2010 ioannidou 2016 karami et al 2016 kattaa et al 2010 oikonomidis et al 2015 rahman et al 2012 sener et al 2005 this study included both to capture linkages and dependencies between the selected mar technique and the mar suitability mapping procedure which affects the outcomes of the final mar suitability map the methodology presented synthesizes existing frameworks in a manner that allows for remote assessment of potential for mar in a karstic and semi arid region gale 2005 and igrac 2007 defined five main mar techniques spreading method induced bank infiltration well shaft and borehole recharge run off and rainwater harvesting and in channel modifications application of mar schemes in arid and semi arid regions was illustrated by gale 2005 and steinel 2012 these applications included floodwater spreading leaky dams check dams injection boreholes inter dune filtration rainwater harvesting irrigation channels bank filtration and injection wells while mar techniques posit interesting possibilities for exploiting groundwater resources in karstic aquifers daher et al 2011 humphreys 2011 milanovic 2005 particularly in mediterranean areas stevanovic 2015 they have mainly been implemented in australia nwqms 2009 vanderzalm et al 2009 with a few similar pilot projects in the usa dillon 2005 dillon et al 2009 sparse implementation of mar in karstic areas reverberates the current lack of knowledge below follows a short description of the most frequent mar techniques used in karstic regions 1 well shaft and borehole recharge rely on directly induced infiltration for instance through injection wells this technique may be applied in areas with deep aquifers escalante et al 2016 it does however need thorough primary investigation and pre treatment de jeude 2016 advantages include minimal evaporation losses rambags et al 2013 applicability in complex geology regardless of topography igrac 2007 and low spatial requirements for implementation steenbergen and tuinhof 2012 primary costs are relatively high escalante et al 2014 2 in channel modification systems enhance groundwater recharge by retaining surface water and controlling releases to facilitate high infiltration rates into the aquifer this technique may be applied to both shallow and deep aquifers in arid climates with ephemeral river streams steinel 2012 advantages include applicability in forested regions escalante et al 2016 which is an acknowledged constraint for most main mar techniques and small scale simple construction demands tuinhof et al 2012 however clogging and sedimentation call for continuous maintenance challenging economic justification given the short life span of the systems escalante et al 2016 xanke et al 2016 primary costs range from low to medium de jeude 2016 3 spreading methods involve the distribution of surface water in areas with high infiltration capacity and potential for percolation this technique may be applied to shallow aquifers in areas with sufficient surface layers of suitable material epikarst and mild slopes daher et al 2011 it is not suitable for recharging deep aquifers and requires large spatial extents for implementation escalante et al 2016 de jeude 2016 steinel 2012 as the oldest and most well established mar technique advantages include low requirements of technical expertise and prior knowledge as well as effective water purification processes initiated during the phases of infiltration and percolation primary costs are low as emphasized by several studies bakalowicz 2011 daher et al 2011 the selection of the appropriate site for mar implementation is vital environmental and social concerns in site selection should therefore be regarded in an early stage the complexity and heterogeneity of karstic regions makes it particularly challenging to generalize characteristic landscape features that reveal preferable mar locations remote sensing allows for retrieval of spatiotemporal data in vast or physically inaccessible areas such spatiotemporal data is effectively managed and analyzed in geographical information systems gis russo et al 2015 this justifies the growing popularity of gis in mar suitability analyses satellite data provide quick and useful baseline data on diverse factors directly or indirectly influencing groundwater movement through aquifers soil and rock types lineament and drainage density slope lithology geology and geomorphology with resolutions ranging from meters to kilometers consequently gis proves to be one of most effective tools for groundwater studies ghayoumian et al 2007 karami et al 2016 krishnamurthy et al 1996 rahman et al 2012 valverde et al 2016 although trade offs are inevitably made between accuracy precision and data availability van berkum 2010 in gis while various thematic layers have been considered in mar suitability mapping there is no consistent methodological approach applicable for all conditions the mar methodology must be defined according to main objectives data availability locally available material environmental and social concerns and so on although karstic regions are found on all continents not all inhibit semi arid climate in europe only the karstic mediterranean regions portray similarity to semi arid climate and are hence of relevance to this paper including countries like greece ioannidou 2016 oikonomidis et al 2015 italy cucchi et al 2008 polemio et al 2009 portugal rahman et al 2012 spain andreo et al 2008 and turkey sener et al 2005 in asia and the middle east karstic and semi arid regions were investigated in bangladesh adham et al 2010 shahid et al 2000 india dutta 2015 krishnamurthy et al 1996 machiwal et al 2011 mukherjee et al 2012 iran ghayoumian et al 2007 karami et al 2016 jordan alraggad and jasem 2010 lebanon daher et al 2011 and syria kattaa et al 2010 in africa although karstic zones play an important role for water supply in countries like south africa botswana and countries located near the mediterranean sea like tunisia chenini et al 2010 lack of research restricts existence of suitable papers investigating karstic and semi arid regions however semi arid regions in ethiopia fenta et al 2015 ghana forkuor et al 2013 and nigeria fashae et al 2014 have been studied table 1 summarizes the most cited papers investigating karstic and semi arid regions around the world fathi 2017 as can be seen 28 distinct thematic layers were identified and categorized as in situ observational and remotely sensed the nine most frequent thematic layers mentioned in the 21 peer reviewed papers are slope lineament density drainage density lithology precipitation geology proximity to surface water bodies depth to groundwater and land use land cover lulc in decreasing order likewise specifically for karst the most frequent thematic layers are slope lithology drainage and lineament density precipitation and infiltration altitude rock type soil and lulc three frameworks are currently prevalent for mar suitability mapping aquifer recharge assessment in karst and epikarst arak was developed by daher et al 2011 to solve theoretical and practical difficulties implementing mar systems in karstic regions this approach combines rock type infiltration and degree of karstification as thematic layers with gis restore maps such as geological and topographical maps in addition to field observations for comprehensive decision support in implementation of mar specifically for karstic regions limestone and dolomite are favored rock types whereas the degree of karstification reflects conduits in system field observations from tracer tests hydraulic spring tests geophysical techniques geological surveys and geochemical analysis restrict the framework to studies in which the area can be physically inspected daher et al 2011 proposed the following equation for weighting thematic layers for karstic regions 1 r e c h a r g e 0 6 e 0 2 r 0 1 i 0 1 k in which e is epikarst r is rock type i is infiltration and k is degree of karstification it was concluded that urbanization highly restricts the implementation of mar systems pointing to the value of land use and land cover for carbonate aquifers the altitude slope lithology infiltration soil aplis framework was proposed by andreo et al 2008 aplis estimates the mean annual recharge based on studies of eight carbonate aquifers in the south of spain mediterranean climate specifically for mar suitability mapping in karstic regions limestone and dolomite are favored with higher weight of the lithology map and recharge is increased with abundant exokarstic infiltration landforms the following weighting of thematic layers for karstic regions was proposed 2 r e c h a r g e a p 3 l 2 i s 0 9 in which a is altitude p is slope l is lithology i is infiltration and s is soil using this approach andreo et al 2008 concluded that evapotranspiration is not a key variable for recharge into groundwater in carbonate aquifers reservoir rock infiltration potential soil development and behavior of karst and epikarst riske is the third framework which was developed by kattaa et al 2010 to investigate potential groundwater recharge and vulnerability in karstic regions this approach considers land use and field tests for improving interpolation accuracy as in the two above mentioned frameworks limestone and dolomite are favored rock types and the degree of karstification and epikarst is considered representative for conduits in the system riske is an extension of epik dorfliger and zwahlen 1998 which was developed by zwahlen 2003 without consideration of soil layers kattaa et al 2010 proposed the following weighting of thematic layers for karstic regions 3 r e c h a r g e 0 1 r 0 5 i 0 1 s 0 2 k 0 2 e in which r is rock type i is infiltration s is soil k is degree of karstification and e is epikarst although distinctly named the frameworks bear high resemblance for instance the same classifications were applied for rock type maps in arak and lithology maps in aplis and the degree of karstification is considered in both arak riske and epik thus appraising differences between the aforementioned frameworks as nuances the following thematic layers are arguably identified as essential criteria for mar suitability analysis in karstic regions geology maps including karstic classes like limestone and dolomite lineament density maps reflecting the conduits in the system and soil maps with classes adapted to karstic regions in considering infiltration as a thematic layer the temporal evolution of diffusion which depends on rainfall intensity and duration is neglected infiltration is considered to have the highest rate in gentle slopes and lowest in steep slopes which favor surface run off however the authors of this paper argue that infiltration capacity alone as a thematic layer is not crucial for mar suitability analysis as infiltration is indirectly incorporated in slope and soil map layers building on the frameworks described above this paper presents a mar suitability analysis with a case study on the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa 1 1 case study the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area rtaa is shared between south eastern districts of botswana and north eastern parts of south africa see fig 1 the region suffers from water shortage due to erratic rainfall patterns and over exploitation of aquifers along with poorly managed water resources the botswanan side is characterized by urbanization development and rapid population growth staudt 2003 the south african side on the other hand is characterized by stabilized economic conditions and rural settlements with unclear water demand and supply ramoeli et al 2010 staudt 2002 the rtaa is located in a karstic and semi arid region subject to variation in surface water availability comparable to dryland areas in such dry areas rainfall is low 500 mm yr and inconsistent lópez and arrúe 1997 this may lead to low water productivity and increased risk of water insecurity habiba et al 2015 even if precipitation were to be fairly high 500 850 mm yr high rates of evapotranspiration would counteractively cause significant annual water losses alazard et al 2015 lópez and arrúe 1997 again prescribing risk of water insecurity the climate of the rtaa ranges from semi arid in the east to dry in the west overall classified as a semi arid region altchenko et al 2017 staudt 2003 rainfall is seasonally dependent with storms occurring in the months of october and april mean annual rainfall ranges between 100 mm and 1000 mm decreasing from east to west altchenko et al 2017 although uncertain climate change projections predict a probable increase in rainfall intensity altchenko et al 2017 taylor et al 2011 mean annual temperature ranges between 18 and 20 c staudt 2003 with maximum and minimum temperatures occurring in january and july respectively the rtaa presents a complex geology and topography xri blue 2017 particularly interesting geological formations are found in the flight zone the boundaries inside the rtaa where mainly dolomite with portions of chert have been subjected to karstification xri blue 2016 two aquifer systems are considered the ramotswa dolomite and the lephala formation comprising a vast area of the bushveld basin both aquifers are locally regarded as hydraulically linked through the pre dominant north south moving fracture zones altchenko et al 2017 staudt 2003 in the dolomites the active groundwater cycle initiates local karstification through structural lineaments creating large transmissivities and storativities altchenko et al 2017 geology maps of the rtaa and the flight zone are provided in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively while a detailed description of geological formations is given elsewhere altchenko et al 2017 staudt 2003 xri blue 2017 2 material and methods 2 1 geographic information system multi criteria decision analysis gis mcda gis mcda comprises a collection of methods and tools used to integrate spatially distributed geographical data with respect to established preferences and value judgements gis allows for automation interpretation and spatially extensive analysis management whilst mcda combines criteria of varying units through standardization and weight assignment ranking of potential mar areas can be done more thoroughly rahman et al 2012 and at lower cost karami et al 2016 oikonomidis et al 2015 valverde et al 2016 yeh et al 2016 by carrying out the mcda in gis gis mcda has been applied globally in countries with varying climate hydro patterns and geology such as greece ioannidou 2016 india kumar et al 2007 iran karami et al 2016 italy cucchi et al 2008 jordan alraggad and jasem 2010 portugal rahman et al 2012 spain andreo et al 2008 tunisia chenini et al 2010 and the usa russo et al 2015 gis mcda for mar suitability analysis consists of four structural components problem statement screening of suitable areas suitability mapping and sensitivity analysis see fig 4 these steps are subsequently presented below 2 1 1 problem statement the first step in gis mcda for mar suitability analysis is identification of issues to be addressed as mar may serve various purposes malczewski 1999 the problem statement forms foundation for establishing objective s intended to be reached with mar for the rtaa spreading method is considered more suitable with respect to practical aspects of implementation and associated costs 2 1 2 screening of suitable areas the second step in gis mcda for mar suitability analysis is the screening of suitable areas this step is carried out using boolean logic algebra rahman et al 2012 in gis operators and and or are used to obtain reflections of suitable and unsuitable areas cells with respect to selected criteria valverde et al 2016 i e cells that do not fulfill specified threshold values are removed from the analysis this is particularly useful for removal of cells with environmental and social concerns in cases where the nature of true false selection is problematic fuzzy logic methods should be considered feizizadeh et al 2014 in which member functions and kernels may be tailored to the area at hand three criteria were selected for the screening of suitable regions land use land cover slope and soil usda texture according to the e soter regional slope classification van engelen and dijkshoorn 2013 terrains with slopes exceeding 30 are defined as steep terrains mild slopes are favored for implementation of spreading methods meanwhile according to the textural soil triangle and its water holding capacity table provided by van engelen and dijkshoorn 2013 areas with clayey soils are regarded unsuitable furthermore the fao 2 2 food and agriculture organization of the united nations land use land cover was used to classify suitable and unsuitable areas as following areas with sparse vegetation bare lands cropland grassland and non cultivated were regarded suitable whereas water bodies urban areas evergreen and deciduous forest 40 and forest and shrub land 15 40 were regarded unsuitable a logical was used to derive suitable areas fulfilling the conditions of mild slopes 30 and absence of clay texture in the designated land cover classes 2 1 3 suitability mapping the third step in gis mcda for mar suitability analysis is suitability mapping this step is performed to estimate the degree to which mar objectives specified in the problem statement may be reached valverde et al 2016 suitability mapping requires specification of i criteria ii decision rule iii normalization and iv weight allocation the rtaa and the flight zone fz were subject to separate suitability mapping using lithology maps of low resolution 1000 m for the former and high resolution 50 m for the latter 2 1 3 1 criteria the criteria are a set of selected environmental factors that influence and hence represent the likely occurrence and movement of water in a zone with respect to the selected mar technique such influencing factors include lithology andreo et al 2008 karami et al 2016 geology fashae et al 2014 geomorphology fenta et al 2015 land cover and land use sener et al 2005 precipitation oikonomidis et al 2015 hydraulic groundwater head russo et al 2015 topography rahman et al 2012 soil mukherjee et al 2012 and so on the term criterion conceptualizes both targets and properties consequently adequate selection of criteria requires investigations of the area either in situ remotely or with the use of literature review as highlighted by malczewski and rinner 2016 selected criteria should be compressive and quantifiable meanwhile it is advised that selected criteria be non redundant and nominal van berkum 2010 nine criteria have been investigated with respect to karstic and semi arid regions as previously presented in table 1 out of these six criteria were chosen to identify the appropriate sites for implementing the spreading method in rtaa and the flight zone see fig 5 rainfall was not included due to low spatio temporal variability fathi 2017 furthermore proximity to water bodies and depth to groundwater were not included due to the seasonal ephemeral nature of surface water and lack of quality data respectively fathi 2017 2 1 3 2 decision rule the decision rule instructs the ranking of alternatives malczewski 1999 weighted linear combination wlc is based on linear aggregation of the results obtained with each criterion malczewski and rinner 2016 and is one of the most widely applied decision rules malczewski 1999 2000 valverde et al 2016 in the present study wlc was applied as a decision rule 2 1 3 3 normalization normalization is needed to extract relative suitability classifications before combining criteria in the resulting suitability map malczewski and rinner 2016 normalization may be carried out with step wise or linear functions malczewski 1999 with the latter being recommended for normalization of combined criteria rahman et al 2012 in the present study the six selected criteria were normalized as following step wise functions were applied for lithology land use land cover and soil piecewise linear functions were applied for slope and a single linear function was applied for drainage and lineament density see fig 6 table 2 provides an overview of selected thresholds for suitability classification of each thematic layer as spreading method relies on direct infiltration sandy loam and sand were assigned the highest value with respect to soil for the rtaa the highest value was assigned to dolomite and limestone due to high potential for water retention in addition to high secondary porosity andreo et al 2008 karami et al 2016 the lowest value was assigned to volcanic extrusive rock which has low infiltration rate mukherjee et al 2012 sener et al 2005 for the flight zone mud rock and shale were assigned the lowest value due to difficulties in implementing spreading methods karami et al 2016 whereas alluvium was assigned the highest value due to high primary porosity altchenko et al 2017 2 1 3 4 weight allocation weight allocation refers to the assignation of weights to each criterion for integration of the thematic layers this is essential as the relative importance of the criteria vary ghayoumian et al 2007 in the present study multi influencing factor mif shaban et al 2006 valverde et al 2016 was used to derive these weights first major and minor effects resulting from the interaction between the thematic layers were identified see fig 7 then the number of major effects score 1 and minor effects score 0 5 were summed finally the relative importance of each criterion division by total sum constituted the weights for each criterion as can be seen in table 3 a total of nine major effects and seven minor effects were identified resulting in a cumulative score of 12 5 points and the highest weight assigned to lithology an elaboration of the detection of major and minor effects is provided below lithology has a major effect on soil lineament density drainage density and land use and land cover lulc the major effect on soil arises as soil decisively emerges by geological processes matsukura et al 2002 wakatsuki and matsukura 2008 while the major effect on drainage density is due to the observed influence by geologic formation on drainage network as well as the development of river streams nickolas et al 2017 in addition the major effect on lineament is explained by the effect of geological process in development and genesis of formation of faults steen and andresen 1999 while there is a direct connection between lithology and lulc for instance in areas with alluvium forested areas or volcanic formations no roots briassoulis 2009 soil has a major effect on drainage density and lulc the major effect of soil on lulc arises due to the strong connection between roots and soil and the further related ecological succession and human exploitation briassoulis 2009 while soil plays a key role on hydraulic conductivity and therefore on recharge process as well as the path of river beds livneh et al 2015 lulc has a major effect on drainage density and minor effects on soil lineament density and slope respectively lulc plays a key role in determination of rainfall interception and runoff and therefore drainage density in addition vegetation can have direct impact on the soil as soils formed under forests are prone to weathering because forests grow in higher rainfall areas therefore more water movements in the root zone lamb and rehm 2017 lulc has a minor effect on lineament density as vegetation alignment is used for recognition of faults singhal and gupta 2010 and slope as the presence of vegetation directly influences slope stability slope has a major and a minor effect on drainage density and lulc respectively nadal romero et al 2014 showed the effects of slope angle and aspect of plant cover with respect to species richness besides slope plays an essential role in genesis of streams bansal and das 2009 the lineament density has a major effect on drainage density and a minor effect on lulc river beds can be affected by tectonic forces aghai et al 2008 vegetation appears in line of lineaments robinson et al 1983 for drainage density two minor effects on lineament and lulc respectively were considered due to the indirect impact of drainage density on human exploitation of land riis and biggs 2003 and the role in recognition of faults singhal and gupta 2010 in regions formed by karstification the weights resulting from the mif method varied by a fourfold lithology was given the highest weight 32 reflecting pertinence of the lithological parameters that govern recharge to the saturated zone karami et al 2016 and storativity in rocks with respect to its related secondary porosity andreo et al 2008 karami et al 2016 kattaa et al 2010 the second highest weight was given to land use land cover 20 followed by soil 16 slope 12 and lineament density 12 the lowest weight was given to drainage density 8 the synthesized recharge equation hence reads 4 r e c h a r g e 0 32 li 0 16 so 0 12 sl 0 20 lulc 0 12 ld 0 08 dd in which li is lithology so is soil sl is slope lulc is land use land cover ld is lineament density and dd is drainage density these weights fall within ranges used in previous studies on mar suitability in karstic and semi arid regions see fig 8 3 sensitivity analysis the fourth step in gis mcda for mar suitability mapping is sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis is used to obtain a measure of the robustness of the results the main source of uncertainty in gis mcda arise from the selected criteria and the defined weights malczewski 1999 if highly sensitive criteria are revealed in the sensitivity analysis the deterministic approach to mar suitability mapping may be altered to a probabilistic approach a vast number of methodologies for sensitivity analysis in gis mcda are described in the literature malczewski 1999 malczewski and rinner 2016 rahman et al 2012 shaban et al 2006 valverde et al 2016 one approach is the re assignation of criterion values as proposed by shankar and mohan 2005 in the present study the approach described by store and kangas 2001 and valverde et al 2016 was used the weights of the criteria were systematically changed by increments appraising effects on dynamic interlinkages between the selected criteria 3 1 data collection and preparation table 4 displays the data sources used to generate the input maps for the gis mcda a digital elevation model dem was obtained from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster data the dem was used to generate the slope map in qgis for this two directional gradient filters x direction and y direction were applied to the dem using in built linear filters from the ilwis software jaiswal et al 2003 slopes were computed from the resulting map as following 5 s l o p e 100 d x 2 d y 2 p i x e l s i z e d e m in which dx filtered dem with x gradient filter dy filtered dem with y gradient filter the lithology maps were assembled from two sources sadc hydrological map for rtaa and merged simplified geology map provided by xri blue lulc was obtained from the fao global land use and land cover map fao globcover with 300 m horizontal resolution soil atlas of africa was provided from the european soil data centre this was overlaid by layers from the harmonized world soil database the input maps are shown in fig 9 4 results and discussion 4 1 suitable areas fig 10 shows the map resulting from screening of suitable areas as can be seen the distinction between suitable and unsuitable areas is poorly pronounced and merely gives a rough indication of areas suitable for implementation of spreading methods the final mar suitability map of the rtaa is shown in fig 11 very high suitability is identified north of the flight zone at the border between botswana and south africa and south west on the botswanan side table 5 summarizes the mar suitability classes i relative to suitable areas of the rtaa and the flight zone and ii relative to the total areas of the rtaa and the flight zone as can be seen there are substantially more moderately suitable areas than very suitable areas in the rtaa this relative difference is however smaller for the flight zone relative to the total areas the dominant mar suitability class in the rtaa is moderately suitable while more than half of the flight zone is suitable however a slightly larger percentage of the rtaa is very suitable as compared to the flight zone the mar suitability map of the flight zone is shown in fig 12 although there is an agreement regarding highly suitable areas at the border between botswana and south africa flight zone more suitable areas are identified with higher resolution particularly the extent of very suitable and suitable areas identified at the country borders is interesting to the transboundary nature of the aquifer fig 13 illustrates the effect of a finer resolution lithology in the flight zone 4 2 sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity analysis are provided in fig 14 as can be seen the most sensitive criteria were lithology li and land use and land cover lulc for the rtaa and lithology and drainage density for the flight zone the overall least sensitive criterion was soil so while neither drainage density dd lineament density ld nor slope sl were particularly sensitive the sensitivity analysis concludes that robust results were obtained with respect to the most suitable areas for mar using spreading method this points to the potential of the methodology proposed for karstic and semi arid regions with similar data availability for actual planning and implementation of spreading method in the rtaa the maps can be used as a decision making tool to consolidate the south african and the botswanan sides in a collaborative approach furthermore such maps can be used in a stakeholder approach identify unknown social concerns and gain public consent with the implementation of mar 5 conclusion in this paper gis mcda was used for mar suitability mapping of a transboundary aquifer in a karstic and semi arid region while previous studies have focused on the selection of mar technique s or the methodology of mar suitability mapping exclusively this paper combines both in systematic development of a karst specific methodology to generate mar suitability maps as a decision making tool mar suitability maps can be of exquisite value for the implementation of mar in transboundary aquifers where contrasting objectives from two or more sides often occur in this study the most suitable areas for spreading methods were identified at the border between south africa and botswana and in the flight zone of the ramotswa transboundary aquifer area the methodology presented in this paper consolidates and further builds on three prevalent frameworks in mar suitability mapping with documented use in karstic and semi arid areas although the method cannot be generalized for karstic aquifers in semi arid regions using only one case study it can be used to gain further insight to more karst specific features dictating potential for mar in such regions as more case studies are considered in this study two karst specific considerations were made lithology and lineament density firstly high lineament density has been found to coincide with high fractures and hence more conduits and windows towards the karstic aquifer this implies a higher recharge to the aquifer secondly while other studies have considered alluvium only as very suitable areas for recharge this paper additionally considered dolomite and limestone specifically found in karstic regions however it is stressed that more case studies are needed to verify the actual methodological transferability to other karstic and semi arid regions in order to draw conclusions about the generalization of the methodology furthermore the use of satellite data embeds a trade off between precision and accuracy at various spatiotemporal scales the uncertainty in inputs to the gis mcda slope soil land use land cover lithology drainage density lineament density was not quantitatively assessed further development of the methodology presented in this paper would include a quantitative uncertainty analysis following the sensitivity analysis this is however left for future studies future research should also adapt the method to other mar techniques such as well shaft and borehole recharge or in channel modifications with specific application to karstic regions this paper has argued the significance of considering both the mar technique and the mar suitability mapping procedure when identifying the potential for mar in a karstic and semi arid region and furthermore unified existing prevalent frameworks for suitability mapping on a case study with limited data availability as thus the present paper adds a small step on which future research can build on declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
