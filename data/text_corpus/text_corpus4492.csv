widely encountered in ocean engineering applications keywords drag reduction vles sharp corner square cylinder 1 introduction in numerous engineering applications such as ocean engineering wind engineering ground and underwater transportation bluff body flow widely exists it also has been the research topic for decades choi et al 2008 prsic et al 2014 many fundamental flow physics and mechanism can be observed in the bluff body flow such as the flow separation vortex shedding flow unsteadiness also the flow structures around the bluff body make the bluff body subjected to unsteady forces the drag force is one important flow parameter for application concern for the structural form the rectangle is a widely used structural section shape it is thus of significant application background and important academic value to study the complex flow structures and forces around a square cylinder the drag reduction of turbulent flow past a bluff body has attracted extensive interests in both academia and industry for several decades for industrial applications it can reduce the fuel consumption and improve the performance of the vehicles in academic research the flow configuration provides abundant fundamental problems such as massive separated flow unsteady vortex evolution flow control strategies etc generally the flow control strategies for drag reduction can be divided into two main groups choi et al 2008 shehata et al 2017 passive flow control and active flow control for the active flow control it is necessary to apply additional energy externally to control the flow which generally requires other mechanical devices to achieve the additional energy supply some studies have applied the effects of electromagnetic forces on the boundary layer and channel flow to reduce the drag pang and choi 2004 thomas et al 2008 wang et al 2013 used the active control method of placing two rotating sub columns behind a single cylinder to reduce the drag synthetic jets are also applied for active flow control of bluff body drag reduction and it is found to be an efficient method dalla longa et al 2017 han et al 2013 moreover a variety of active flow control method can be found in different literatures choi et al 2008 cattafesta and sheplak 2011 as to the passive flow control it is common to use the techniques such as changing the shape of the bluff body add extra slabs small blocks mazellier et al 2012 uses adaptive porous flaps on the upper and lower sides of the square column to reduce the resistance of the fluid flowing through the square column malekzadeh et al 2017 and ding et al 2013 both place obstacles at a certain distance before and after the bluff body to change the flow structure and study the effects of the distance between the disturbing obstacle and the square column on the drag reduction gao et al 2017 use the slit on the drag reduction of cylinder flow the present study focuses on the passive flow control method of modifying the geometry to reduce the drag turbulent flow around a square cylinder has been a classic flow test case lyn et al 1995 for various fundamental studies it was also used for drag reduction studies kurata et al 2009 he et al 2014 sohankar et al 2015 previous experiments see fig 1 have found that by shaping the corner of the square cylinder the drag can be reduced by around 50 for some conditions kurata et al 2009 he et al 2014 although the significant drag reduction has been observed in the experiments the underlying physical mechanism has not been well understood on the basis the present study aims to reveal some of the key flow mechanics based on high fidelity numerical simulation and also explores the further possibility to reduce the drag on the square cylinder high fidelity simulation such as large eddy simulation les has been applied for various flow control studies rumsey and nishino 2011 han and krajnovic 2014 it shows high potential to investigate the involved flow mechanics however les suffers from the high computation cost for high re number turbulent flow in recent years hybrid turbulence modelling method sagaut et al 2013 has been developed rapidely as it combies the advantages of different turbulence modelling approaches several hybrid rans les methods have been developed and applied for many complex turbulent flow simulations spalart 2009 chaouat 2017 usta and korkut 2018 recently a relatively new variant of vles very large eddy simulation turbulence method is proposed han and krajnovic 2013 2015 and also has been validated in several classic turbulent flow cases and it performs very well it is found that the vles method can provide satisfactory predictions using quite coarse computational mesh and thus suitable for complex high re turbulent flow on the basis the second objective of the present study is to assess the vles method for passive flow control problems 2 vles turbulence modelling the vles method han and krajnovic 2013 applied in the present study is based on the standard k ε turbulence model the governing equations eqs 1 3 of turbulent kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate ε are the same as those in the standard k ε turbulence model the turbulent viscosity is modelled by introducing a new resolution control function i e rcf 1 d ρ k d t p k ρ ε x j μ μ t σ k k x j 2 d ρ ε d t ε k c ε 1 p k c ε 2 ρ ε x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j 3 μ t r c f ρ c μ k 2 ε in the above equation the resolution control function i e rcf is the core of vles modelling it has the form shown in eq 4 where l c l i and l k are the cut off length scale integral length scale and kolmogorov length scale respectively as shown in eq 5 4 r c f min 1 0 1 0 exp β l c l k 1 0 exp β l i l k 2 5 l c c v l e s δ x δ y δ z 1 3 l i k 3 2 ε l k v 3 4 ε 1 4 where the model constants are β 0 002 and c vles 0 61 with the mesh resolution changing the resolution control function rcf changes automatically it then determines how much of turbulence is modelled and how much of turbulence resolved thus with different mesh resolution the vles method can work in different modelling modes smoothly ranging from the rans les to dns more details about the vles method can be found elsewhere han and krajnovic 2013 han and krajnovic 2015 3 numerical details the present vles method has been implemented in the open source cfd toolbox openfoam jasak 2009 the unsteady numerical simulations are performed using the modified pimplefoam solver the convective terms are discretized using a second order central differencing scheme coupled with a small fraction of first order upwind scheme the temporal advancement is approximated using a second order implicit crank nicolson scheme the new vles model is applied for the flow past a square cylinder and its variants with the reynolds number of 22000 based on the cylinder edge length d and incoming velocity u 0 the square cylinder is aligned in the z spanwise direction and the inlet flow is set in the x streamwise direction the computational domain has a physical extent of 20d 14d 4d three different meshes are used the grid is clustered near the wall and the first node is located around y 1 0 as shown in fig 2 at the near wall region the boundary layer type mesh is applied i e in the wall normal direction the first mesh is located at y d 1 5 10 3 resulting in the non dimensional wall distance of around y 1 0 for the first closest mesh to the wall the mesh scale in the wall parallel direction is around δx 22 and in the span wise direction the mesh scale is around δz 89 away from the wall the mesh scale is increased exponentially in the wall normal direction uniform velocity is imposed at the inlet and periodic conditions are applied at the spanwise direction non slip wall conditions are used for the solid walls for the turbulence quantities k and ε at the inlet they are determined based on the values of 1 for modelled turbulent intensity and 5 for the ratio of modelled turbulent viscosity to laminar viscosity for the flow past a square cylinder i e the natural flow without cut corner flow control three meshes are applied to study the mesh resolution effects on the flow predictions the first mesh is quite coarse containing about 0 77 million cells the second one is by fining the first mesh near the square cylinder resulting in a mesh containing about 1 2 million cells and the third one is about 2 0 million cells the predictions with the three meshes are compared in the following sections and they are found to agree with each other well for the flow past a shaped corner cylinder i e the controlled flow three meshes are also used the mesh structures and the computational domain are the same as in the natural flow case the first mesh contains about 0 9 million cells the second relatively fine mesh contains about 1 7 million cells and the third fine mesh contains about 3 8 million cells the predictions with the three meshes are compared in the following sections the results agree with each other well on the three meshes 4 results and discussions 4 1 natural flow past a square cylinder at re 22000 fig 3 shows the comparisons of the mean velocity along the central line in wake after the cylinder by the vles model and experiments lyn et al 1995 along with previous results of des model barone and roy 2006 which is performed on a quite fine mesh containing about 8 5 million cells generally the predictions by the present vles model are quite close to the experimental date and the previous des results in both the near wake and far wake regions fig 4 shows the rms root mean square velocities along the central line in the wake by the present vles models along with experimental date and previous des results as can be seen from the figure the general trend and the peak of rms velocities can be well predicted by the present vles model the rms velocity in the z direction has no experimental results from previous experimental study fig 4 also shows the non dimensional tke turbulence kinetic energy of vles on the three meshes another observation is that with increasing the mesh resolution the change of the vles prediction is less significant considering the coarse mesh used this means that the vles model can predict the main flow structures very well the comparisons of the velocity results confirm that the present vles model based on the standard k ε turbulence model can efficiently resolve the flow structures for the flow past a square cylinder and the results are generally better than previous des results barone and roy 2006 4 2 controlled flow past a square cylinder with cut corner control method 1 cm 1 the first kind of passive flow control for the drag reduction of the square cylinder is based on previous investigations kurata et al 2009 he et al 2014 fig 1 shows the square cylinder with the cut corners referred to as cm 1 previous experiments have found that with different cut corner lengths the drag reduction effects differ a lot in some cases the drag reduction is quite significant in the present study two test cases are selected as they have significant drag reduction effects the first case referred to as f1 has the cut corner scales of c1 d 0 15 and c2 d 0 15 and the second case referred to as f2 has the scales of c1 d 0 20 and c2 d 0 15 for convenience in the following text they are called cases f1 and f2 f1 means that the cut corner scales are 5 mm for c1 and 5 mm for c2 and f2 means that the cut corner scales are 10 mm for c1 and 5 mm for c2 as in the experiments the global flow parameters for the baseline case f0 and two shaped corner cases f1 and f2 are summarized in table 1 with the experimental date and some previous simulation results it can be found that the present vles model generally gives good predictions compared with the experimental date for all the three cases the present simulation predicts a significant drag reduction of around 39 for case f1 and 48 for case f2 which are quite close to experimental date the results show that with the drag reduction the strouhal number is increasing the rms drag and rms lift coefficient decreasing in the wake of the cylinders the mean velocity profiles drop to below zero indicating a recirculation region the distance between the rear surface of the cylinder and the location where the mean velocity restores to zero is defined as the length of the recirculation region fig 5 shows the mean streamwise velocity in the central line compared with case f0 the recirculation regions of case f1 and f2 become significantly larger and the result of case f2 is slightly larger than the case f1 it means that the length of the recirculation region is evidently increased for controlled cut corner cases the length of the recirculation region is related to the drag reduction significantly and the longer of the length the smaller of the drag moreover the maximum reversed velocity in the wake region in both of cases f1 and f2 is larger than that in the case f0 which is nearly twice of that in case f0 in the downstream recovery area the wake recovery velocities of case f1 and f2 are slightly larger than that of case f0 the mean velocity and the second invariant of the velocity gradient q for different cases are shown in fig 6 where case f0 is the baseline case f1 and f2 are the controlled shaped corner cases the mean velocity shows that cases f1 and f2 give a longer recirculation region compared with the baseline f0 which are consistent with previous observations for the cases f1 and f2 a much larger drag reduction is observed in case f2 however the recirculation region of case f2 behind the cylinder is just slightly bigger than that in the case f1 and the width of the flow around the cylinder seems become narrow in case f2 the results imply that the drag reduction mechanisms of the case f1 and f2 are not the same previous study balachandar et al 1997 demonstrates that for the turbulent flow around the cylinder bluff body the longer of the recirculation region in the wake the smaller of the drag and the narrower of the wake region the smaller of the drag thus the cases f1 and f2 correspond to two different flow mechanisms the results of q in fig 6 show that with the drag reduction the wake region seems to become narrow and more stable it also shows that bigger vortex structures can be observed in cases f1 and f2 compared with the baseline f0 from fig 7 it can be seen that there are two evident vortex structures on the upper and lower sides of the square cylinder in case f0 in case f1 and f2 the vortex structure is gradually compressed toward the wall surface and gradually moves back thus the boundary layer becomes thinner it leads to a narrower recirculation region it is because that a small vortex structure is formed at the cut corner region and the recirculation region in the cut corner acts as a reshaping mechanism that allows the flow to go around the new corner more easily so the separation is suppressed at the upper and lower sides of the square cylinder fig 8 shows the time averaged streamlines around the cylinders it is clear that in fig 8 a for case f0 the streamlines pass by the front edges and move away from the side surfaces forming a large separation near the side surfaces and the recirculation region is short and wide as for the cut corner case shown in fig 8 b the streamlines go around the cut corners in fact there is a small recirculation flow inside the cut corner and the streamlines at the cut corner show the vortex structures well 4 3 controlled flow past a square cylinder with cut corner control method 2 cm 2 the previous section confirms that the present numerical methods based on vles modelling can give satisfactory results for passive drag control of square cylinder thus it is further applied to explore the possibility to further reduce the drag of the cylinder here it is proposed that an extra cut is applied for the previous cut corner cylinder which means that two cuts are used for the square cylinder fig 9 shows the sketch of the passive control method for the square cylinder and the new proposed method cm 2 is shown in the right figure of fig 9 fig 9 shows the square cylinder with the cut corners in the present study the passive control method cm 2 is developed based on the control method cm 1 i e the cases f1 and f2 here there are six test cases designed case 1 has the cut corner scale of b1 d 0 05 with b1 b2 case 2 has the scale of b1 d 0 075 with b1 b2 and case 3 has the scale of b1 d 0 1 with b1 b2 each case can also combine with the case f1 or f2 thus there are six cases in total for convenience in the following text they are called f1 f2 a f1 f2 b f1 f2 c as discussed in previous sections three different meshes are applied to investigate the effects of grid resolution on the numerical results for the controlled flow cases three different meshes are also applied i e the first mesh contains about 0 9 million cells the second relatively fine mesh contains about 1 7 million cells and the third fine mesh contains about 3 8 million cells here the results from case f1 b with three meshes are given other cases are similar and not given here table 2 shows the global flow parameters predicted by the vles model with three different meshes it can be seen that the global parameters are generally agree with each other very well on the three meshes for the drag coefficient the three meshes can give satisfactory results fig 10 is the mean velocities along the central line of the shaped cylinder on three meshes by the vles model it can be seen that the three meshes give quite close predictions it demonstrates that the results of vles study on the relatively coarse mesh i e 1 7 million cells are reliable thus for other simulations in cm 2 cases the mesh containing about 1 7 million cells are applied on the other hand it also shows that the vles model can predict the flow structures quite well around a square cylinder even using a coarse mesh the predicted global flow parameters for the six shaped corner cases i e f1 a f1 b f1 c f2 a f2 b and f2 c are summarized in table 3 apparently the drag reduction has been achieved an interesting observation is that apart from the case f1 a which has nearly the same drag reduction as in previous case f1 the other 5 cases all give a much larger drag reduction and the drag reduction can be reduced up to around 60 as to the changes to the case f1 the case f1 a has nearly the same drag as in case f1 but with the extra cut increasing slightly cases f1 b and f1 c the drag changes significantly as to the changes to the case f2 the drag results are nearly the same for the cases f2 a f2 b and f2 c and a drag reduction of around 60 can be obtained it should be noted that as shown in table 3 the proposed passive control method cm 2 can reduce the drag coefficient to a value of around 0 9 which is much smaller than the drag coefficient of around 1 1 for the turbulent flow around a smooth circular cylinder at the reynolds number of around 22000 dong and karniadakis 2005 the second invariant of the velocity gradient q for different cases are shown in fig 11 where the case f1 is the baseline case case f1 a and case f1 c are the controlled cases for the case f1 a and case f1 c a much larger drag reduction is observed in case f1 c see table 3 the width of the flow around the cylinder becomes narrow in the case f1 c the results imply that the drag reduction mechanisms of the case f1 and case f1 c are not the same it also shows that bigger vortex structures can be observed in cases f1 a and f1 c compared with the baseline case f1 the other cases in cm 2 model have similar results which are not shown here fig 12 shows the mean streamwise velocity along the central line of the cylinder in fig 12 a the recirculation region of case 4 3 i e case f2 is still the longest and the recirculation regions of case f1 a f1 b and f1 have nearly the same length the maximum reversed velocity in the recirculation region of cm 2 method is smaller than that in cm 1 method as to the recovery velocity in the far wake region the recovery velocity in the case f1 f1 a f2 f1 b f1 c is increasing the same conclusion can be drawn from fig 12 b although the length of recirculation region of the case f1 b f1 a is nearly the same as in the case f1 the drag coefficient of case f1 b is much smaller which demonstrates that the drag reduction is not only related to the length of the recirculation region fig 13 shows the comparisons of mean velocity contours in the wake region as can be seem from the figures the length of the wake region is generally shorter than that in cm 1 model and the width of the wake becomes significantly narrower as studied by the balachandar et al 1997 the drag of the turbulent flow around the cylinder is related to the width and length of the wake region in high reynolds number the ratio of the recirculation region length l to the wake width h is inversely proportional to the drag force the conclusion is consistent to the results from the present numerical simulation for example the recirculation length of the wake of case f1 c and case f1 a is nearly the same as that of case f1 but the width of case f1 c is narrower which results in a larger ratio of length to width l h and finally a small drag force however the width of case f1 a is nearly the same as that of case f1 thus the drag coefficient of case f1 a is very close to that of case f1 as shown in table 3 compared with the previous control method cm 1 the proposed control model cm 2 combines the drag reduction mechanisms of both the short recirculation region and the narrow wake region fig 14 shows the streamlines contours for the cases of f1 f1 a f1 b f1 c f2 f2 a f2 b f2 c respectively in fig 14 b i e case f1 a there are two symmetric vortex structures on the upper and lower sides of the square cylinder compared with the case f1 the vortex structure becomes smaller and moves backward and the boundary layer becomes thinner in fig 14 d i e case f1 c there is only one vortex structure on the upper and lower sides the boundary layer becomes much thinner and the separation is suppressed a small vortex structure is generated in the second cut corner due to the two small vortex structures the flow around the cylinder surface can be attached to the wall surface better than that in cm 1 method fig 14 also shows the time averaged streamlines around the cylinders for case f1 f1 a and f1 c from the streamlines downstream of the square and considering the results in fig 12 the lengths of the recirculation region for the three cases are nearly the same however it can be seen from the figure that the width of the downstream recirculation region of f1 is significantly larger than those of the other two cases comparing case f1 a with case f1 c it can be seen that when the second corner is large the obtained downstream recirculation region has a smaller width and a better drag reduction effect however when the second cut corner reaches a certain size the drag reduction effect no longer changes significantly such as the cases f1 b f1 c f2 b and f2 c 5 conclusions in summary a new unified hybrid turbulence simulation approach namely vles method is applied for the complex unsteady flow around a square cylinder with a reynolds number of 22000 both the baseline flow case and the passive flow controlled cases are studies the vles calculations are performed on three different meshes in order to investigate the efficiency of the model it is found that the vles model can efficiently capture the flow structures such as the vortex shedding flow separation even on a quite coarse mesh compared with previous les and des studies the vles predictions agree with available experimental date very well for both the baseline flow and the controlled flow it implies that the vles method has high potential for complex flow control simulations based on the vles method which has been implemented in openfoam toolbox drag reduction of the square cylinder are explored using a passive flow control method via cut corners at the front edges of the cylinder two kinds of control methods are studied the first one is based on previous investigations and the second one is a new proposed flow control method with two cut corners it is found that both the cut corner control method at the front edge of the square cylinder can achieve large drag reduction the new proposed control method cm 2 even performs better for drag reduction and the drag can be reduced by about 60 for several cases such as case f1 b f1 c f2 a f2 b and f2 c in cm 2 method when the second corner reaches a certain scale the drag reduction effect keeps nearly unchanged regardless of the size of the first corner the flow mechanisms are explored the second cut corner can depress the flow separation at the upper and lower sides of the cylinder resulting in a narrow wake region also the recirculation region in the wake is shortened with cut corners the drag reduction is closely related to the ratio of the recirculation length to the wake width i e l h the proposed control method can combine both of the effects of shortening the recirculation region and narrowing the wake width it is worth to perform further studies for the new controlled method to reduce the drag acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the

containing about 1 2 million cells and the third one is about 2 0 million cells the predictions with the three meshes are compared in the following sections and they are found to agree with each other well for the flow past a shaped corner cylinder i e the controlled flow three meshes are also used the mesh structures and the computational domain are the same as in the natural flow case the first mesh contains about 0 9 million cells the second relatively fine mesh contains about 1 7 million cells and the third fine mesh contains about 3 8 million cells the predictions with the three meshes are compared in the following sections the results agree with each other well on the three meshes 4 results and discussions 4 1 natural flow past a square cylinder at re 22000 fig 3 shows the comparisons of the mean velocity along the central line in wake after the cylinder by the vles model and experiments lyn et al 1995 along with previous results of des model barone and roy 2006 which is performed on a quite fine mesh containing about 8 5 million cells generally the predictions by the present vles model are quite close to the experimental date and the previous des results in both the near wake and far wake regions fig 4 shows the rms root mean square velocities along the central line in the wake by the present vles models along with experimental date and previous des results as can be seen from the figure the general trend and the peak of rms velocities can be well predicted by the present vles model the rms velocity in the z direction has no experimental results from previous experimental study fig 4 also shows the non dimensional tke turbulence kinetic energy of vles on the three meshes another observation is that with increasing the mesh resolution the change of the vles prediction is less significant considering the coarse mesh used this means that the vles model can predict the main flow structures very well the comparisons of the velocity results confirm that the present vles model based on the standard k ε turbulence model can efficiently resolve the flow structures for the flow past a square cylinder and the results are generally better than previous des results barone and roy 2006 4 2 controlled flow past a square cylinder with cut corner control method 1 cm 1 the first kind of passive flow control for the drag reduction of the square cylinder is based on previous investigations kurata et al 2009 he et al 2014 fig 1 shows the square cylinder with the cut corners referred to as cm 1 previous experiments have found that with different cut corner lengths the drag reduction effects differ a lot in some cases the drag reduction is quite significant in the present study two test cases are selected as they have significant drag reduction effects the first case referred to as f1 has the cut corner scales of c1 d 0 15 and c2 d 0 15 and the second case referred to as f2 has the scales of c1 d 0 20 and c2 d 0 15 for convenience in the following text they are called cases f1 and f2 f1 means that the cut corner scales are 5 mm for c1 and 5 mm for c2 and f2 means that the cut corner scales are 10 mm for c1 and 5 mm for c2 as in the experiments the global flow parameters for the baseline case f0 and two shaped corner cases f1 and f2 are summarized in table 1 with the experimental date and some previous simulation results it can be found that the present vles model generally gives good predictions compared with the experimental date for all the three cases the present simulation predicts a significant drag reduction of around 39 for case f1 and 48 for case f2 which are quite close to experimental date the results show that with the drag reduction the strouhal number is increasing the rms drag and rms lift coefficient decreasing in the wake of the cylinders the mean velocity profiles drop to below zero indicating a recirculation region the distance between the rear surface of the cylinder and the location where the mean velocity restores to zero is defined as the length of the recirculation region fig 5 shows the mean streamwise velocity in the central line compared with case f0 the recirculation regions of case f1 and f2 become significantly larger and the result of case f2 is slightly larger than the case f1 it means that the length of the recirculation region is evidently increased for controlled cut corner cases the length of the recirculation region is related to the drag reduction significantly and the longer of the length the smaller of the drag moreover the maximum reversed velocity in the wake region in both of cases f1 and f2 is larger than that in the case f0 which is nearly twice of that in case f0 in the downstream recovery area the wake recovery velocities of case f1 and f2 are slightly larger than that of case f0 the mean velocity and the second invariant of the velocity gradient q for different cases are shown in fig 6 where case f0 is the baseline case f1 and f2 are the controlled shaped corner cases the mean velocity shows that cases f1 and f2 give a longer recirculation region compared with the baseline f0 which are consistent with previous observations for the cases f1 and f2 a much larger drag reduction is observed in case f2 however the recirculation region of case f2 behind the cylinder is just slightly bigger than that in the case f1 and the width of the flow around the cylinder seems become narrow in case f2 the results imply that the drag reduction mechanisms of the case f1 and f2 are not the same previous study balachandar et al 1997 demonstrates that for the turbulent flow around the cylinder bluff body the longer of the recirculation region in the wake the smaller of the drag and the narrower of the wake region the smaller of the drag thus the cases f1 and f2 correspond to two different flow mechanisms the results of q in fig 6 show that with the drag reduction the wake region seems to become narrow and more stable it also shows that bigger vortex structures can be observed in cases f1 and f2 compared with the baseline f0 from fig 7 it can be seen that there are two evident vortex structures on the upper and lower sides of the square cylinder in case f0 in case f1 and f2 the vortex structure is gradually compressed toward the wall surface and gradually moves back thus the boundary layer becomes thinner it leads to a narrower recirculation region it is because that a small vortex structure is formed at the cut corner region and the recirculation region in the cut corner acts as a reshaping mechanism that allows the flow to go around the new corner more easily so the separation is suppressed at the upper and lower sides of the square cylinder fig 8 shows the time averaged streamlines around the cylinders it is clear that in fig 8 a for case f0 the streamlines pass by the front edges and move away from the side surfaces forming a large separation near the side surfaces and the recirculation region is short and wide as for the cut corner case shown in fig 8 b the streamlines go around the cut corners in fact there is a small recirculation flow inside the cut corner and the streamlines at the cut corner show the vortex structures well 4 3 controlled flow past a square cylinder with cut corner control method 2 cm 2 the previous section confirms that the present numerical methods based on vles modelling can give satisfactory results for passive drag control of square cylinder thus it is further applied to explore the possibility to further reduce the drag of the cylinder here it is proposed that an extra cut is applied for the previous cut corner cylinder which means that two cuts are used for the square cylinder fig 9 shows the sketch of the passive control method for the square cylinder and the new proposed method cm 2 is shown in the right figure of fig 9 fig 9 shows the square cylinder with the cut corners in the present study the passive control method cm 2 is developed based on the control method cm 1 i e the cases f1 and f2 here there are six test cases designed case 1 has the cut corner scale of b1 d 0 05 with b1 b2 case 2 has the scale of b1 d 0 075 with b1 b2 and case 3 has the scale of b1 d 0 1 with b1 b2 each case can also combine with the case f1 or f2 thus there are six cases in total for convenience in the following text they are called f1 f2 a f1 f2 b f1 f2 c as discussed in previous sections three different meshes are applied to investigate the effects of grid resolution on the numerical results for the controlled flow cases three different meshes are also applied i e the first mesh contains about 0 9 million cells the second relatively fine mesh contains about 1 7 million cells and the third fine mesh contains about 3 8 million cells here the results from case f1 b with three meshes are given other cases are similar and not given here table 2 shows the global flow parameters predicted by the vles model with three different meshes it can be seen that the global parameters are generally agree with each other very well on the three meshes for the drag coefficient the three meshes can give satisfactory results fig 10 is the mean velocities along the central line of the shaped cylinder on three meshes by the vles model it can be seen that the three meshes give quite close predictions it demonstrates that the results of vles study on the relatively coarse mesh i e 1 7 million cells are reliable thus for other simulations in cm 2 cases the mesh containing about 1 7 million cells are applied on the other hand it also shows that the vles model can predict the flow structures quite well around a square cylinder even using a coarse mesh the predicted global flow parameters for the six shaped corner cases i e f1 a f1 b f1 c f2 a f2 b and f2 c are summarized in table 3 apparently the drag reduction has been achieved an interesting observation is that apart from the case f1 a which has nearly the same drag reduction as in previous case f1 the other 5 cases all give a much larger drag reduction and the drag reduction can be reduced up to around 60 as to the changes to the case f1 the case f1 a has nearly the same drag as in case f1 but with the extra cut increasing slightly cases f1 b and f1 c the drag changes significantly as to the changes to the case f2 the drag results are nearly the same for the cases f2 a f2 b and f2 c and a drag reduction of around 60 can be obtained it should be noted that as shown in table 3 the proposed passive control method cm 2 can reduce the drag coefficient to a value of around 0 9 which is much smaller than the drag coefficient of around 1 1 for the turbulent flow around a smooth circular cylinder at the reynolds number of around 22000 dong and karniadakis 2005 the second invariant of the velocity gradient q for different cases are shown in fig 11 where the case f1 is the baseline case case f1 a and case f1 c are the controlled cases for the case f1 a and case f1 c a much larger drag reduction is observed in case f1 c see table 3 the width of the flow around the cylinder becomes narrow in the case f1 c the results imply that the drag reduction mechanisms of the case f1 and case f1 c are not the same it also shows that bigger vortex structures can be observed in cases f1 a and f1 c compared with the baseline case f1 the other cases in cm 2 model have similar results which are not shown here fig 12 shows the mean streamwise velocity along the central line of the cylinder in fig 12 a the recirculation region of case 4 3 i e case f2 is still the longest and the recirculation regions of case f1 a f1 b and f1 have nearly the same length the maximum reversed velocity in the recirculation region of cm 2 method is smaller than that in cm 1 method as to the recovery velocity in the far wake region the recovery velocity in the case f1 f1 a f2 f1 b f1 c is increasing the same conclusion can be drawn from fig 12 b although the length of recirculation region of the case f1 b f1 a is nearly the same as in the case f1 the drag coefficient of case f1 b is much smaller which demonstrates that the drag reduction is not only related to the length of the recirculation region fig 13 shows the comparisons of mean velocity contours in the wake region as can be seem from the figures the length of the wake region is generally shorter than that in cm 1 model and the width of the wake becomes significantly narrower as studied by the balachandar et al 1997 the drag of the turbulent flow around the cylinder is related to the width and length of the wake region in high reynolds number the ratio of the recirculation region length l to the wake width h is inversely proportional to the drag force the conclusion is consistent to the results from the present numerical simulation for example the recirculation length of the wake of case f1 c and case f1 a is nearly the same as that of case f1 but the width of case f1 c is narrower which results in a larger ratio of length to width l h and finally a small drag force however the width of case f1 a is nearly the same as that of case f1 thus the drag coefficient of case f1 a is very close to that of case f1 as shown in table 3 compared with the previous control method cm 1 the proposed control model cm 2 combines the drag reduction mechanisms of both the short recirculation region and the narrow wake region fig 14 shows the streamlines contours for the cases of f1 f1 a f1 b f1 c f2 f2 a f2 b f2 c respectively in fig 14 b i e case f1 a there are two symmetric vortex structures on the upper and lower sides of the square cylinder compared with the case f1 the vortex structure becomes smaller and moves backward and the boundary layer becomes thinner in fig 14 d i e case f1 c there is only one vortex structure on the upper and lower sides the boundary layer becomes much thinner and the separation is suppressed a small vortex structure is generated in the second cut corner due to the two small vortex structures the flow around the cylinder surface can be attached to the wall surface better than that in cm 1 method fig 14 also shows the time averaged streamlines around the cylinders for case f1 f1 a and f1 c from the streamlines downstream of the square and considering the results in fig 12 the lengths of the recirculation region for the three cases are nearly the same however it can be seen from the figure that the width of the downstream recirculation region of f1 is significantly larger than those of the other two cases comparing case f1 a with case f1 c it can be seen that when the second corner is large the obtained downstream recirculation region has a smaller width and a better drag reduction effect however when the second cut corner reaches a certain size the drag reduction effect no longer changes significantly such as the cases f1 b f1 c f2 b and f2 c 5 conclusions in summary a new unified hybrid turbulence simulation approach namely vles method is applied for the complex unsteady flow around a square cylinder with a reynolds number of 22000 both the baseline flow case and the passive flow controlled cases are studies the vles calculations are performed on three different meshes in order to investigate the efficiency of the model it is found that the vles model can efficiently capture the flow structures such as the vortex shedding flow separation even on a quite coarse mesh compared with previous les and des studies the vles predictions agree with available experimental date very well for both the baseline flow and the controlled flow it implies that the vles method has high potential for complex flow control simulations based on the vles method which has been implemented in openfoam toolbox drag reduction of the square cylinder are explored using a passive flow control method via cut corners at the front edges of the cylinder two kinds of control methods are studied the first one is based on previous investigations and the second one is a new proposed flow control method with two cut corners it is found that both the cut corner control method at the front edge of the square cylinder can achieve large drag reduction the new proposed control method cm 2 even performs better for drag reduction and the drag can be reduced by about 60 for several cases such as case f1 b f1 c f2 a f2 b and f2 c in cm 2 method when the second corner reaches a certain scale the drag reduction effect keeps nearly unchanged regardless of the size of the first corner the flow mechanisms are explored the second cut corner can depress the flow separation at the upper and lower sides of the cylinder resulting in a narrow wake region also the recirculation region in the wake is shortened with cut corners the drag reduction is closely related to the ratio of the recirculation length to the wake width i e l h the proposed control method can combine both of the effects of shortening the recirculation region and narrowing the wake width it is worth to perform further studies for the new controlled method to reduce the drag acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the

22461,the increasing economic cost and environmental impact of maritime transportation necessitate the reduction of fossil fuel consumption of ocean going cargo ships although fundamental ship propulsion system theory is well known and is at a mature stage of development there is still an enormous variety in the assessment methodology of environmental transport performance of ships furthermore calibration of ship propulsion system model parameters with testbed towing tank and full scale measurement data is rare as these measurements are both difficult and expensive finally the effects of different power management strategies on the ultimate energy conversion effectiveness of typical cargo ships have rarely been investigated systematically in this paper these three issues are discussed addressed and solved for a representative benchmark chemical tanker this ship was chosen to investigate the so called energy conversion effectiveness under various propulsion control and electric power generation modes as ample real ship data is available the transport performance assessment of the ship s power plant is generalised for hybrid arrangements with either power take off or power take in the results show that an optimal combination of propulsion control power management and voyage planning will further reduce the global fuel consumption and co2 emissions produced by the

phase angle between voltage and current deg ω p angular speed of propeller rad s 1 introduction almost 70 years ago in gabrielli and von karman 1950 gabrielli and von karman asked the question what price speed in this classic paper the economic cost for faster travel by means of various transport modes was investigated from an efficiency perspective today due to increasing economic and environmental pressure high maximum speed is no longer the highest priority in design and operation for transportation vehicles especially for maritime transport lindstad and eskeland 2015 thus priority has shifted to the question what price transportation rather than what price speed eyring et al 2010 shi 2013 fuel consumption significantly influences the economic cost of transportation and directly results in the emission of carbon dioxide co2 which is a major greenhouse gas lindstad et al 2013 consequently the overall fuel consumption includes not only the economic cost but also the environmental impact psaraftis and kontovas 2010 the shipping industry being the main carrier of world trade carrying over 80 by volume and more than 70 of its value unctad 2017 consumes much more fuel than other transport modes in spite of the fact that shipping is the most energy efficient mode of cargo transport øyvind et al 2003 the increasing worldwide concerns regarding the environmental impact of maritime transportation thus necessitate proper evaluation and reduction of fossil fuel consumption of commercial ships particularly cargo ships in order to facilitate the ship performance evaluation during both the ship preliminary design stage and operation stage coraddu et al 2014 a consistent and comprehensive theoretical framework is indispensable during ship operation propulsion control and power management significantly influence the fuel consumption performance of ships armstrong and banks 2015 geertsma et al 2017a so quantitative and systematic investigations in this regard is needed when trying to improve the transport performance of ships 1 1 existing frameworks and terminology it is difficult to properly assess the ship transport performance due to the large amounts of influencing variables coraddu et al 2015 indicators and criteria for transport performance of ships need to be identified when evaluating ship performance misra 2016 thus research has been performed to quantify the transport performance of ships and marine vehicles papanikolaou 2014 stapersma 2017 the eedi energy efficiency design index proposed by imo international maritime organisation mepc 2014 which for merchant ships is the obligatory indicator defining the ship energy efficiency is in principle the ratio of penalty to benefit of the energy conversion of ships stapersma 2016 as such the eedi has a close relationship to the energy conversion effectiveness that will be introduced in this paper the main difference is however that the energy conversion effectiveness is defined for different ship speeds and for representative environmental conditions while the eedi is not in papanikolaou 2005 the transport efficiency is defined as the ratio of the total installed power to the vessel s deadweight or payload times the ship service speed in akagi 1991 the reciprocal transportation efficiency is defined as a function of the ship displacement maximum ship speed and total installed power in akagi and morishita 2001 the specific power is analysed as a function of the ship payload maximum ship speed and total installed power in kennell 1998 a transport factor is defined as a function of the ship s displacement the design speed and the total installed power the above mentioned indicators of ship transport performance are essentially the same or similar while they may be termed differently by different researchers 1 2 influence of ship operations reducing the fuel consumption is an effective solution to decrease the transportation cost and the emission of greenhouse gases stapersma 2010 bialystocki and konovessis 2016 although the design of the ship propulsion system initially influences the fuel consumption behaviour of the ship altosole et al 2007 ship operation plays a crucial role in the fuel consumption reduction as well roskilly et al 2015 andersson et al 2016 a practical and widely adopted practice to reduce fuel consumption of cargo ships is reducing ship speed both during design decrease design speed and operationally slow steaming psaraftis and kontovas 2013 lee et al 2015 however using only one single design point to calculate eedi rather than the actual operation on the basis of ship missions during its lifetime imo strives to reduce installed power and thus design ship speed to achieve a smaller eedi raising serious concerns regarding the safety of ships in adverse conditions papanikolaou et al 2016 bitner gregerse et al 2016 instead designing the ship with a higher design speed and reducing actual operational speed during missions could be more effective and more importantly safer yasukawa et al 2017 ship propulsion control and energy management also influence the fuel consumption performance of ships significantly kanellos et al 2014 geertsma et al 2017a 2017b in geertsma et al 2017b in a case study of a patrol vessel geertsma et al find that propulsion control strategy can save up to 30 of fuel while also reducing thermal engine loading and acceleration time further in geertsma et al 2018 geertsma et al propose an adaptive pitch control strategy to optimise the fuel consumption ship manoeuvrability engine thermal loading and propeller cavitation noise in buhaug et al 2009 an assessment of the energy saving potential using known technology and practices has shown that a proper energy management can reduce co2 emissions co2 ton mile by 1 10 as a result of reduction of fuel consumption in figari and guedes soares 2009 figari et al propose a dynamic set point propulsion control scheme with respect to the static combinator control scheme for the best use of the ship propulsion system in terms of power fuel consumption and exhaust emissions for a ferry 1 3 requirement of a flexible simulation tool simulation models can be categorized into two main groups first principle and empirical models del re et al 2010 first principle models provide the ability to gain physical insight in the investigated systems and not just the superficial and direct results and therefore have always been the first choice of researchers guzzella and onder 2009 del re et al 2010 first principle models have to be limited however both in scope and depth to balance the usefulness and effectiveness with required calculation time of the chosen models bossel 1994 refsgaard and henriksen 2004 in order to get to effective high performance models one of the common ways is combining the first principle and empirical approaches from different aspects or at different levels resulting in hybrid models asprion et al 2013 in figari and campora 2003 a ship propulsion system model which includes amongst others a complex two zone crank angle diesel engine model based on wiebe shaped combustion but on the other hand a simple one dimensional lookup table for the ship resistance model and simple two dimensional lookup tables for the propeller model is developed and used to analyse the components and system responses at off design and transient conditions for a better balance in schulten 2005 grimmelius et al 2007 sui et al 2017 geertsma et al 2017b ship propulsion system models containing different mean value first principle mvfp models of a diesel engine are developed for the investigation of ship performance in vrijdag 2009 in order to investigate the control of propeller cavitation in operational conditions a complex propeller model and propulsion control model can be found in the ship propulsion system model while the diesel engine is modelled as a set of lookup tables thus the complexity and focus of models depend on the goals pursued by researchers using the model sometimes it is accepted to have large differences in the level of detail of component models but as a general rule of thumb the authors consider it better to strive for more balanced system models with approximately equivalent level of detail for all component models 1 4 existing problems and knowledge gap the existing terminology defining the ship transport performance is considered to be inconsistent and confusing the current terminology mixes up the concepts of energy effectiveness energy efficiency and energy factor when defining the ship transport performance moreover most of the indicators only take the power chain of shaft to wheel from installed power to ship mobility power rather than tank to wheel from fuel energy flow to ship mobility power into consideration neglecting power generation which can make significant differences to the overall transport performance of ships when the engines are considered most of the research of ship transport performance only focus on the input and output ends of the power chain of the energy conversion and fail to clarify the individual contributions of each part of the power chain to the overall performance in addition in most research indicators of ship transport performance including imo s eedi are only investigated at one single ship speed often the design ship speed rather than at various operational ship speeds and only in calm water conditions which rarely is the case according to faltinsen 1980 the influence of propulsion control strategy on the fuel consumption performance have been researched for ships whose operating conditions change frequently such as navy frigates patrol vessels and ro ro pax ferries etc however quantitative and systematic investigations of the influence on the fuel consumption of ocean going cargo ships which consume much more fuel than any other ship type by propulsion control as well as the adoption of a shaft generator power take off pto are scarce this gap in maritime research is addressed in this paper 1 5 outline and goals thus the main goals of this paper are 1 to introduce a transport performance index called the energy conversion effectiveness this performance indicator can be calculated for different ship speeds and representative environmental conditions and encompasses all energy conversions on board of ships section 3 2 calibration of the parameters of a theoretic ship propulsion system model with extensive tank and on board measurement data taken on board of a typical chemical tanker i e full scale measurements the model is balanced i e approximately equal level of detail of component models section 4 3 investigation into the effects of different ship propulsion control and electric power generation modes on the energy conversion effectiveness and other performance variables in realistic sailing conditions section 5 section 6 contains the conclusions discusses limitations and uncertainties of the current study and provides recommendations for future work but first in chapter 2 a benchmark chemical tanker providing all the opportunities to systematically investigate the fuel consumption performance of ocean going cargo ships is introduced 2 benchmark ship and propulsion electric power system 2 1 a representative benchmark ship chemical tanker a 13000 dwt chemical tanker shown in fig 1 for which ample real ship measurement data both towing tank and full scale are available has been chosen as a benchmark for this study because it represents a normal type of ship that takes its share in the daily business of transportation of goods the layout of the power plant i e propulsion and electric power system of the benchmark chemical tanker is shown in fig 2 the benchmark chemical tanker has a propulsion system where a controllable pitch propeller cpp driven by a two stroke main engine is installed the propulsion system with cpp allows to investigate ship performance when operating in different propulsion control modes i e constant revolution mode constant pitch mode and combinator mode the electric power generation system of the chemical tanker consists of a shaft generator that is powered by the main engine through a pto gearbox and auxiliary generators driven by auxiliary diesel engines the chemical tanker having a power generating system with pto and auxiliary generators provides the opportunity to investigate the influence on the ship performance of different electric power generation modes i e aux mode and pto mode both the propulsion control modes and electric power generation modes will be elaborated in section 5 2 2 2 general information of the chemical tanker power plant some general ship and power plant information of the chemical tanker is presented in table 1 and table 2 3 energy conversion effectiveness and fuel index 3 1 energy conversion effectiveness when evaluating the transport performance of ships that transport goods from one port to another the ultimate ship mission must be taken into account stapersma 2017 i e the mobility power to move a certain useful weight with a certain speed should be added to the end of the power chain of the ship propulsion as illustrated by fig 3 the main power is provided by the main engine for ship propulsion which overcomes ship resistance at a certain ship speed indicated by the ship effective power harvald 1983 molland et al 2011 the auxiliary power is provided by the auxiliary engines or by the main engine in pto power take off mode to support the ship auxiliary systems the crew and the cargo etc mainly indicated by the electric power for on board loads the key connection between the main power and auxiliary power line in case of pto is the mechanical splitting hub working together with an electrical merging hub refer to fig 3 in gabrielli and von karman 1950 in order to evaluate the transportation performance of ships gabrielli and von karman defined the effective power index epi equal to the resistance weight ratio 1 1 the resistance weight ratio which was originally termed as the coefficient of the specific resistance symbolized as ε by gabrielli and von karman was actually an index cost benefit and hence will be called an effective power index epi in this paper as 1 e p i p e max w g v max r max w g where p e max is the maximum ship effective power w r max is the maximum ship resistance n w g is the ship gross weight n and v max is the maximum ship velocity m s however the effective power index epi defined by equation 1 to evaluate the ship transportation performance has a number of drawbacks firstly the maximum ship speed and the corresponding maximum ship effective power are used in the definition which is not representative secondly in the original paper gabrielli and von karman themselves had already argued that a certain useful load which the ship transports rather than the gross weight of the ship should be used when evaluating the economic performance of transportation of the ship they failed to do this finally due to lack of exact information last but not least the definition by equation 1 only takes the hull resistance into account i e excluding the ship propulsion and power generation this nowadays cannot be neglected when analysing the energy conversion performance of the whole ship to solve the first and the second problem in this paper the definition of the effective power index epi has been improved to equation 2 the maximum ship speed and the corresponding maximum ship effective power have been replaced with the operational ones during real ship sailing the ship gross weight has been replaced by ship dead weight which following imo is considered the useful weight 2 e p i p e w d v r w d where p e is the ship effective power w r is the ship resistance n v is the ship speed m s and w d is the dead weight of the ship n extending the concept of the effective power index introduced by gabrielli and von karman 1950 the transport effectiveness ε t of ships is defined by equation 3 3 ε t w d v p b p where p b p is the engine power required for ship propulsion w note that effectiveness essentially is a benefit cost ratio in the definition of the transport effectiveness ε t by equation 3 the ship propulsion and transmission system are included in order to also include the engine power generation and take both the main engine and auxiliary engines into account the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c is according to stapersma 2017 defined by equation 4 4 ε e c w d v φ f e m a i n φ f e a u x where φ f e m a i n is the fuel energy flow into the main engine j s φ f e a u x is the fuel energy flow into the auxiliary engines j s decomposing the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c unveils the different elements of the power chain of the ship equation 5 shows that the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c is the product of familiar component efficiencies a power distribution factor ε h u b and a ship effective power effectiveness ε e p 5 ε e c p b m a i n

the main engine w p b a u x is the power of the auxiliary engines w p d is the delivered power to the propeller w the hub distribution factor ε h u b defined in equation 5 includes the engine power required for ship propulsion since only that power in the end is useful and benefits the mobility power and the engine power produced by both main and auxiliary engines note that the introduction of the hub distribution factor also makes it possible to define the combined engine efficiency that takes all power generation on board into account and consequently all fuel consumption if it is assumed that the power of both main engine and auxiliary engines is provided only for ship propulsion and on board electrical loads looking at the total engine power in the denominator from a different perspective i e to where it will be consumed rather than from where it is generated the definition of hub distribution factor ε h u b in equation 5 can then be written as equation 6 6 ε h u b p b p p

pto and auxiliary engines running in parallel p b e is the sum of p b p t o and p b a u x but this case will not be investigated in this paper note that for the same electric power required by electric loads the corresponding engine power p b e in case of pto is slightly larger than that in case of auxiliary engines running due to the power losses in the pto gearbox when the auxiliary engines would be partly used for power take in pti the expression will be different and more complicated but this paper will not look into pti the hub distribution factor ε h u b is determined by the loads according to which the power distribution or energy management decisions are made put even more poignantly the hub distribution factor ε h u b defined in equations 5 and 6 actually is an energy management factor rather than an energy usage efficiency 3 2 fuel index fuel consumption of the ship at each operating point are quantified by the fuel index fi g ton mile which is defined by equation

dead weight tonnage of the ship t and v is the ship speed kn note that an index essentially is the inverse of effectiveness i e a cost benefit ratio 4 explanation and final calibration of propulsion system model 4 1 propulsion system model description and philosophy the models of the main components of the ship propulsion system as presented earlier in fig 2 although having a first principle structure with normalised in and output variables basically are empirical models fitted with a finite number of parameters rather than look up tables in which the measured test data are stored directly the component models are given in appendix a and were calibrated first to available test data component level as presented in appendix b the component models were integrated into the overall ship propulsion and electric generating system model of the chemical tanker using first principle balances as shown in fig 4 in this case the propulsion system model could also be validated by sea trial test data system level of the real ship and the actual matching of engine propeller and ship be established as shown in the following sections this should make the subsequent results of the analysis very realistic as the model is based on hard full scale data 4 2 correction of towing tank measurement data and model calibration using sea trial measurements first the results of resistance test of ship model and results of open water test of propeller model were directly used in building the simulation models of the ship resistance and the propeller open water characteristics the details of which are given in appendix b however there were discrepancies between the original model test prediction results of the delivered power and propeller speed at various ship speeds and the results of the real ship sea trial test during the sea trial test the shaft power was measured from which the delivered power can be deduced assuming a transmission efficiency for the shaftline further propeller speed at various ship speeds was measured based on this the original model test results of the chemical tanker have been corrected according to the sea trial test data the correction procedure will be briefly introduced in the following to compare the sea trial test results and the model prediction results and get the multiplicative correction factors for the model test results ratios of relevant parameters of the sea trial test to those of the model prediction results are formed as shown in equation 8 8 x x t r i a l x p r e d i c t i o n the ratios according to equation 8 can be derived from relevant variables with the added advantage that constant quantities such as sea water density and propeller diameter are removed from the considerations note that ship speed is dropping out since all comparisons are made for the same ship speed for all other quantities it is assumed that there can be a difference between the sea trial test and model prediction results the correction factors for delivered power p d and propeller speed n were determined using the sea trial results these are the basis and final criterion for correction of the other parameters actually there are many different solutions to correct the model prediction results by choosing different combinations of parameters having uncertainties that could be corrected it is assumed that the ship effective power and propeller characteristic rather than the relative rotation efficiency thrust deduction fraction and wake fraction are the most uncertain factors therefore the relative rotation efficiency thrust deduction fraction and wake fraction are left out of the correction in other words they remain the same as the original model test data further assume that the propulsive efficiency which is the ratio of the ship effective power to the delivered power remains the same as the original model test prediction resulting in the same correction factor for the ship effective power and delivered power as shown in equation 9 9 p e p d then the correction factors for the propeller open water characteristics can be derived from those for the delivered power propeller speed and ship effective power as shown in equations 10 12 10 k q p d η r n 3 p d 1 n 3 p d n 3 11 j 1 w n 1 n 12 k t p e n 2 1 t p e n 2 1 p e n 2 13 η 0 k t j k q p e n 2 1 n n 3 p d p e p d 1 where p d is the ratio of delivered power n is the ratio of propeller speed k q is the ratio of propeller torque coefficient η r is the ratio of relative rotation efficiency 1 w is the ratio of wake fraction defect j is the ratio of propeller advance coefficient p e is the ratio of the ship effective power 1 t is the ratio of thrust deduction fraction defect k t is the ratio of propeller thrust coefficient η d is the ratio of propulsive efficiency and η 0 is the ratio of propeller open water efficiency as argued the result presented in equation 13 implies that the propeller open water efficiency at the same ship speed will remain the same as the original model test data as a result of the chosen solution for the corrections finally the values of the correction factors deduced with the procedure above are presented in table 3 the model test results corrected using the above mentioned method have been applied in developing and calibrating the models of propeller and ship resistance as introduced in appendix b after the components models of the ship propulsion system have been built the static matching of the ship propulsion system is analysed matching to be understood as the relation between engine envelope and propeller ship characteristic as fully explained in klein woud and stapersma 2002 the matching results have been validated by the real ship sea trial test shown in fig 5 the original matching based on the original model test data is heavier compared with the sea trial test results note that due to the fact that there is only one overall set of correction factors as given in equation 10 12 and presented in table 3 the measured points of the sea trial are still not all exactly on the model data but at least the model now correlates in a mean sense to the measured data note that the ship draught during sea trial test was the same as the ship design draught in this paper the service margin or sea margin sm is assumed to be zero sm 0 during the sea trial test despite of the fact that the wind force was actually beaufort 3 4 and the sea state was douglas 2 3 rather than a very calm sea however the correction on resistance would be even larger if the sea margin during sea trials was noticeably larger than one 5 application of calibrated propulsion system model on the benchmark ship simulation results for realistic operational conditions 5 1 selecting a sea margin for typical sailing conditions according to klein woud and stapersma 2002 the sea margin sm in realistic sailing condition which accounts for the added ship resistance due to the fouling of hull and propeller displacement sea state and water depth as shown in equation 14 is selected relative to the sea margin of 0 in sea trial condition calm water condition 14 s m f f o u l i n g d i s p

per year due to fouling the effect of hull and propeller fouling is 15 f 1 f o u l i n g 1 0 03 1 5 1 045 the ship resistance addition relative to that in trial condition due to sea state during realistic sailing conditions taking wind waves and currents in to account is set to be 10 so the effect of sea state is 16 f 3 s e a s t a t e 1 10 clearly this is a drastic simplification of actual sea state effects but for the current design study it is deemed sufficient the draught of the ship during the sea trial test is the design draught and it is assumed that the ship also sails at the design draught in real sailing condition so the effect of the displacement variations on ship resistance are neglected see equation 17 furthermore it is assumed that the ship sails in deep water as during the sea trials so the effect of shallow water on ship resistance is also neglected see equation 18 17 f 2 d i s p l a c e m e n t 1 18 f 4 w a t e r d e p t h 1 the total sea margin according to equation 14 will then be 19 s m 1 045 1 1 1 1 1 0 15 therefore the sea margin sm in realistic sailing condition relative to sea trial condition is set to be 15 5 2 different ship propulsion control and electric power generation modes in this paper different propulsion control modes as well as different electric power generation modes are taken into consideration to conduct a systematic ship propulsion behaviour investigation 5 2 1 ship propulsion control modes a controllable pitch propeller driven by the main engine is installed in the propulsion system of the chemical tanker theoretically the chemical tanker propulsion system can work in three different control modes namely constant revolution mode constant pitch mode and combinator mode as presented in table 4 the propeller revolution and propeller pitch are predefined in combinator curves and controlled simultaneously by single lever command slc for these three different propulsion control modes in each combinator curve for a given slc there will be a certain propeller revolution and propeller pitch in constant revolution mode the ship speed will be controlled by changing the propeller pitch and keeping the propeller revolution constant in the constant pitch mode the ship speed will be controlled by changing the propeller revolution and keeping the propeller pitch constant until the propeller revolution reaches the minimum revolution limit in the combinator mode the ship speed will be controlled by changing the propeller revolution limited by the minimum and maximum revolutions and pitch simultaneously see fig 6 a the mechanical power which is either provided by the main engine to the shaft generator through the pto gearbox in pto mode or is provided by the auxiliary engine directly to the auxiliary generator in aux mode is 350 kw and assumed to be constant setting the sea margin as 15 the operational results in terms of main engine speed and power under the combinator control mode and the two electric power generation modes are shown in fig 6 b when the electric power is generated in pto mode the main engine needs to provide extra power to the shaft generator in addition to the power required by the propulsion system if the main engine is operating in the high engine speed region in practice ship speed should be reduced somewhat or for the sake of the engine operation safety the electric power generation mode should be switched from pto mode to aux mode or the propeller pitch should be reduced slightly to keep the engine power inside the engine operating envelope 5 2 2 electric power generation modes the electric power generation system of the chemical tanker consists of three auxiliary generators driven by three auxiliary engines and one shaft generator driven by the main engine through a pto gearbox the electric power required by the on board electric loads can be provided either by the shaft generator pto mode or by the auxiliary generators aux mode or even by both the shaft generator and auxiliary generators working in parallel combined mode when a large amount of electric power is needed in some special cases the latter mode will however not be investigated in this paper table 5 presents the electric power generation modes investigated in this paper 5 3 correction for difference between diesel fuel type used in the engine test bed and real ship operations the specific fuel consumption of the main engine is calculated by the diesel engine model introduced in the appendix the specific fuel consumption of the auxiliary engine at 50 mcr is 230 g kwh at iso value for fuel lhv and consequently the specific fuel consumption of the auxiliary engine whose power at mcr is 750 kw is assumed to be 230 g kwh at iso when it provides mechanical power of 350 kw to the auxiliary generator at aux mode in reality the diesel fuel type in ship operation is heavy fuel oil hfo for the main engine and marine diesel fuel mdf for the auxiliary engines however the fuel consumption test results measured on the engine test bed which have been corrected at iso are used in developing and calibration of the main engine model therefore the fuel consumption during real ship operation has been corrected according to equation 20 using the correcting factors shown in table 6 note that the underlying idea of equation 20 is that engine efficiency remains the same when changing fuel type 20 φ x c x φ x i s o where φ x is the fuel consumption of hfo and mdf kg s φ x i s o is the fuel consumption of fuel at iso kg s c x is the correcting factors of fuel consumption for different fuel types represented in table 6 5 4 results and evaluation the ship performance under different propulsion control modes as well as different power generation modes at nominal sea margin sm 15 has been investigated and the results are presented in figs 7 14 5 4 1 fuel consumption and fuel index the combined engine power and fuel flow at different propulsion control modes and power generation modes are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively according to fig 7 a the combined engine power in pto mode is slightly higher than that of aux mode because of the power losses in the pto gearbox through which the power from the main engine is transmitted to the shaft generator while the power from auxiliary engine is directly transmitted to the auxiliary generator according to fig 7 b the combined fuel flow at aux mode is higher than that at pto mode especially at low ship speeds due to the higher specific fuel consumption at aux mode as shown in fig 8 a for the same ship speeds the constant revolution mode requires the highest engine power and fuel flow followed by the combinator mode and the constant pitch mode requires the lowest this in fact is mainly caused by the lower propeller efficiency when the pitch is reduced in case of constant revolution and combinator mode compared with the constant pitch mode as will be elaborated in the next section the combined specific fuel consumption sfc under constant revolution control mode is better than the constant pitch mode and the combinator mode especially at low ship speed as shown in fig 8 a while the results of fuel index fi under the three different propulsion control modes are contrary as shown in fig 8 b the reason is that the main engine almost operates in the same region of specific fuel consumption under the three different control modes at high ship speeds while it runs in quite different regions at low ship speeds and for the 2 stroke engines in the benchmark ship the constant revolution mode runs through a better region of sfc compared with the other two modes note that for 4 stroke engines constant revolution normally has a worse sfc compared to constant pitch propeller curve the fuel index is determined by the fuel consumption flow at a certain ship speed when the ship dead weight remains the same the constant revolution control mode has a higher fuel consumption flow compared with the other two modes especially at low ship speeds as already shown in fig 7 b furthermore the lowest fuel index under different propulsion control modes occurs at different ship speeds it shows the fact that the fuel consumption can be reduced by slow steaming of the ship although the specific fuel consumption of the engines will increase with the reduction of the ship speed note that engine specific fuel consumption sfc is a combined value for main and auxiliary engines if applicable as implied by equation 5 when looking at the electric power generation modes the combined specific fuel consumption is higher at aux mode than that at pto mode especially at low ship speeds as shown in fig 8 a the reason is that at low ship speeds the engine power required for propulsion is low and the engine power for electric loads is relatively higher than at high ship speeds consequently the auxiliary engine with higher specific fuel consumption contributes relatively more engine power at low ship speeds resulting in higher combined specific fuel consumption at aux mode the difference between operating the shaft generator or auxiliary gensets also has some influence on the combined fuel index and the pto mode has a lower fuel index in all the three propulsion control modes as shown in fig 8 b the first lesson is that specific fuel consumption of the engine gives misleading trends and should not be used when considering the overall energy conversion in the ship instead the fuel index should be used since it contains information of the propeller efficiency and auxiliary power conversion as well and therefore is a real system performance indicator unlike sfc 5 4 2 energy effectiveness and efficiencies the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c shown in fig 10 is actually the inverse of the fuel index and thus the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c has the inverse trend as that of the fuel index fi the highest values of the energy conversion effectiveness correspond to the lowest values of the fuel index in fact the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c is determined by the combined engine efficiency η e n g shown in fig 9 the hub distribution factor ε h u b shown in fig 11 the transmission efficiency η t r m shown in fig 12 the propulsive efficiency η d shown in fig 13 and the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p which is actually the ratio of ship dead weight to ship resistance w d r shown in fig 14 the combined engine efficiency η e n g shown in fig 9 is actually the inverse of the combined engine specific fuel consumption sfc shown in fig 8 a the hub distribution factor ε h u b shown in fig 11 is determined by the propulsion load provided that the electrical load is kept constant or rather the hub distribution factor ε h u b will increase if the power required for ship propulsion increases both increasing the ship speed and changing propulsion control modes from constant pitch mode to constant revolution mode will increase the power required for propulsion and consequently influence the hub distribution factor in the latter case it can be explained by the propulsive efficiency η d of different control modes shown in fig 13 at certain ship speeds in particular at low ship speeds constant revolution mode with smaller propeller pitch results in lower propulsive efficiency so the propeller needs more power from engine for ship propulsion the hub distribution factor ε h u b at pto mode is slightly higher than that at aux mode because the engine power for electric system p b e at pto mode is slightly higher than that at aux mode due to the power losses in the pto gearbox the transmission efficiency η t r m of the shaftline does not change much with the ship speed and propulsion control modes as shown in fig 12 having limited influence on the overall performance of the entire power chain the propulsive efficiency η d shown in fig 13 is mainly determined by the propeller efficiency considering the fact that the ship hull efficiency does not vary too much under different operating conditions at high ship speeds the propulsive efficiency under different propulsion control modes shows very small differences because both the propeller speed and pitch are almost the same to obtain the corresponding high ship speeds when the ship slows down the propulsive efficiency under all the three different propulsion control modes decreases as a result of the different combinations of propeller speed and pitch to obtain the required low ship speeds the decrease of propulsive efficiency under constant revolution propulsion control mode is the fastest followed by the combinator control mode while for the constant pitch control mode the propulsive efficiency changes slowest as shown in fig 13 in other words the constant pitch control mode shows the best propulsive efficiency when the ship sails at low speeds while the constant revolution mode has the worst propulsive efficiency and the combinator control modes lies in between when the ship is operating under constant revolution mode in order to reduce the ship speed the propeller pitch has to be reduced consequently decreasing the propeller efficiency in fact the propeller pitch has a dominating effect on the propeller efficiency while the propeller speed hardly has an influence when the ship sails under certain resistance conditions the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p i e the ratio of ship dead weight to resistance w d r under the three different propulsion control modes will be obviously the same when the ship sails at the same speeds as shown in fig 14 when the ship slows down the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p will increase accordingly in other words the power needed for ship propulsion to transport a certain useful load will be reduced significantly when reducing the ship speed as a consequence the required engine power will be reduced by a great deal when the ship sails at slow speeds especially when the propulsive efficiency η d does not change much for example when the ship is operated under the constant pitch control modes or the ship is propelled by a fixed pitch propeller that is the most common case for large ocean going cargo ships nowadays in fact the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p is the core reason why ship transportation is the most efficient when compared to other transportation modes and the absolute size of useful weight w d makes it the most important transportation mode in terms of transport volume as well 5 4 3 summary of the results the result of course is that slow steaming within a certain ship speed range will reduce the fuel consumption generating the electric power by the shaft generator pto mode rather than by the auxiliary generators aux mode also saves fuel constant revolution control mode consumes more fuel than the other two modes especially at low ship speeds however the benchmark chemical tanker operates in constant revolution mode most of the time during transport because of the installed shaft generator which needs to run at constant revolution when the ship is operating at constant pitch and combinator modes where the shaft speed will change significantly with slc the onboard electric power will be provided by the auxiliary generators rather than the shaft generator to provide electricity with stable frequency and voltage for the onboard grid when comparing the fuel index and energy conversion effectiveness of the ship under constant revolution mode where the electric power is generated in pto mode with those under constant pitch and combinator modes where the electric power is generated in aux mode the disadvantages brought by the constant revolution mode at low ship speeds are essentially the results of the decreased propeller pitch leading to a lower propeller efficiency which is not compensated by the better specific fuel consumption of the engine and the advantages of the shaft generator 6 conclusions and recommendations this paper has cleared up some confusion in the existing terminology by developing a consistent and comprehensive theoretical framework of the energy conversion of ships with the new framework in addition to having an overall look at the whole power chain this paper also has a close look inside the stages of the energy conversion process providing a deeper insight into the influence of individual nodes and links of the power chain on the overall performance the influence on the transport performance by ship operations is provided through a quantitative and systematic investigation on the impact of operational reduction of ship speeds propulsion control modes and electric power generation modes according to results of the ship performance investigation the most efficient and practical way to reduce the fuel index of a cargo ship not surprisingly is to reduce the ship speed however the engine specific fuel consumption may increase with the reduction of the ship speed which is a misleading result in this paper operational reduction of ship speed has been investigated given a fixed nominal or design speed in fact under imo ships are designed to be slower by selecting propulsion systems with smaller engines in the design stage to achieve a lower eedi which has raised serious concerns regarding ship safety in adverse weather conditions however designing the ship for a higher speed but reducing actual operational speed during missions will be more effective and safer alternative propulsion control modes also result in differences in the fuel consumption performance especially at low ship speeds in terms of the fuel index the constant pitch control mode shows the best performance during various operational conditions while the constant revolution model is the worst especially during low ship speeds in terms of the specific fuel consumption of the engines the constant revolution mode shows a better behaviour compared with the other two control modes in particular at low ship speeds but this is a misleading result the propulsive efficiency and the effective power effectiveness are the core factors that have a dominating influence on the overall performance of the power chain the effective power effectiveness presents the core reason why bigger and slower ships are more efficient however the reduction of the propulsive efficiency at lower ship speed will severely limit the increase of the energy conversion effectiveness that would be possible from the effective power effectiveness i e the favourable weight resistance ratio at low speeds the energy management of the power chain which is quantified by the hub distribution factor has a large impact on the energy conversion effectiveness of the ship the more the power is distributed for ship propulsion compared to the power provided for example to the electrical loads onboard the higher the energy conversion effectiveness will be which means the ship will be more efficient investigation of the influence on the energy conversion effectiveness by the power take off pto shows that under the same propulsion control mode generating the electric power by the shaft generator rather than the auxiliary generator also reduces fuel consumption of the ship but the effect is relatively minor last but not least there are still some uncertainties and limitations in this study and these need to be further studied in future work the main uncertainties are present in the prediction of the fuel consumption performance of the 2 stroke diesel engine because of a small database as introduced in appendix b it is the intention to try to obtain more test data through further cooperation with partners from industry the main limitation is that in this paper only point values of the performance parameters are investigated while in the end mean values weighted over realistic mission profiles must give the real answers acknowledgements this project partly is financially supported by international science technology cooperation program of china 2014dfa71700 marine low speed engine project phase i appendix a description of component models a 1 normalisation of variables for the sake of convenience in modelling and analysis of the ship propulsion system some variables used in the model of ship propulsion system have been normalised by relating the off design condition variables to the corresponding variables of a known nominal condition klein woud and stapersma 2002 as presented in eq a 1 a1 x x x n o m where x is the normalised variables x is the relevant variables to be normalised and x n o m is the corresponding nominal value of the variables note that the mathematical technique of normalisation is the same as relating sea trial to prediction as was done to make corrections for the actual sea trial measurements a 2 diesel engine model in this paper an analytical and first principle model in which the engine torque m e n g is modelled as a function of engine speed n e n g and the injected fuel per cycle m f shi 2013 expressed by eq a2 has been adopted in the ship propulsion system model the engine torque m e n g injected fuel per cycle m f and the engine speed n e n g have all been normalised as m m f and n according to eq a 1 a2 m f m f n f 1 m f f 2 n f 3 m f n 1 a 1 m f b 1 m f 2 c 1 n d 1 n 2 2 e 1 m f 1 n this equation essentially is a taylor series approximation of a function of two variables up to second order terms including the cross product a 3 ship resistance model most of the time the ship resistance or ship effective power are modelled when modelling ship resistance characteristics however unfortunately this kind of models are not first principle because they just model the results rather than the physics behind the final results in other words one cannot have a physical insight in the modelled system in klein woud and stapersma 2002 the specific resistance of ship hull c e which is a non dimensional parameter indicating the ship resistance characteristics when amongst others ship size speed and hull form are given it is defined by eq a 3 a3 c e p e ρ 2 3 v s 3 where p e is the ship effective power w ρ is the density of water kg m3 is the displacement volume of the hull m3 v s is the ship velocity m s in this paper the ship specific resistance c e instead of ship resistance or ship effective power which is the result of the former is modelled as a function of ship speed v s by eq a 4 the variables in the following equations have been normalised according to eq a 1 both the viscous resistance at lower ship speeds and wave making resistance at higher ship speeds are modelled by eq a 4 the wave making resistance which takes a very small part of the total resistance at low ship speeds and will increase rapidly at high ship speeds is modelled as an exponential function of the ship speed the viscous resistance consists of the basic viscous resistance a linear correction and nonlinear correction the latter two contributions being the result of viscous effect at lower reynolds and being modelled as a linear slope and exponential function respectively a4 c e 1 a c e basic viscous resistance k c e v s 1 linear correction viscous resistance c c e ⅇ d c e v s

advance ratio j have been normalised as k t k q and j according to eq a 1 a 5 wake factor thrust deduction factor and relative rotative efficiency model in this paper the wake factor w thrust deduction factor t and relative rotative efficiency η r are modelled as a quadratic function of ship speed v s by eq a 7 eq a 8 and eq a 9 respectively the variables in the equations have already been normalised by eq a 1 a7 w 1 c w 1 v s d w 1 v s 2 a8 t 1 c t 1 v s d t 1 v s 2 a9 η r 1 c η r 1 v s d η r 1 v s 2 again these essentially are taylor series approximations of a function of one variable up to second order terms a 6 mechanical transmission losses the method proposed in godjevac et al 2016 is used to model the transmission losses of propulsion shaftline and pto gearbox of the ship the gearbox and shaft losses are presented as a torque loss m l o s s which is expressed as function of the input torque m i n and input speed n i n shown in eq a 10 the variables in the equation have already been normalised a10 m l o s s k a m i n k b n i n k c where k a is the coefficient related to the torque k b is the coefficient related to the rotational speed and k c is the coefficient related to the constant torque loss appendix b calibration of component models to testbed and towing tank measurements b 1 diesel engine the calibration results of diesel engine model are shown in table b 2 fig b 1 and fig b 2 the engine test data used in calibrating the diesel engine torque model are selected from operating points along the propeller curve and the generator curve in the engine envelope fuel consumption test data of operating points along the generator curve and propeller curve are obtained by taking the mean value of the corresponding data of the eiapp engine international air pollution prevention technical files of five different engines from the same engine family including the diesel engine installed in the chemical tanker as shown in table b 1 the mean value of data of different engines is taken in the following way firstly the mean value of data of different engines at nominal points are taken as the new nominal value of the engine secondly the mean values of part load percentages i e the ratios of part load value to nominal value along generator curve e2 cycle and propeller curve e3 cycle of different engines are taken as the part load percentages of the engine along generator curve and propeller curve respectively table b1 available eiapp test data of man6s35me engines from the same engine family table b1 test cycle e2 e3 e3 e3 e3 rated power kw 4170

consumption performance of a 2 stroke diesel engine is different from that of a 4 stroke diesel engine the specific fuel consumption of 4 stroke diesel engines is better lower when the engine is operating under the propeller law than under the generator law klein woud and stapersma 2002 however the 2 stroke diesel engine investigated in this paper has better specific fuel consumption when operating under generator law than the propeller law although in fact there is hardly any difference as shown in fig b 2 which is also different from 4 stroke diesel engine unfortunately very few data in this regard are found in the open literature and currently we have limitations to prove the accuracy of our model results more data and research results in this regard are expected and encouraged to be published by the other researchers b 2 ship resistance the calibration results of ship resistance model are shown in table 4 and b3 fig b 3 and fig b 4 note that the original model test data of ship effective power presented in fig b 4 have been corrected together with the original model test data of the propeller open water characteristics according to the real ship sea trial test results and the correction method as was shown in the main text section 4 2 in addition the available test data are limited in the high ship speeds range namely from 11 5kn to 15kn and there is no data available for the low ship speeds below 11 5kn therefore only the specific ship resistance model at high ship speeds are calibrated using the available test data while the model at low ship speeds are

22461,the increasing economic cost and environmental impact of maritime transportation necessitate the reduction of fossil fuel consumption of ocean going cargo ships although fundamental ship propulsion system theory is well known and is at a mature stage of development there is still an enormous variety in the assessment methodology of environmental transport performance of ships furthermore calibration of ship propulsion system model parameters with testbed towing tank and full scale measurement data is rare as these measurements are both difficult and expensive finally the effects of different power management strategies on the ultimate energy conversion effectiveness of typical cargo ships have rarely been investigated systematically in this paper these three issues are discussed addressed and solved for a representative benchmark chemical tanker this ship was chosen to investigate the so called energy conversion effectiveness under various propulsion control and electric power generation modes as ample real ship data is available the transport performance assessment of the ship s power plant is generalised for hybrid arrangements with either power take off or power take in the results show that an optimal combination of propulsion control power management and voyage planning will further reduce the global fuel consumption and co2 emissions produced by the

phase angle between voltage and current deg ω p angular speed of propeller rad s 1 introduction almost 70 years ago in gabrielli and von karman 1950 gabrielli and von karman asked the question what price speed in this classic paper the economic cost for faster travel by means of various transport modes was investigated from an efficiency perspective today due to increasing economic and environmental pressure high maximum speed is no longer the highest priority in design and operation for transportation vehicles especially for maritime transport lindstad and eskeland 2015 thus priority has shifted to the question what price transportation rather than what price speed eyring et al 2010 shi 2013 fuel consumption significantly influences the economic cost of transportation and directly results in the emission of carbon dioxide co2 which is a major greenhouse gas lindstad et al 2013 consequently the overall fuel consumption includes not only the economic cost but also the environmental impact psaraftis and kontovas 2010 the shipping industry being the main carrier of world trade carrying over 80 by volume and more than 70 of its value unctad 2017 consumes much more fuel than other transport modes in spite of the fact that shipping is the most energy efficient mode of cargo transport øyvind et al 2003 the increasing worldwide concerns regarding the environmental impact of maritime transportation thus necessitate proper evaluation and reduction of fossil fuel consumption of commercial ships particularly cargo ships in order to facilitate the ship performance evaluation during both the ship preliminary design stage and operation stage coraddu et al 2014 a consistent and comprehensive theoretical framework is indispensable during ship operation propulsion control and power management significantly influence the fuel consumption performance of ships armstrong and banks 2015 geertsma et al 2017a so quantitative and systematic investigations in this regard is needed when trying to improve the transport performance of ships 1 1 existing frameworks and terminology it is difficult to properly assess the ship transport performance due to the large amounts of influencing variables coraddu et al 2015 indicators and criteria for transport performance of ships need to be identified when evaluating ship performance misra 2016 thus research has been performed to quantify the transport performance of ships and marine vehicles papanikolaou 2014 stapersma 2017 the eedi energy efficiency design index proposed by imo international maritime organisation mepc 2014 which for merchant ships is the obligatory indicator defining the ship energy efficiency is in principle the ratio of penalty to benefit of the energy conversion of ships stapersma 2016 as such the eedi has a close relationship to the energy conversion effectiveness that will be introduced in this paper the main difference is however that the energy conversion effectiveness is defined for different ship speeds and for representative environmental conditions while the eedi is not in papanikolaou 2005 the transport efficiency is defined as the ratio of the total installed power to the vessel s deadweight or payload times the ship service speed in akagi 1991 the reciprocal transportation efficiency is defined as a function of the ship displacement maximum ship speed and total installed power in akagi and morishita 2001 the specific power is analysed as a function of the ship payload maximum ship speed and total installed power in kennell 1998 a transport factor is defined as a function of the ship s displacement the design speed and the total installed power the above mentioned indicators of ship transport performance are essentially the same or similar while they may be termed differently by different researchers 1 2 influence of ship operations reducing the fuel consumption is an effective solution to decrease the transportation cost and the emission of greenhouse gases stapersma 2010 bialystocki and konovessis 2016 although the design of the ship propulsion system initially influences the fuel consumption behaviour of the ship altosole et al 2007 ship operation plays a crucial role in the fuel consumption reduction as well roskilly et al 2015 andersson et al 2016 a practical and widely adopted practice to reduce fuel consumption of cargo ships is reducing ship speed both during design decrease design speed and operationally slow steaming psaraftis and kontovas 2013 lee et al 2015 however using only one single design point to calculate eedi rather than the actual operation on the basis of ship missions during its lifetime imo strives to reduce installed power and thus design ship speed to achieve a smaller eedi raising serious concerns regarding the safety of ships in adverse conditions papanikolaou et al 2016 bitner gregerse et al 2016 instead designing the ship with a higher design speed and reducing actual operational speed during missions could be more effective and more importantly safer yasukawa et al 2017 ship propulsion control and energy management also influence the fuel consumption performance of ships significantly kanellos et al 2014 geertsma et al 2017a 2017b in geertsma et al 2017b in a case study of a patrol vessel geertsma et al find that propulsion control strategy can save up to 30 of fuel while also reducing thermal engine loading and acceleration time further in geertsma et al 2018 geertsma et al propose an adaptive pitch control strategy to optimise the fuel consumption ship manoeuvrability engine thermal loading and propeller cavitation noise in buhaug et al 2009 an assessment of the energy saving potential using known technology and practices has shown that a proper energy management can reduce co2 emissions co2 ton mile by 1 10 as a result of reduction of fuel consumption in figari and guedes soares 2009 figari et al propose a dynamic set point propulsion control scheme with respect to the static combinator control scheme for the best use of the ship propulsion system in terms of power fuel consumption and exhaust emissions for a ferry 1 3 requirement of a flexible simulation tool simulation models can be categorized into two main groups first principle and empirical models del re et al 2010 first principle models provide the ability to gain physical insight in the investigated systems and not just the superficial and direct results and therefore have always been the first choice of researchers guzzella and onder 2009 del re et al 2010 first principle models have to be limited however both in scope and depth to balance the usefulness and effectiveness with required calculation time of the chosen models bossel 1994 refsgaard and henriksen 2004 in order to get to effective high performance models one of the common ways is combining the first principle and empirical approaches from different aspects or at different levels resulting in hybrid models asprion et al 2013 in figari and campora 2003 a ship propulsion system model which includes amongst others a complex two zone crank angle diesel engine model based on wiebe shaped combustion but on the other hand a simple one dimensional lookup table for the ship resistance model and simple two dimensional lookup tables for the propeller model is developed and used to analyse the components and system responses at off design and transient conditions for a better balance in schulten 2005 grimmelius et al 2007 sui et al 2017 geertsma et al 2017b ship propulsion system models containing different mean value first principle mvfp models of a diesel engine are developed for the investigation of ship performance in vrijdag 2009 in order to investigate the control of propeller cavitation in operational conditions a complex propeller model and propulsion control model can be found in the ship propulsion system model while the diesel engine is modelled as a set of lookup tables thus the complexity and focus of models depend on the goals pursued by researchers using the model sometimes it is accepted to have large differences in the level of detail of component models but as a general rule of thumb the authors consider it better to strive for more balanced system models with approximately equivalent level of detail for all component models 1 4 existing problems and knowledge gap the existing terminology defining the ship transport performance is considered to be inconsistent and confusing the current terminology mixes up the concepts of energy effectiveness energy efficiency and energy factor when defining the ship transport performance moreover most of the indicators only take the power chain of shaft to wheel from installed power to ship mobility power rather than tank to wheel from fuel energy flow to ship mobility power into consideration neglecting power generation which can make significant differences to the overall transport performance of ships when the engines are considered most of the research of ship transport performance only focus on the input and output ends of the power chain of the energy conversion and fail to clarify the individual contributions of each part of the power chain to the overall performance in addition in most research indicators of ship transport performance including imo s eedi are only investigated at one single ship speed often the design ship speed rather than at various operational ship speeds and only in calm water conditions which rarely is the case according to faltinsen 1980 the influence of propulsion control strategy on the fuel consumption performance have been researched for ships whose operating conditions change frequently such as navy frigates patrol vessels and ro ro pax ferries etc however quantitative and systematic investigations of the influence on the fuel consumption of ocean going cargo ships which consume much more fuel than any other ship type by propulsion control as well as the adoption of a shaft generator power take off pto are scarce this gap in maritime research is addressed in this paper 1 5 outline and goals thus the main goals of this paper are 1 to introduce a transport performance index called the energy conversion effectiveness this performance indicator can be calculated for different ship speeds and representative environmental conditions and encompasses all energy conversions on board of ships section 3 2 calibration of the parameters of a theoretic ship propulsion system model with extensive tank and on board measurement data taken on board of a typical chemical tanker i e full scale measurements the model is balanced i e approximately equal level of detail of component models section 4 3 investigation into the effects of different ship propulsion control and electric power generation modes on the energy conversion effectiveness and other performance variables in realistic sailing conditions section 5 section 6 contains the conclusions discusses limitations and uncertainties of the current study and provides recommendations for future work but first in chapter 2 a benchmark chemical tanker providing all the opportunities to systematically investigate the fuel consumption performance of ocean going cargo ships is introduced 2 benchmark ship and propulsion electric power system 2 1 a representative benchmark ship chemical tanker a 13000 dwt chemical tanker shown in fig 1 for which ample real ship measurement data both towing tank and full scale are available has been chosen as a benchmark for this study because it represents a normal type of ship that takes its share in the daily business of transportation of goods the layout of the power plant i e propulsion and electric power system of the benchmark chemical tanker is shown in fig 2 the benchmark chemical tanker has a propulsion system where a controllable pitch propeller cpp driven by a two stroke main engine is installed the propulsion system with cpp allows to investigate ship performance when operating in different propulsion control modes i e constant revolution mode constant pitch mode and combinator mode the electric power generation system of the chemical tanker consists of a shaft generator that is powered by the main engine through a pto gearbox and auxiliary generators driven by auxiliary diesel engines the chemical tanker having a power generating system with pto and auxiliary generators provides the opportunity to investigate the influence on the ship performance of different electric power generation modes i e aux mode and pto mode both the propulsion control modes and electric power generation modes will be elaborated in section 5 2 2 2 general information of the chemical tanker power plant some general ship and power plant information of the chemical tanker is presented in table 1 and table 2 3 energy conversion effectiveness and fuel index 3 1 energy conversion effectiveness when evaluating the transport performance of ships that transport goods from one port to another the ultimate ship mission must be taken into account stapersma 2017 i e the mobility power to move a certain useful weight with a certain speed should be added to the end of the power chain of the ship propulsion as illustrated by fig 3 the main power is provided by the main engine for ship propulsion which overcomes ship resistance at a certain ship speed indicated by the ship effective power harvald 1983 molland et al 2011 the auxiliary power is provided by the auxiliary engines or by the main engine in pto power take off mode to support the ship auxiliary systems the crew and the cargo etc mainly indicated by the electric power for on board loads the key connection between the main power and auxiliary power line in case of pto is the mechanical splitting hub working together with an electrical merging hub refer to fig 3 in gabrielli and von karman 1950 in order to evaluate the transportation performance of ships gabrielli and von karman defined the effective power index epi equal to the resistance weight ratio 1 1 the resistance weight ratio which was originally termed as the coefficient of the specific resistance symbolized as ε by gabrielli and von karman was actually an index cost benefit and hence will be called an effective power index epi in this paper as 1 e p i p e max w g v max r max w g where p e max is the maximum ship effective power w r max is the maximum ship resistance n w g is the ship gross weight n and v max is the maximum ship velocity m s however the effective power index epi defined by equation 1 to evaluate the ship transportation performance has a number of drawbacks firstly the maximum ship speed and the corresponding maximum ship effective power are used in the definition which is not representative secondly in the original paper gabrielli and von karman themselves had already argued that a certain useful load which the ship transports rather than the gross weight of the ship should be used when evaluating the economic performance of transportation of the ship they failed to do this finally due to lack of exact information last but not least the definition by equation 1 only takes the hull resistance into account i e excluding the ship propulsion and power generation this nowadays cannot be neglected when analysing the energy conversion performance of the whole ship to solve the first and the second problem in this paper the definition of the effective power index epi has been improved to equation 2 the maximum ship speed and the corresponding maximum ship effective power have been replaced with the operational ones during real ship sailing the ship gross weight has been replaced by ship dead weight which following imo is considered the useful weight 2 e p i p e w d v r w d where p e is the ship effective power w r is the ship resistance n v is the ship speed m s and w d is the dead weight of the ship n extending the concept of the effective power index introduced by gabrielli and von karman 1950 the transport effectiveness ε t of ships is defined by equation 3 3 ε t w d v p b p where p b p is the engine power required for ship propulsion w note that effectiveness essentially is a benefit cost ratio in the definition of the transport effectiveness ε t by equation 3 the ship propulsion and transmission system are included in order to also include the engine power generation and take both the main engine and auxiliary engines into account the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c is according to stapersma 2017 defined by equation 4 4 ε e c w d v φ f e m a i n φ f e a u x where φ f e m a i n is the fuel energy flow into the main engine j s φ f e a u x is the fuel energy flow into the auxiliary engines j s decomposing the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c unveils the different elements of the power chain of the ship equation 5 shows that the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c is the product of familiar component efficiencies a power distribution factor ε h u b and a ship effective power effectiveness ε e p 5 ε e c p b m a i n p b a u x φ f e m a i n φ f e a u x η e n g p b p p b m a i n p b a u x ε h u b p d p b p η t r m p e p d η d w d v p e ε e p η e n g ε h u b η t r m η d ε e p ε t where p b m a i n is the power of the main engine w p b a u x is the power of the auxiliary engines w p d is the delivered power to the propeller w the hub distribution factor ε h u b defined in equation 5 includes the engine power required for ship propulsion since only that power in the end is useful and benefits the mobility power and the engine power produced by both main and auxiliary engines note that the introduction of the hub distribution factor also makes it possible to define the combined engine efficiency that takes all power generation on board into account and consequently all fuel consumption if it is assumed that the power of both main engine and auxiliary engines is provided only for ship propulsion and on board electrical loads looking at the total engine power in the denominator from a different perspective i e to where it will be consumed rather than from where it is generated the definition of hub distribution factor ε h u b in equation 5 can then be written as equation 6 6 ε h u b p b p p b p p b e where p b e is engine power required by electrical loads w and in our case is either equal to p b p t o in case of pto or p b a u x in case of auxiliary engines running see fig 3 in case of pto and auxiliary engines running in parallel p b e is the sum of p b p t o and p b a u x but this case will not be investigated in this paper note that for the same electric power required by electric loads the corresponding engine power p b e in case of pto is slightly larger than that in case of auxiliary engines running due to the power losses in the pto gearbox when the auxiliary engines would be partly used for power take in pti the expression will be different and more complicated but this paper will not look into pti the hub distribution factor ε h u b is determined by the loads according to which the power distribution or energy management decisions are made put even more poignantly the hub distribution factor ε h u b defined in equations 5 and 6 actually is an energy management factor rather than an energy usage efficiency 3 2 fuel index fuel consumption of the ship at each operating point are quantified by the fuel index fi g ton mile which is defined by equation 7 7 f i φ f u e l m a i n φ f u e l a u x m d v where φ f u e l m a i n is the fuel mass flow into the main engine g h φ f u e l a u x is the fuel mass flow into the auxiliary engines g h m d is the dead weight tonnage of the ship t and v is the ship speed kn note that an index essentially is the inverse of effectiveness i e a cost benefit ratio 4 explanation and final calibration of propulsion system model 4 1 propulsion system model description and philosophy the models of the main components of the ship propulsion system as presented earlier in fig 2 although having a first principle structure with normalised in and output variables basically are empirical models fitted with a finite number of parameters rather than look up tables in which the measured test data are stored directly the component models are given in appendix a and were calibrated first to available test data component level as presented in appendix b the component models were integrated into the overall ship propulsion and electric generating system model of the chemical tanker using first principle balances as shown in fig 4 in this case the propulsion system model could also be validated by sea trial test data system level of the real ship and the actual matching of engine propeller and ship be established as shown in the following sections this should make the subsequent results of the analysis very realistic as the model is based on hard full scale data 4 2 correction of towing tank measurement data and model calibration using sea trial measurements first the results of resistance test of ship model and results of open water test of propeller model were directly used in building the simulation models of the ship resistance and the propeller open water characteristics the details of which are given in appendix b however there were discrepancies between the original model test prediction results of the delivered power and propeller speed at various ship speeds and the results of the real ship sea trial test during the sea trial test the shaft power was measured from which the delivered power can be deduced assuming a transmission efficiency for the shaftline further propeller speed at various ship speeds was measured based on this the original model test results of the chemical tanker have been corrected according to the sea trial test data the correction procedure will be briefly introduced in the following to compare the sea trial test results and the model prediction results and get the multiplicative correction factors for the model test results ratios of relevant parameters of the sea trial test to those of the model prediction results are formed as shown in equation 8 8 x x t r i a l x p r e d i c t i o n the ratios according to equation 8 can be derived from relevant variables with the added advantage that constant quantities such as sea water density and propeller diameter are removed from the considerations note that ship speed is dropping out since all comparisons are made for the same ship speed for all other quantities it is assumed that there can be a difference between the sea trial test and model prediction results the correction factors for delivered power p d and propeller speed n were determined using the sea trial results these are the basis and final criterion for correction of the other parameters actually there are many different solutions to correct the model prediction results by choosing different combinations of parameters having uncertainties that could be corrected it is assumed that the ship effective power and propeller characteristic rather than the relative rotation efficiency thrust deduction fraction and wake fraction are the most uncertain factors therefore the relative rotation efficiency thrust deduction fraction and wake fraction are left out of the correction in other words they remain the same as the original model test data further assume that the propulsive efficiency which is the ratio of the ship effective power to the delivered power remains the same as the original model test prediction resulting in the same correction factor for the ship effective power and delivered power as shown in equation 9 9 p e p d then the correction factors for the propeller open water characteristics can be derived from those for the delivered power propeller speed and ship effective power as shown in equations 10 12 10 k q p d η r n 3 p d 1 n 3 p d n 3 11 j 1 w n 1 n 12 k t p e n 2 1 t p e n 2 1 p e n 2 13 η 0 k t j k q p e n 2 1 n n 3 p d p e p d 1 where p d is the ratio of delivered power n is the ratio of propeller speed k q is the ratio of propeller torque coefficient η r is the ratio of relative rotation efficiency 1 w is the ratio of wake fraction defect j is the ratio of propeller advance coefficient p e is the ratio of the ship effective power 1 t is the ratio of thrust deduction fraction defect k t is the ratio of propeller thrust coefficient η d is the ratio of propulsive efficiency and η 0 is the ratio of propeller open water efficiency as argued the result presented in equation 13 implies that the propeller open water efficiency at the same ship speed will remain the same as the original model test data as a result of the chosen solution for the corrections finally the values of the correction factors deduced with the procedure above are presented in table 3 the model test results corrected using the above mentioned method have been applied in developing and calibrating the models of propeller and ship resistance as introduced in appendix b after the components models of the ship propulsion system have been built the static matching of the ship propulsion system is analysed matching to be understood as the relation between engine envelope and propeller ship characteristic as fully explained in klein woud and stapersma 2002 the matching results have been validated by the real ship sea trial test shown in fig 5 the original matching based on the original model test data is heavier compared with the sea trial test results note that due to the fact that there is only one overall set of correction factors as given in equation 10 12 and presented in table 3 the measured points of the sea trial are still not all exactly on the model data but at least the model now correlates in a mean sense to the measured data note that the ship draught during sea trial test was the same as the ship design draught in this paper the service margin or sea margin sm is assumed to be zero sm 0 during the sea trial test despite of the fact that the wind force was actually beaufort 3 4 and the sea state was douglas 2 3 rather than a very calm sea however the correction on resistance would be even larger if the sea margin during sea trials was noticeably larger than one 5 application of calibrated propulsion system model on the benchmark ship simulation results for realistic operational conditions 5 1 selecting a sea margin for typical sailing conditions according to klein woud and stapersma 2002 the sea margin sm in realistic sailing condition which accounts for the added ship resistance due to the fouling of hull and propeller displacement sea state and water depth as shown in equation 14 is selected relative to the sea margin of 0 in sea trial condition calm water condition 14 s m f f o u l i n g d i s p l a c e m e n t s e a s t a t e w a t e r d e p t h f 1 f o u l i n g f 2 d i s p l a c e m e n t f 3 s e a s t a t e f 4 w a t e r d e p t h 1 based on 1 5 years period and 3 increase of resistance per year due to fouling the effect of hull and propeller fouling is 15 f 1 f o u l i n g 1 0 03 1 5 1 045 the ship resistance addition relative to that in trial condition due to sea state during realistic sailing conditions taking wind waves and currents in to account is set to be 10 so the effect of sea state is 16 f 3 s e a s t a t e 1 10 clearly this is a drastic simplification of actual sea state effects but for the current design study it is deemed sufficient the draught of the ship during the sea trial test is the design draught and it is assumed that the ship also sails at the design draught in real sailing condition so the effect of the displacement variations on ship resistance are neglected see equation 17 furthermore it is assumed that the ship sails in deep water as during the sea trials so the effect of shallow water on ship resistance is also neglected see equation 18 17 f 2 d i s p l a c e m e n t 1 18 f 4 w a t e r d e p t h 1 the total sea margin according to equation 14 will then be 19 s m 1 045 1 1 1 1 1 0 15 therefore the sea margin sm in realistic sailing condition relative to sea trial condition is set to be 15 5 2 different ship propulsion control and electric power generation modes in this paper different propulsion control modes as well as different electric power generation modes are taken into consideration to conduct a systematic ship propulsion behaviour investigation 5 2 1 ship propulsion control modes a controllable pitch propeller driven by the main engine is installed in the propulsion system of the chemical tanker theoretically the chemical tanker propulsion system can work in three different control modes namely constant revolution mode constant pitch mode and combinator mode as presented in table 4 the propeller revolution and propeller pitch are predefined in combinator curves and controlled simultaneously by single lever command slc for these three different propulsion control modes in each combinator curve for a given slc there will be a certain propeller revolution and propeller pitch in constant revolution mode the ship speed will be controlled by changing the propeller pitch and keeping the propeller revolution constant in the constant pitch mode the ship speed will be controlled by changing the propeller revolution and keeping the propeller pitch constant until the propeller revolution reaches the minimum revolution limit in the combinator mode the ship speed will be controlled by changing the propeller revolution limited by the minimum and maximum revolutions and pitch simultaneously see fig 6 a the mechanical power which is either provided by the main engine to the shaft generator through the pto gearbox in pto mode or is provided by the auxiliary engine directly to the auxiliary generator in aux mode is 350 kw and assumed to be constant setting the sea margin as 15 the operational results in terms of main engine speed and power under the combinator control mode and the two electric power generation modes are shown in fig 6 b when the electric power is generated in pto mode the main engine needs to provide extra power to the shaft generator in addition to the power required by the propulsion system if the main engine is operating in the high engine speed region in practice ship speed should be reduced somewhat or for the sake of the engine operation safety the electric power generation mode should be switched from pto mode to aux mode or the propeller pitch should be reduced slightly to keep the engine power inside the engine operating envelope 5 2 2 electric power generation modes the electric power generation system of the chemical tanker consists of three auxiliary generators driven by three auxiliary engines and one shaft generator driven by the main engine through a pto gearbox the electric power required by the on board electric loads can be provided either by the shaft generator pto mode or by the auxiliary generators aux mode or even by both the shaft generator and auxiliary generators working in parallel combined mode when a large amount of electric power is needed in some special cases the latter mode will however not be investigated in this paper table 5 presents the electric power generation modes investigated in this paper 5 3 correction for difference between diesel fuel type used in the engine test bed and real ship operations the specific fuel consumption of the main engine is calculated by the diesel engine model introduced in the appendix the specific fuel consumption of the auxiliary engine at 50 mcr is 230 g kwh at iso value for fuel lhv and consequently the specific fuel consumption of the auxiliary engine whose power at mcr is 750 kw is assumed to be 230 g kwh at iso when it provides mechanical power of 350 kw to the auxiliary generator at aux mode in reality the diesel fuel type in ship operation is heavy fuel oil hfo for the main engine and marine diesel fuel mdf for the auxiliary engines however the fuel consumption test results measured on the engine test bed which have been corrected at iso are used in developing and calibration of the main engine model therefore the fuel consumption during real ship operation has been corrected according to equation 20 using the correcting factors shown in table 6 note that the underlying idea of equation 20 is that engine efficiency remains the same when changing fuel type 20 φ x c x φ x i s o where φ x is the fuel consumption of hfo and mdf kg s φ x i s o is the fuel consumption of fuel at iso kg s c x is the correcting factors of fuel consumption for different fuel types represented in table 6 5 4 results and evaluation the ship performance under different propulsion control modes as well as different power generation modes at nominal sea margin sm 15 has been investigated and the results are presented in figs 7 14 5 4 1 fuel consumption and fuel index the combined engine power and fuel flow at different propulsion control modes and power generation modes are shown in fig 7 a and b respectively according to fig 7 a the combined engine power in pto mode is slightly higher than that of aux mode because of the power losses in the pto gearbox through which the power from the main engine is transmitted to the shaft generator while the power from auxiliary engine is directly transmitted to the auxiliary generator according to fig 7 b the combined fuel flow at aux mode is higher than that at pto mode especially at low ship speeds due to the higher specific fuel consumption at aux mode as shown in fig 8 a for the same ship speeds the constant revolution mode requires the highest engine power and fuel flow followed by the combinator mode and the constant pitch mode requires the lowest this in fact is mainly caused by the lower propeller efficiency when the pitch is reduced in case of constant revolution and combinator mode compared with the constant pitch mode as will be elaborated in the next section the combined specific fuel consumption sfc under constant revolution control mode is better than the constant pitch mode and the combinator mode especially at low ship speed as shown in fig 8 a while the results of fuel index fi under the three different propulsion control modes are contrary as shown in fig 8 b the reason is that the main engine almost operates in the same region of specific fuel consumption under the three different control modes at high ship speeds while it runs in quite different regions at low ship speeds and for the 2 stroke engines in the benchmark ship the constant revolution mode runs through a better region of sfc compared with the other two modes note that for 4 stroke engines constant revolution normally has a worse sfc compared to constant pitch propeller curve the fuel index is determined by the fuel consumption flow at a certain ship speed when the ship dead weight remains the same the constant revolution control mode has a higher fuel consumption flow compared with the other two modes especially at low ship speeds as already shown in fig 7 b furthermore the lowest fuel index under different propulsion control modes occurs at different ship speeds it shows the fact that the fuel consumption can be reduced by slow steaming of the ship although the specific fuel consumption of the engines will increase with the reduction of the ship speed note that engine specific fuel consumption sfc is a combined value for main and auxiliary engines if applicable as implied by equation 5 when looking at the electric power generation modes the combined specific fuel consumption is higher at aux mode than that at pto mode especially at low ship speeds as shown in fig 8 a the reason is that at low ship speeds the engine power required for propulsion is low and the engine power for electric loads is relatively higher than at high ship speeds consequently the auxiliary engine with higher specific fuel consumption contributes relatively more engine power at low ship speeds resulting in higher combined specific fuel consumption at aux mode the difference between operating the shaft generator or auxiliary gensets also has some influence on the combined fuel index and the pto mode has a lower fuel index in all the three propulsion control modes as shown in fig 8 b the first lesson is that specific fuel consumption of the engine gives misleading trends and should not be used when considering the overall energy conversion in the ship instead the fuel index should be used since it contains information of the propeller efficiency and auxiliary power conversion as well and therefore is a real system performance indicator unlike sfc 5 4 2 energy effectiveness and efficiencies the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c shown in fig 10 is actually the inverse of the fuel index and thus the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c has the inverse trend as that of the fuel index fi the highest values of the energy conversion effectiveness correspond to the lowest values of the fuel index in fact the energy conversion effectiveness ε e c is determined by the combined engine efficiency η e n g shown in fig 9 the hub distribution factor ε h u b shown in fig 11 the transmission efficiency η t r m shown in fig 12 the propulsive efficiency η d shown in fig 13 and the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p which is actually the ratio of ship dead weight to ship resistance w d r shown in fig 14 the combined engine efficiency η e n g shown in fig 9 is actually the inverse of the combined engine specific fuel consumption sfc shown in fig 8 a the hub distribution factor ε h u b shown in fig 11 is determined by the propulsion load provided that the electrical load is kept constant or rather the hub distribution factor ε h u b will increase if the power required for ship propulsion increases both increasing the ship speed and changing propulsion control modes from constant pitch mode to constant revolution mode will increase the power required for propulsion and consequently influence the hub distribution factor in the latter case it can be explained by the propulsive efficiency η d of different control modes shown in fig 13 at certain ship speeds in particular at low ship speeds constant revolution mode with smaller propeller pitch results in lower propulsive efficiency so the propeller needs more power from engine for ship propulsion the hub distribution factor ε h u b at pto mode is slightly higher than that at aux mode because the engine power for electric system p b e at pto mode is slightly higher than that at aux mode due to the power losses in the pto gearbox the transmission efficiency η t r m of the shaftline does not change much with the ship speed and propulsion control modes as shown in fig 12 having limited influence on the overall performance of the entire power chain the propulsive efficiency η d shown in fig 13 is mainly determined by the propeller efficiency considering the fact that the ship hull efficiency does not vary too much under different operating conditions at high ship speeds the propulsive efficiency under different propulsion control modes shows very small differences because both the propeller speed and pitch are almost the same to obtain the corresponding high ship speeds when the ship slows down the propulsive efficiency under all the three different propulsion control modes decreases as a result of the different combinations of propeller speed and pitch to obtain the required low ship speeds the decrease of propulsive efficiency under constant revolution propulsion control mode is the fastest followed by the combinator control mode while for the constant pitch control mode the propulsive efficiency changes slowest as shown in fig 13 in other words the constant pitch control mode shows the best propulsive efficiency when the ship sails at low speeds while the constant revolution mode has the worst propulsive efficiency and the combinator control modes lies in between when the ship is operating under constant revolution mode in order to reduce the ship speed the propeller pitch has to be reduced consequently decreasing the propeller efficiency in fact the propeller pitch has a dominating effect on the propeller efficiency while the propeller speed hardly has an influence when the ship sails under certain resistance conditions the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p i e the ratio of ship dead weight to resistance w d r under the three different propulsion control modes will be obviously the same when the ship sails at the same speeds as shown in fig 14 when the ship slows down the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p will increase accordingly in other words the power needed for ship propulsion to transport a certain useful load will be reduced significantly when reducing the ship speed as a consequence the required engine power will be reduced by a great deal when the ship sails at slow speeds especially when the propulsive efficiency η d does not change much for example when the ship is operated under the constant pitch control modes or the ship is propelled by a fixed pitch propeller that is the most common case for large ocean going cargo ships nowadays in fact the ship effective power effectiveness ε e p is the core reason why ship transportation is the most efficient when compared to other transportation modes and the absolute size of useful weight w d makes it the most important transportation mode in terms of transport volume as well 5 4 3 summary of the results the result of course is that slow steaming within a certain ship speed range will reduce the fuel consumption generating the electric power by the shaft generator pto mode rather than by the auxiliary generators aux mode also saves fuel constant revolution control mode consumes more fuel than the other two modes especially at low ship speeds however the benchmark chemical tanker operates in constant revolution mode most of the time during transport because of the installed shaft generator which needs to run at constant revolution when the ship is operating at constant pitch and combinator modes where the shaft speed will change significantly with slc the onboard electric power will be provided by the auxiliary generators rather than the shaft generator to provide electricity with stable frequency and voltage for the onboard grid when comparing the fuel index and energy conversion effectiveness of the ship under constant revolution mode where the electric power is generated in pto mode with those under constant pitch and combinator modes where the electric power is generated in aux mode the disadvantages brought by the constant revolution mode at low ship speeds are essentially the results of the decreased propeller pitch leading to a lower propeller efficiency which is not compensated by the better specific fuel consumption of the engine and the advantages of the shaft generator 6 conclusions and recommendations this paper has cleared up some confusion in the existing terminology by developing a consistent and comprehensive theoretical framework of the energy conversion of ships with the new framework in addition to having an overall look at the whole power chain this paper also has a close look inside the stages of the energy conversion process providing a deeper insight into the influence of individual nodes and links of the power chain on the overall performance the influence on the transport performance by ship operations is provided through a quantitative and systematic investigation on the impact of operational reduction of ship speeds propulsion control modes and electric power generation modes according to results of the ship performance investigation the most efficient and practical way to reduce the fuel index of a cargo ship not surprisingly is to reduce the ship speed however the engine specific fuel consumption may increase with the reduction of the ship speed which is a misleading result in this paper operational reduction of ship speed has been investigated given a fixed nominal or design speed in fact under imo ships are designed to be slower by selecting propulsion systems with smaller engines in the design stage to achieve a lower eedi which has raised serious concerns regarding ship safety in adverse weather conditions however designing the ship for a higher speed but reducing actual operational speed during missions will be more effective and safer alternative propulsion control modes also result in differences in the fuel consumption performance especially at low ship speeds in terms of the fuel index the constant pitch control mode shows the best performance during various operational conditions while the constant revolution model is the worst especially during low ship speeds in terms of the specific fuel consumption of the engines the constant revolution mode shows a better behaviour compared with the other two control modes in particular at low ship speeds but this is a misleading result the propulsive efficiency and the effective power effectiveness are the core factors that have a dominating influence on the overall performance of the power chain the effective power effectiveness presents the core reason why bigger and slower ships are more efficient however the reduction of the propulsive efficiency at lower ship speed will severely limit the increase of the energy conversion effectiveness that would be possible from the effective power effectiveness i e the favourable weight resistance ratio at low speeds the energy management of the power chain which is quantified by the hub distribution factor has a large impact on the energy conversion effectiveness of the ship the more the power is distributed for ship propulsion compared to the power provided for example to the electrical loads onboard the higher the energy conversion effectiveness will be which means the ship will be more efficient investigation of the influence on the energy conversion effectiveness by the power take off pto shows that under the same propulsion control mode generating the electric power by the shaft generator rather than the auxiliary generator also reduces fuel consumption of the ship but the effect is relatively minor last but not least there are still some uncertainties and limitations in this study and these need to be further studied in future work the main uncertainties are present in the prediction of the fuel consumption performance of the 2 stroke diesel engine because of a small database as introduced in appendix b it is the intention to try to obtain more test data through further cooperation with partners from industry the main limitation is that in this paper only point values of the performance parameters are investigated while in the end mean values weighted over realistic mission profiles must give the real answers acknowledgements this project partly is financially supported by international science technology cooperation program of china 2014dfa71700 marine low speed engine project phase i appendix a description of component models a 1 normalisation of variables for the sake of convenience in modelling and analysis of the ship propulsion system some variables used in the model of ship propulsion system have been normalised by relating the off design condition variables to the corresponding variables of a known nominal condition klein woud and stapersma 2002 as presented in eq a 1 a1 x x x n o m where x is the normalised variables x is the relevant variables to be normalised and x n o m is the corresponding nominal value of the variables note that the mathematical technique of normalisation is the same as relating sea trial to prediction as was done to make corrections for the actual sea trial measurements a 2 diesel engine model in this paper an analytical and first principle model in which the engine torque m e n g is modelled as a function of engine speed n e n g and the injected fuel per cycle m f shi 2013 expressed by eq a2 has been adopted in the ship propulsion system model the engine torque m e n g injected fuel per cycle m f and the engine speed n e n g have all been normalised as m m f and n according to eq a 1 a2 m f m f n f 1 m f f 2 n f 3 m f n 1 a 1 m f b 1 m f 2 c 1 n d 1 n 2 2 e 1 m f 1 n this equation essentially is a taylor series approximation of a function of two variables up to second order terms including the cross product a 3 ship resistance model most of the time the ship resistance or ship effective power are modelled when modelling ship resistance characteristics however unfortunately this kind of models are not first principle because they just model the results rather than the physics behind the final results in other words one cannot have a physical insight in the modelled system in klein woud and stapersma 2002 the specific resistance of ship hull c e which is a non dimensional parameter indicating the ship resistance characteristics when amongst others ship size speed and hull form are given it is defined by eq a 3 a3 c e p e ρ 2 3 v s 3 where p e is the ship effective power w ρ is the density of water kg m3 is the displacement volume of the hull m3 v s is the ship velocity m s in this paper the ship specific resistance c e instead of ship resistance or ship effective power which is the result of the former is modelled as a function of ship speed v s by eq a 4 the variables in the following equations have been normalised according to eq a 1 both the viscous resistance at lower ship speeds and wave making resistance at higher ship speeds are modelled by eq a 4 the wave making resistance which takes a very small part of the total resistance at low ship speeds and will increase rapidly at high ship speeds is modelled as an exponential function of the ship speed the viscous resistance consists of the basic viscous resistance a linear correction and nonlinear correction the latter two contributions being the result of viscous effect at lower reynolds and being modelled as a linear slope and exponential function respectively a4 c e 1 a c e basic viscous resistance k c e v s 1 linear correction viscous resistance c c e ⅇ d c e v s ⅇ d c e nonlinear correction viscous resistance viscous resistance a c e ⅇ b c e v s 1 wavemaking resistance a 4 propeller model the propeller model introduced in klein woud and stapersma 2002 has been applied in this paper as shown in eq a 5 and eq a 6 a5 k t 1 a p r o p j 1 c p r o p j 1 2 a6 k q 1 b p r o p j 1 d p r o p j 1 2 the propeller thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and advance ratio j have been normalised as k t k q and j according to eq a 1 a 5 wake factor thrust deduction factor and relative rotative efficiency model in this paper the wake factor w thrust deduction factor t and relative rotative efficiency η r are modelled as a quadratic function of ship speed v s by eq a 7 eq a 8 and eq a 9 respectively the variables in the equations have already been normalised by eq a 1 a7 w 1 c w 1 v s d w 1 v s 2 a8 t 1 c t 1 v s d t 1 v s 2 a9 η r 1 c η r 1 v s d η r 1 v s 2 again these essentially are taylor series approximations of a function of one variable up to second order terms a 6 mechanical transmission losses the method proposed in godjevac et al 2016 is used to model the transmission losses of propulsion shaftline and pto gearbox of the ship the gearbox and shaft losses are presented as a torque loss m l o s s which is expressed as function of the input torque m i n and input speed n i n shown in eq a 10 the variables in the equation have already been normalised a10 m l o s s k a m i n k b n i n k c where k a is the coefficient related to the torque k b is the coefficient related to the rotational speed and k c is the coefficient related to the constant torque loss appendix b calibration of component models to testbed and towing tank measurements b 1 diesel engine the calibration results of diesel engine model are shown in table b 2 fig b 1 and fig b 2 the engine test data used in calibrating the diesel engine torque model are selected from operating points along the propeller curve and the generator curve in the engine envelope fuel consumption test data of operating points along the generator curve and propeller curve are obtained by taking the mean value of the corresponding data of the eiapp engine international air pollution prevention technical files of five different engines from the same engine family including the diesel engine installed in the chemical tanker as shown in table b 1 the mean value of data of different engines is taken in the following way firstly the mean value of data of different engines at nominal points are taken as the new nominal value of the engine secondly the mean values of part load percentages i e the ratios of part load value to nominal value along generator curve e2 cycle and propeller curve e3 cycle of different engines are taken as the part load percentages of the engine along generator curve and propeller curve respectively table b1 available eiapp test data of man6s35me engines from the same engine family table b1 test cycle e2 e3 e3 e3 e3 rated power kw 4170

consumption performance of a 2 stroke diesel engine is different from that of a 4 stroke diesel engine the specific fuel consumption of 4 stroke diesel engines is better lower when the engine is operating under the propeller law than under the generator law klein woud and stapersma 2002 however the 2 stroke diesel engine investigated in this paper has better specific fuel consumption when operating under generator law than the propeller law although in fact there is hardly any difference as shown in fig b 2 which is also different from 4 stroke diesel engine unfortunately very few data in this regard are found in the open literature and currently we have limitations to prove the accuracy of our model results more data and research results in this regard are expected and encouraged to be published by the other researchers b 2 ship resistance the calibration results of ship resistance model are shown in table 4 and b3 fig b 3 and fig b 4 note that the original model test data of ship effective power presented in fig b 4 have been corrected together with the original model test data of the propeller open water characteristics according to the real ship sea trial test results and the correction method as was shown in the main text section 4 2 in addition the available test data are limited in the high ship speeds range namely from 11 5kn to 15kn and there is no data available for the low ship speeds below 11 5kn therefore only the specific ship resistance model at high ship speeds are calibrated using the available test data while the model at low ship speeds are fitted according to the ship resistance calculation method presented in holtrop and mennen 1982 holtrop 1984 carried out by the authors but not presented here table b3 coefficients of ship resistance

22462,weight saving is crucial in naval architecture to reduce costs and improve performances in sailing ships design rig s scantling is important also for ship stability as rig s weight generates heeling actions on the vessel due to heeled navigation therefore rig s weight saving remarkably reduces ship s heeling allowing to increase the wind exposed area consequently improving the sailing performances however because of the complexity of the structure and uncertainties in loading conditions the structural scantling of a rig implies the adoption of high safety factors furthermore the increasing trend to use composite materials represents an additional source of complexity due to their anisotropic non homogeneous nature and uncertainties on material properties and generally implies even larger safety factors besides implying high construction costs the present work shows a comparison between an existing 76 m carbon mast and an aluminium alloy one suitable fem models of both rigs were built up and used to assess the structural system strength according to applicable class rules the cross section stiffness of the aluminium mast was optimized in order to make masts performances comparable the optimized aluminium mast of comparable weight of the carbon one results to be more cost effective for such range of sailing vessels keywords sail system mast rigging structural lightning aluminium alloy composites 1 introduction the study of a sail system is a typical fluid structure interaction fsi problem fukasawa and katori 1993 being the acting loads dependent on the structural deformations furthermore since two fluids water and air are involved inertial loads arising by ship motions can further affect aerodynamic and structural performances marchaj 2000 nowadays recent technological innovations have introduced large improvements in sail yachts an increasing trend towards embedded design approaches involving riggers and sailmakers historically distinct professional figures in collaboration also with skilled aerodynamicists and material scientists can be observed vazquez 2007 furthermore while many aerodynamic studies are carried out on masts and sails to optimize their shapes e g chapin et al 2005 ferreira et al 2017 rather small efforts are devoted to the study of the structural behaviour and to the ability of mast and rigging to deform in a controllable manner in particular such analyses are even more complicated when adopting composite materials le maitre et al 1996 which revolutionized the nautical world in past decades the opportunities offered by such materials in terms of mechanical characteristics and design flexibility to naval architects generated an intensive and continuously increasing application in this field giorgetti 2000 especially anisotropy allowed suitable orientation of stiffness and strength properties of laminates on the other hand the anisotropic nature of composite materials the non homogeneous elastic properties through the thickness of the stacking sequence the scattered and largely varying mechanical properties both in terms of stiffness and strength and new failure modes originating from the cohesive behaviour of multi layered composites may complicate the design phase in addition manufacturing defects still leave large uncertainties in the use of such materials leading to mechanical performances i e stiffness strength fatigue etc strongly dependant on the manufacturing process forcing classification societies to impose high safety factors in their rules and standards for such reasons the risk to over design structures is high thus wasting the potential benefits of composite materials traditionally global buckling is considered the governing limit state because of the column like behaviour of such slender structures rizzo and boote 2010 material failure and ultimate capacity collapse are limit states to be considered as well but still accounting for weight optimization indeed rig weight is of paramount importance because of its effects on ship stability and seakeeping performances and considering the large height of the sail systemrelatively large masts can also experience fatigue issues on fittings items like toggles turnbuckles tip cups at spreader ends and eyes terminals finite element models are powerful numerical tools that can be successfully used for the design of composite slender structures although modelling is challenging because of the complexity of the constitutive laws of such materials due to their layered lay out anisotropic nature and complex failure modes godani et al 2014 hence traditional metallic structures could be reconsidered in cases of high uncertainties and safety conditions as in large sailing vessels in fact the isotropy of metallic homogenous and ductile materials simplifies the structural design possibly leading to better optimization of the final product in terms of costs weight structural behaviour and more in general performances furthermore because of the lower stiffness of aluminium alloys with respect to carbon fibre laminates similar mast s pre bend can be reached with lower pre tensioning forces thus lowering the loads and their effect on the whole structure including the hull the present work arises from the question of replacing carbon fibre masts with aluminium ones for large sailing vessels in order to answer to this question an existing rig using a carbon mast 76 m tall and having five orders of spreaders installed on the test case sail yacht has been taken into account the work is aimed at designing an aluminium mast having comparable weight and structural characteristics equivalent to the carbon fibre one in order to reduce design and construction costs and to increase the shipyard competitiveness namely the aluminium mast proposed by the current work only costs about 35 of the price of the equivalent carbon fiber mast in the following the design procedure is presented including also results relevant to safety requirements imposed by scantling rules of classification societies as aforementioned the literature regarding the study of the rig in terms of structural behaviour is more limited with respect to the one regarding aerodynamic aspects however a few works can be found in open literature a recent short review about mast and rigging design is reported in ghelardi 2017 and moves from the well known empirical work by skene 1904 which represent a milestone in the field passing to the nordic boat standard method reported in larsson and eliasson 1997 in which formulae for small rig scantling are reported leading to the works of grabe 2004 2006 2013 and sponberg 1983 through the interesting numerical and experimental approaches proposed by janssen 2004 carrera et al 2009 and pallu de la barrière et al 2008 another interesting study has been published by van der werff and keuning 1988 where the variations of rigging forces are studied depending on the heeling angle with an analytical approach this study also takes into account the hull girder flexibility in 2010 an article about best practices for the numerical modelling of rigs using one and two dimensional elements was presented in rizzo and boote 2010 in the last years gaiotti and rizzo 2014 published a work regarding the dynamic behaviour of a typical aluminium mast panel in particular the authors assessed the structural response under sinusoidal impulsive loads of different durations in menotti et al 2013 a study based on the use of an unsteady fluid structure interaction fsi tool was used to investigate the cause of the dismasting of the vor 70 groupama 4 racing yacht tuning values were reported but no information about the followed procedure were presented results showed like the loss of different structural elements of the rigging system caused the mast failure more recently in lepidi et al 2015 a preliminary work on the investigation of the mast pumping phenomenon during sailing was presented the work regarded the setup of an analytical model constituted by a shear undeformable euler bernoulli beam and an inextensible cable to simulate the mast and the forestay respectively results were validated with a fem code finding good agreement eventually another work was presented in lorenzetti et al 2017 focused on the importance of the numerical simulation of geometrical manufacturing defects arising during the mast construction and affecting the mast structural response as regards scantling rules proposed by classification societies dnvgl s standards dnvgl 2016 seems to be the most detailed for the design of such structures several loading conditions can be assessed depending on the ship typology considering forces induced by aerodynamic actions standing and running rigging however even if less detailed rather comprehensive guidelines for rig scantling can be found also in lr 2016 dnvgl s rules have been adopted in the present study to assess aerodynamic loads and limit states of the structure 2 numerical models the study has been carried out via the fe software adina adina 2016 both geometrical large displacement and material nonlinearities of truss elements used to simulate the cables were considered in the analyses carried out eventually linearized buckling simulations have been used to assess such limit state according to dnvgl s requirements and usual shipyards design practice at first a model of the existing carbon fibre mast has been created followed by the equivalent aluminium mast the only difference between the two analysed rigs is represented by the material s characteristics of the mast in fact shrouds and stays have not been changed in terms of cross sections and material since the focus of this work was on the mast only which represents the main fraction of the total weight of the rig fig 1 shows the percentage weight of the different components of the existing carbon mast rig the mast represents 56 of the total weight whilst the sum of the fore aft rigging i e the stays and the transversal rigging i e the shrouds accounts for 36 about the geometry the mast is 76 045 m tall having a rake of 2 1 spreaders have a sweep back angle of 22 fig 2 shows the main geometrical features the mast has been subdivided in eight panels between mast step gooseneck and each spreaders pair with different cross sectional areas and inertias it should be noted that panel 0 represents the part of the mast between the keel and the main deck furthermore v and d letters indicate the vertical and diagonal shrouds in order to take into account the effects induced by the real cross section of the mast panels spreaders and diagonal shrouds end points are placed in their actual position i e on tube shell such points are connected via rigid link to the beam axis line representing the mast the points on the mast represent the master points which drives the rigid displacements of the slave points belonging to shrouds and spreaders according to the deformation of the structure such modelling strategy allows appropriately considering the effects of bending and torsional moments induced by the spreaders on the mast rigid links are highlighted in fig 3 fig 4 shows a schematic representation of the cross section without internal stiffening an elastic isotropic material model was adopted for the mast and the spreaders materials characteristics are reported in table 1 cables were modelled by an isotropic nonlinear material model where compressive stiffnesses were set equal to zero for negative strains to model the behaviour of such structures in compression carbon material was employed for shrouds and back stay whilst pbo phenylene benzobisoxazole was used for other stays densities were also set up since the own static weight of the structure was considered in the computations a density fictitious value based on the shipyards experience and considering also fittings end tips local reinforcements pulleys filler material and paint as appropriate has been used however in the case of the aluminium mast the exact value could not be reported here for confidentiality reasons nevertheless for readers information the adopted figure is not so different by the density of an aluminium alloy generally used for mast building i e al 6082 which is reported in table 1 as a general indication mast and spreaders were modelled with 6 dofs beam elements as regard shrouds and stays truss elements were employed the model accounts for a total number of 362 elements and 372 nodes shrouds and stays have been modelled with one single truss element apart from the fore stays where the induced aerodynamic load was supposed to be applied in fact different loading conditions generated by different sails have been considered to set different load cases therefore the fore stays where the aerodynamic load was applied were in turn modelled with 50 truss elements it is worth noting that sails were not modelled since the loads were applied as concentrated forces according to the widely applied quasi static equilibrium between inclining and righting moment of the yacht procedure conceptually proposed by skene 1904 namely the dnvgl s dnvgl 2016 recommendations were followed to evaluate external acting loads the mast was stepped on the keel while the main deck represents a further constraint such conditions have been simulated by fixing all the dofs at the mast step except for the rotations around the transversal y axis whilst to simulate the deck effect no horizontal translations were allowed at deck level as well as rotations about the vertical axis mast torsion to perform a more accurate computation the second constraint set at deck level births only at the end of the pre tensioning stage when the mast assumes a fixed and defined vertical position chain plates of shrouds have been simulated by fixing displacements of truss elements ends free rotations fig 5 shows the numerical model built in adina with boundary conditions three different loading categories can be identified pre tensioning aerodynamic and gravity loads assuming a quasi static approach at first pretension has been imposed on the whole rig different strategies could be possible to simulate the real dock tuning procedure as regards real experimental procedure generally only vertical shrouds are tensioned first based on the shipyard experience then the mast step is pushed by a jack measuring the applied force later force measurements are taken at stays and mast step vertical displacement is measured the process is repeated until the mast shape and the force applied by the jack reach a target value thereafter the mast is lowered and stepped up repeatedly and diagonal shrouds tensioned one pair by one pair verifying not only stays and stepping forces but also global mast shape i e its pre bending deflection checking possible inverse deflection as regards the numerical procedure adopted in the present work shrouds and stays have been tensioned by imposing initial strains causing shortening thus simulating the action of hydraulic cylinders at cable ends and or turnbuckles partially following the actual procedure adopted by the shipyard at the initial computation step the lowest vertical shrouds v1 and the inner forestay were tensioned afterwards several computation steps were run imposing a shortening starting from the highest diagonal shrouds d5 to the lowest ones d1 eventually headstay and back stay have been tuned fig 6 illustrates the initial and final pre tensioning steps where initial strains are applied in several steps respectively in a and b plots the magenta elements are the tensioned ones i e where initial strains were imposed whilst the blue ones are slack i e where no initial strains were applied mast and spreaders are in compression axial forces induced by dock tuning are reported in table 3 in percentage terms computed with respect to the values detected for v1 shrouds which are the most stressed cable elements afterwards aerodynamic loads were considered dnvgl specify four different ship categories for the load estimation depending on the ship characteristics dnvgl 2016 such categories are reported in table 2 the analysed ship falls into the first category three different sail plan configurations and loading conditions have been considered according to the ship specifications a full main sail and jib the jib is armed on the inner forestay which has been modelled with 50 truss elements in order to evaluate its catenary shape based on dnvgl 2016 aerodynamic loads have been computed by assuming a heeling angle of 25 and applying concentrated forces in the following points according to rules specifications lateral forces nodes shared by spreaders and mast mainsail head and gooseneck due to the mainsail action inner forestay simulating the jib action longitudinal forces mainsail head and gooseneck due to the longitudinal component of the force developed by the mainsail leech vertical loads induced by halyards and applied at mainsail and jib head b two reef main sail and staysail the staysail is armed on the staysail stay which has been modelled with 50 truss elements in order to evaluate its catenary shape in this case aerodynamic loads have been computed under the hypothesis of a heeling angle of 20 forces have been applied similarly to the previous case c full main sail and reacher the reacher is armed on the headstay which has been modelled with 50 truss elements in order to evaluate its catenary shape in this case aerodynamic loads have been computed under the hypothesis of a heeling angle of 20 forces have been applied similarly to the first case for the sake of shortness the load cases will be indicated in the following as lca load case a lcb and lcc aerodynamic standing and running rigging have been considered according to dnvgl s recommendations in all computations the interested reader is referred to dnvgl 2016 for further details on the adopted formulae it is worth to outline that before applying the aerodynamic loads the tuning procedure was preliminary carried out in all the three load cases gravity force has been also considered in the computation because of the large size of the mast it is worth mentioning that to perform a more conservative computation runners initially were not introduced in the modelling this aspect mainly affects the longitudinal stability of the mast which is considered critical in harsh dynamic conditions moreover runners are not always used by the crew during navigation but only when pitching may induce large inertial loads e g while motoring in heading rough sea similar numerical models were validated by the authors in a previously published work comparing adina s results with experimental ones carried out from a similar rig ghelardi et al 2019 initial assessments have been carried out on the carbon mast model in order to validate the numerical results comparing outcomes with the ones obtained according to dnvgl rules by the designer in their preliminary calculations on the structural integrity of the rig and those later provided by the shipyard both carried out using the commercial software ansys afterwards calculations on the aluminium mast have been settled showing the need for a structural optimization in terms of weight reduction and re distribution along mast s height eventually a comparison between the carbon and aluminium masts was carried out comparing static and buckling analyses showing also the capability of the optimized aluminium mast to satisfy the acceptance criteria of the dnvgl rules 3 analysis of results 3 1 carbon mast since dnvgl s calculations were developed before the construction of the rig a difference in terms of total weight exists between the model used in the design stage and the one now developed in fact the nominal total design weight was of 16575 kg whilst the real total weight of the structure adopted in the subsequent analyses was about 18274 kg in particular mast tube weight accounted for 8504 kg and 10731 kg in the two cases the difference is due to the presence of filler paint pulleys fittings electrical cables and halyards not considered in the initial design fe model however because of the adopted quasi static approach this difference was supposed to be not substantial in fact it should be noted that for such kind of structures gravity loads are less relevant with respect to external static loads however the own weight of the structure has been considered in the calculations fig 7 reports a picture during the weighting procedure of the carbon mast a first evaluation regarded the dock tuning maximum longitudinal pre bending displacements accounted for 176 mm approximately and occurred roughly at mid span of panel 3 of the mast as regards shrouds highest axial forces have been found in correspondence of the v1s reducing along mast height until the v5s fig 8 reports axial forces and longitudinal deformation of the structure the latter is magnified by a factor 50 for clarity it is worth to note once again that runners were not modelled in the current and in the following simulations for conservative reasons in fact their action would contribute to reduce the mast longitudinal bending helping to stabilize the structure as mentioned runners are not always used during navigation and this can be regarded as a conservative assumption lepidi et al 2015 all the axial force values reported in fig 8 are normalized with respect to the value of the v1 shrouds working load calculated in load case a lca by dnvgl ansys model such choice of normalization value has no particular meaning other than hiding absolute values of tensioning forces therefore for instance v1 dock tuning tension account for the 69 5 of the value computed by dnvgl ansys model in lca for v1 tension such choice has been extended to all the following cases providing an overview of the sail system structural behaviour without disclosing confidential data however for a better comprehension of the involved figures the reference value of tension has an order of magnitude of about 1000 1200 kn table 3 shows a comparison between the axial forces of shrouds and stays computed by dnvgl ansys model and by the authors of this study after the dock tuning process estimates of loads on lower vertical shrouds v1s v2s and v3s present a good agreement being differences lower than 10 for v4s v5s d6s and d1 aft differences grow up until 15 stays forces show variations between the 10 and 30 whilst d1fwd forward shows an 87 difference such deviation is due to a slight variation of the geometry adopted in the adina model for the sake of simplicity however it should be noted from table 3 that d1fwd s contribute to rig tuning forces is only approximately 1 of the maximum reference value taken to normalize all results therefore the induced absolute error in the simulation has been considered negligible as regards the compression at the mast foot the value showed very good matching the pre bend value has been computed from the algebraic sum of maximum and minimum longitudinal displacements divided by the height of the mainsails boltrope 65200 mm the difference between the two calculations is 33 see fig 9 showing the mast s deformed shape such a deviation between the two models can be noted in the longitudinal plane above 50 m in height where dnvgl ansys s model presents a larger deformation such difference can be explained by the higher stress state of v4s v5s and d6s which generate a higher compression on the corresponding spreaders thus increasing the longitudinal deformation of the mast highest part afterwards a comparison among the different analysed load cases has been carried out results are reported in the following for the three different load cases fig 10 shows a visual comparison about the axial forces and the lateral displacements of the rig fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 show the differences in terms of axial forces of standing and running rigging between adina s and ansys results for the different load cases again results were normalized with respect to the value of the v1 shrouds computed in lca by dnvgl ansys model table 4 shows the differences in percentage terms between the current results and those obtained by dnvgl ansys model since rather large differences were observed in lcb see fig 12 a new computation was carried out introducing the runner in the model it can be seen that the agreement among results considerably improved in lca dnvgl ansys vs adina differences for vertical and diagonal d2 d5 and d6 shrouds are lower than 6 about d1s the differences around 20 are mainly due to the absence of the runners in the adina model as a consequence of the conservative choice at the modelling stage as regards staysail and back stays the large percentage differences are less significant since the computed tensions are rather low in lcb a decrease of the tensional state of the vertical shrouds can be generally observed however rather large differences can be observed especially on diagonal and highest vertical shrouds after introducing the runner results significantly improved the highest differences arise for the headstay and back stay 26 and 29 respectively eventually lcc shows the best agreement since all vertical shrouds differ by less than 3 5 and diagonal ones and stays by less than 9 the only exception is represented by the inner stay whose axial forces differ by 41 9 even if its contribution to the global tensional state is limited it is worth noting that in such case the runner was not considered both in the current analysis as well as in mast designer s one as regards the compression at the mast foot the variation in lca and lcc is approximately 1 whilst for lcb it is about the 10 and 13 in the cases with and without runner respectively the computed maxima sag values of the loaded stays were comparable with the ones obtained by the designer according to dnvgl rules being the difference about 2 3 for the various load cases while a general agreement is noted some particular components are differently assessed by the two fem models which indeed have been both built following the very same rules and criteria suitable explanations shall be provided later afterwards assessments on the buckling limit state have been performed according to dnvgl requirements linearized eigenvalue analysis it is worth remembering that dnvgl requires a safety factor of 2 6 and 3 1 respectively for the first lateral and first longitudinal buckling modes three different calculations have been run for lca lcb and lcc it can be noted that limit values are satisfied in all cases fig 14 reports the results of the eigenvalue linearized buckling analysis dotted lines represent the minimum admitted values by the dnvgl s rules in fig 15 corresponding buckling mode shapes are reported it is worth noting that the most critical case is related to lca where the largest heeling angle was assumed being equal to 25 the first encountered modes are the transversal ones where 6 half waves can be counted the first longitudinal modes show a single wave instead 3 2 aluminium mast after validating the carbon model built up in adina software environment the model simulating the aluminium mast has been set up a first evaluation has been carried out on a mast geometrically identical to the original one where the only difference lies in the adoption of the material characteristics of the aluminium instead of that of carbon fibre laminate incidentally it is noted that the numerical model does not explicitly account for the cross section shape of the structural components while only geometric sectional properties are needed as input data i e area and its centre shear areas bending and torsional inertias etc material characteristics are reported in table 1 the resultant total weight of the mast tube accounted for 14945 kg about 4000 kg more than the carbon fibre mast a preliminary buckling analysis has been performed lca was assumed since it is the reference load configuration required by the dnvgl s rules for such analysis safety factors for longitudinal and lateral first buckling modes showed values of 2 06 and 2 53 respectively both not satisfying the required limit fig 16 shows the mode shapes it can be noted that largest eigen vectors arise at panel 3 and 4 for the longitudinal buckling and 1 and 2 for the lateral one to meet the dnvgl s rules requirements a structural optimization was needed a manual iterative trial and error procedure consisted in the variation of the cross sectional properties of the mast tube thus varying areas and inertias values aimed at reducing the total weight and satisfying the buckling safety factors limits prescribed in the rules to simplify the procedure still providing basic hints for mast cross section design an elliptical cross sectional shape has been assumed considered representative of the real one as a first approximation ellipse s axes have been kept constant and equal to the maxima length and breadth of the real cross section 1050 450 mm fig 4 in lowest mast panels mast tapering was accounted for in higher panels as well therefore the only parameter varied in the analysis was the tube shell thickness not necessarily constant along the cross section girth the modification has been carried out by reducing areas and inertias values of the non buckled panels whilst they have been increased in the ones affected by severe eigen vector values table 5 reports a comparison in terms of areas and longitudinal ixx and transversal iyy inertias between the carbon mast and the optimized aluminium one also in this case values are conveniently reported in non dimensional form taking as a reference panels 0 and 1 having the same largest cross section it can be noted that transversal inertia and cross sectional area have been increased in the second panel of the aluminium mast since it resulted to be the most critical parameter in the buckling analysis the total weight of the mast tube of the optimized aluminium mast accounted for 10882 kg showing an increment of 145 kg with respect to the carbon one or 1 4 in percentage terms to assess the structural response new buckling analyses have been performed whose results are reported in the next section 3 3 comparison between carbon and aluminium masts a first comparison regarded the dock tuning table 6 where axial forces have been compared for the carbon laminate mast and the optimized aluminium one results are also reported in terms of percentage difference values are still reported normalized with respect to the v1 axial force of the carbon rig computed in lca as previously done it can be noted that the tensional state of the rig decreased in the new case even the compression at the mast foot in addition the longitudinal deformed shape of the tube did not show significant differences as confirmed by the reported pre bend value whilst the total tensional state of the rig decreases generating a beneficial effect on the hull structures however it is worth recalling that the current values may be further improved if tuning optimization of the aluminium mast is carried out further comparisons have been carried out in the defined load cases normalized results are reported in table 7 in terms of difference between carbon fibre and aluminium made masts a high reduction of the tensional state in several components can be observed causing quasi slack conditions in some cases e g back stay or d1 fwd in lcb therefore these analyses highlighted the need to optimize the dock tuning for such new rig however such considerations have been postponed to future works fig 17 shows a comparison between the lateral transversal deflection of the carbon and aluminium masts along their height for the different loading conditions in all the analysed cases the aluminium mast showed a softer behaviour however variations are in the order of few centimetres therefore it is reasonable assuming that the aerodynamic performances would not be significantly affected by such variations fig 18 shows the percentage difference between the carbon and aluminium masts computed with respect to the aluminium mast displacement for the different load cases about the loaded stays computed maxima sag values showed almost matching results in the cases of the aluminium and carbon masts values are reported in table 8 computed in percentage terms with respect to stays length eventually buckling analyses have been carried out for the different load cases results are reported in fig 19 where the dotted lines represent the minimum admissible values prescribed by the dnvgl s rules respectively equal to 2 6 and 3 1 for the lateral and longitudinal buckling it can be noted that results provided by the optimized aluminium mast model satisfy the safety limits imposed by dnvgl s rules observing an acceptable reduction of the safety factors and indicating an appropriate optimization process 4 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to design a large aluminium mast having structural characteristics and dimensions similar to the ones of an already existing carbon fibre mast in fact the use of metallic structure is preferable when seeking design simplification simple manufacturing processes and costs saving the result has been achieved by means of fe analyses a first numerical model was built up to simulate the carbon mast behaviour in order to validate the model results have been compared with the ones obtained by the designers according to dnvgl rules in their verification stage of the structural safety of the rig despite the use of different software and the small discrepancies in the adopted dock tuning procedure due to software own features results are in good agreement in the majority of cases afterwards a new rig having the same geometrical and material characteristics was created only changing the material properties of the mast adopting an aluminium material defined by an isotropic elastic model instead of an elastic orthotropic model suitable for carbon fibre however the new structure was unable to satisfy structural safety requirements with respect to column buckling therefore an optimization process was necessary as a result a negligible difference of the total weight accounting for the 1 4 145 kg absolute value has been obtained maintaining similar stiffness which guarantee similar performances of the sail plan buckling capacity is reduced but still satisfies the prescriptions imposed by classification society dnv gl as linearized buckling analyses confirmed the capability of the structure to satisfy required standards it is worth noting that a dock tuning optimization test campaign should be carried out by varying pretension values of standing rigging but because of the complexity of the work such studies have been postponed to the future money savings in adopting the metallic mast in lieu of the carbon fibre one has been estimated in the order of m yet manufacturing a safe and well performing sail system as regards further future developments three dimensional models may be used to assess more into the detail the behaviour of the structure taking into account local effects e g local buckling also developing non linear post buckling collapse simulations and even considering dynamic response in time domain as reported in gaiotti et al 2014 a further element of interest could be the investigation of local manufacturing imperfections on the structural response of the mast as shown by lorenzetti et al 2017 which are in most cases not negligible in the structural assessments eventually the importance of internal reinforcements and filler in the structural modelling could be investigated also through experimental tests to verify their influence on the structural stiffness in terms of increment of material own weight and inertias as reported in ghelardi et al 2019 
22462,weight saving is crucial in naval architecture to reduce costs and improve performances in sailing ships design rig s scantling is important also for ship stability as rig s weight generates heeling actions on the vessel due to heeled navigation therefore rig s weight saving remarkably reduces ship s heeling allowing to increase the wind exposed area consequently improving the sailing performances however because of the complexity of the structure and uncertainties in loading conditions the structural scantling of a rig implies the adoption of high safety factors furthermore the increasing trend to use composite materials represents an additional source of complexity due to their anisotropic non homogeneous nature and uncertainties on material properties and generally implies even larger safety factors besides implying high construction costs the present work shows a comparison between an existing 76 m carbon mast and an aluminium alloy one suitable fem models of both rigs were built up and used to assess the structural system strength according to applicable class rules the cross section stiffness of the aluminium mast was optimized in order to make masts performances comparable the optimized aluminium mast of comparable weight of the carbon one results to be more cost effective for such range of sailing vessels keywords sail system mast rigging structural lightning aluminium alloy composites 1 introduction the study of a sail system is a typical fluid structure interaction fsi problem fukasawa and katori 1993 being the acting loads dependent on the structural deformations furthermore since two fluids water and air are involved inertial loads arising by ship motions can further affect aerodynamic and structural performances marchaj 2000 nowadays recent technological innovations have introduced large improvements in sail yachts an increasing trend towards embedded design approaches involving riggers and sailmakers historically distinct professional figures in collaboration also with skilled aerodynamicists and material scientists can be observed vazquez 2007 furthermore while many aerodynamic studies are carried out on masts and sails to optimize their shapes e g chapin et al 2005 ferreira et al 2017 rather small efforts are devoted to the study of the structural behaviour and to the ability of mast and rigging to deform in a controllable manner in particular such analyses are even more complicated when adopting composite materials le maitre et al 1996 which revolutionized the nautical world in past decades the opportunities offered by such materials in terms of mechanical characteristics and design flexibility to naval architects generated an intensive and continuously increasing application in this field giorgetti 2000 especially anisotropy allowed suitable orientation of stiffness and strength properties of laminates on the other hand the anisotropic nature of composite materials the non homogeneous elastic properties through the thickness of the stacking sequence the scattered and largely varying mechanical properties both in terms of stiffness and strength and new failure modes originating from the cohesive behaviour of multi layered composites may complicate the design phase in addition manufacturing defects still leave large uncertainties in the use of such materials leading to mechanical performances i e stiffness strength fatigue etc strongly dependant on the manufacturing process forcing classification societies to impose high safety factors in their rules and standards for such reasons the risk to over design structures is high thus wasting the potential benefits of composite materials traditionally global buckling is considered the governing limit state because of the column like behaviour of such slender structures rizzo and boote 2010 material failure and ultimate capacity collapse are limit states to be considered as well but still accounting for weight optimization indeed rig weight is of paramount importance because of its effects on ship stability and seakeeping performances and considering the large height of the sail systemrelatively large masts can also experience fatigue issues on fittings items like toggles turnbuckles tip cups at spreader ends and eyes terminals finite element models are powerful numerical tools that can be successfully used for the design of composite slender structures although modelling is challenging because of the complexity of the constitutive laws of such materials due to their layered lay out anisotropic nature and complex failure modes godani et al 2014 hence traditional metallic structures could be reconsidered in cases of high uncertainties and safety conditions as in large sailing vessels in fact the isotropy of metallic homogenous and ductile materials simplifies the structural design possibly leading to better optimization of the final product in terms of costs weight structural behaviour and more in general performances furthermore because of the lower stiffness of aluminium alloys with respect to carbon fibre laminates similar mast s pre bend can be reached with lower pre tensioning forces thus lowering the loads and their effect on the whole structure including the hull the present work arises from the question of replacing carbon fibre masts with aluminium ones for large sailing vessels in order to answer to this question an existing rig using a carbon mast 76 m tall and having five orders of spreaders installed on the test case sail yacht has been taken into account the work is aimed at designing an aluminium mast having comparable weight and structural characteristics equivalent to the carbon fibre one in order to reduce design and construction costs and to increase the shipyard competitiveness namely the aluminium mast proposed by the current work only costs about 35 of the price of the equivalent carbon fiber mast in the following the design procedure is presented including also results relevant to safety requirements imposed by scantling rules of classification societies as aforementioned the literature regarding the study of the rig in terms of structural behaviour is more limited with respect to the one regarding aerodynamic aspects however a few works can be found in open literature a recent short review about mast and rigging design is reported in ghelardi 2017 and moves from the well known empirical work by skene 1904 which represent a milestone in the field passing to the nordic boat standard method reported in larsson and eliasson 1997 in which formulae for small rig scantling are reported leading to the works of grabe 2004 2006 2013 and sponberg 1983 through the interesting numerical and experimental approaches proposed by janssen 2004 carrera et al 2009 and pallu de la barrière et al 2008 another interesting study has been published by van der werff and keuning 1988 where the variations of rigging forces are studied depending on the heeling angle with an analytical approach this study also takes into account the hull girder flexibility in 2010 an article about best practices for the numerical modelling of rigs using one and two dimensional elements was presented in rizzo and boote 2010 in the last years gaiotti and rizzo 2014 published a work regarding the dynamic behaviour of a typical aluminium mast panel in particular the authors assessed the structural response under sinusoidal impulsive loads of different durations in menotti et al 2013 a study based on the use of an unsteady fluid structure interaction fsi tool was used to investigate the cause of the dismasting of the vor 70 groupama 4 racing yacht tuning values were reported but no information about the followed procedure were presented results showed like the loss of different structural elements of the rigging system caused the mast failure more recently in lepidi et al 2015 a preliminary work on the investigation of the mast pumping phenomenon during sailing was presented the work regarded the setup of an analytical model constituted by a shear undeformable euler bernoulli beam and an inextensible cable to simulate the mast and the forestay respectively results were validated with a fem code finding good agreement eventually another work was presented in lorenzetti et al 2017 focused on the importance of the numerical simulation of geometrical manufacturing defects arising during the mast construction and affecting the mast structural response as regards scantling rules proposed by classification societies dnvgl s standards dnvgl 2016 seems to be the most detailed for the design of such structures several loading conditions can be assessed depending on the ship typology considering forces induced by aerodynamic actions standing and running rigging however even if less detailed rather comprehensive guidelines for rig scantling can be found also in lr 2016 dnvgl s rules have been adopted in the present study to assess aerodynamic loads and limit states of the structure 2 numerical models the study has been carried out via the fe software adina adina 2016 both geometrical large displacement and material nonlinearities of truss elements used to simulate the cables were considered in the analyses carried out eventually linearized buckling simulations have been used to assess such limit state according to dnvgl s requirements and usual shipyards design practice at first a model of the existing carbon fibre mast has been created followed by the equivalent aluminium mast the only difference between the two analysed rigs is represented by the material s characteristics of the mast in fact shrouds and stays have not been changed in terms of cross sections and material since the focus of this work was on the mast only which represents the main fraction of the total weight of the rig fig 1 shows the percentage weight of the different components of the existing carbon mast rig the mast represents 56 of the total weight whilst the sum of the fore aft rigging i e the stays and the transversal rigging i e the shrouds accounts for 36 about the geometry the mast is 76 045 m tall having a rake of 2 1 spreaders have a sweep back angle of 22 fig 2 shows the main geometrical features the mast has been subdivided in eight panels between mast step gooseneck and each spreaders pair with different cross sectional areas and inertias it should be noted that panel 0 represents the part of the mast between the keel and the main deck furthermore v and d letters indicate the vertical and diagonal shrouds in order to take into account the effects induced by the real cross section of the mast panels spreaders and diagonal shrouds end points are placed in their actual position i e on tube shell such points are connected via rigid link to the beam axis line representing the mast the points on the mast represent the master points which drives the rigid displacements of the slave points belonging to shrouds and spreaders according to the deformation of the structure such modelling strategy allows appropriately considering the effects of bending and torsional moments induced by the spreaders on the mast rigid links are highlighted in fig 3 fig 4 shows a schematic representation of the cross section without internal stiffening an elastic isotropic material model was adopted for the mast and the spreaders materials characteristics are reported in table 1 cables were modelled by an isotropic nonlinear material model where compressive stiffnesses were set equal to zero for negative strains to model the behaviour of such structures in compression carbon material was employed for shrouds and back stay whilst pbo phenylene benzobisoxazole was used for other stays densities were also set up since the own static weight of the structure was considered in the computations a density fictitious value based on the shipyards experience and considering also fittings end tips local reinforcements pulleys filler material and paint as appropriate has been used however in the case of the aluminium mast the exact value could not be reported here for confidentiality reasons nevertheless for readers information the adopted figure is not so different by the density of an aluminium alloy generally used for mast building i e al 6082 which is reported in table 1 as a general indication mast and spreaders were modelled with 6 dofs beam elements as regard shrouds and stays truss elements were employed the model accounts for a total number of 362 elements and 372 nodes shrouds and stays have been modelled with one single truss element apart from the fore stays where the induced aerodynamic load was supposed to be applied in fact different loading conditions generated by different sails have been considered to set different load cases therefore the fore stays where the aerodynamic load was applied were in turn modelled with 50 truss elements it is worth noting that sails were not modelled since the loads were applied as concentrated forces according to the widely applied quasi static equilibrium between inclining and righting moment of the yacht procedure conceptually proposed by skene 1904 namely the dnvgl s dnvgl 2016 recommendations were followed to evaluate external acting loads the mast was stepped on the keel while the main deck represents a further constraint such conditions have been simulated by fixing all the dofs at the mast step except for the rotations around the transversal y axis whilst to simulate the deck effect no horizontal translations were allowed at deck level as well as rotations about the vertical axis mast torsion to perform a more accurate computation the second constraint set at deck level births only at the end of the pre tensioning stage when the mast assumes a fixed and defined vertical position chain plates of shrouds have been simulated by fixing displacements of truss elements ends free rotations fig 5 shows the numerical model built in adina with boundary conditions three different loading categories can be identified pre tensioning aerodynamic and gravity loads assuming a quasi static approach at first pretension has been imposed on the whole rig different strategies could be possible to simulate the real dock tuning procedure as regards real experimental procedure generally only vertical shrouds are tensioned first based on the shipyard experience then the mast step is pushed by a jack measuring the applied force later force measurements are taken at stays and mast step vertical displacement is measured the process is repeated until the mast shape and the force applied by the jack reach a target value thereafter the mast is lowered and stepped up repeatedly and diagonal shrouds tensioned one pair by one pair verifying not only stays and stepping forces but also global mast shape i e its pre bending deflection checking possible inverse deflection as regards the numerical procedure adopted in the present work shrouds and stays have been tensioned by imposing initial strains causing shortening thus simulating the action of hydraulic cylinders at cable ends and or turnbuckles partially following the actual procedure adopted by the shipyard at the initial computation step the lowest vertical shrouds v1 and the inner forestay were tensioned afterwards several computation steps were run imposing a shortening starting from the highest diagonal shrouds d5 to the lowest ones d1 eventually headstay and back stay have been tuned fig 6 illustrates the initial and final pre tensioning steps where initial strains are applied in several steps respectively in a and b plots the magenta elements are the tensioned ones i e where initial strains were imposed whilst the blue ones are slack i e where no initial strains were applied mast and spreaders are in compression axial forces induced by dock tuning are reported in table 3 in percentage terms computed with respect to the values detected for v1 shrouds which are the most stressed cable elements afterwards aerodynamic loads were considered dnvgl specify four different ship categories for the load estimation depending on the ship characteristics dnvgl 2016 such categories are reported in table 2 the analysed ship falls into the first category three different sail plan configurations and loading conditions have been considered according to the ship specifications a full main sail and jib the jib is armed on the inner forestay which has been modelled with 50 truss elements in order to evaluate its catenary shape based on dnvgl 2016 aerodynamic loads have been computed by assuming a heeling angle of 25 and applying concentrated forces in the following points according to rules specifications lateral forces nodes shared by spreaders and mast mainsail head and gooseneck due to the mainsail action inner forestay simulating the jib action longitudinal forces mainsail head and gooseneck due to the longitudinal component of the force developed by the mainsail leech vertical loads induced by halyards and applied at mainsail and jib head b two reef main sail and staysail the staysail is armed on the staysail stay which has been modelled with 50 truss elements in order to evaluate its catenary shape in this case aerodynamic loads have been computed under the hypothesis of a heeling angle of 20 forces have been applied similarly to the previous case c full main sail and reacher the reacher is armed on the headstay which has been modelled with 50 truss elements in order to evaluate its catenary shape in this case aerodynamic loads have been computed under the hypothesis of a heeling angle of 20 forces have been applied similarly to the first case for the sake of shortness the load cases will be indicated in the following as lca load case a lcb and lcc aerodynamic standing and running rigging have been considered according to dnvgl s recommendations in all computations the interested reader is referred to dnvgl 2016 for further details on the adopted formulae it is worth to outline that before applying the aerodynamic loads the tuning procedure was preliminary carried out in all the three load cases gravity force has been also considered in the computation because of the large size of the mast it is worth mentioning that to perform a more conservative computation runners initially were not introduced in the modelling this aspect mainly affects the longitudinal stability of the mast which is considered critical in harsh dynamic conditions moreover runners are not always used by the crew during navigation but only when pitching may induce large inertial loads e g while motoring in heading rough sea similar numerical models were validated by the authors in a previously published work comparing adina s results with experimental ones carried out from a similar rig ghelardi et al 2019 initial assessments have been carried out on the carbon mast model in order to validate the numerical results comparing outcomes with the ones obtained according to dnvgl rules by the designer in their preliminary calculations on the structural integrity of the rig and those later provided by the shipyard both carried out using the commercial software ansys afterwards calculations on the aluminium mast have been settled showing the need for a structural optimization in terms of weight reduction and re distribution along mast s height eventually a comparison between the carbon and aluminium masts was carried out comparing static and buckling analyses showing also the capability of the optimized aluminium mast to satisfy the acceptance criteria of the dnvgl rules 3 analysis of results 3 1 carbon mast since dnvgl s calculations were developed before the construction of the rig a difference in terms of total weight exists between the model used in the design stage and the one now developed in fact the nominal total design weight was of 16575 kg whilst the real total weight of the structure adopted in the subsequent analyses was about 18274 kg in particular mast tube weight accounted for 8504 kg and 10731 kg in the two cases the difference is due to the presence of filler paint pulleys fittings electrical cables and halyards not considered in the initial design fe model however because of the adopted quasi static approach this difference was supposed to be not substantial in fact it should be noted that for such kind of structures gravity loads are less relevant with respect to external static loads however the own weight of the structure has been considered in the calculations fig 7 reports a picture during the weighting procedure of the carbon mast a first evaluation regarded the dock tuning maximum longitudinal pre bending displacements accounted for 176 mm approximately and occurred roughly at mid span of panel 3 of the mast as regards shrouds highest axial forces have been found in correspondence of the v1s reducing along mast height until the v5s fig 8 reports axial forces and longitudinal deformation of the structure the latter is magnified by a factor 50 for clarity it is worth to note once again that runners were not modelled in the current and in the following simulations for conservative reasons in fact their action would contribute to reduce the mast longitudinal bending helping to stabilize the structure as mentioned runners are not always used during navigation and this can be regarded as a conservative assumption lepidi et al 2015 all the axial force values reported in fig 8 are normalized with respect to the value of the v1 shrouds working load calculated in load case a lca by dnvgl ansys model such choice of normalization value has no particular meaning other than hiding absolute values of tensioning forces therefore for instance v1 dock tuning tension account for the 69 5 of the value computed by dnvgl ansys model in lca for v1 tension such choice has been extended to all the following cases providing an overview of the sail system structural behaviour without disclosing confidential data however for a better comprehension of the involved figures the reference value of tension has an order of magnitude of about 1000 1200 kn table 3 shows a comparison between the axial forces of shrouds and stays computed by dnvgl ansys model and by the authors of this study after the dock tuning process estimates of loads on lower vertical shrouds v1s v2s and v3s present a good agreement being differences lower than 10 for v4s v5s d6s and d1 aft differences grow up until 15 stays forces show variations between the 10 and 30 whilst d1fwd forward shows an 87 difference such deviation is due to a slight variation of the geometry adopted in the adina model for the sake of simplicity however it should be noted from table 3 that d1fwd s contribute to rig tuning forces is only approximately 1 of the maximum reference value taken to normalize all results therefore the induced absolute error in the simulation has been considered negligible as regards the compression at the mast foot the value showed very good matching the pre bend value has been computed from the algebraic sum of maximum and minimum longitudinal displacements divided by the height of the mainsails boltrope 65200 mm the difference between the two calculations is 33 see fig 9 showing the mast s deformed shape such a deviation between the two models can be noted in the longitudinal plane above 50 m in height where dnvgl ansys s model presents a larger deformation such difference can be explained by the higher stress state of v4s v5s and d6s which generate a higher compression on the corresponding spreaders thus increasing the longitudinal deformation of the mast highest part afterwards a comparison among the different analysed load cases has been carried out results are reported in the following for the three different load cases fig 10 shows a visual comparison about the axial forces and the lateral displacements of the rig fig 11 fig 12 and fig 13 show the differences in terms of axial forces of standing and running rigging between adina s and ansys results for the different load cases again results were normalized with respect to the value of the v1 shrouds computed in lca by dnvgl ansys model table 4 shows the differences in percentage terms between the current results and those obtained by dnvgl ansys model since rather large differences were observed in lcb see fig 12 a new computation was carried out introducing the runner in the model it can be seen that the agreement among results considerably improved in lca dnvgl ansys vs adina differences for vertical and diagonal d2 d5 and d6 shrouds are lower than 6 about d1s the differences around 20 are mainly due to the absence of the runners in the adina model as a consequence of the conservative choice at the modelling stage as regards staysail and back stays the large percentage differences are less significant since the computed tensions are rather low in lcb a decrease of the tensional state of the vertical shrouds can be generally observed however rather large differences can be observed especially on diagonal and highest vertical shrouds after introducing the runner results significantly improved the highest differences arise for the headstay and back stay 26 and 29 respectively eventually lcc shows the best agreement since all vertical shrouds differ by less than 3 5 and diagonal ones and stays by less than 9 the only exception is represented by the inner stay whose axial forces differ by 41 9 even if its contribution to the global tensional state is limited it is worth noting that in such case the runner was not considered both in the current analysis as well as in mast designer s one as regards the compression at the mast foot the variation in lca and lcc is approximately 1 whilst for lcb it is about the 10 and 13 in the cases with and without runner respectively the computed maxima sag values of the loaded stays were comparable with the ones obtained by the designer according to dnvgl rules being the difference about 2 3 for the various load cases while a general agreement is noted some particular components are differently assessed by the two fem models which indeed have been both built following the very same rules and criteria suitable explanations shall be provided later afterwards assessments on the buckling limit state have been performed according to dnvgl requirements linearized eigenvalue analysis it is worth remembering that dnvgl requires a safety factor of 2 6 and 3 1 respectively for the first lateral and first longitudinal buckling modes three different calculations have been run for lca lcb and lcc it can be noted that limit values are satisfied in all cases fig 14 reports the results of the eigenvalue linearized buckling analysis dotted lines represent the minimum admitted values by the dnvgl s rules in fig 15 corresponding buckling mode shapes are reported it is worth noting that the most critical case is related to lca where the largest heeling angle was assumed being equal to 25 the first encountered modes are the transversal ones where 6 half waves can be counted the first longitudinal modes show a single wave instead 3 2 aluminium mast after validating the carbon model built up in adina software environment the model simulating the aluminium mast has been set up a first evaluation has been carried out on a mast geometrically identical to the original one where the only difference lies in the adoption of the material characteristics of the aluminium instead of that of carbon fibre laminate incidentally it is noted that the numerical model does not explicitly account for the cross section shape of the structural components while only geometric sectional properties are needed as input data i e area and its centre shear areas bending and torsional inertias etc material characteristics are reported in table 1 the resultant total weight of the mast tube accounted for 14945 kg about 4000 kg more than the carbon fibre mast a preliminary buckling analysis has been performed lca was assumed since it is the reference load configuration required by the dnvgl s rules for such analysis safety factors for longitudinal and lateral first buckling modes showed values of 2 06 and 2 53 respectively both not satisfying the required limit fig 16 shows the mode shapes it can be noted that largest eigen vectors arise at panel 3 and 4 for the longitudinal buckling and 1 and 2 for the lateral one to meet the dnvgl s rules requirements a structural optimization was needed a manual iterative trial and error procedure consisted in the variation of the cross sectional properties of the mast tube thus varying areas and inertias values aimed at reducing the total weight and satisfying the buckling safety factors limits prescribed in the rules to simplify the procedure still providing basic hints for mast cross section design an elliptical cross sectional shape has been assumed considered representative of the real one as a first approximation ellipse s axes have been kept constant and equal to the maxima length and breadth of the real cross section 1050 450 mm fig 4 in lowest mast panels mast tapering was accounted for in higher panels as well therefore the only parameter varied in the analysis was the tube shell thickness not necessarily constant along the cross section girth the modification has been carried out by reducing areas and inertias values of the non buckled panels whilst they have been increased in the ones affected by severe eigen vector values table 5 reports a comparison in terms of areas and longitudinal ixx and transversal iyy inertias between the carbon mast and the optimized aluminium one also in this case values are conveniently reported in non dimensional form taking as a reference panels 0 and 1 having the same largest cross section it can be noted that transversal inertia and cross sectional area have been increased in the second panel of the aluminium mast since it resulted to be the most critical parameter in the buckling analysis the total weight of the mast tube of the optimized aluminium mast accounted for 10882 kg showing an increment of 145 kg with respect to the carbon one or 1 4 in percentage terms to assess the structural response new buckling analyses have been performed whose results are reported in the next section 3 3 comparison between carbon and aluminium masts a first comparison regarded the dock tuning table 6 where axial forces have been compared for the carbon laminate mast and the optimized aluminium one results are also reported in terms of percentage difference values are still reported normalized with respect to the v1 axial force of the carbon rig computed in lca as previously done it can be noted that the tensional state of the rig decreased in the new case even the compression at the mast foot in addition the longitudinal deformed shape of the tube did not show significant differences as confirmed by the reported pre bend value whilst the total tensional state of the rig decreases generating a beneficial effect on the hull structures however it is worth recalling that the current values may be further improved if tuning optimization of the aluminium mast is carried out further comparisons have been carried out in the defined load cases normalized results are reported in table 7 in terms of difference between carbon fibre and aluminium made masts a high reduction of the tensional state in several components can be observed causing quasi slack conditions in some cases e g back stay or d1 fwd in lcb therefore these analyses highlighted the need to optimize the dock tuning for such new rig however such considerations have been postponed to future works fig 17 shows a comparison between the lateral transversal deflection of the carbon and aluminium masts along their height for the different loading conditions in all the analysed cases the aluminium mast showed a softer behaviour however variations are in the order of few centimetres therefore it is reasonable assuming that the aerodynamic performances would not be significantly affected by such variations fig 18 shows the percentage difference between the carbon and aluminium masts computed with respect to the aluminium mast displacement for the different load cases about the loaded stays computed maxima sag values showed almost matching results in the cases of the aluminium and carbon masts values are reported in table 8 computed in percentage terms with respect to stays length eventually buckling analyses have been carried out for the different load cases results are reported in fig 19 where the dotted lines represent the minimum admissible values prescribed by the dnvgl s rules respectively equal to 2 6 and 3 1 for the lateral and longitudinal buckling it can be noted that results provided by the optimized aluminium mast model satisfy the safety limits imposed by dnvgl s rules observing an acceptable reduction of the safety factors and indicating an appropriate optimization process 4 conclusions the main purpose of this study was to design a large aluminium mast having structural characteristics and dimensions similar to the ones of an already existing carbon fibre mast in fact the use of metallic structure is preferable when seeking design simplification simple manufacturing processes and costs saving the result has been achieved by means of fe analyses a first numerical model was built up to simulate the carbon mast behaviour in order to validate the model results have been compared with the ones obtained by the designers according to dnvgl rules in their verification stage of the structural safety of the rig despite the use of different software and the small discrepancies in the adopted dock tuning procedure due to software own features results are in good agreement in the majority of cases afterwards a new rig having the same geometrical and material characteristics was created only changing the material properties of the mast adopting an aluminium material defined by an isotropic elastic model instead of an elastic orthotropic model suitable for carbon fibre however the new structure was unable to satisfy structural safety requirements with respect to column buckling therefore an optimization process was necessary as a result a negligible difference of the total weight accounting for the 1 4 145 kg absolute value has been obtained maintaining similar stiffness which guarantee similar performances of the sail plan buckling capacity is reduced but still satisfies the prescriptions imposed by classification society dnv gl as linearized buckling analyses confirmed the capability of the structure to satisfy required standards it is worth noting that a dock tuning optimization test campaign should be carried out by varying pretension values of standing rigging but because of the complexity of the work such studies have been postponed to the future money savings in adopting the metallic mast in lieu of the carbon fibre one has been estimated in the order of m yet manufacturing a safe and well performing sail system as regards further future developments three dimensional models may be used to assess more into the detail the behaviour of the structure taking into account local effects e g local buckling also developing non linear post buckling collapse simulations and even considering dynamic response in time domain as reported in gaiotti et al 2014 a further element of interest could be the investigation of local manufacturing imperfections on the structural response of the mast as shown by lorenzetti et al 2017 which are in most cases not negligible in the structural assessments eventually the importance of internal reinforcements and filler in the structural modelling could be investigated also through experimental tests to verify their influence on the structural stiffness in terms of increment of material own weight and inertias as reported in ghelardi et al 2019 
22463,the current design standard lacks the detailed approach to estimate managed ice actions which in turn forces the industry to rely on ice basin model tests and calibrated numerical simulations to address the need for a reliable assessment of managed ice actions on large scale floaters this paper proposes an efficient two dimensional discrete element simulation with polygonal elements which integrates smoothly with a mooring system modeling and a hydrodynamic force representation the study aims at establishing a range of numerical parameters suitable for managed ice as well as the boundaries within which the two dimensional assumption remains acceptable the study includes validations against the empirical data on isolated ice impacts and the towing model test conducted in the

oil and gas of which more than 80 is expected to be offshore hamilton 2011 projected that approximately half of the untouched oil reserve exists in water depths greater than 100 m where bottom founded structures are no longer cost effective for the arctic environments paulin et al 2008 floating platforms with reliable station keeping systems become the only realistic option for drilling and other key offshore operations in the arctic s deep water as unmanaged sea ice imposes load beyond the capacity of conventional mooring systems which leads to failures at a low ambient temperature zhang and qian 2017 feng and qian 2018 floating platforms are usually deployed with the support from ice management hamilton et al 2011 fig 1 illustrates an ice management technique where two icebreakers move in a circular pattern to reduce the size of incoming ice floes to a safe level although the ice loads are reduced significantly the floating platform and its mooring system still have to endure the managed ice actions while maintaining an acceptable offset for drilling or other critical operations the assessment of loads imposed by managed ice remains a challenging issue due to its complex and uncertain nature for floating platforms in managed ice the current design standard iso19906 2010 recommends an empirical approach based on the field data collected on the kulluk wright 2000 the approach relies on data correction proposed by keinonen et al 1996 to reflect the influence of different vessel dimensions hull forms hull surface conditions ice strengths and ambient temperatures in the more rigorous attempt to assess the managed ice load numerous ice basin model tests have investigated a wide range of cases including managed ice load on ships zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2016

towing operations eik and marchenko 2010 comfort et al 1999 presented a discussion on the trend observed in the previous model test data and concluded on the relative importance of the ice concentration ice thickness ice velocity and the correlation between the model tests due to the resource intensive nature of ice basin tests various researches have invested in well calibrated numerical models to extend the investigation beyond the scope of the basin tests from the large scale perspective ice floes in nature bear resemblance to a system of discrete particles this inspired many scholars to investigate the behavior of ice floes using the discrete element method dem where the individual ice floe is represented using a single unbreakable particle tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 the earlier attempts utilized 2d disk elements to simulate the ice floe fields in the horizontal plane babic 1990 hopkins and hibler 1991 løset 1994a 1994b hansen and løset 1999a 1999b one notable study by løset 1994a 1994b demonstrated that even with simplified floe geometry and restriction to the horizontal plane the load predicted by dem aligned well with the model test results the 2d dem developments later incorporated polygonal elements to mimic the planar geometry of real ice floes zhan et al 2010 rabatel et al 2015 yulmetov et al 2016 yulmetov and løset 2017 despite the promising results 2d simulation inherently restricts the possibilities for out of plane motions such as rafting and overturning of ice floes which are inevitable in the case of high ice concentration with significant lateral confinement dem studies naturally progressed to 3d formulation utilizing disk elements hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 hopkins and tuthill 2002 ji et al 2013 sun and shen 2012 polyhedral elements lau et al 2011 lau 2006 lau and simoes ré 2006 zhan and molyneux 2012 dilated polyhedral elements hopkins 2004 liu and ji 2018 and spherical elements pradana and qian 2019 majority of the aforementioned 3d simulations demonstrated a close match to their benchmarking ice basin tests despite the advancements in 3d dem a number of recent studies still advocate the use of 2d dem for managed ice problems which evidently yielded good or at least qualitative agreement with the experimental results when the ice concentration and the lateral confinement is not significant yulmetov et al 2016 yulmetov and løset 2017 karulin et al 2012 karulin and karulina 2011 in support of the previous statement the 3d simulations in hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 revealed that a confined field of floating ice floes began showing 3d motions rafting and overturning only when the surface concentration reaches 79 this suggests that there exists a limiting condition possibly in terms of initial ice concentration or relative floe size below which 2d simulations remain reasonably accurate past 2d investigations however have not clearly established these limiting conditions addressing the limit is therefore the key to maximize the potential of 2d solutions as compliments to the design standard and the ice basin tests this study aims to address the assessment of loads generated by managed ice specifically on moored floating platforms in line with this aim this study proposes a 2d discrete element framework where the ice floes are represented using random convex polygons created using the voronoi tessellation procedure via comparison against ice basin tests this study attempts to establish a validity range where the 2d assumption remains reasonably accurate despite the inherent limitations the current 2d framework consumes considerably less computational resources and execution time as compared to a 3d simulation thus once the validity range is identified the 2d framework holds significant potential as a preliminary analysis tool for engineering applications ghoshal et al 2018 the simplicity of the 2d formulation also allows for modeling various dynamic systems with relative ease hence the framework developed herein is easily extendable to other relevant topics such as vessels with dynamic positioning under managed ice kjerstad et al 2015 the numerical framework in this paper is an extension of that in matuttis and chen 2014 which is originally designed to simulate granular materials in section 2 this paper describes the underlying formulation in the contact forces the voronoi based ice floe creation the moored floating platform modeling and the simplified hydrodynamic forces next section 3 validates the current approach against the field data on isolated ice floe impacts as well as the iceberg towing model test presented in eik and marchenko 2010 as a demonstration of the proposed approach section 5 presents a case study on a hypothetical floating platform based on the kulluk wright 2000 where the effect of the ice and the mooring system characteristics is examined finally section 6 summarizes the conclusions supported by the findings of this study 2 discrete element formulation 2 1 overview the current framework computes the interaction between each discrete element according to the soft particle concept cundall and strack 1979 which establishes the contact force as a function of the overlap between non deformable elements particles the particles may also experience other external actions such as hydrodynamic or wind forces by applying time integration to the equation of motion the framework calculates the position and the velocity of each particle at the next time step due to the 2d assumption the framework computes strictly the water plane motion two translational and one rotational degrees of freedom and assumes that all out of plane actions are in equilibrium in the current approach the typical simulation comprises the simulation walls the ice floes the floating platform and the representation of the mooring system the first three components are discrete elements with specific geometry and assignments the simulation walls are unmovable rectangular particles placed at the extremes of the domain the ice floes are arbitrarily shaped polygonal particles that move in response to the external forces on the other hand the floating platform is a particle that possesses the platform s water plane geometry mass and mass moment of inertia motions of the platform elicit restoring forces from the mooring system which is represented using a set of springs successive time integration over a pre determined duration provides the time series of 1 ice actions on the platform 2 mooring restoring forces and 3 motions of the platform 2 2 contact formulation fig 2 illustrates a contact between two polygonal particles as illustrated the particles in contact experience normal and tangential forces that are generated by the spring dashpot system in the corresponding direction these forces act on the centroid of the overlapping region see fig 2a and due to the eccentricity with respect to the particle centroids they produce in plane moments as well the geometry of the overlap region fig 2c defines the normal and the tangential direction the vector connecting the two intersection points represents the tangential direction while the normal direction follows accordingly see fig 2c details regarding the contact detection and the computation of the overlap geometry are available in matuttis and chen 2014 following the traditional formulation for the soft particle contact the current contact forces include 1a f n f n s f n d 0 normal component 1b f t f t s f t d μ f n tangential component where the subscripts s and d designate the elastic and the damping components respectively the formulation restricts the negative normal force signifying unphysical attractive force which may occur when the damping term is dominant on the other hand the tangential force imitates friction and as such its magnitude is limited by the coefficient of friction μ at the end of every contact computation the framework resolves the forces and moment according to the global coordinate system resulting in f contact x f contact y and m contact at the centroid of each particle 2 2 1 normal forces the normal elastic force depends on the extent of overlap and the assigned material stiffness at any given time step its magnitude follows 2 f n s e h a overlap l where 3 l 4 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 the parameters r 1 r 2 represent the distance between the corresponding particle centroid and the center of the overlap area see fig 2 the constants e and h denote the particle elastic modulus and the out of plane thickness respectively together they characterize the normal contact stiffness meanwhile the area of the overlap region a overlap and the particle length scale l quantify the extent of overlap the normal damping force is modeled after the viscous damper in harmonic oscillators and expressed as 4 f n d 2 ζ n e h m a overlap i 1 a overlap i δ t 1 l where ζ n represents the normal damping ratio and m denotes the effective mass of the two particles in contact the term inside the parentheses is an approximation of the relative velocity based on the change of the overlap area over a single time step δ t during separation i e when the relative velocity is positive the damping force may lead to a negative attractive total force in eq 1a if the damping force exceeds the elastic force which may occur when ζ n or the initial impact velocity is high the limit f n 0 see eq 1a prevents this unphysical behavior 2 2 2 tangential forces the tangential elastic force adheres to the cundall strack friction model cundall and strack 1979 which computes the force incrementally as follows 5 f t s i f t s i 1 η e h v t i δ t μ f n the multiplier η represents the ratio between the tangential and the normal spring stiffness this paper assumes that η 0 38 based on the shear to normal modulus correlation with a poisson ratio of 0 3 the bracketed term approximates the relative tangential motion based on the current relative tangential velocity v t i at any time step the tangential elastic force must not exceed the ceiling set by the coefficient of friction to avoid non decaying tangential oscillations the current contact model includes a tangential damping force similar to the viscous damper in the normal direction 6 f t d 2 ζ t η e h m v t 2 2 3 upper limit for the normal contact force the normal contact force in eq 1a may exceed the strength of the simulated material and produces unrealistically high loads this study proposes a force limit that reflects the compressive strength of the material the limit ensures that the maximum pressure on the contact area i e a c h l contact see fig 2c does not exceed the material s compressive strength based on the ice pressure data from ship ramming tests iso19906 2010 proposed the pressure area curve that follows 7 σ c p a c d p where the coefficients c p and d p equal 3 0 and 0 4 respectively consistent with the focus on ice the current formulation limits the normal contact pressure f n a c to that in eq 7 this study therefore does not simulate the physical crushing failure in the ice floes for confined ice fields a 3d dem approach will be able to predict such failures in the ice floes with enhanced accuracy pradana and qian 2019 2 3 ice field creation with voronoi tessellation realistic assessment of managed ice loads requires the simulation of the ice field s randomness along with its essential characteristics namely the ice concentration and the average floe size the ice concentration represents the fraction of the water plane area that is occupied by ice floes while the ice floe size is often quantified using the mean caliper diameter mcd for any given polygon this study approximates the mcd as twice the average centroid to vertex distance a number of publications have generated artificial ice fields using existing or self developed algorithm yulmetov et al 2016 propose an algorithm that generates scales and places arbitrary polygons in such a way that the target size distribution and the desired ice concentration are achieved other scholars utilize the 2d voronoi tessellation to achieve similar result liu and ji 2018 lau and simoes ré 2006 considering its efficiency this study adopts the voronoi tessellation algorithm to generate the managed ice fields in the 2d context the voronoi tessellation divides a planar domain into n convex polygons see okabe et al 2009 for the detailed algorithm the variable n equals the number of randomly placed voronoi generators also referred to as seed points that are present within the domain the edges of the polygons are equidistant lines between one voronoi generator and its adjacent neighbors such that every polygon encloses precisely one voronoi generator without further modification the voronoi polygons form a 100 concentration nevertheless any desired concentration is achievable by scaling down the polygons while the average floe size in terms of mcd can be regulated by adjusting n according to the domain size in a case where every polygon is scaled uniformly the concentration c and the scaling factor α obey the following relationship α c fig 3 a shows an example ice field with c 90 and a mean floe size of d floe 28 m the drawback of a voronoi tessellation based approach is the lack of a direct control over the floe shape and size distribution nonetheless indirect controls over these distributions are possible through the strategic positioning of voronoi generators sotomayor and tippur 2014 another method to control the shape distribution involves the centroidal voronoi tessellation cvt where an iterative tessellation is performed until the polygon centroids and the voronoi generators converge du et al 1999 this method requires that for the i th iteration the voronoi generators are the centroid of the polygons from the i 1 th iteration except for the 1st iteration where the voronoi generators are randomly placed fig 3a c illustrates the polygon shape evolution as the iteration is performed while fig 3d shows a field of ice floes in nature as shown the cvt algorithm eliminates the elongated polygons fig 3c yet they produce unnaturally rounded and uniform floes on the other hand if the cvt is stopped before convergence the resulting polygons appear to be more natural and thus closer to the real ice floes see fig 3b for this reason the current study adopts the partial cvt where the algorithm is stopped after the second iteration 2 4 modelling the mooring system in the current approach the individual mooring line is a spring that follows a user defined horizontal tension offset curve fig 4 this method enables the modeling of different mooring types taut or catenary of any size and pre tension by simply providing the appropriate tension offset curve furthermore the layout of the mooring system spread or grouped in any orientation is easily modifiable by adjusting the coordinates of the fairlead and the anchor points fig 4b exemplifies a typical tension offset curve required by the current framework as shown the curve should cover both the positive and the negative offset that are expected to occur during the simulation the example curve in fig 4b represents the response of a single mooring line to a horizontal offset which for better accuracy can be generated using a specialized mooring analysis tool throughout the simulation the framework assumes that the mooring offset equals the change in the projected mooring length the mooring system provides restoring forces and moment proportional to the platform s motion the magnitudes of these restoring actions equal the resultant of all mooring line tension and are expressed as 8a f moor x i 1 k t i c o s θ i 8b f moor y i 1 k t i s i n θ i 8c m moor i 1 k t i c o s θ i e i y i 1 k t i s i n θ i e i x where t i represents the tension of line i according to the assigned tension offset curve θ i denotes the angle between the mooring line and the horizontal x axis see fig 4a and the parameters e i x and e i y define the eccentricity between the mooring force and the centroid of the floater in the x and y directions respectively in addition to these forces the motion of the submerged mooring lines introduces a water drag that exerts a damping effect on the system currently the energy dissipation contributed by the mooring system is simulated using viscous dampers which generate the following forces and moment 9a f moor damp x 2 ζ moor k x m flt v flt x 9b f moor damp y 2 ζ moor k y m flt v flt y 9c m moor damp 2 ζ moor k rot j flt ω flt k x k y and k rot represent the translational and the rotational stiffness of the mooring system respectively these stiffness parameters derive from separate static offset analyses performed before the ice structure simulation the constant ζ moor represents the mooring system s damping ratio while m flt and j flt denote the mass and the mass moment of inertia of the floating platform the total mooring action applied to the platform s centroid equals the summation of eqs 8 and 9 2 5 hydrodynamic forces lu et al 2011 identified that the water drag force acting on a relatively flat ice floe equals the sum of the form drag and the skin drag and follows 10 f drag c f 2 1 c 1 c h d 1 2 2 h d c s a ρ w v w v v w v where c f and c s represent the form and the skin drag coefficient respectively the form drag refers to the normal force acting on the vertical face of an ice floe as it moves through the water accordingly it depends on the floe thickness h and the floe diameter d however the wake effects in a field of ice floes attenuate this force in proportion to the ice concentration c as implied by eq 10 the skin drag on the other hand describes the tangential force acting on the bottom face of an ice floe and as such is governed by the planar area of the ice floe a similar to other approximations of the fluid drag eq 10 is a function of the fluid density ρ w as well as the relative velocity between the fluid v w and the ice floe v the current framework computes the drag force in the x and y directions independently and applies them to the centroid of each particle as suggested in lu et al 2011 the value of drag coefficients are c f 1 0 and c s 0 002 the formulation in eq 10 lacks the fluid resistance against in plane rotations which can lead to unrealistic floe movements e g unrestrained rigid body rotation to alleviate this the current study imposes a drag moment similar to that in ji et al 2013 11 m drag c r 2 d 2 4 h d d 2 ρ w ω ω where ω is the particle s angular velocity the rotational drag coefficient c r assumes a value of 1 0 following the form drag coefficient in addition to the drag forces the current framework considers the added mass effect that occurs when an ice floe accelerates or decelerates in water meylan et al 2015 demonstrated experimentally that the added mass on an ice floe constitutes about 10 of the actual mass following this finding the ice floe mass considered in the simulation equals 12 m m 0 1 c m where m 0 is the actual mass of the ice floe while the added mass coefficient c m equals 0 1 in all simulations 2 6 equation of motion and time integration the x and y translational motions of a discrete element adheres to the newton s equation of motion 13 m d v d

any given discrete element clearly the mooring forces are zero when the particular discrete element represents an ice floe parallel to the translational motion the centroidal rotation of a discrete element follows 14 j d ω d t m contact m drag m moor m moor damp where ω represents the particle s angular velocity while j denotes the particle s mass moment of inertia by integrating eqs 13 and 14 with respect to time the dem predicts the elements position and velocity throughout the simulation the time integration in the current framework adopts the gear s predictor corrector technique following the original work by matuttis and chen 2014 to ensure stability the simulation time step δ t is equal to 10 of the estimated contact duration of the smallest discrete element which follows 15 δ t 0 1 m i n m e h π 3 validation of the proposed approach 3 1 simulation of isolated ice floe impacts the impact of an isolated ice floe represents the simplest form of ice structure interaction in such a case the contact parameters are the main factors that dictate the impact force for a given floe motion calibration against isolated impact data is therefore a crucial first step in determining the appropriate contact parameters in relation to that timco 2011 gathered and examined numerous isolated ice floe impacts from the field measurements as well as the ice basin tests the data comprises descriptions of the ice floe features size mass and velocity and the impact force on the structures the study discovered a strong correlation between the impact force f impact in mn and the floe s kinetic energy e k in gj which can be described using a power law 16a f impact 61 7 e k 0 532 mean 16b f impact 388 e k 0 532 upper bound with the appropriate the contact parameters the current dem is expected to reproduce the empirical trend in dem the contact behavior highly depends on the material properties assigned to the individual element these properties include the elastic modulus e the damping ratio ζ n ζ t the friction coefficient μ and the limiting normal stress σ as mentioned earlier the limiting normal stress predicates on the empirical pressure area curve in eq 7 the coefficient for ice ice friction assumes a value of 0 3 based on the experimental data reported by sukhorukov and løset 2013 while the coefficient for ice steel friction equals 0 1 according to the recommendation in iso19906 2010 for impact problems the normal damping ratio has a strong link to the coefficient of restitution e i e the ratio between the velocity after and before impact yulmetov et al 2016 demonstrated that by taking into account the near field hydrodynamic damping together with the energy dissipated during local crushing of ice floes the coefficient of restitution for ice floe impacts should not exceed 0 1 according to nagurka and huang 2004 the damping ratio and the coefficient of restitution adhere to the following relationship 17 ζ l n e π 1 l n e π 2 1 2 the parameter e in eq 17 defines the coefficient of restitution thus for e 0 1 the normal damping ratio is ζ n 0 59 the tangential damping ratio on the other hand assumes a value of ζ t η ζ n where η represents the tangential to normal stiffness ratio the remaining material property namely the elastic modulus is the subject of the current investigation to validate the current approach against the impact data in timco 2011 this study simulates numerous collisions between an arbitrarily shaped ice floe and an immovable wall in these simulations the water drag and the added mass effect are neglected to avoid any form of energy dissipation prior to collision the simulation begins with the voronoi tessellation to produce an array of randomly shaped ice floes which are then isolated and driven one by one into the target wall see fig 5 by adjusting the floe size the out of plane thickness and the drift velocity the simulation covers the range of impact force and kinetic energy reported in the empirical database the simulations assigned three different values for the elastic modulus namely e 1 10 and 100 mpa for every elastic modulus considered the simulation comprises 530 unique cases fig 6 contrasts the impact force energy data in timco 2011 against those obtained from the simulations as illustrated both the measured and the simulated impact forces increase with the kinetic energy yet there are significant amounts of scatter for the measured data the scatter originates from many different factors some of the prominent factors are arguably the mechanical properties of ice including strength and modulus since the ice floes are reported to indicate varying extent of failure after collision for the dem results since the ice strength is uniformly based on eq 7 the scatter occurs mainly due to eccentric collisions which transform parts of the kinetic energy into rotational motion matskevitch 1997 thus depending on the exact floe geometry the same kinetic energy may translate into a different impact force as demonstrated through fig 6a c the dem impact force increases with the elastic modulus for the elastic modulus of 1 100 mpa the dem results occupy the margin between the mean and the upper bound curve established by timco 2011 however the dem and the measurements achieved the best agreement when e 1 mpa fig 6a which is several orders lower than the elastic modulus of sea ice 2 6 gpa according to iso19906 2011 earlier ice floe simulation with 2d disks similarly used a low elastic modulus of 0 1 mpa which was justified by the close comparison to the ice basin tests løset 1994a 1994b hansen and løset 1999a 1999b this appears to be the consequence of the soft particle approach where the particle overlap is merely a crude estimation of the actual deformation the elastic modulus under this framework therefore may not adhere to the physical value and should be determined through calibration against the relevant experimental data based on the calibration herein the subsequent simulations adopt the elastic modulus of e 1 mpa 3 2 simulation of iceberg towing model tests the validation progresses to the complex interactions within a field of ice floes as a benchmark the current study adopts the ice basin test simulating the iceberg towing operations in managed ice eik and marchenko 2010 under the geometric scale factor of 40 updated details regarding the tests are available in yulmetov and løset 2017 the following discussions refer to the full scale dimensions the model test was conducted in the hsva testing facility where the ice basin is 78 m long and 10 m wide the experimentalists carried out the towing of a cylindrical iceberg which corresponds to the full scale iceberg with a diameter of 76 m a thickness of 26 m and a density of 887 kg m3 the towing gear consists of a line looped around the iceberg which is then connected to a steel hawser attached to the overhead carriage the line converted to full scale is 920 m long with a diameter of 160 mm while the steel hawser is 80 m long with a diameter of 120 mm for each tow the carriage travelled in a straight line trajectory while the load cell installed on the steel hawser measured the total towing force which includes the water and the ice resistance the tests examined the towing force under 40 71 and 86 ice concentration while the ice thickness is fixed at 1 16 m at full scale during the preparation stage the intact ice is cut into triangles with an approximate size of 800 m2 at full scale assuming equilateral triangle the sides are 43 m long however since the same ice field is reused for different ice concentrations the floe size is not preserved throughout the tests therefore the average floe size for c 71 and 40 is somewhat smaller yulmetov and løset 2017 the benchmark test may appear unrelated to floating platforms however it still provides a realistic measurement of managed ice actions within a controlled setting in which complications due to other environmental loads do not occur moreover the cylindrical iceberg suits the nature of the 2d simulation where the influence of non prismatic geometry cannot be considered directly yet there are aspects unique to the towing test that need to be addressed 1 the modeling of the towing gear and 2 the water drag acting on the iceberg the following paragraphs describe the modeling of the aforementioned aspects fig 7 a illustrates the modeling of the towing gear which comprises two linear springs representing the towing line looped around the iceberg as shown the simulation excludes the steel hawser due to the lack of information on the material properties the initial geometry depicted in fig 7a is an approximation based on the reported line length and the iceberg diameter one end of the spring resides at the side of the iceberg while the other is attached to a virtual carriage which moves according to the sequence of velocity v tow shown in fig 7b the movement of the carriage stretches the spring which in turn generates tension t tow proportional to the spring stiffness k tow the spring stiffness and the corresponding tension follow 18a k tow e t a t l t 95 10 9 π 0 08 2 400 4 78 10 6 n m 18b t tow k tow δ l t 0 where e t and a t denote the elastic modulus and the cross sectional area of the towing line respectively while l t represents the un stretched spring length the current framework computes the towing line tension at every time step and subsequently applies the resultant towing forces and moment onto the iceberg similar to the procedure for the mooring restoring forces see eq 8 prior to the main test the experiment measured the water resistance on the iceberg through an open water towing yulmetov and løset 2017 showed that the water resistance oscillates due to the complex flow around the cylindrical geometry assuming that the water resistance is dictated mainly by the form drag mechanism yulmetov and løset 2017 proposed the following expression to describe the water drag on the iceberg 19 f drag iceberg c f 2 h d ρ w v w v v w v where h and d correspond to the thickness and the diameter of the iceberg respectively the experimental data indicates that the form drag coefficient fluctuates around c f 0 37 throughout the tow the current simulation adopts this coefficient under the assumption that the average drag force represents the water resistance adequately table 1 summarizes the parameters assigned for the simulation while fig 8 presents the ice floe size distribution for each ice concentration considered since it is not possible to precisely reproduce the ice floes from the tests the simulated ice field enforces only the key characteristics namely the average floe size and the ice concentration the floe size reduction reflected in fig 8 is merely an estimate since the actual value is not reported fig 9 shows snapshots from the simulation while fig 10 compares the simulated versus the measured towing force in a lower ice concentration c 40 the ice floes have plenty of space to disperse around the advancing iceberg see fig 9a as a result the ice actions come mostly in the form of isolated or simultaneous collisions with little to no floe accumulation ahead of the iceberg the simulated towing force fig 10a reflects these collisions as transient peaks throughout the towing however the water resistance on the iceberg still constitutes a significant portion of the total towing action as indicated by the relatively high force in between the force peaks compared to the measured towing force fig 10a the simulation indicates a reasonable agreement although it is unable to reproduce the exact towing force evolution the transient peaks are somewhat comparable yet the simulation underestimates the average towing force due to the simplification in the iceberg water resistance this comparison therefore suggests that the current dem is able to estimate the ice collision forces and with improved water resistance formulation may reproduce the measured the towing force more accurately as the ice concentration increases the chain of contacts between ice floes gradually becomes the dominant driving factor in the total ice action the snapshots from the case with c 71 fig 9b and c 86 fig 9c clearly portray this phenomenon which further suggest a force build up as opposed to the collision induced force peaks in addition to that the contact network extends laterally towards the basin walls causing a lateral confinement effect that intensifies the ice forces the time series in fig 10 demonstrate that the simulated towing force in high concentration c 71 and 86 consists of sustained peaks that are considerably higher than the transient peaks observed under lower ice concentration c 40 however compared to the test the simulations for c 71 and 86 underestimate the towing force significantly the underestimation becomes more severe as the ice concentration increases as depicted in fig 10b c these comparisons once again demonstrate the limitation of a 2d approach the nature of a densely packed ice field aggravated by the narrow and confining basin unavoidably leads to 3d motions as well as ice floe fragmentations these phenomena ultimately result in the accumulation of ice floes not only in the horizontal plane but also in the vertical direction as the ice starts to accumulate at the interface between the ice floe and the structure the effective thickness of the ice floe increases due to the increase in the contact area between the ice floe and the structure this leads to an increase in the ice load which cannot be represent ed in the 2d simulation the 2d framework simply lacks the means to simulate the three dimensional ice build up and thus leads to the force underestimation in fig 10b c the comparisons in fig 10 prove that the current 2d dem works reasonably well under limited circumstances i e when the ice concentration throughout the simulation remains low enough for the 2d assumption to stay valid which was also confirmed in hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 the current results suggest that two factors dictate this condition 1 the initial ice concentration and 2 the relative domain width which affects the lateral confinement nonetheless defining the exact limits for these two parameters is challenging due to the complexity of the problem and the limited empirical data from the current tests alone the initial ice concentration of c 40 and the domain of width 400 m appear to be the limiting conditions as an attempt to further investigate the effect of domain width this study simulates several hypothetical cases where the basin width varies while the mean floe size and the initial concentration are maintained a newly introduced parameter namely the normalized domain width ψ quantifies the net domain width relative to the average floe size and follows 20 ψ w domain d iceberg d floe where w domain represents the domain width d iceberg denotes the iceberg diameter and d floe corresponds to the average floe size fig 11 presents the evolution of the maximum towing force with respect to the normalized domain width ψ at c 40 71 and 86 as shown the maximum towing force converges when the parameter ψ is greater than a certain critical value depending on the initial ice concentration when c 40 the towing force converges at ψ 8 0 which coincidentally matches the actual ice basin width at higher initial concentrations c 71 and 86 the towing force converges at ψ values larger than that of the actual basin conversely when ψ is less than the critical value the maximum towing force increases rapidly as a consequence of the lateral confinement effect which promotes severe accumulation of ice floes nonetheless due to the limitation of the 2d assumption the maximum towing force at a small ψ may not be accurate as is the case for c 71 and 86 see fig 11 overall the results in fig 11 confirm that the lateral confinement effect becomes negligible past a certain ψ value if the initial ice concentration is sufficiently low this critical ψ can be a useful predictor whether the ice concentration will remain low enough for a valid 2d assumption conversely if the initial ice concentration is high there can be a critical ψ value yet the 2d assumption is questionable from the start of the simulation based on the current benchmark tests the proposed 2d discrete element framework is reasonably accurate up to c 40 with ψ 8 0 the exact validity range may correspond to a slightly larger c and ψ value yet they will remain unknown due to the lack of different ice concentrations in the test program in conclusion beyond the verified conditions the 2d dem may only provide qualitative prediction of the actual ice action 4 managed ice actions on moored floating platforms 4 1 general description this section presents a case study on managed ice load on a moored floating platform as predicted by the proposed discrete element framework the subject of the study is a hypothetical floater inspired by the kulluk as background information kulluk is a conical floating structure designed specifically to endure harsher ice condition such that it can extend the annual drilling season up to the early winter the platform s instrumented mooring lines have amassed invaluable ice load data during the years of deployment in the beaufort sea to date the collected data is regarded as the most comprehensive reference since no other field measurements have covered the range of ice conditions documented by the kulluk fig 12 a illustrates the kulluk during one of its deployments as reported in wright 2000 kulluk has a waterline diameter of 70 m an operating draft of 11 5 m and a displacement of 28 000 tonnes its mooring system consists of 12 catenary steel wires that are evenly spread each with a diameter of 90 mm during operation the mooring lines length and pretension vary according to the site water depth an example data in wright 2000 showed that for a water depth of 32 m the mooring lines are 530 732 m long while the pretension ranges from 600 to 2200 kn fig 12b illustrates the modeling of the hypothetical platform while table 2 summarizes all of the relevant properties following the kulluk the hypothetical platform has a circular water plane geometry with a diameter of 70 m the springs illustrated in fig 12c represent the horizontal projection of the mooring system each spring obeys the tension offset relationship shown in fig 12c which is obtained from a separate 3d static offset analysis performed in harp hull and riser mooring program an industry accepted coupled hull mooring analysis package kim et al 2001 tahar and kim 2003 the harp model assumes that all 12 mooring lines are of equal length and pretension while the material properties are taken from a steel wire catalogue in the current market see table 2 for the values as a simple check fig 13 a contrasts the static offset properties of the mooring system modeled in the discrete element framework against that in harp the comparison shows a close agreement which verifies the mooring system representation in the 2d dem the case study examines the effect of various managed ice conditions on the ice load as well as the mooring load as shown in table 3 the examined parameters consist of the ice concentration the ice thickness the ice drift velocity and the ice floe size the values for these parameters predicate on the ranges and descriptions given in kulluk s field report wright 2000 the case study also examines the effect of the global mooring stiffness past studies have shown that the compliance afforded by the mooring system affects the ice actions to some extent some researches lawrence 2009 sayed and barker 2011 demonstrated that an increasing structural compliance reduces the ice action while others molyneux et al 2011 aksnes 2011 showed otherwise accordingly in addition to the default mooring stiffness in fig 13a the case study simulates a fixed and a drastically more flexible system to examine the significance of structural compliance in the upcoming section the flexible system corresponds to 5 of the default stiffness 4 2 simulation setup for every case in table 3 this study assigned a 1560 1180 m2 ice domain in which the floes are generated based on previous experiences from the narrow ice basin tests the current simulation area is set to be considerably larger than the ice domain in order to avoid the effect of artificial lateral confinement ψ 50 nonetheless the case study purposely adopts a relatively wide ice domain 17 times floater diameter to simulate the natural confining effect from the mass of densely packed ice floes table 4 summarizes the parameters used in the simulation which mostly remain the same as those in section 3 in the case study the ice floes are riding on the constant water current that moves towards the floating platform the ice drift velocity therefore depends on the current velocity v w as implied by the drag force formulation on the other hand the case study ignores the water drag acting on the floater and focus exclusively on the ice induced loads in support of this treatment a recent dem study karulin and karulina 2013 has demonstrated that for a 50 ice concentration and a 0 5 m s current velocity the mooring load due to water drag is insignificant compared to that due to the ice actions excluding the water drag on the floater also implies the omission of the hydrodynamic damping currently the decay of the floater motion comes exclusively from the mooring system damping see eq 9 yet with adjustments on the damping ratio to compensate the omitted hydrodynamic damping the chosen damping ratio of ζ moor 4 derives from calibration against the free decay analysis in harp in which the hydrodynamic damping on the hull and the mooring lines are taken into account as confirmed in fig 13b the 2d floater mooring system with a 4 damping produces comparable motion decay to that from the 3d model in harp 4 3 results and discussions 4 3 1 simulation snapshots and typical load time series the snapshots in fig 14 exemplify the ice floe motion in two drastically different ice concentrations namely c 20 fig 14a b and c 90 fig 14c d subjected to the same ice velocity the same ice velocity in the two different ice concentration implies the different waves currents and winds experienced by the floater fig 14 aims to examine the effect of ice concentration on the ice load while maintaining the other ice load parameters meanwhile fig 15 presents the global ice load the global mooring load as well as the offset time series from the aforementioned cases the global load in this context refers to the resultant of the x and y force components in a low ice concentration the global ice load consists of sparsely distributed impulsive forces which cause the floater to undergo free vibration in between impacts this is evident from the oscillating mooring load in between the ice load peaks fig 15a as well as the oscillating floater offset fig 15b conversely the higher ice concentration generates greater and longer sustained ice load fig 15c which in turn lessens the floater s free vibration response fig 15d the load time series also demonstrate that at times the mooring load is greater than the corresponding ice impact load these events indicate the presence of dynamic amplification which depends heavily on the dynamic properties of both the ice load and the floating platform the forces in fig 15a suggest that the dynamic amplification tend to occur when the ice load duration is comparable to the platforms oscillation period further post processing of fig 15a reveals that the average ice load duration is indeed close to the natural period of the floater the ice load duration fluctuates around 19 9 s while the floater s natural period is 18 78 s based on the simple estimation t n 2 π m flt k x despite the dynamic amplifications the overall maximum of the ice and the mooring load in fig 15a remains comparable this may not be the case when the ice condition or the mooring stiffness changes however the ice induced dynamic amplification is a complex topic that warrants a separate investigation the current study due to the inherent restrictions of the 2d framework will not address this phenomenon in a detailed manner 4 3 2 comparison to field data on kulluk limitations on both the field data and the simulation bring difficulties for a meaningful quantitative comparison the field data in wright 2000 consists of numerous load events during which the mooring system configuration varies the report however contains no description on the mooring system for the corresponding ice load events moreover the overall ice conditions are described qualitatively using the ice regime parameter which is proportional to the ice concentration yet does not reflect the specific ice thickness drift velocity or floe size from the simulation side the current 2d assumption restricts the floater geometry to prismatic shapes which means that the effect of the hull s downward slope is not present in the simulations due to the discrepancy in the floater geometry in addition to the uncertain ice and mooring characteristics the current comparison can only verify the correctness of the simulated load in a qualitative manner i e in terms of the overall trend and the order of magnitude fig 16 contrasts the simulated global load against that from the field measurements as shown the field data scatters significantly yet it indicates a roughly exponential trend with respect to the ice regime in this comparison the simulation adopts the typical ice encountered by the kulluk wright 2000 which is characterized by a thickness of 1 0 m a drift velocity of 0 5 m s an average floe size of 50 m and an ice concentration that varies from 20 to 90 furthermore the comparison predicates on the assumption that simulated ice concentration is equal to the ice regime fig 16 shows that the discrete element simulation is able to reproduce the exponentially increasing mooring load the simulation with all of the assumed ice condition also produces global loads that are in reasonable agreement with the mean curve of the field data this qualitative agreement at the very least establishes some credibility for the simulated load in the upcoming case study however as demonstrated through the towing simulation in section 3 the 2d framework carries intrinsic limitations that compromise the accuracy in higher ice concentration although results from the higher ice concentrations may not be accurate they are still included for the sake of completeness 4 3 3 effect of managed ice characteristics fig 17 illustrates the effect of various ice characteristics on the mooring and the ice load since the typical global load consists of distinct peaks see fig 15 the case study places emphasis on the maximum instead of the average load in general the global mooring load demonstrates the same trend as the global ice load although their magnitudes are not necessarily equal fig 17a illustrates the global load evolution under varying ice concentrations while both the mooring and ice loads increase exponentially with ice concentration the mooring load noticeably exceeds the ice load at c 40 and 50 thus indicating a critical dynamic amplification as briefly discussed earlier this phenomenon occurs due to the interaction between the ice load and the floater s dynamic properties which coincidentally resonates under the aforementioned ice concentrations as also illustrated in fig 17a the ice load surpasses the mooring load at higher ice concentrations c 80 again the reason behind this trend lies on the dynamics of the global loads at the considered ice concentration fig 17b presents the effect of the average floe size d floe on the global load while the ice thickness the ice drift velocity and the ice concentration are maintained the simulated loads indicate a linearly increasing trend with respect to the average floe size considering the proportionality between the impact load and the floe kinetic energy see fig 6 this trend is expected since the energy level rises with the ice floe size however the results in fig 17b demonstrate that the global load is not very sensitive to the average floe size as the floe size increases from 30 m to 80 m 167 increase the global ice load and the global mooring load escalate by only 83 and 82 respectively despite the seemingly conclusive results the simulation assumes unbreakable ice floes which is no longer realistic when the floe is large relative to its thickness the current framework by itself is incapable of establishing this floe size limit as observed from the recent literatures calibrated 3d dem with bonded particles e g in di et al 2017 is arguably the more suitable tool to address larger ice floes the global load increases with the ice thickness fig 17c and the ice drift velocity fig 17d as expected from their influence on the kinetic energy the result demonstrates that increasing the ice thickness from 1 0 m to 4 0 m 300 increase leads to a 239 and a 185 increase in the global ice load and the global mooring load respectively in contrast as the ice drift velocity increases from 0 25 m s to 1 0 m s 300 increase the global ice load and the global mooring load sharply increase by 750 and 605 respectively the higher sensitivity towards the ice drift velocity is consistent with the definition of kinetic energy in which the velocity term is squared the results in fig 17 confirm that the ice induced actions demonstrate stable and clear trends with respect to the managed ice characteristics among the investigated parameters the ice concentration appears to be the most complex determining factor the increase in ice concentration leads to ice floe accumulation jamming which not only produces higher loads but also changes the dynamics of the load as exemplified earlier in fig 15 on the other hand the effect of the remaining parameters namely the ice thickness the floe size and the ice drift velocity are predictable through their contribution in the kinetic energy of the moving ice floe overall under the current unbreakable floe assumption the global load indicates the least sensitivity to the average ice floe size 4 3 4 effect of mooring stiffness fig 18 presents the maximum global loads simulated under three different mooring systems the fixed system is equivalent to a system with an infinite stiffness under which the global mooring load is equal to the global ice load the default system refers to that described in fig 12 while the 5 default system maintains the same geometrical configuration yet with tension offset curve decreased to 5 of that in fig 12c the drastic loss in stiffness undoubtedly leads to a much higher offset which likely exceeds the maximum allowable limit 5 of water depth for drilling since the ice concentration changes the ice load dynamics the case study also examines the mooring stiffness effect under two different ice concentrations i e c 50 and 90 in terms of the ice load magnitude the variation in the mooring stiffness leads to some changes under c 50 fig 18a the difference in the ice load is practically negligible as compared to the dramatic change in the mooring stiffness as the stiffness decreases from fixed to default the ice load increases by 13 3 further stiffness reduction from default to 5 default on the contrary lowers the ice load by 9 6 when c 90 fig 18b the mooring stiffness effect is somewhat more substantial the ice load indicates a mere 5 increase when the stiffness is reduced from fixed to default while stiffness reduction from default to 5 default lowers the ice load by 25 5 overall fig 18 demonstrates that the mooring stiffness influence on the ice impact load is relatively minor the results suggest that for a given managed ice characteristics there exists a mooring stiffness that will maximize ice load which should be avoided in design on the other hand considerable mooring stiffness reduction alleviates only a small portion of the ice load and is unfeasible for drilling or other critical operations in a broader context fig 18 suggests that including the floater motion in an ice structure interaction analysis do not alter the computed ice load significantly in practice this implies that the dynamic mooring floater analysis may be conducted separately using specialized tools by taking the dem ice load with fixed structure assumption as input the change in the mooring stiffness undoubtedly influences the global mooring load however the influence seemingly depends on the ice load dynamics as well the ice concentration of c 50 have previously demonstrated the tendency to trigger dynamic amplification which explains the 36 increase in the global mooring load as the mooring stiffness changes from fixed to default see fig 18a on the contrary further stiffness reduction from default to 5 default alters the dynamic properties of the floater relative to that of the ice load which ultimately results in 48 reduction of the global mooring load the same reasoning explains the trend under c 90 fig 18b except that the corresponding ice load do not have a tendency to induce dynamic amplifications 5 summary and conclusions this paper proposes an efficient 2d discrete element approach as a tool to assess managed ice load on moored floating platforms the discrete element framework adheres to the soft particle principle yet with modifications to facilitate non disk elements in the proposed tool the ice floes are arbitrarily shaped polygons created using the voronoi tessellation algorithm which enables direct control over the ice concentration and the average floe size the floating platform is represented using a polygon that possesses the platform s waterline geometry mass and mass moment of inertia meanwhile the individual mooring line is a spring that follows a tension offset relationship generated using a specialized mooring analysis package this paper validates the discrete element simulation against relevant experiments and field measurements and subsequently demonstrates the application through a case study on a hypothetical floating platform based on the kulluk the results presented throughout the paper support the following conclusions 1 the elastic modulus assigned to the particles discrete elements is critical to the estimated impact force the comparison against the isolated ice floe impact database timco 2011 verifies that the most suitable elastic modulus for the current formulation is 1 mpa despite being several orders lower than the actual sea ice modulus 2 6 gpa the chosen modulus yielded the best agreement with the average of the impact database the seemingly unphysical modulus is likely a consequence of the soft particle principle where the particle particle overlap is a crude estimation of the actual deformation 2 the 2d discrete element framework simulates a reasonably accurate ice action under a certain condition i e when the ice concentration throughout the simulation remains sufficiently low the validation against the iceberg towing model test reveals that agreement is achieved only when the initial ice concentration is 40 meanwhile for the 71 and 86 initial concentrations the discrete element analysis underestimates the measured ice load significantly the underestimation occurs since the 2d framework is incapable of simulating the three dimensional ice buildup that tends to occur in high initial concentration or under confined environment e g a narrow ice basin based on the currently available results the validity of the 2d formulation is verified up to the initial ice concentration of c 40 with a relative domain width of ψ 8 0 3 the case study on the hypothetical floater presents the effect of managed ice characteristics on the ice load as well as the mooring load the overall results demonstrate that the mooring load follows the same trend as the ice load however depending on the dynamics of the ice load relative to that of the mooring system the mooring load may exceed the ice action as a result of dynamic amplification the global load refers to both the ice and the mooring load increases in an approximately exponential trend with respect to the initial ice concentration with respect to the other ice characteristics namely ice thickness floe size and ice drift velocity the global load indicates a roughly linear trend over the examined parameters among all ice characteristics the global load is the least sensitive to the average floe size 4 in addition the case study shows that the structural compliance offered by the mooring system leads to relatively insignificant variations in the ice load the ice load slightly increases as the mooring stiffness shifts from infinite fixed to the default value assumed in the case study in contrast an additional stiffness reduction from default to 5 default lowers the ice load by relatively small margin the observed trend suggests that the ice load reaches a maximum under a certain mooring stiffness which should be avoided in design acknowledgement the authors thank the national research foundation keppel corporation and national university of singapore r 261 507 010 281 for supporting

22463,the current design standard lacks the detailed approach to estimate managed ice actions which in turn forces the industry to rely on ice basin model tests and calibrated numerical simulations to address the need for a reliable assessment of managed ice actions on large scale floaters this paper proposes an efficient two dimensional discrete element simulation with polygonal elements which integrates smoothly with a mooring system modeling and a hydrodynamic force representation the study aims at establishing a range of numerical parameters suitable for managed ice as well as the

structures are no longer cost effective for the arctic environments paulin et al 2008 floating platforms with reliable station keeping systems become the only realistic option for drilling and other key offshore operations in the arctic s deep water as unmanaged sea ice imposes load beyond the capacity of conventional mooring systems which leads to failures at a low ambient temperature zhang and qian 2017 feng and qian 2018 floating platforms are usually deployed with the support from ice management hamilton et al 2011 fig 1 illustrates an ice management technique where two icebreakers move in a circular pattern to reduce the size of incoming ice floes to a safe level although the ice loads are reduced significantly the floating platform and its mooring system still have to endure the managed ice actions while maintaining an acceptable offset for drilling or other critical operations the assessment of loads imposed by managed ice remains a challenging issue due to its complex and uncertain nature for floating platforms in managed ice the current design standard iso19906 2010 recommends an empirical approach based on the field data collected on the kulluk wright 2000 the approach relies on data correction proposed by keinonen et al 1996 to reflect the influence of different vessel dimensions hull forms hull surface conditions ice strengths and ambient temperatures in the more rigorous attempt to assess the managed ice load numerous ice basin model tests have investigated a wide range of cases including managed ice load on ships zhou et al 2019 wang et al 2016 jenssen et al 2012 karulin and karulina 2011 løset et al 1998 semi submersibles karulin et al 2012 karulin and karulina 2014 williams 1989 conical platforms cole 2005 abdelnour et al 1987 and iceberg towing operations eik and marchenko 2010 comfort et al 1999 presented a discussion on the trend observed in the previous model test data and concluded on the relative importance of the ice concentration ice thickness ice velocity and the correlation between the model tests due to the resource intensive nature of ice basin tests various researches have invested in well calibrated numerical models to extend the investigation beyond the scope of the basin tests from the large scale perspective ice floes in nature bear resemblance to a system of discrete particles this inspired many scholars to investigate the behavior of ice floes using the discrete element method dem where the individual ice floe is represented using a single unbreakable particle tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 the earlier attempts utilized 2d disk elements to simulate the ice floe fields in the horizontal plane babic 1990 hopkins and hibler 1991 løset 1994a 1994b hansen and løset 1999a 1999b one notable study by løset 1994a 1994b demonstrated that even with simplified floe geometry and restriction to the horizontal plane the load predicted by dem aligned well with the model test results the 2d dem developments later incorporated polygonal elements to mimic the planar geometry of real ice floes zhan et al 2010 rabatel et al 2015 yulmetov et al 2016 yulmetov and løset 2017 despite the promising results 2d simulation inherently restricts the possibilities for out of plane motions such as rafting and overturning of ice floes which are inevitable in the case of high ice concentration with significant lateral confinement dem studies naturally progressed to 3d formulation utilizing disk elements hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 hopkins and tuthill 2002 ji et al 2013 sun and shen 2012 polyhedral elements lau et al 2011 lau 2006 lau and simoes ré 2006 zhan and molyneux 2012 dilated polyhedral elements hopkins 2004 liu and ji 2018 and spherical elements pradana and qian 2019 majority of the aforementioned 3d simulations demonstrated a close match to their benchmarking ice basin tests despite the advancements in 3d dem a number of recent studies still advocate the use of 2d dem for managed ice problems which evidently yielded good or at least qualitative agreement with the experimental results when the ice concentration and the lateral confinement is not significant yulmetov et al 2016 yulmetov and løset 2017 karulin et al 2012 karulin and karulina 2011 in support of the previous statement the 3d simulations in hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 revealed that a confined field of floating ice floes began showing 3d motions rafting and overturning only when the surface concentration reaches 79 this suggests that there exists a limiting condition possibly in terms of initial ice concentration or relative floe size below which 2d simulations remain reasonably accurate past 2d investigations however have not clearly established these limiting conditions addressing the limit is therefore the key to maximize the potential of 2d solutions as compliments to the design standard and the ice basin tests this study aims to address the assessment of loads generated by managed ice specifically on moored floating platforms in line with this aim this study proposes a 2d discrete element framework where the ice floes are represented using random convex polygons created using the voronoi tessellation procedure via comparison against ice basin tests this study attempts to establish a validity range where the 2d assumption remains reasonably accurate despite the inherent limitations the current 2d framework consumes considerably less computational resources and execution time as compared to a 3d simulation thus once the validity range is identified the 2d framework holds significant potential as a preliminary analysis tool for engineering applications ghoshal et al 2018 the simplicity of the 2d formulation also allows for modeling various dynamic systems with relative ease hence the framework developed herein is easily extendable to other relevant topics such as vessels with dynamic positioning under managed ice kjerstad et al 2015 the numerical framework in this paper is an extension of that in matuttis and chen 2014 which is originally designed to simulate granular materials in section 2 this paper describes the underlying formulation in the contact forces the voronoi based ice floe creation the moored floating platform modeling and the simplified hydrodynamic forces next section 3 validates the current approach against the field data on isolated ice floe impacts as well as the iceberg towing model test presented in eik and marchenko 2010 as a demonstration of the proposed approach section 5 presents a case study on a hypothetical floating platform based on the kulluk wright 2000 where the effect of the ice and the mooring system characteristics is examined finally section 6 summarizes the conclusions supported by the findings of this study 2 discrete element formulation 2 1 overview the current framework computes the interaction between each discrete element according to the soft particle concept cundall and strack 1979 which establishes the contact force as a function of the overlap between non deformable elements particles the particles may also experience other external actions such as hydrodynamic or wind forces by applying time integration to the equation of motion the framework calculates the position and the velocity of each particle at the next time step due to the 2d assumption the framework computes strictly the water plane motion two translational and one rotational degrees of freedom and assumes that all out of plane actions are in equilibrium in the current approach the typical simulation comprises the simulation walls the ice floes the floating platform and the representation of the mooring system the first three components are discrete elements with specific geometry and assignments the simulation walls are unmovable rectangular particles placed at the extremes of the domain the ice floes are arbitrarily shaped polygonal particles that move in response to the external forces on the other hand the floating platform is a particle that possesses the platform s water plane geometry mass and mass moment of inertia motions of the platform elicit restoring forces from the mooring system which is represented using a set of springs successive time integration over a pre determined duration provides the time series of 1 ice actions on the platform 2 mooring restoring forces and 3 motions of the platform 2 2 contact formulation fig 2 illustrates a contact between two polygonal particles as illustrated the particles in contact experience normal and tangential forces that are generated by the spring dashpot system in the corresponding direction these forces act on the centroid of the overlapping region see fig 2a and due to the eccentricity with respect to the particle centroids they produce in plane moments as well the geometry of the overlap region fig 2c defines the normal and the tangential direction the vector connecting the two intersection points represents the tangential direction while the normal direction follows accordingly see fig 2c details regarding the contact detection and the computation of the overlap geometry are available in matuttis and chen 2014 following the traditional formulation for the soft particle contact the current contact forces include 1a f n f n s f n d 0 normal component 1b f t f t s f t d μ f n tangential component where the subscripts s and d designate the elastic and the damping components respectively the formulation restricts the negative normal force signifying unphysical attractive force which may occur when the damping term is dominant on the other hand the tangential force imitates friction and as such its magnitude is limited by the coefficient of friction μ at the end of every contact computation the framework resolves the forces and moment according to the global coordinate system resulting in f contact x f contact y and m contact at the centroid of each particle 2 2 1 normal forces the normal elastic force depends on the extent of overlap and the assigned material stiffness at any given time step its magnitude follows 2 f n s e h a overlap l where 3 l 4 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 the parameters r 1 r 2 represent the distance between the corresponding particle centroid and the center of the overlap area see fig 2 the constants e and h denote the particle elastic modulus and the out of plane thickness respectively together they characterize the normal contact stiffness meanwhile the area of the overlap region a overlap and the particle length scale l quantify the extent of overlap the normal damping force is modeled after the viscous damper in harmonic oscillators and expressed as 4 f n d 2 ζ n e h m a overlap i 1 a overlap i δ t 1 l where ζ n represents the normal damping ratio and m denotes the effective mass of the two particles in contact the term inside the parentheses is an approximation of the relative velocity based on the change of the overlap area over a single time step δ t during separation i e when the relative velocity is positive the damping force may lead to a negative attractive total force in eq 1a if the damping force exceeds the elastic force which may occur when ζ n or the initial impact velocity is high the limit f n 0 see eq 1a prevents this unphysical behavior 2 2 2 tangential forces the tangential elastic force adheres to the cundall strack friction model cundall and strack 1979 which computes the force incrementally as follows 5 f t s i f t s i 1 η e h v t i δ t μ f n the multiplier η represents the ratio between the tangential and the normal spring stiffness this paper assumes that η 0 38 based on the shear to normal modulus correlation with a poisson ratio of 0 3 the bracketed term approximates the relative tangential motion based on the current relative tangential velocity v t i at any time step the tangential elastic force must not exceed the ceiling set by the coefficient of friction to avoid non decaying tangential oscillations the current contact model includes a tangential damping force similar to the viscous damper in the normal direction 6 f t d 2 ζ t η e h m v t 2 2 3 upper limit for the normal contact force the normal contact force in eq 1a may exceed the strength of the simulated material and produces unrealistically high loads this study proposes a force limit that reflects the compressive strength of the material the limit ensures that the maximum pressure on the contact area i e a c h l contact see fig 2c does not exceed the material s compressive strength based on the ice pressure data from ship ramming tests iso19906 2010 proposed the pressure area curve that follows 7 σ c p a c d p where the coefficients c p and d p equal 3 0 and 0 4 respectively consistent with the focus on ice the current formulation limits the normal contact pressure f n a c to that in eq 7 this study therefore does not simulate the physical crushing failure in the ice floes for confined ice fields a 3d dem approach will be able to predict such failures in the ice floes with enhanced accuracy pradana and qian 2019 2 3 ice field creation with voronoi tessellation realistic assessment of managed ice loads requires the simulation of the ice field s randomness along with its essential characteristics namely the ice concentration and the average floe size the ice concentration represents the fraction of the water plane area that is occupied by ice floes while the ice floe size is often quantified using the mean caliper diameter mcd for any given polygon this study approximates the mcd as twice the average centroid to vertex distance a number of publications have generated artificial ice fields using existing or self developed algorithm yulmetov et al 2016 propose an algorithm that generates scales and places arbitrary polygons in such a way that the target size distribution and the desired ice concentration are achieved other scholars utilize the 2d voronoi tessellation to achieve similar result liu and ji 2018 lau and simoes ré 2006 considering its efficiency this study adopts the voronoi tessellation algorithm to generate the managed ice fields in the 2d context the voronoi tessellation divides a planar domain into n convex polygons see okabe et al 2009 for the detailed algorithm the variable n equals the number of randomly placed voronoi generators also referred to as seed points that are present within the domain the edges of the polygons are equidistant lines between one voronoi generator and its adjacent neighbors such that every polygon encloses precisely one voronoi generator without further modification the voronoi polygons form a 100 concentration nevertheless any desired concentration is achievable by scaling down the polygons while the average floe size in terms of mcd can be regulated by adjusting n according to the domain size in a case where every polygon is scaled uniformly the concentration c and the scaling factor α obey the following relationship α c fig 3 a shows an example ice field with c 90 and a mean floe size of d floe 28 m the drawback of a voronoi tessellation based approach is the lack of a direct control over the floe shape and size distribution nonetheless indirect controls over these distributions are possible through the strategic positioning of voronoi generators sotomayor and tippur 2014 another method to control the shape distribution involves the centroidal voronoi tessellation cvt where an iterative tessellation is performed until the polygon centroids and the voronoi generators converge du et al 1999 this method requires that for the i th iteration the voronoi generators are the centroid of the polygons from the i 1 th iteration except for the 1st iteration where the voronoi generators are randomly placed fig 3a c illustrates the polygon shape evolution as the iteration is performed while fig 3d shows a field of ice floes in nature as shown the cvt algorithm eliminates the elongated polygons fig 3c yet they produce unnaturally rounded and uniform floes on the other hand if the cvt is stopped before convergence the resulting polygons appear to be more natural and thus closer to the real ice floes see fig 3b for this reason the current study adopts the partial cvt where the algorithm is stopped after the second iteration 2 4 modelling the mooring system in the current approach the individual mooring line is a spring that follows a user defined horizontal tension offset curve fig 4 this method enables the modeling of different mooring types taut or catenary of any size and pre tension by simply providing the appropriate tension offset curve furthermore the layout of the mooring system spread or grouped in any orientation is easily modifiable by adjusting the coordinates of the fairlead and the anchor points fig 4b exemplifies a typical tension offset curve required by the current framework as shown the curve should cover both the positive and the negative offset that are expected to occur during the simulation the example curve in fig 4b represents the response of a single mooring line to a horizontal offset which for better accuracy can be generated using a specialized mooring analysis tool throughout the simulation the framework assumes that the mooring offset equals the change in the projected mooring length the mooring system provides restoring forces and moment proportional to the platform s motion the magnitudes of these restoring actions equal the resultant of all mooring line tension and are expressed as 8a f moor x i 1 k t i c o s θ i 8b f moor y i 1 k t i s i n θ i 8c m moor i 1 k t i c o s θ i e i y i 1 k t i s i n θ i e i x where t i represents the tension of line i according to the assigned tension offset curve θ i denotes the angle between the mooring line and the horizontal x axis see fig 4a and the parameters e i x and e i y define the eccentricity between the mooring force and the centroid of the floater in the x and y directions respectively in addition to these forces the motion of the submerged mooring lines introduces a water drag that exerts a damping effect on the system currently the energy dissipation contributed by the mooring system is simulated using viscous dampers which generate the following forces and moment 9a f moor damp x 2 ζ moor k x m flt v flt x 9b f moor damp y 2 ζ moor k y m flt v flt y 9c m moor damp 2 ζ moor k rot j flt ω flt k x k y and k rot represent the translational and the rotational stiffness of the mooring system respectively these stiffness parameters derive from separate static offset analyses performed before the ice structure simulation the constant ζ moor represents the mooring system s damping ratio while m flt and j flt denote the mass and the mass moment of inertia of the floating platform the total mooring action applied to the platform s centroid equals the summation of eqs 8 and 9 2 5 hydrodynamic forces lu et al 2011 identified that the water drag force acting on a relatively flat ice floe equals the sum of the form drag and the skin drag and follows 10 f drag c f 2 1 c 1 c h d 1 2 2 h d c s a ρ w v w v v w v where c f and c s represent the form and the skin drag coefficient respectively the form drag refers to the normal force acting on the vertical face of an ice floe as it moves through the water accordingly it depends on the floe thickness h and the floe diameter d however the wake effects in a field of ice floes attenuate this force in proportion to the ice concentration c as implied by eq 10 the skin drag on the other hand describes the tangential force acting on the bottom face of an ice floe and as such is governed by the planar area of the ice floe a similar to other approximations of the fluid drag eq 10 is a function of the fluid density ρ w as well as the relative velocity between the fluid v w and the ice floe v the current framework computes the drag force in the x and y directions independently and applies them to the centroid of each particle as suggested in lu et al 2011 the value of drag coefficients are c f 1 0 and c s 0 002 the formulation in eq 10 lacks the fluid resistance against in plane rotations which can lead to unrealistic floe movements e g unrestrained rigid body rotation to alleviate this the current study imposes a drag moment similar to that in ji et al 2013 11 m drag c r 2 d 2 4 h d d 2 ρ w ω ω where ω is the particle s angular velocity the rotational drag coefficient c r assumes a value of 1 0 following the form drag coefficient in addition to the drag forces the current framework considers the added mass effect that occurs when an ice floe accelerates or decelerates in water meylan et al 2015 demonstrated experimentally that the added mass on an ice floe constitutes about 10 of the actual mass following this finding the ice floe mass considered in the simulation equals 12 m m 0 1 c m where m 0 is the actual mass of the ice floe while the added mass coefficient c m equals 0 1 in all simulations 2 6 equation of motion and time integration the x and y translational motions of a discrete element adheres to the newton s equation of motion 13 m d v d t f contact f drag f moor f moor damp where v designates the particle s velocity in the corresponding direction the right hand side of eq 13 comprises the time varying external forces that may act on any given discrete element clearly the mooring forces are zero when the particular discrete element represents an ice floe parallel to the translational motion the centroidal rotation of a discrete element follows 14 j d ω d t m contact m drag m moor m moor damp where ω represents the particle s angular velocity while j denotes the particle s mass moment of inertia by integrating eqs 13 and 14 with respect to time the dem predicts the elements position and velocity throughout the simulation the time integration in the current framework adopts the gear s predictor corrector technique following the original work by matuttis and chen 2014 to ensure stability the simulation time step δ t is equal to 10 of the estimated contact duration of the smallest discrete element which follows 15 δ t 0 1 m i n m e h π 3 validation of the proposed approach 3 1 simulation of isolated ice floe impacts the impact of an isolated ice floe represents the simplest form of ice structure interaction in such a case the contact parameters are the main factors that dictate the impact force for a given floe motion calibration against isolated impact data is therefore a crucial first step in determining the appropriate contact parameters in relation to that timco 2011 gathered and examined numerous isolated ice floe impacts from the field measurements as well as the ice basin tests the data comprises descriptions of the ice floe features size mass and velocity and the impact force on the structures the study discovered a strong correlation between the impact force f impact in mn and the floe s kinetic energy e k in gj which can be described using a power law 16a f impact 61 7 e k 0 532 mean 16b f impact 388 e k 0 532 upper bound with the appropriate the contact parameters the current dem is expected to reproduce the empirical trend in dem the contact behavior highly depends on the material properties assigned to the individual element these properties include the elastic modulus e the damping ratio ζ n ζ t the friction coefficient μ and the limiting normal stress σ as mentioned earlier the limiting normal stress predicates on the empirical pressure area curve in eq 7 the coefficient for ice ice friction assumes a value of 0 3 based on the experimental data reported by sukhorukov and løset 2013 while the coefficient for ice steel friction equals 0 1 according to the recommendation in iso19906 2010 for impact problems the normal damping ratio has a strong link to the coefficient of restitution e i e the ratio between the velocity after and before impact yulmetov et al 2016 demonstrated that by taking into account the near field hydrodynamic damping together with the energy dissipated during local crushing of ice floes the coefficient of restitution for ice floe impacts should not exceed 0 1 according to nagurka and huang 2004 the damping ratio and the coefficient of restitution adhere to the following relationship 17 ζ l n e π 1 l n e π 2 1 2 the parameter e in eq 17 defines the coefficient of restitution thus for e 0 1 the normal damping ratio is ζ n 0 59 the tangential damping ratio on the other hand assumes a value of ζ t η ζ n where η represents the tangential to normal stiffness ratio the remaining material property namely the elastic modulus is the subject of the current investigation to validate the current approach against the impact data in timco 2011 this study simulates numerous collisions between an arbitrarily shaped ice floe and an immovable wall in these simulations the water drag and the added mass effect are neglected to avoid any form of energy dissipation prior to collision the simulation begins with the voronoi tessellation to produce an array of randomly shaped ice floes which are then isolated and driven one by one into the target wall see fig 5 by adjusting the floe size the out of plane thickness and the drift velocity the simulation covers the range of impact force and kinetic energy reported in the empirical database the simulations assigned three different values for the elastic modulus namely e 1 10 and 100 mpa for every elastic modulus considered the simulation comprises 530 unique cases fig 6 contrasts the impact force energy data in timco 2011 against those obtained from the simulations as illustrated both the measured and the simulated impact forces increase with the kinetic energy yet there are significant amounts of scatter for the measured data the scatter originates from many different factors some of the prominent factors are arguably the mechanical properties of ice including strength and modulus since the ice floes are reported to indicate varying extent of failure after collision for the dem results since the ice strength is uniformly based on eq 7 the scatter occurs mainly due to eccentric collisions which transform parts of the kinetic energy into rotational motion matskevitch 1997 thus depending on the exact floe geometry the same kinetic energy may translate into a different impact force as demonstrated through fig 6a c the dem impact force increases with the elastic modulus for the elastic modulus of 1 100 mpa the dem results occupy the margin between the mean and the upper bound curve established by timco 2011 however the dem and the measurements achieved the best agreement when e 1 mpa fig 6a which is several orders lower than the elastic modulus of sea ice 2 6 gpa according to iso19906 2011 earlier ice floe simulation with 2d disks similarly used a low elastic modulus of 0 1 mpa which was justified by the close comparison to the ice basin tests løset 1994a 1994b hansen and løset 1999a 1999b this appears to be the consequence of the soft particle approach where the particle overlap is merely a crude estimation of the actual deformation the elastic modulus under this framework therefore may not adhere to the physical value and should be determined through calibration against the relevant experimental data based on the calibration herein the subsequent simulations adopt the elastic modulus of e 1 mpa 3 2 simulation of iceberg towing model tests the validation progresses to the complex interactions within a field of ice floes as a benchmark the current study adopts the ice basin test simulating the iceberg towing operations in managed ice eik and marchenko 2010 under the geometric scale factor of 40 updated details regarding the tests are available in yulmetov and løset 2017 the following discussions refer to the full scale dimensions the model test was conducted in the hsva testing facility where the ice basin is 78 m long and 10 m wide the experimentalists carried out the towing of a cylindrical iceberg which corresponds to the full scale iceberg with a diameter of 76 m a thickness of 26 m and a density of 887 kg m3 the towing gear consists of a line looped around the iceberg which is then connected to a steel hawser attached to the overhead carriage the line converted to full scale is 920 m long with a diameter of 160 mm while the steel hawser is 80 m long with a diameter of 120 mm for each tow the carriage travelled in a straight line trajectory while the load cell installed on the steel hawser measured the total towing force which includes the water and the ice resistance the tests examined the towing force under 40 71 and 86 ice concentration while the ice thickness is fixed at 1 16 m at full scale during the preparation stage the intact ice is cut into triangles with an approximate size of 800 m2 at full scale assuming equilateral triangle the sides are 43 m long however since the same ice field is reused for different ice concentrations the floe size is not preserved throughout the tests therefore the average floe size for c 71 and 40 is somewhat smaller yulmetov and løset 2017 the benchmark test may appear unrelated to floating platforms however it still provides a realistic measurement of managed ice actions within a controlled setting in which complications due to other environmental loads do not occur moreover the cylindrical iceberg suits the nature of the 2d simulation where the influence of non prismatic geometry cannot be considered directly yet there are aspects unique to the towing test that need to be addressed 1 the modeling of the towing gear and 2 the water drag acting on the iceberg the following paragraphs describe the modeling of the aforementioned aspects fig 7 a illustrates the modeling of the towing gear which comprises two linear springs representing the towing line looped around the iceberg as shown the simulation excludes the steel hawser due to the lack of information on the material properties the initial geometry depicted in fig 7a is an approximation based on the reported line length and the iceberg diameter one end of the spring resides at the side of the iceberg while the other is attached to a virtual carriage which moves according to the sequence of velocity v tow shown in fig 7b the movement of the carriage stretches the spring which in turn generates tension t tow proportional to the spring stiffness k tow the spring stiffness and the corresponding tension follow 18a k tow e t a t l t 95 10 9 π 0 08 2 400 4 78 10 6 n m 18b t tow k tow δ l t 0 where e t and a t denote the elastic modulus and the cross sectional area of the towing line respectively while l t represents the un stretched spring length the current framework computes the towing line tension at every time step and subsequently applies the resultant towing forces and moment onto the iceberg similar to the procedure for the mooring restoring forces see eq 8 prior to the main test the experiment measured the water resistance on the iceberg through an open water towing yulmetov and løset 2017 showed that the water resistance oscillates due to the complex flow around the cylindrical geometry assuming that the water resistance is dictated mainly by the form drag mechanism yulmetov and løset 2017 proposed the following expression to describe the water drag on the iceberg 19 f drag iceberg c f 2 h d ρ w v w v v w v where h and d correspond to the thickness and the diameter of the iceberg respectively the experimental data indicates that the form drag coefficient fluctuates around c f 0 37 throughout the tow the current simulation adopts this coefficient under the assumption that the average drag force represents the water resistance adequately table 1 summarizes the parameters assigned for the simulation while fig 8 presents the ice floe size distribution for each ice concentration considered since it is not possible to precisely reproduce the ice floes from the tests the simulated ice field enforces only the key characteristics namely the average floe size and the ice concentration the floe size reduction reflected in fig 8 is merely an estimate since the actual value is not reported fig 9 shows snapshots from the simulation while fig 10 compares the simulated versus the measured towing force in a lower ice concentration c 40 the ice floes have plenty of space to disperse around the advancing iceberg see fig 9a as a result the ice actions come mostly in the form of isolated or simultaneous collisions with little to no floe accumulation ahead of the iceberg the simulated towing force fig 10a reflects these collisions as transient peaks throughout the towing however the water resistance on the iceberg still constitutes a significant portion of the total towing action as indicated by the relatively high force in between the force peaks compared to the measured towing force fig 10a the simulation indicates a reasonable agreement although it is unable to reproduce the exact towing force evolution the transient peaks are somewhat comparable yet the simulation underestimates the average towing force due to the simplification in the iceberg water resistance this comparison therefore suggests that the current dem is able to estimate the ice collision forces and with improved water resistance formulation may reproduce the measured the towing force more accurately as the ice concentration increases the chain of contacts between ice floes gradually becomes the dominant driving factor in the total ice action the snapshots from the case with c 71 fig 9b and c 86 fig 9c clearly portray this phenomenon which further suggest a force build up as opposed to the collision induced force peaks in addition to that the contact network extends laterally towards the basin walls causing a lateral confinement effect that intensifies the ice forces the time series in fig 10 demonstrate that the simulated towing force in high concentration c 71 and 86 consists of sustained peaks that are considerably higher than the transient peaks observed under lower ice concentration c 40 however compared to the test the simulations for c 71 and 86 underestimate the towing force significantly the underestimation becomes more severe as the ice concentration increases as depicted in fig 10b c these comparisons once again demonstrate the limitation of a 2d approach the nature of a densely packed ice field aggravated by the narrow and confining basin unavoidably leads to 3d motions as well as ice floe fragmentations these phenomena ultimately result in the accumulation of ice floes not only in the horizontal plane but also in the vertical direction as the ice starts to accumulate at the interface between the ice floe and the structure the effective thickness of the ice floe increases due to the increase in the contact area between the ice floe and the structure this leads to an increase in the ice load which cannot be represent ed in the 2d simulation the 2d framework simply lacks the means to simulate the three dimensional ice build up and thus leads to the force underestimation in fig 10b c the comparisons in fig 10 prove that the current 2d dem works reasonably well under limited circumstances i e when the ice concentration throughout the simulation remains low enough for the 2d assumption to stay valid which was also confirmed in hopkins and tuhkuri 1999 the current results suggest that two factors dictate this condition 1 the initial ice concentration and 2 the relative domain width which affects the lateral confinement nonetheless defining the exact limits for these two parameters is challenging due to the complexity of the problem and the limited empirical data from the current tests alone the initial ice concentration of c 40 and the domain of width 400 m appear to be the limiting conditions as an attempt to further investigate the effect of domain width this study simulates several hypothetical cases where the basin width varies while the mean floe size and the initial concentration are maintained a newly introduced parameter namely the normalized domain width ψ quantifies the net domain width relative to the average floe size and follows 20 ψ w domain d iceberg d floe where w domain represents the domain width d iceberg denotes the iceberg diameter and d floe corresponds to the average floe size fig 11 presents the evolution of the maximum towing force with respect to the normalized domain width ψ at c 40 71 and 86 as shown the maximum towing force converges when the parameter ψ is greater than a certain critical value depending on the initial ice concentration when c 40 the towing force converges at ψ 8 0 which coincidentally matches the actual ice basin width at higher initial concentrations c 71 and 86 the towing force converges at ψ values larger than that of the actual basin conversely when ψ is less than the critical value the maximum towing force increases rapidly as a consequence of the lateral confinement effect which promotes severe accumulation of ice floes nonetheless due to the limitation of the 2d assumption the maximum towing force at a small ψ may not be accurate as is the case for c 71 and 86 see fig 11 overall the results in fig 11 confirm that the lateral confinement effect becomes negligible past a certain ψ value if the initial ice concentration is sufficiently low this critical ψ can be a useful predictor whether the ice concentration will remain low enough for a valid 2d assumption conversely if the initial ice concentration is high there can be a critical ψ value yet the 2d assumption is questionable from the start of the simulation based on the current benchmark tests the proposed 2d discrete element framework is reasonably accurate up to c 40 with ψ 8 0 the exact validity range may correspond to a slightly larger c and ψ value yet they will remain unknown due to the lack of different ice concentrations in the test program in conclusion beyond the verified conditions the 2d dem may only provide qualitative prediction of the actual ice action 4 managed ice actions on moored floating platforms 4 1 general description this section presents a case study on managed ice load on a moored floating platform as predicted by the proposed discrete element framework the subject of the study is a hypothetical floater inspired by the kulluk as background information kulluk is a conical floating structure designed specifically to endure harsher ice condition such that it can extend the annual drilling season up to the early winter the platform s instrumented mooring lines have amassed invaluable ice load data during the years of deployment in the beaufort sea to date the collected data is regarded as the most comprehensive reference since no other field measurements have covered the range of ice conditions documented by the kulluk fig 12 a illustrates the kulluk during one of its deployments as reported in wright 2000 kulluk has a waterline diameter of 70 m an operating draft of 11 5 m and a displacement of 28 000 tonnes its mooring system consists of 12 catenary steel wires that are evenly spread each with a diameter of 90 mm during operation the mooring lines length and pretension vary according to the site water depth an example data in wright 2000 showed that for a water depth of 32 m the mooring lines are 530 732 m long while the pretension ranges from 600 to 2200 kn fig 12b illustrates the modeling of the hypothetical platform while table 2 summarizes all of the relevant properties following the kulluk the hypothetical platform has a circular water plane geometry with a diameter of 70 m the springs illustrated in fig 12c represent the horizontal projection of the mooring system each spring obeys the tension offset relationship shown in fig 12c which is obtained from a separate 3d static offset analysis performed in harp hull and riser mooring program an industry accepted coupled hull mooring analysis package kim et al 2001 tahar and kim 2003 the harp model assumes that all 12 mooring lines are of equal length and pretension while the material properties are taken from a steel wire catalogue in the current market see table 2 for the values as a simple check fig 13 a contrasts the static offset properties of the mooring system modeled in the discrete element framework against that in harp the comparison shows a close agreement which verifies the mooring system representation in the 2d dem the case study examines the effect of various managed ice conditions on the ice load as well as the mooring load as shown in table 3 the examined parameters consist of the ice concentration the ice thickness the ice drift velocity and the ice floe size the values for these parameters predicate on the ranges and descriptions given in kulluk s field report wright 2000 the case study also examines the effect of the global mooring stiffness past studies have shown that the compliance afforded by the mooring system affects the ice actions to some extent some researches lawrence 2009 sayed and barker 2011 demonstrated that an increasing structural compliance reduces the ice action while others molyneux et al 2011 aksnes 2011 showed otherwise accordingly in addition to the default mooring stiffness in fig 13a the case study simulates a fixed and a drastically more flexible system to examine the significance of structural compliance in the upcoming section the flexible system corresponds to 5 of the default stiffness 4 2 simulation setup for every case in table 3 this study assigned a 1560 1180 m2 ice domain in which the floes are generated based on previous experiences from the narrow ice basin tests the current simulation area is set to be considerably larger than the ice domain in order to avoid the effect of artificial lateral confinement ψ 50 nonetheless the case study purposely adopts a relatively wide ice domain 17 times floater diameter to simulate the natural confining effect from the mass of densely packed ice floes table 4 summarizes the parameters used in the simulation which mostly remain the same as those in section 3 in the case study the ice floes are riding on the constant water current that moves towards the floating platform the ice drift velocity therefore depends on the current velocity v w as implied by the drag force formulation on the other hand the case study ignores the water drag acting on the floater and focus exclusively on the ice induced loads in support of this treatment a recent dem study karulin and karulina 2013 has demonstrated that for a 50 ice concentration and a 0 5 m s current velocity the mooring load due to water drag is insignificant compared to that due to the ice actions excluding the water drag on the floater also implies the omission of the hydrodynamic damping currently the decay of the floater motion comes exclusively from the mooring system damping see eq 9 yet with adjustments on the damping ratio to compensate the omitted hydrodynamic damping the chosen damping ratio of ζ moor 4 derives from calibration against the free decay analysis in harp in which the hydrodynamic damping on the hull and the mooring lines are taken into account as confirmed in fig 13b the 2d floater mooring system with a 4 damping produces comparable motion decay to that from the 3d model in harp 4 3 results and discussions 4 3 1 simulation snapshots and typical load time series the snapshots in fig 14 exemplify the ice floe motion in two drastically different ice concentrations namely c 20 fig 14a b and c 90 fig 14c d subjected to the same ice velocity the same ice velocity in the two different ice concentration implies the different waves currents and winds experienced by the floater fig 14 aims to examine the effect of ice concentration on the ice load while maintaining the other ice load parameters meanwhile fig 15 presents the global ice load the global mooring load as well as the offset time series from the aforementioned cases the global load in this context refers to the resultant of the x and y force components in a low ice concentration the global ice load consists of sparsely distributed impulsive forces which cause the floater to undergo free vibration in between impacts this is evident from the oscillating mooring load in between the ice load peaks fig 15a as well as the oscillating floater offset fig 15b conversely the higher ice concentration generates greater and longer sustained ice load fig 15c which in turn lessens the floater s free vibration response fig 15d the load time series also demonstrate that at times the mooring load is greater than the corresponding ice impact load these events indicate the presence of dynamic amplification which depends heavily on the dynamic properties of both the ice load and the floating platform the forces in fig 15a suggest that the dynamic amplification tend to occur when the ice load duration is comparable to the platforms oscillation period further post processing of fig 15a reveals that the average ice load duration is indeed close to the natural period of the floater the ice load duration fluctuates around 19 9 s while the floater s natural period is 18 78 s based on the simple estimation t n 2 π m flt k x despite the dynamic amplifications the overall maximum of the ice and the mooring load in fig 15a remains comparable this may not be the case when the ice condition or the mooring stiffness changes however the ice induced dynamic amplification is a complex topic that warrants a separate investigation the current study due to the inherent restrictions of the 2d framework will not address this phenomenon in a detailed manner 4 3 2 comparison to field data on kulluk limitations on both the field data and the simulation bring difficulties for a meaningful quantitative comparison the field data in wright 2000 consists of numerous load events during which the mooring system configuration varies the report however contains no description on the mooring system for the corresponding ice load events moreover the overall ice conditions are described qualitatively using the ice regime parameter which is proportional to the ice concentration yet does not reflect the specific ice thickness drift velocity or floe size from the simulation side the current 2d assumption restricts the floater geometry to prismatic shapes which means that the effect of the hull s downward slope is not present in the simulations due to the discrepancy in the floater geometry in addition to the uncertain ice and mooring characteristics the current comparison can only verify the correctness of the simulated load in a qualitative manner i e in terms of the overall trend and the order of magnitude fig 16 contrasts the simulated global load against that from the field measurements as shown the field data scatters significantly yet it indicates a roughly exponential trend with respect to the ice regime in this comparison the simulation adopts the typical ice encountered by the kulluk wright 2000 which is characterized by a thickness of 1 0 m a drift velocity of 0 5 m s an average floe size of 50 m and an ice concentration that varies from 20 to 90 furthermore the comparison predicates on the assumption that simulated ice concentration is equal to the ice regime fig 16 shows that the discrete element simulation is able to reproduce the exponentially increasing mooring load the simulation with all of the assumed ice condition also produces global loads that are in reasonable agreement with the mean curve of the field data this qualitative agreement at the very least establishes some credibility for the simulated load in the upcoming case study however as demonstrated through the towing simulation in section 3 the 2d framework carries intrinsic limitations that compromise the accuracy in higher ice concentration although results from the higher ice concentrations may not be accurate they are still included for the sake of completeness 4 3 3 effect of managed ice characteristics fig 17 illustrates the effect of various ice characteristics on the mooring and the ice load since the typical global load consists of distinct peaks see fig 15 the case study places emphasis on the maximum instead of the average load in general the global mooring load demonstrates the same trend as the global ice load although their magnitudes are not necessarily equal fig 17a illustrates the global load evolution under varying ice concentrations while both the mooring and ice loads increase exponentially with ice concentration the mooring load noticeably exceeds the ice load at c 40 and 50 thus indicating a critical dynamic amplification as briefly discussed earlier this phenomenon occurs due to the interaction between the ice load and the floater s dynamic properties which coincidentally resonates under the aforementioned ice concentrations as also illustrated in fig 17a the ice load surpasses the mooring load at higher ice concentrations c 80 again the reason behind this trend lies on the dynamics of the global loads at the considered ice concentration fig 17b presents the effect of the average floe size d floe on the global load while the ice thickness the ice drift velocity and the ice concentration are maintained the simulated loads indicate a linearly increasing trend with respect to the average floe size considering the proportionality between the impact load and the floe kinetic energy see fig 6 this trend is expected since the energy level rises with the ice floe size however the results in fig 17b demonstrate that the global load is not very sensitive to the average floe size as the floe size increases from 30 m to 80 m 167 increase the global ice load and the global mooring load escalate by only 83 and 82 respectively despite the seemingly conclusive results the simulation assumes unbreakable ice floes which is no longer realistic when the floe is large relative to its thickness the current framework by itself is incapable of establishing this floe size limit as observed from the recent literatures calibrated 3d dem with bonded particles e g in di et al 2017 is arguably the more suitable tool to address larger ice floes the global load increases with the ice thickness fig 17c and the ice drift velocity fig 17d as expected from their influence on the kinetic energy the result demonstrates that increasing the ice thickness from 1 0 m to 4 0 m 300 increase leads to a 239 and a 185 increase in the global ice load and the global mooring load respectively in contrast as the ice drift velocity increases from 0 25 m s to 1 0 m s 300 increase the global ice load and the global mooring load sharply increase by 750 and 605 respectively the higher sensitivity towards the ice drift velocity is consistent with the definition of kinetic energy in which the velocity term is squared the results in fig 17 confirm that the ice induced actions demonstrate stable and clear trends with respect to the managed ice characteristics among the investigated parameters the ice concentration appears to be the most complex determining factor the increase in ice concentration leads to ice floe accumulation jamming which not only produces higher loads but also changes the dynamics of the load as exemplified earlier in fig 15 on the other hand the effect of the remaining parameters namely the ice thickness the floe size and the ice drift velocity are predictable through their contribution in the kinetic energy of the moving ice floe overall under the current unbreakable floe assumption the global load indicates the least sensitivity to the average ice floe size 4 3 4 effect of mooring stiffness fig 18 presents the maximum global loads simulated under three different mooring systems the fixed system is equivalent to a system with an infinite stiffness under which the global mooring load is equal to the global ice load the default system refers to that described in fig 12 while the 5 default system maintains the same geometrical configuration yet with tension offset curve decreased to 5 of that in fig 12c the drastic loss in stiffness undoubtedly leads to a much higher offset which likely exceeds the maximum allowable limit 5 of water depth for drilling since the ice concentration changes the ice load dynamics the case study also examines the mooring stiffness effect under two different ice concentrations i e c 50 and 90 in terms of the ice load magnitude the variation in the mooring stiffness leads to some changes under c 50 fig 18a the difference in the ice load is practically negligible as compared to the dramatic change in the mooring stiffness as the stiffness decreases from fixed to default the ice load increases by 13 3 further stiffness reduction from default to 5 default on the contrary lowers the ice load by 9 6 when c 90 fig 18b the mooring stiffness effect is somewhat more substantial the ice load indicates a mere 5 increase when the stiffness is reduced from fixed to default while stiffness reduction from default to 5 default lowers the ice load by 25 5 overall fig 18 demonstrates that the mooring stiffness influence on the ice impact load is relatively minor the results suggest that for a given managed ice characteristics there exists a mooring stiffness that will maximize ice load which should be avoided in design on the other hand considerable mooring stiffness reduction alleviates only a small portion of the ice load and is unfeasible for drilling or other critical operations in a broader context fig 18 suggests that including the floater motion in an ice structure interaction analysis do not alter the computed ice load significantly in practice this implies that the dynamic mooring floater analysis may be conducted separately using specialized tools by taking the dem ice load with fixed structure assumption as input the change in the mooring stiffness undoubtedly influences the global mooring load however the influence seemingly depends on the ice load dynamics as well the ice concentration of c 50 have previously demonstrated the tendency to trigger dynamic amplification which explains the 36 increase in the global mooring load as the mooring stiffness changes from fixed to default see fig 18a on the contrary further stiffness reduction from default to 5 default alters the dynamic properties of the floater relative to that of the ice load which ultimately results in 48 reduction of the global mooring load the same reasoning explains the trend under c 90 fig 18b except that the corresponding ice load do not have a tendency to induce dynamic amplifications 5 summary and conclusions this paper proposes an efficient 2d discrete element approach as a tool to assess managed ice load on moored floating platforms the discrete element framework adheres to the soft particle principle yet with modifications to facilitate non disk elements in the proposed tool the ice floes are arbitrarily shaped polygons created using the voronoi tessellation algorithm which enables direct control over the ice concentration and the average floe size the floating platform is represented using a polygon that possesses the platform s waterline geometry mass and mass moment of inertia meanwhile the individual mooring line is a spring that follows a tension offset relationship generated using a specialized mooring analysis package this paper validates the discrete element simulation against relevant experiments and field measurements and subsequently demonstrates the application through a case study on a hypothetical floating platform based on the kulluk the results presented throughout the paper support the following conclusions 1 the elastic modulus assigned to the particles discrete elements is critical to the estimated impact force the comparison against the isolated ice floe impact database timco 2011 verifies that the most suitable elastic modulus for the current formulation is 1 mpa despite being several orders lower than the actual sea ice modulus 2 6 gpa the chosen modulus yielded the best agreement with the average of the impact database the seemingly unphysical modulus is likely a consequence of the soft particle principle where the particle particle overlap is a crude estimation of the actual deformation 2 the 2d discrete element framework simulates a reasonably accurate ice action under a certain condition i e when the ice concentration throughout the simulation remains sufficiently low the validation against the iceberg towing model test reveals that agreement is achieved only when the initial ice concentration is 40 meanwhile for the 71 and 86 initial concentrations the discrete element analysis underestimates the measured ice load significantly the underestimation occurs since the 2d framework is incapable of simulating the three dimensional ice buildup that tends to occur in high initial concentration or under confined environment e g a narrow ice basin based on the currently available results the validity of the 2d formulation is verified up to the initial ice concentration of c 40 with a relative domain width of ψ 8 0 3 the case study on the hypothetical floater presents the effect of managed ice characteristics on the ice load as well as the mooring load the overall results demonstrate that the mooring load follows the same trend as the ice load however depending on the dynamics of the ice load relative to that of the mooring system the mooring load may exceed the ice action as a result of dynamic amplification the global load refers to both the ice and the mooring load increases in an approximately exponential trend with respect to the initial ice concentration with respect to the other ice characteristics namely ice thickness floe size and ice drift velocity the global load indicates a roughly linear trend over the examined parameters among all ice characteristics the global load is the least sensitive to the average floe size 4 in addition the case study shows that the structural compliance offered by the mooring system leads to relatively insignificant variations in the ice load the ice load slightly increases as the mooring stiffness shifts from infinite fixed to the default value assumed in the case study in contrast an additional stiffness reduction from default to 5 default lowers the ice load by relatively small margin the observed trend suggests that the ice load reaches a maximum under a certain mooring stiffness which should be avoided in design acknowledgement the authors thank the national research foundation keppel corporation and national university of singapore r 261 507 010 281 for supporting

22464,the effect of two symmetrically distributed fin shaped strips on hydrodynamic forces and flow structures of a circular cylinder is numerically investigated at low reynolds numbers of 60 180 the angular position θ defined as the angle between the starting point of the strips and the front stagnation point of the cylinder is varied from 30 to 90 it is observed that the boundary layer separation is tripped by the strips altering the pressure distribution and forming a recirculation region behind the strips as a result the drag and lift coefficients are increased significantly at θ 30 and 40 the boundary layer reattaches on the cylinder surface after the first separation from the strip tip followed by the second separation however when θ is larger than 50 the separation point is fixed at the sharp corner of the strips compared to θ 40 and θ 70 shorter wake formation length and larger wake width are observed at θ 50 60 resulting in the larger drag force and faster vortex shedding the strips placed at θ 40 70 have more contribution to the alteration of flow structure than those positioned at θ 30 or 80 90 at re 180 placing the fin shaped strips at 60 maximally increases the lift and drag coefficients by 40 03 and 16 98 respectively in comparison with the bare cylinder keywords fin shaped strips placement angle hydrodynamic coefficient flow structure vortex shedding 1 introduction the unsteady viscous fluid flow past a circular cylinder has long been a topic of interest in the fields of fluid mechanics and fluid structure interaction due to its fundamental and practical significance both experimental measurements and numerical simulations have confirmed that the instability of the flow wake behind a circular cylinder occurs when reynolds number re ud ν where u is the free stream velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity is higher than 47 henderson 1997 the vortex shedding identified by definite frequencies leads to time dependent drag and lift forces acting on circular cylinders consequently vibration known as vortex induced vibration viv is induced over a range of re which is termed as the lock on region or the synchronization region as viv influences the stability and shortens the structure life it is usually treated as a destructive phenomenon in the past decades a variety of methods have been proposed to suppress viv actively and passively zdravkovich 1981 rashidi et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 zhu and yao 2015 zhu et al 2015 2017 instead of viv suppression the vibration energy of cylinders can be converted to electrical energy the first vibration energy harvester based on the concept of viv was proposed by bernitsas et al 2008 which was termed as a vivace vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy converter that can be used in flow speed as slow as 0 4 m s lee and bernitsas 2011 after that bernitsas and his group ding et al 2016 kinaci et al 2016 park et al 2013 improved the performance by symmetrically attaching a pair of rough strips on the windward surface of a circular cylinder as passive turbulence controls ptc it was observed that the vibration amplitude was significantly increased which is beneficial for energy harvesting chang et al 2011 investigated the effects of the location surface coverage and size of rectangular strips on the response amplitude at high reynolds numbers both the suppression and amplification of vibration were observed via changing the location of strips in our recent numerical study zhu et al 2018a it was found the response amplitude was sensitive to the geometry and the placement angle of strips at reynolds number of 30 480 304800 a significant vibration enhancement was achieved by placing rectangular strips at angular position of 20 60 the similar method of tripping boundary layer is achieved by attaching wires or rods on the cylinder surface as protrusions alam et al 2003 experimentally investigated the effects of tripping rods on flow characteristics and fluid forces acting on a circular cylinder at a reynolds number of 5 5 104 it was found that a stronger vortex was created behind the cylinder when the rods were placed at 45 60 while the fluid forces were reduced at the angular position of 30 the suppression of vortex shedding was further confirmed in their later experiments with tripwires placed at the same angular position alam et al 2016 kim et al 2018 experimentally studied the vibration of an elastically supported circular cylinder with a control rod installed in its wake they reported that the vibration response was highly sensitive to the rod position and galloping was generated by placing the rod at x c 0 4d and y c 0 0 4d or x c 0 4 0 8d and y c 0 4d x c and y c are the streamwise and lateral distances measured from the rear stagnation point respectively quadrante and nishi 2014 also verified the importance of the control wires position the hydrodynamic forces were diminished when tripping wires were placed at angular position ranging from 20 to 52 5 or greater than 97 5 while the forces were increased with the angular position ranging from 52 5 to 97 5 nevertheless the aforementioned numerical and experimental studies were carried out at higher reynolds numbers of 103 106 although ptc was proved effective in enhancing cylinder vibration the intrinsic links between the flow characteristics and the associated changes in hydrodynamic forces need to be further revealed especially at lower reynolds numbers this knowledge could be important in creating new controls for vibration amplification additionally the laminar boundary layer is relatively hard to be altered or tripped due to its larger thickness as compared to a turbulent layer thus to some extent laminar flow can be treated as an extreme condition for test if the boundary layer of a circular cylinder is obviously affected at a sufficiently low reynolds number the alteration would be more vigorous for high re numbers in this work fin shaped strips are proposed with the intent of increasing the hydrodynamic forces and altering the vortex shedding the primary aim is to examine the effects of fin shaped strips on fluid forces flow structure and vortex shedding at low reynolds number range of 60 180 to get further insight into the interaction between fluid and structure under a controlled situation it is expected that numerical simulations at low reynolds numbers can provide detailed flow structures in the boundary layers of the cylinder surface which is difficult to measure experimentally this knowledge is invaluable in explaining the effect of control on the flow structure to this end the flow around a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips is investigated using direct numerical simulation dns the remainder of this paper is organized in the following manner in section 2 the governing equations computational domain and model validation are introduced the hydrodynamic coefficients and strouhal number are discussed in section 3 while the vortex formation and flow structures are analyzed in section 4 finally major conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations and numerical method as the wake transition of a circular cylinder occurs beyond re 180 williamson 1996a 1996b jiang et al 2016 the two dimensional 2d simulation was applied in capturing the 2d vortex shedding in this work in 2d simulation the cylinder is seemed as a rigid body so that the numerical results cannot be directly extrapolated to a flexible cylinder whose ambient flow is more complicated and is not considered in this work however the 2d numerical results could identify the characteristics of flow over an infinite rigid cylinder in this low reynolds number range of 60 180 thus the actual aspect ratio can be determined by the combined parameters such as the flow velocity the required power density and the array configuration as reported in previous literature zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2018a 2018b the dns were carried out with the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd solver openfoam the unsteady incompressible navier stokes ns equations including the continuity and momentum equations expressed as follows were directly solved 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j where x i is the cartesian coordinate in i direction u i is the velocity component in the direction x i t is the flow time p is the pressure ρ is the density of fluid and ν is the kinematic viscosity finite volume method fvm was employed to discretize eqs 1 and 2 the pressure velocity coupling was solved with the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm jiang et al 2016 the spatial discretization of the convective term and diffusion term were performed by the fourth order cubic scheme and second order linear scheme respectively the time derivative term was discretized using a blended scheme consisting of the second order crank nicolson scheme and a first order euler implicit scheme jiang et al 2017 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions a rectangle computational domain of 50d in the streamwise direction 40d in the transverse direction as shown in fig 1 is adopted for 2d dns the domain size is determined based on the 2d domain size dependence study for a circular cylinder conducted by jiang et al 2016 the distance between the upstream boundary and the center of the circular cylinder the original point is 20d the two lateral boundaries are also 20d away from the cylinder center so that the blockage ratio is around 2 5 as depicted in fig 1 the circular cylinder is symmetrically attached by a pair of fin shaped strips apart from the arc surface covering part of the circular cylinder the fin shaped strip is enclosed by a cambered surface and the subsequent plane perpendicular to the cylinder surface each strip facing the incoming flow covers 30 surface on each side of the cylinder and the radius of the cambered surface is r d 3 resulting in the maximum thickness of δ d 0 062 for each strip the location of strips is defined by the placement angle θ which is measured from the forward stagnation point to the upstream edge of the cambered surface it is worth noting that the projected width d p of the equipped cylinder perpendicular to the incoming flow varies with the location of strips the maximum projected width d p 1 124d occurs at θ 60 while the projected width equals to the cylinder diameter at θ 30 and θ 90 at the inlet boundary a uniform flow with velocity of u is specified in the x direction at the outlet a zero normal gradient condition and a reference value of zero are applied for the velocity and the pressure respectively the slip wall boundary condition u y 0 and v 0 is applied at the two lateral boundaries a non slip boundary condition is applied on the surface of the cylinder and the strips 2 3 computational mesh as shown in fig 1 an enlarged concentric circle around the cylinder is employed to create an o xy grid system near the cylinder while the rest regions are tessellated with rectangular grids the perimeter of the cylinder is equally discretized with 218 nodes the radial size of the first layer of mesh next to the cylinder is 0 002d meeting the requirement of y 0 25 the cell expansion ratio in the whole domain is kept below 1 05 a grid independence test was undertaken first four different grids for the cylinder with 60 fin shaped strips at re 180 were checked table 1 summarized the test results illustrating the dependence of the time averaged drag coefficient c d the root mean square lift coefficient c lrms and the strouhal number st on the grid size the drag and lift coefficients are computed from the surface distribution of pressure and shear stress obviously the hydrodynamic coefficients and the strouhal number st converge at m3 the differences between m3 and m4 is within 0 2 demonstrating that further increase of mesh resolution has negligible effect on the results therefore the grid size of m3 was chosen in simulation the non dimensional time step u δt d is kept below 0 0005 as a result the courant number at such mesh resolution and time step is less than 0 2 in the whole domain 2 4 model validation the numerical model used in this study was validated with the simulation results of flow past a bare circular cylinder over a re range of 60 180 the predicted time mean drag coefficient base pressure coefficient and strouhal number of lift coefficient are shown in fig 2 together with the experimental and numerical results reported previously the base pressure coefficient is defined as 3 c p b p b p ρ u 2 2 where p b is the time averaged pressure at the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and p is the reference pressure at the inlet it is seen from fig 2 that the drag coefficient c d decreases sharply as re increases from 60 to 120 then remains a relatively stable value as re further increases to 180 it agrees well with the numerical results reported by henderson 1995 the difference between the present results and that of rajani et al 2009 is within 1 8 as the reynolds number is between the onset of vortex shedding re 47 and the onset of three dimensionality re 188 5 1 the absolute value of the base pressure coefficient increases gradually which is consistent with the reported numerical results henderson 1995 barkley and henderson 1996 rajani et al 2009 and the experimental data williamson and roshko 1990 the predicted st re relationship showing an increase with growth rate gradually reduced in the considered re range is also in good agreement with the experimental and numerical results in previous literature williamson and roshko 1990 henderson 1995 barkley and henderson 1996 rajani et al 2009 3 hydrodynamic coefficients and strouhal number 3 1 drag and lift coefficients fig 3 shows the temporal evolution of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the equipped cylinder at re 160 compared to the bare cylinder in all the considered cases the drag and lift coefficients attain a stable fluctuation at t 100 t is the dimensionless time defined as t tu d indicating the flow reaches a periodic but statistically stable state it is clearly seen that both the drag and lift forces increase when a pair of fin shaped strips are placed in the considered placement angles at angular position of θ 40 80 the larger hydrodynamic coefficients may be attributed to the increased projected width d p facing the incoming flow the larger the projected width the more obvious increase in the drag and lift coefficients nevertheless there is a slight increase of hydrodynamic coefficients at θ 30 and 90 whose projected width is not changed this result indicates that the flow around the cylinder is influenced by the strips which will be discussed in section 4 the dependence of hydrodynamic coefficients on re at different placement angles is shown in fig 4 the time averaged drag coefficient c d at θ 30 and 90 reveal the same trend as the bare cylinder i e a rapid reduction occurring over 60 re 120 followed by a relatively stable value over 120 re 180 the c d re curves of these three cases bare cylinder θ 30 and θ 90 are almost parallel with the largest magnitude at θ 30 followed by that at θ 90 as the projected width at θ 30 and 90 is the same as the bare cylinder it further demonstrates that the drag coefficient could be increased without increasing the projected width which was also observed by quadrante and nishi 2014 in their experimental study on the vibration amplification of a circular cylinder by attaching tripping wires moreover compared to θ 90 where the strips cover the cylinder surface from 90 to 120 placing strips at θ 30 with the cylinder surface 30 60 covered has more distinct influence on the drag force when the strips are located between 40 and 80 beyond the turning point on the c d re curve c d increases gradually instead of keeping a stable value it indicates that with increasing reynolds number the growth of pressure drag is larger than the drop in shear stress in this re range henderson 1997 the maximum growth rate appears at θ 60 followed θ 50 but the drag coefficients of the two cases are very close when re 140 at re 180 c d of the cylinder with strips attached at θ 50 and 60 reaches the maximum value of 1 566 which is 16 98 larger than that of bare cylinder followed by θ 70 and θ 40 and then θ 80 the cylinder with 60 strips has the maximum projected width d p 1 124d resulting in the maximum pressure difference and hence the maximum drag the cylinder with 50 strips has the same projected width as θ 70 d p 50 d p 70 and similarly d p 40 d p 80 however the drag coefficient at θ 50 is larger than that at θ 70 and the drag coefficient at θ 40 is larger than that at θ 80 as the coverage angle of each strip is 30 the sharp corner appears at 90 for the 60 strips 60 30 90 thus the sharp corners of 40 strips and 50 strips locate at the forward surface of the circular cylinder while the corners of 70 strips and 80 strips appear at the rear surface it illustrates that the location of sharp corner has a significant impact on the drag force which coincides well with the observation of rectangular strips in zhu et al 2018a as shown in fig 4 the root mean square rms lift coefficient increases gradually with re compared to the bare cylinder the growth rate becomes larger after the cylinder is attached with fin shaped strips similar to the drag coefficient the maximum growth rate occurs at θ 50 and 60 followed by θ 70 40 80 30 and 90 in sequence for 60 strips at re 180 the lift coefficient is increased by 40 03 as compared to the bare cylinder even for 90 strips there is an increase of 4 1 in the lift force therefore at re 180 placing the fin shaped strips at 60 maximally increases the lift and drag coefficients by 40 03 and 16 98 respectively in contrast quadrante and nishi 2014 reported that positioning tripping wires at 75 achieved the maximum increases of lift and drag coefficients by 63 and 44 respectively it is noted that the diameter of the control wires is 0 12d about twice the maximum thickness of the employed strips in this work additionally their experiments were carried out at higher reynolds number of 3 45 103 2 04 104 thus although the increases of hydrodynamic forces are relatively low the performance could be improved by thickening the strips and it has a great potential at higher re as the hydrodynamic coefficients keep growing with increasing of re fig 5 depicts the lissajous figure of the lift coefficient with the drag coefficient which was usually used to infer the motion trajectory of the structure sahin and owens 2004 wu and shu 2011 wu et al 2014 figure eight trajectories are clearly observed but they are not symmetric with respect to the y axis indicating an existence of phase angle between the hydrodynamic coefficients along the two directions as the frequency ratio of drag coefficient to lift coefficient is 2 1 the phase angle is in range of π 8 π 4 the minimum phase angle occurs at 60 strips which is favorable to the vibration response vandiver et al 2009 as re increases the growth of c d is faster than c l so that the figure eight becomes more asymmetric fig 5b the phase angle is nearly increased to π 4 at re 180 overall both the drag and lift forces attain the greatest promotion by attaching a pair of fin shaped strips to the cylinder surface at placement angle of 60 followed closely by the 50 strips these results provide a reference to enhance the flow induced vibration and thereby the improvement of energy harvesting 3 2 pressure coefficient fig 6 shows the variation of the time mean pressure coefficient the position angle along the cylinder surface is measured from the front stagnation point i e β 180 represents the rear stagnation point it is clearly seen that the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface is altered by the introduction of fin shaped strips it is embodied in three aspects the occurrence of the minimum pressure the pressure recovery behind the strips and the turning point of c p β curve in the downstream of sharp corners for the bare cylinder the minimum pressure appears around β 86 at re 60 corresponding to the maximum velocity close to the cylinder surface and it moves forward slightly to β 82 as re increases to 180 it is related to the shift of boundary layer separation point which moves upstream with increasing reynolds number braza et al 1986 rajani et al 2009 by placing the strips the occurrence of the pressure trough is affected when θ is smaller than 70 the minimum pressure occurs at the sharp corners of strips indicating that the boundary layer develops along the arc surface of strips and reaches the maximum velocity at the corners nevertheless when the placement angle is increased to 80 the occurrence of the minimum pressure shifts back to 83 and there is another turning point presenting at the sharp corners with a relatively large pressure value at θ 90 the pressure trough occurs at the same location as the bare cylinder and the transition of pressure at the sharp corners becomes smooth compared to the bare cylinder the pressure recovery rate becomes faster after the pressure valley especially for 30 strips as the placement angle increases from 30 to 80 this recovery rate is gradually reduced to the same level as the bare cylinder the main reason is the pressure drop generated by the strips is weakened as strips move back it indicates that the strips trip the boundary layer and hence alter the flow structure at the backward facing step while the change is decreased with the increase of the angular position it is noted from fig 6 that the c p β curve has an obvious turning point after the rapid recovery of pressure for the cylinder with 30 strips this turning point is also observed from the curves of 40 strips except re 180 it is mainly attributed to the reattachment of boundary layer which will be discussed later fig 7 shows the dependence of the base pressure on reynolds number these results reveal the same trend as those of lift coefficient fig 4b the minimal base pressure occurs at θ 60 c p 1 2318 at re 180 followed by θ 50 c p 1 2305 at re 180 the low base pressure explains the large time mean drag as shown in fig 4 additionally as compared to the bare cylinder the reduction of base pressure is accelerated after a critical re 80 for 50 and 60 strips illustrated by a steeper slope of the curves henderson 1995 1997 pointed out that the decrease in shear stress of the bare cylinder is almost equal to the increase in pressure drag so that the c d re curve is relatively flat in 120 re 180 fig 2a as the reduction of base pressure becomes larger the pressure drag acting on the cylinder with 60 and 50 strips is increased more than the decrease of shear stress resulting in the increase in the mean drag coefficient similarly the trend of c p explains the variation of c d in other cases 3 3 strouhal number the time history of lift coefficients is analyzed by fft fast fourier transform algorithm and the peak frequency of the spectrum is defined as the strouhal number st f s d p u where f s is the peak frequency of the spectrum and d p is the projected width fig 8 plots the spectra of the lift coefficient for the cylinder with strips located at different angles at re 160 for the bare cylinder the strouhal frequency is 0 186 consisting well with the value in previous literature when the cylinder is attached with fin shaped strips the st is increased but the growth varies with the placement angle the largest st occurs at θ 60 indicating the fastest vortex shedding followed by the cylinder with 50 strips with f 0 218 it illustrates that the strips placed at θ 60 and 50 not only achieve the largest fluid forces but also gain the highest shedding frequency which are favorable to energy harvesting a small peak at 3f represents the third harmonic of st which becomes more obvious as the strips move from 30 to 60 and reaches the largest one at θ 60 the emergence of the third harmonic is associated with the recirculation region formed behind the strips and the alternating shear layer reattachment younis et al 2016 yao and jaiman 2017 fig 9 compares the st re relationship for the cylinder with strips at different placement angles for each case the shedding frequency increases smoothly with reynolds number indicating the installation of fin shaped strips does not change the growth trend of st for the two dimensional time periodic flow in this re range the magnitude of st at θ 30 is relatively small as the shear layers are tripped by the strips and retarded due to the reattachment the small st presenting at θ 90 is because the boundary layer separation point moves backward to the sharp corner of strips 120 conversely the forward transfer of boundary layer separation point leads to the large st at θ 50 and θ 60 4 vortex formation and flow structures 4 1 vortex formation the time averaged flow field is analyzed to quantify the vortex formation the formation length of vortex l f and the separation point of boundary layer are obtained from the contour line of u 0 as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 the wake width d is defined by the largest vertical distance between the positive and negative vorticity peaks jiang and cheng 2017 because the vorticity field directly reveals the vertical extend for the vortices to be rolled up to trigger vortex shedding fig 10 where the normalized vorticity ω is defined as 4 ω v x u y d p u as compared in fig 10 the formation length and wake width of a bare cylinder are consistent with the simulation results in jiang and cheng 2017 and the boundary layer separation point agrees with the numerical results in braza et al 1986 and rajani et al 2009 fig 11 depicts the contour line of u 0 for the time averaged flow around the cylinder with fin shaped strips it is worth noting that the contour line behind the 30 strips is separated by the cylinder surface indicating the reattachment of boundary layer the same phenomenon is observed for the cylinder with 40 strips and the cylinder with 50 strips at small reynolds numbers due to the reattachment the boundary layer separation occurs twice the first one at the sharp corner of strips and the second one at the cylinder surface behind the strips in contrast when the placement angle is larger than 60 the separation occurs at the tips of strips although the reynolds number is as small as 60 since the size of the recirculation bubble behind the cylinder is determined by the secondary separation the separation point after reattachment is used to determine the separation position α in fig 12 a it is clearly seen that the separation point shifts forward i e reducing α when the cylinder is attached with 30 strips though the boundary layer reattaches the cylinder surface after the tripping of strips consequently the formation length is reduced and the wake width is increased as illustrated in fig 12 b and fig 12 c and hence the reduction of base pressure and the increase of drag force fig 4 similarly the separation point of the cylinder with 40 strips moves forward except at re 180 where the secondary separation disappears for the cylinder with 50 strips the secondary separation occurs at re 60 and re 80 and disappears at higher reynolds numbers for other cases the separation point is locked on the sharp corners of strips compared to θ 70 the separation points occurring at the tips of 50 and 60 strips locate forwardly resulting in the shortest formation length and the widest wake width and thereby the largest drag force for the cylinders with 70 strips and 80 strips the boundary layer separation occurs earlier than that of the bare cylinder fig 11a so that the wake width is wider noted that the separation point of the cylinder with 90 strips appears later than the bare cylinder nevertheless due to the outward push of shear layer by the strips the wake width is still larger than the bare cylinder additionally as shown in fig 12 an increase in reynolds number leads to the reduction in the formation length and wake width explaining the reduction of base pressure and the increase of vortex shedding frequency 4 2 flow structure fig 13 displays the contours of the rms values of the streamwise velocity u rms u rms u for different placement angles at re 160 there are two peaks of u rms symmetrically distributed about y d 0 indicating the roll up positions of the shear layers on both sides the lateral separation between the two peaks becomes wider after the cylinder is attached with fin shaped strips the widest lateral separation occurs at 60 and 50 strips followed by 70 and 40 strips then 80 strips and then 30 and 90 strips consisting well with the trend of wake width thus this lateral separation is sometimes defined as the wake width for analysis in previous literature alam et al 2018 younis et al 2016 the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peaks follows the trend of formation length i e the shortest distance presents at 60 strips while a large wake width corresponds to a large c d and c lrms the formation length is inversely linked to these quantities alam et al 2011 wang et al 2018 the maximum u rms increases with the increase of placement angle from 30 to 50 but declines with further increasing from 60 to 90 as a result the rolling of shear layers grows strongly with the introduction of 50 or 60 strips indicating more disturbance energy unlike u rms the contours of the lateral velocity v rms v rms u only exhibit one peak on the wake centerline as shown in fig 14 nevertheless the streamwise position of the peak v rms moves forward and the magnitude of the peak v rms grows correspondingly as θ increases from 30 to 60 the same trend as the peak of u rms as θ further increases from 60 to 90 the position of the peak of v rms retreats along with the reduction of magnitude this trend explains the variation of lift force younis et al 2016 fig 15 shows the time averaged reynolds shear stresses u v u 2 for the cylinder with fin shaped strips attached at different positions the two large peaks symmetrically located on each side of y d 0 arise from the roll up of shear layers while the two small peaks correspond to the reattachment of shear layers on the cylinder leeward surface the magnitude of peak reynolds shear stress increases albeit slightly as the strips move from 30 to 60 it indicates that the momentum transport by the fluctuating velocity component is enhanced additionally the position of the peaks moves closer to the cylinder base illustrating the reduction of formation length when the placement angle is beyond 60 both the magnitude and position of the shear stress vary along the opposite direction it is noted that another two tiny peaks occur near the cylinder base at θ 40 80 and the peaks are most apparent at θ 60 these peaks are caused by the recirculation region formed behind the strips which adheres to the cylinder surface in order to further examine the separation of boundary layer fig 16 shows the enlargement of the streamlines around the cylinder it can be seen that at θ 30 and 40 the flow separates from the corner of strips forming a recirculation region behind the strips the separated flow reattaches on the cylinder surface and then separates again from the cylinder surface this phenomenon was also observed by alam et al 2003 in the experiments of flow past a pair of tripping rods positioned symmetrically in the windward surface of a circular cylinder compared to the 30 strips the recirculation region at θ 40 elongates and the reattachment length dwindles resulting in a relatively early separation and thereby a wider wake width and a larger c d at θ 50 the recirculation region integrates into the wake flow with the absence of reattachment leading to fixed separation point at the corner of strips the instantaneous vorticity contours for different placement angles at re 160 are compared in fig 17 all the considered cases display the typical 2 s two vortices are shed per cycle the upper vortex clockwise and the lower one counterclockwise shedding mode indicating that the disturbance of the strips on vortex shedding is limited in low reynolds number nevertheless the streamwise and lateral distances between two adjacent vortices vary with the placement angle of strips as θ increases from 30 to 60 the streamwise distance reduces whereas the lateral gap grows in consistent with the increase of shedding frequency the opposite trend occurring in 60 θ 90 also illustrates the reduction in st 5 conclusions a two dimensional direct numerical simulation is conducted on flow around a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips symmetrically located on its surface at re of 60 180 the major findings are as follows 1 both the drag and lift coefficients are increased after the installation of strips the larger the projected width the higher the growth rate in fluid forces nevertheless due to the tripping strips the hydrodynamic forces rise slightly at θ 30 and θ 90 though their projected widths are the same as the bare cylinder the maximum increases in the drag and lift achieved by the 60 strips are about 16 98 and 40 03 larger than that of a bare cylinder respectively and the phase angle between the two hydrodynamic coefficients attains the minimal value 2 the fin shaped strips trip the boundary layer and alter the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface a recirculation region is formed behind the strips moreover this region at θ 30 and 40 is separated by the reattached boundary layer flow from the flow wake leading to an obvious turning point after the pressure recovery when the strips are placed at 40 80 the reduction of base pressure becomes larger as re increases and hence the uplift in drag force the minimal base pressure occurs at θ 60 resulting in the maximal drag 3 flow separation is locked on the sharp corner of strips for θ 50 the separation points at the corners of 50 and 60 strips locate forwardly resulting in the shorter formation length and the wider wake width and thereby the larger drag and the faster vortex shedding additionally a third harmonic appears and reaches the peak at θ 60 associated with the recirculation region and alternating shear layer reattachment 4 as the placement angle increases from 30 to 60 the magnitudes of the peaks of streamwise velocity lateral velocity and reynolds shear stress increase and their locations move forward a conversely trend is found as θ further increases from 60 to 90 therefore the magnitude and position of the peak fluctuating velocities explain the variations in formation length and wake width and hence the change in hydrodynamic forces acknowledgements the research work was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51979238

22464,the effect of two symmetrically distributed fin shaped strips on hydrodynamic forces and flow structures of a circular cylinder is numerically investigated at low reynolds numbers of 60 180 the angular position θ defined as the angle between the starting point of the strips and the front stagnation point of the cylinder is varied from 30 to 90 it is observed that the boundary layer separation is tripped by the strips altering the pressure distribution and forming a recirculation region behind the strips as a result the drag and lift coefficients are increased significantly at θ 30 and 40 the boundary layer reattaches on the cylinder surface after the first separation from the strip tip followed by the second separation however when θ is larger than 50 the separation point is fixed at the sharp corner of the strips compared to θ 40 and θ 70 shorter wake formation length and larger wake width are observed at θ 50 60 resulting in the larger drag force and faster vortex shedding the strips placed at θ 40 70 have more contribution to the alteration of flow structure than those positioned at θ 30 or 80 90 at re 180 placing the fin shaped strips at 60 maximally increases the lift and drag coefficients by 40 03 and 16 98 respectively in comparison with the bare cylinder keywords fin shaped strips placement angle hydrodynamic coefficient flow structure vortex shedding 1 introduction the unsteady viscous fluid flow past a circular cylinder has long been a topic of interest in the fields of fluid mechanics and fluid structure interaction due to its fundamental and practical significance both experimental measurements and numerical simulations have confirmed that the instability of the flow wake behind a circular cylinder occurs when reynolds number re ud ν where u is the free stream velocity d is the diameter of the cylinder and ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity is higher than 47 henderson 1997 the vortex shedding identified by definite frequencies leads to time dependent drag and lift forces acting on circular cylinders consequently vibration known as vortex induced vibration viv is induced over a range of re which is termed as the lock on region or the synchronization region as viv influences the stability and shortens the structure life it is usually treated as a destructive phenomenon in the past decades a variety of methods have been proposed to suppress viv actively and passively zdravkovich 1981 rashidi et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 zhu and yao 2015 zhu et al 2015 2017 instead of viv suppression the vibration energy of cylinders can be converted to electrical energy the first vibration energy harvester based on the concept of viv was proposed by bernitsas et al 2008 which was termed as a vivace vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy converter that can be used in flow speed as slow as 0 4 m s lee and bernitsas 2011 after that bernitsas and his group ding et al 2016 kinaci et al 2016 park et al 2013 improved the performance by symmetrically attaching a pair of rough strips on the windward surface of a circular cylinder as passive turbulence controls ptc it was observed that the vibration amplitude was significantly increased which is beneficial for energy harvesting chang et al 2011 investigated the effects of the location surface coverage and size of rectangular strips on the response amplitude at high reynolds numbers both the suppression and amplification of vibration were observed via changing the location of strips in our recent numerical study zhu et al 2018a it was found the response amplitude was sensitive to the geometry and the placement angle of strips at reynolds number of 30 480 304800 a significant vibration enhancement was achieved by placing rectangular strips at angular position of 20 60 the similar method of tripping boundary layer is achieved by attaching wires or rods on the cylinder surface as protrusions alam et al 2003 experimentally investigated the effects of tripping rods on flow characteristics and fluid forces acting on a circular cylinder at a reynolds number of 5 5 104 it was found that a stronger vortex was created behind the cylinder when the rods were placed at 45 60 while the fluid forces were reduced at the angular position of 30 the suppression of vortex shedding was further confirmed in their later experiments with tripwires placed at the same angular position alam et al 2016 kim et al 2018 experimentally studied the vibration of an elastically supported circular cylinder with a control rod installed in its wake they reported that the vibration response was highly sensitive to the rod position and galloping was generated by placing the rod at x c 0 4d and y c 0 0 4d or x c 0 4 0 8d and y c 0 4d x c and y c are the streamwise and lateral distances measured from the rear stagnation point respectively quadrante and nishi 2014 also verified the importance of the control wires position the hydrodynamic forces were diminished when tripping wires were placed at angular position ranging from 20 to 52 5 or greater than 97 5 while the forces were increased with the angular position ranging from 52 5 to 97 5 nevertheless the aforementioned numerical and experimental studies were carried out at higher reynolds numbers of 103 106 although ptc was proved effective in enhancing cylinder vibration the intrinsic links between the flow characteristics and the associated changes in hydrodynamic forces need to be further revealed especially at lower reynolds numbers this knowledge could be important in creating new controls for vibration amplification additionally the laminar boundary layer is relatively hard to be altered or tripped due to its larger thickness as compared to a turbulent layer thus to some extent laminar flow can be treated as an extreme condition for test if the boundary layer of a circular cylinder is obviously affected at a sufficiently low reynolds number the alteration would be more vigorous for high re numbers in this work fin shaped strips are proposed with the intent of increasing the hydrodynamic forces and altering the vortex shedding the primary aim is to examine the effects of fin shaped strips on fluid forces flow structure and vortex shedding at low reynolds number range of 60 180 to get further insight into the interaction between fluid and structure under a controlled situation it is expected that numerical simulations at low reynolds numbers can provide detailed flow structures in the boundary layers of the cylinder surface which is difficult to measure experimentally this knowledge is invaluable in explaining the effect of control on the flow structure to this end the flow around a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips is investigated using direct numerical simulation dns the remainder of this paper is organized in the following manner in section 2 the governing equations computational domain and model validation are introduced the hydrodynamic coefficients and strouhal number are discussed in section 3 while the vortex formation and flow structures are analyzed in section 4 finally major conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations and numerical method as the wake transition of a circular cylinder occurs beyond re 180 williamson 1996a 1996b jiang et al 2016 the two dimensional 2d simulation was applied in capturing the 2d vortex shedding in this work in 2d simulation the cylinder is seemed as a rigid body so that the numerical results cannot be directly extrapolated to a flexible cylinder whose ambient flow is more complicated and is not considered in this work however the 2d numerical results could identify the characteristics of flow over an infinite rigid cylinder in this low reynolds number range of 60 180 thus the actual aspect ratio can be determined by the combined parameters such as the flow velocity the required power density and the array configuration as reported in previous literature zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2018a 2018b the dns were carried out with the open source computational fluid dynamics cfd solver openfoam the unsteady incompressible navier stokes ns equations including the continuity and momentum equations expressed as follows were directly solved 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j where x i is the cartesian coordinate in i direction u i is the velocity component in the direction x i t is the flow time p is the pressure ρ is the density of fluid and ν is the kinematic viscosity finite volume method fvm was employed to discretize eqs 1 and 2 the pressure velocity coupling was solved with the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm jiang et al 2016 the spatial discretization of the convective term and diffusion term were performed by the fourth order cubic scheme and second order linear scheme respectively the time derivative term was discretized using a blended scheme consisting of the second order crank nicolson scheme and a first order euler implicit scheme jiang et al 2017 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions a rectangle computational domain of 50d in the streamwise direction 40d in the transverse direction as shown in fig 1 is adopted for 2d dns the domain size is determined based on the 2d domain size dependence study for a circular cylinder conducted by jiang et al 2016 the distance between the upstream boundary and the center of the circular cylinder the original point is 20d the two lateral boundaries are also 20d away from the cylinder center so that the blockage ratio is around 2 5 as depicted in fig 1 the circular cylinder is symmetrically attached by a pair of fin shaped strips apart from the arc surface covering part of the circular cylinder the fin shaped strip is enclosed by a cambered surface and the subsequent plane perpendicular to the cylinder surface each strip facing the incoming flow covers 30 surface on each side of the cylinder and the radius of the cambered surface is r d 3 resulting in the maximum thickness of δ d 0 062 for each strip the location of strips is defined by the placement angle θ which is measured from the forward stagnation point to the upstream edge of the cambered surface it is worth noting that the projected width d p of the equipped cylinder perpendicular to the incoming flow varies with the location of strips the maximum projected width d p 1 124d occurs at θ 60 while the projected width equals to the cylinder diameter at θ 30 and θ 90 at the inlet boundary a uniform flow with velocity of u is specified in the x direction at the outlet a zero normal gradient condition and a reference value of zero are applied for the velocity and the pressure respectively the slip wall boundary condition u y 0 and v 0 is applied at the two lateral boundaries a non slip boundary condition is applied on the surface of the cylinder and the strips 2 3 computational mesh as shown in fig 1 an enlarged concentric circle around the cylinder is employed to create an o xy grid system near the cylinder while the rest regions are tessellated with rectangular grids the perimeter of the cylinder is equally discretized with 218 nodes the radial size of the first layer of mesh next to the cylinder is 0 002d meeting the requirement of y 0 25 the cell expansion ratio in the whole domain is kept below 1 05 a grid independence test was undertaken first four different grids for the cylinder with 60 fin shaped strips at re 180 were checked table 1 summarized the test results illustrating the dependence of the time averaged drag coefficient c d the root mean square lift coefficient c lrms and the strouhal number st on the grid size the drag and lift coefficients are computed from the surface distribution of pressure and shear stress obviously the hydrodynamic coefficients and the strouhal number st converge at m3 the differences between m3 and m4 is within 0 2 demonstrating that further increase of mesh resolution has negligible effect on the results therefore the grid size of m3 was chosen in simulation the non dimensional time step u δt d is kept below 0 0005 as a result the courant number at such mesh resolution and time step is less than 0 2 in the whole domain 2 4 model validation the numerical model used in this study was validated with the simulation results of flow past a bare circular cylinder over a re range of 60 180 the predicted time mean drag coefficient base pressure coefficient and strouhal number of lift coefficient are shown in fig 2 together with the experimental and numerical results reported previously the base pressure coefficient is defined as 3 c p b p b p ρ u 2 2 where p b is the time averaged pressure at the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and p is the reference pressure at the inlet it is seen from fig 2 that the drag coefficient c d decreases sharply as re increases from 60 to 120 then remains a relatively stable value as re further increases to 180 it agrees well with the numerical results reported by henderson 1995 the difference between the present results and that of rajani et al 2009 is within 1 8 as the reynolds number is between the onset of vortex shedding re 47 and the onset of three dimensionality re 188 5 1 the absolute value of the base pressure coefficient increases gradually which is consistent with the reported numerical results henderson 1995 barkley and henderson 1996 rajani et al 2009 and the experimental data williamson and roshko 1990 the predicted st re relationship showing an increase with growth rate gradually reduced in the considered re range is also in good agreement with the experimental and numerical results in previous literature williamson and roshko 1990 henderson 1995 barkley and henderson 1996 rajani et al 2009 3 hydrodynamic coefficients and strouhal number 3 1 drag and lift coefficients fig 3 shows the temporal evolution of the hydrodynamic coefficients of the equipped cylinder at re 160 compared to the bare cylinder in all the considered cases the drag and lift coefficients attain a stable fluctuation at t 100 t is the dimensionless time defined as t tu d indicating the flow reaches a periodic but statistically stable state it is clearly seen that both the drag and lift forces increase when a pair of fin shaped strips are placed in the considered placement angles at angular position of θ 40 80 the larger hydrodynamic coefficients may be attributed to the increased projected width d p facing the incoming flow the larger the projected width the more obvious increase in the drag and lift coefficients nevertheless there is a slight increase of hydrodynamic coefficients at θ 30 and 90 whose projected width is not changed this result indicates that the flow around the cylinder is influenced by the strips which will be discussed in section 4 the dependence of hydrodynamic coefficients on re at different placement angles is shown in fig 4 the time averaged drag coefficient c d at θ 30 and 90 reveal the same trend as the bare cylinder i e a rapid reduction occurring over 60 re 120 followed by a relatively stable value over 120 re 180 the c d re curves of these three cases bare cylinder θ 30 and θ 90 are almost parallel with the largest magnitude at θ 30 followed by that at θ 90 as the projected width at θ 30 and 90 is the same as the bare cylinder it further demonstrates that the drag coefficient could be increased without increasing the projected width which was also observed by quadrante and nishi 2014 in their experimental study on the vibration amplification of a circular cylinder by attaching tripping wires moreover compared to θ 90 where the strips cover the cylinder surface from 90 to 120 placing strips at θ 30 with the cylinder surface 30 60 covered has more distinct influence on the drag force when the strips are located between 40 and 80 beyond the turning point on the c d re curve c d increases gradually instead of keeping a stable value it indicates that with increasing reynolds number the growth of pressure drag is larger than the drop in shear stress in this re range henderson 1997 the maximum growth rate appears at θ 60 followed θ 50 but the drag coefficients of the two cases are very close when re 140 at re 180 c d of the cylinder with strips attached at θ 50 and 60 reaches the maximum value of 1 566 which is 16 98 larger than that of bare cylinder followed by θ 70 and θ 40 and then θ 80 the cylinder with 60 strips has the maximum projected width d p 1 124d resulting in the maximum pressure difference and hence the maximum drag the cylinder with 50 strips has the same projected width as θ 70 d p 50 d p 70 and similarly d p 40 d p 80 however the drag coefficient at θ 50 is larger than that at θ 70 and the drag coefficient at θ 40 is larger than that at θ 80 as the coverage angle of each strip is 30 the sharp corner appears at 90 for the 60 strips 60 30 90 thus the sharp corners of 40 strips and 50 strips locate at the forward surface of the circular cylinder while the corners of 70 strips and 80 strips appear at the rear surface it illustrates that the location of sharp corner has a significant impact on the drag force which coincides well with the observation of rectangular strips in zhu et al 2018a as shown in fig 4 the root mean square rms lift coefficient increases gradually with re compared to the bare cylinder the growth rate becomes larger after the cylinder is attached with fin shaped strips similar to the drag coefficient the maximum growth rate occurs at θ 50 and 60 followed by θ 70 40 80 30 and 90 in sequence for 60 strips at re 180 the lift coefficient is increased by 40 03 as compared to the bare cylinder even for 90 strips there is an increase of 4 1 in the lift force therefore at re 180 placing the fin shaped strips at 60 maximally increases the lift and drag coefficients by 40 03 and 16 98 respectively in contrast quadrante and nishi 2014 reported that positioning tripping wires at 75 achieved the maximum increases of lift and drag coefficients by 63 and 44 respectively it is noted that the diameter of the control wires is 0 12d about twice the maximum thickness of the employed strips in this work additionally their experiments were carried out at higher reynolds number of 3 45 103 2 04 104 thus although the increases of hydrodynamic forces are relatively low the performance could be improved by thickening the strips and it has a great potential at higher re as the hydrodynamic coefficients keep growing with increasing of re fig 5 depicts the lissajous figure of the lift coefficient with the drag coefficient which was usually used to infer the motion trajectory of the structure sahin and owens 2004 wu and shu 2011 wu et al 2014 figure eight trajectories are clearly observed but they are not symmetric with respect to the y axis indicating an existence of phase angle between the hydrodynamic coefficients along the two directions as the frequency ratio of drag coefficient to lift coefficient is 2 1 the phase angle is in range of π 8 π 4 the minimum phase angle occurs at 60 strips which is favorable to the vibration response vandiver et al 2009 as re increases the growth of c d is faster than c l so that the figure eight becomes more asymmetric fig 5b the phase angle is nearly increased to π 4 at re 180 overall both the drag and lift forces attain the greatest promotion by attaching a pair of fin shaped strips to the cylinder surface at placement angle of 60 followed closely by the 50 strips these results provide a reference to enhance the flow induced vibration and thereby the improvement of energy harvesting 3 2 pressure coefficient fig 6 shows the variation of the time mean pressure coefficient the position angle along the cylinder surface is measured from the front stagnation point i e β 180 represents the rear stagnation point it is clearly seen that the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface is altered by the introduction of fin shaped strips it is embodied in three aspects the occurrence of the minimum pressure the pressure recovery behind the strips and the turning point of c p β curve in the downstream of sharp corners for the bare cylinder the minimum pressure appears around β 86 at re 60 corresponding to the maximum velocity close to the cylinder surface and it moves forward slightly to β 82 as re increases to 180 it is related to the shift of boundary layer separation point which moves upstream with increasing reynolds number braza et al 1986 rajani et al 2009 by placing the strips the occurrence of the pressure trough is affected when θ is smaller than 70 the minimum pressure occurs at the sharp corners of strips indicating that the boundary layer develops along the arc surface of strips and reaches the maximum velocity at the corners nevertheless when the placement angle is increased to 80 the occurrence of the minimum pressure shifts back to 83 and there is another turning point presenting at the sharp corners with a relatively large pressure value at θ 90 the pressure trough occurs at the same location as the bare cylinder and the transition of pressure at the sharp corners becomes smooth compared to the bare cylinder the pressure recovery rate becomes faster after the pressure valley especially for 30 strips as the placement angle increases from 30 to 80 this recovery rate is gradually reduced to the same level as the bare cylinder the main reason is the pressure drop generated by the strips is weakened as strips move back it indicates that the strips trip the boundary layer and hence alter the flow structure at the backward facing step while the change is decreased with the increase of the angular position it is noted from fig 6 that the c p β curve has an obvious turning point after the rapid recovery of pressure for the cylinder with 30 strips this turning point is also observed from the curves of 40 strips except re 180 it is mainly attributed to the reattachment of boundary layer which will be discussed later fig 7 shows the dependence of the base pressure on reynolds number these results reveal the same trend as those of lift coefficient fig 4b the minimal base pressure occurs at θ 60 c p 1 2318 at re 180 followed by θ 50 c p 1 2305 at re 180 the low base pressure explains the large time mean drag as shown in fig 4 additionally as compared to the bare cylinder the reduction of base pressure is accelerated after a critical re 80 for 50 and 60 strips illustrated by a steeper slope of the curves henderson 1995 1997 pointed out that the decrease in shear stress of the bare cylinder is almost equal to the increase in pressure drag so that the c d re curve is relatively flat in 120 re 180 fig 2a as the reduction of base pressure becomes larger the pressure drag acting on the cylinder with 60 and 50 strips is increased more than the decrease of shear stress resulting in the increase in the mean drag coefficient similarly the trend of c p explains the variation of c d in other cases 3 3 strouhal number the time history of lift coefficients is analyzed by fft fast fourier transform algorithm and the peak frequency of the spectrum is defined as the strouhal number st f s d p u where f s is the peak frequency of the spectrum and d p is the projected width fig 8 plots the spectra of the lift coefficient for the cylinder with strips located at different angles at re 160 for the bare cylinder the strouhal frequency is 0 186 consisting well with the value in previous literature when the cylinder is attached with fin shaped strips the st is increased but the growth varies with the placement angle the largest st occurs at θ 60 indicating the fastest vortex shedding followed by the cylinder with 50 strips with f 0 218 it illustrates that the strips placed at θ 60 and 50 not only achieve the largest fluid forces but also gain the highest shedding frequency which are favorable to energy harvesting a small peak at 3f represents the third harmonic of st which becomes more obvious as the strips move from 30 to 60 and reaches the largest one at θ 60 the emergence of the third harmonic is associated with the recirculation region formed behind the strips and the alternating shear layer reattachment younis et al 2016 yao and jaiman 2017 fig 9 compares the st re relationship for the cylinder with strips at different placement angles for each case the shedding frequency increases smoothly with reynolds number indicating the installation of fin shaped strips does not change the growth trend of st for the two dimensional time periodic flow in this re range the magnitude of st at θ 30 is relatively small as the shear layers are tripped by the strips and retarded due to the reattachment the small st presenting at θ 90 is because the boundary layer separation point moves backward to the sharp corner of strips 120 conversely the forward transfer of boundary layer separation point leads to the large st at θ 50 and θ 60 4 vortex formation and flow structures 4 1 vortex formation the time averaged flow field is analyzed to quantify the vortex formation the formation length of vortex l f and the separation point of boundary layer are obtained from the contour line of u 0 as shown in fig 10 and fig 11 the wake width d is defined by the largest vertical distance between the positive and negative vorticity peaks jiang and cheng 2017 because the vorticity field directly reveals the vertical extend for the vortices to be rolled up to trigger vortex shedding fig 10 where the normalized vorticity ω is defined as 4 ω v x u y d p u as compared in fig 10 the formation length and wake width of a bare cylinder are consistent with the simulation results in jiang and cheng 2017 and the boundary layer separation point agrees with the numerical results in braza et al 1986 and rajani et al 2009 fig 11 depicts the contour line of u 0 for the time averaged flow around the cylinder with fin shaped strips it is worth noting that the contour line behind the 30 strips is separated by the cylinder surface indicating the reattachment of boundary layer the same phenomenon is observed for the cylinder with 40 strips and the cylinder with 50 strips at small reynolds numbers due to the reattachment the boundary layer separation occurs twice the first one at the sharp corner of strips and the second one at the cylinder surface behind the strips in contrast when the placement angle is larger than 60 the separation occurs at the tips of strips although the reynolds number is as small as 60 since the size of the recirculation bubble behind the cylinder is determined by the secondary separation the separation point after reattachment is used to determine the separation position α in fig 12 a it is clearly seen that the separation point shifts forward i e reducing α when the cylinder is attached with 30 strips though the boundary layer reattaches the cylinder surface after the tripping of strips consequently the formation length is reduced and the wake width is increased as illustrated in fig 12 b and fig 12 c and hence the reduction of base pressure and the increase of drag force fig 4 similarly the separation point of the cylinder with 40 strips moves forward except at re 180 where the secondary separation disappears for the cylinder with 50 strips the secondary separation occurs at re 60 and re 80 and disappears at higher reynolds numbers for other cases the separation point is locked on the sharp corners of strips compared to θ 70 the separation points occurring at the tips of 50 and 60 strips locate forwardly resulting in the shortest formation length and the widest wake width and thereby the largest drag force for the cylinders with 70 strips and 80 strips the boundary layer separation occurs earlier than that of the bare cylinder fig 11a so that the wake width is wider noted that the separation point of the cylinder with 90 strips appears later than the bare cylinder nevertheless due to the outward push of shear layer by the strips the wake width is still larger than the bare cylinder additionally as shown in fig 12 an increase in reynolds number leads to the reduction in the formation length and wake width explaining the reduction of base pressure and the increase of vortex shedding frequency 4 2 flow structure fig 13 displays the contours of the rms values of the streamwise velocity u rms u rms u for different placement angles at re 160 there are two peaks of u rms symmetrically distributed about y d 0 indicating the roll up positions of the shear layers on both sides the lateral separation between the two peaks becomes wider after the cylinder is attached with fin shaped strips the widest lateral separation occurs at 60 and 50 strips followed by 70 and 40 strips then 80 strips and then 30 and 90 strips consisting well with the trend of wake width thus this lateral separation is sometimes defined as the wake width for analysis in previous literature alam et al 2018 younis et al 2016 the streamwise distance from the cylinder center to the peaks follows the trend of formation length i e the shortest distance presents at 60 strips while a large wake width corresponds to a large c d and c lrms the formation length is inversely linked to these quantities alam et al 2011 wang et al 2018 the maximum u rms increases with the increase of placement angle from 30 to 50 but declines with further increasing from 60 to 90 as a result the rolling of shear layers grows strongly with the introduction of 50 or 60 strips indicating more disturbance energy unlike u rms the contours of the lateral velocity v rms v rms u only exhibit one peak on the wake centerline as shown in fig 14 nevertheless the streamwise position of the peak v rms moves forward and the magnitude of the peak v rms grows correspondingly as θ increases from 30 to 60 the same trend as the peak of u rms as θ further increases from 60 to 90 the position of the peak of v rms retreats along with the reduction of magnitude this trend explains the variation of lift force younis et al 2016 fig 15 shows the time averaged reynolds shear stresses u v u 2 for the cylinder with fin shaped strips attached at different positions the two large peaks symmetrically located on each side of y d 0 arise from the roll up of shear layers while the two small peaks correspond to the reattachment of shear layers on the cylinder leeward surface the magnitude of peak reynolds shear stress increases albeit slightly as the strips move from 30 to 60 it indicates that the momentum transport by the fluctuating velocity component is enhanced additionally the position of the peaks moves closer to the cylinder base illustrating the reduction of formation length when the placement angle is beyond 60 both the magnitude and position of the shear stress vary along the opposite direction it is noted that another two tiny peaks occur near the cylinder base at θ 40 80 and the peaks are most apparent at θ 60 these peaks are caused by the recirculation region formed behind the strips which adheres to the cylinder surface in order to further examine the separation of boundary layer fig 16 shows the enlargement of the streamlines around the cylinder it can be seen that at θ 30 and 40 the flow separates from the corner of strips forming a recirculation region behind the strips the separated flow reattaches on the cylinder surface and then separates again from the cylinder surface this phenomenon was also observed by alam et al 2003 in the experiments of flow past a pair of tripping rods positioned symmetrically in the windward surface of a circular cylinder compared to the 30 strips the recirculation region at θ 40 elongates and the reattachment length dwindles resulting in a relatively early separation and thereby a wider wake width and a larger c d at θ 50 the recirculation region integrates into the wake flow with the absence of reattachment leading to fixed separation point at the corner of strips the instantaneous vorticity contours for different placement angles at re 160 are compared in fig 17 all the considered cases display the typical 2 s two vortices are shed per cycle the upper vortex clockwise and the lower one counterclockwise shedding mode indicating that the disturbance of the strips on vortex shedding is limited in low reynolds number nevertheless the streamwise and lateral distances between two adjacent vortices vary with the placement angle of strips as θ increases from 30 to 60 the streamwise distance reduces whereas the lateral gap grows in consistent with the increase of shedding frequency the opposite trend occurring in 60 θ 90 also illustrates the reduction in st 5 conclusions a two dimensional direct numerical simulation is conducted on flow around a circular cylinder with a pair of fin shaped strips symmetrically located on its surface at re of 60 180 the major findings are as follows 1 both the drag and lift coefficients are increased after the installation of strips the larger the projected width the higher the growth rate in fluid forces nevertheless due to the tripping strips the hydrodynamic forces rise slightly at θ 30 and θ 90 though their projected widths are the same as the bare cylinder the maximum increases in the drag and lift achieved by the 60 strips are about 16 98 and 40 03 larger than that of a bare cylinder respectively and the phase angle between the two hydrodynamic coefficients attains the minimal value 2 the fin shaped strips trip the boundary layer and alter the pressure distribution around the cylinder surface a recirculation region is formed behind the strips moreover this region at θ 30 and 40 is separated by the reattached boundary layer flow from the flow wake leading to an obvious turning point after the pressure recovery when the strips are placed at 40 80 the reduction of base pressure becomes larger as re increases and hence the uplift in drag force the minimal base pressure occurs at θ 60 resulting in the maximal drag 3 flow separation is locked on the sharp corner of strips for θ 50 the separation points at the corners of 50 and 60 strips locate forwardly resulting in the shorter formation length and the wider wake width and thereby the larger drag and the faster vortex shedding additionally a third harmonic appears and reaches the peak at θ 60 associated with the recirculation region and alternating shear layer reattachment 4 as the placement angle increases from 30 to 60 the magnitudes of the peaks of streamwise velocity lateral velocity and reynolds shear stress increase and their locations move forward a conversely trend is found as θ further increases from 60 to 90 therefore the magnitude and position of the peak fluctuating velocities explain the variations in formation length and wake width and hence the change in hydrodynamic forces acknowledgements the research work was supported by national natural science foundation of china no 51979238
