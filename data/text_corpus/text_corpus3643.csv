analysis of metagenomic profiles stamp software package parks et al 2014 specifically the abundance profiles otu table produced by qiime and a metadata file containing the descriptive information of each sample including sampling location salinity and temperature were used as inputs the statistical differences in mean proportion of taxa between sample groups were estimated with two sided welch s t test with 95 confidence intervals p value correction was performed using benjamini hochberg false discovery rate bh fdr approach p 0 05 as implemented in stamp searching for potential human pathogens the otu table was searched using a list of potential human pathogens that have been identified in human sewage by metagenome analysis cai and zhang 2013 due to the limitations of sequencing small fragments of the 16s rrna gene the taxonomic information is generally insufficient to identify bacteria to the species level janda et al 2007 we focused on two bacterial genera in this report escherichia shigella is used as an indicator of fecal contamination legionella is used to indicate potential infection risks associated with aerosols since cistern water is more commonly used for showering than as a source of unfiltered drinking water the fraction of legionella and escherichia shigella in each water sample was calculated by counting the number of otus associated with each genus the relative abundance is calculated by the number of otus identified divided by the total otus in each sample other bacterial genera that may include potential human pathogens are presented in the supplementary table s4 factors that may contribute to the occurrence of legionella and escherichia shigella in samples were assessed using pearson s correlation coefficient in r version 3 3 2 input variables include phylogenetic diversity tree index mean temperature and mean salinity of top 1m of coastal water or cistern water and the top four principal coordinates from pcoa detection of enterococcus faecalis loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp was performed following the modified protocol of kanitkar et al 2017 to determine the occurrence of enterococcus faecalis in aliquots of microbial dna extracts from water samples lamp primers previously designed by kato et al 2007 targeting azoa gene of e faecalis were adapted and are summarized in table s5 the lamp reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing 12 5 μl of 1x warmstart lamp master mix new england biolabs ma usa 1 6 m each of primer fip and bip 0 2 m each of primer f3 and b3 0 8 m each of primer lb and lf and 2 μl of dna extract the negative control substituted 2 μl of rnase free water qiagen md usa in the place of a dna sample the mixture was incubated at 65 c for 30 min and then cooled to 4 c for 5 min to terminate the reaction lamp product was visualized by the addition of 1 μl sybr green i 1 10 dilution of 10 000x stock invitrogen waltham ma usa a subset of samples was diluted to assess the presence of amplification inhibitors all diluted samples yielded negative lamp results six replicate lamp reactions were conducted for each water sample to calculate the most probable number mpn of genome concentration based on statistical probability a numerical excel spreadsheet was used for the estimation of mpn value with 95 confidence limits 3 results water quality assessment by microbial diversity and composition comparison of 16s rrna gene sequences from 45 water samples indicated that proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum identified fig s1 this result is not surprising because this phylum is composed of diverse families genera and species that are commonly found in aquatic environments delmont et al 2018 he et al 2017 bacteroidetes were the second most commonly observed phylum in all samples acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes that were commonly found in cistern samples were rare in coastal and runoff waters fig s1 chlamydiae seemed to be unique to cistern and runoff water and gemmatimonadetes were in low abundance but ubiquitous in cistern water cyanobacteria and marinimicrobia were present in all coastal samples but were absent in cistern samples cistern and runoff samples had more unidentified phyla than coastal waters fig s1 within sample phylogenic diversity indices are shown in fig 2 a two sided t tests showed that phylogenetic indices were significantly different between cistern and coastal samples p 10 10 and between coastal and runoff samples p 0 03 however cistern and runoff samples were not significantly different p 0 07 the pcoa plot showed that microbial communities were similar within the same type of samples but were different between sample types fig 2b surface runoff samples were tightly clustered and were distantly related to other samples coastal samples had a greater variability as indicated by the spread along both principal coordinate 1 pc1 and pc2 scales cistern samples were tightly clustered except sample 23nd which had the lowest filtration volume 860 ml highest water temperature 28 2 c and salinity 0 15psu table s2 the distinct microbial community composition in this sample together with physical water quality parameters implied contamination of the cistern by flood waters corroborated by the home owner s description of the storm events statistical comparison of microbial community composition in coastal waters versus those in cistern waters revealed that marinimicrobia acidobacteria proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia were the main phyla that contributed to the observed differences fig 3 a differences in proteobacteria among cistern and runoff samples determined their unique microbial signature fig 3b occurrence of escherichia shigella and legionella escherichia shigella were frequently found in cistern waters with 82 of the samples containing gene sequences matching these genera table 1 thirty percent 30 of the coastal water samples also contained 16s rrna gene sequences that identified as escherichia shigella one of three street surface runoff samples had a match with escherichia shigella gene sequences but all three surface runoff samples were positive for legionella legionella was also detected in 86 of rain cisterns and 10 of coastal waters table 1 the relative abundance of otus identified as escherichia shigella and legionella was plotted by sample types fig 4 the occurrence of these genera as a portion of the total microbial population varied largely among samples ranging from non detect to 0 8 escherichia shigella figs 4a and 1 of legionella fig 4b in a coastal sample the two genera although frequently detected in cistern waters accounted for very small fractions of the total microbial population 0 05 for escherichia shigella 0 4 for legionella the majority of the cistern samples had less than 0 1 of the two genera combined as indicated by the width of the plot at the base fig 4a and b the fractions of these genera were even lower in most of coastal waters with exception of a couple heavily polluted samples from south side of the island see small insert in fig 4a and b results of pearson correlation analysis of water quality parameters phylogenetic diversity pd tree index pcoa coordinates and fractions of escherichia shigella and legionella genera in each sample are shown in fig 5 there was a significant negative correlation between water temperature and salinity at coastal sites since lower salinity waters were found at coastal zones that were heavily influenced by land runoff fig 5a the fraction of legionella detected in coastal samples was found to be negatively correlated with pc3 of the pcoa fig 5a while the fraction of escherichia shigella genus had a positive correlation with pc3 suggesting these two genera may originate from different sources the detection of both genera in coastal samples was negatively correlated with microbial diversity index indicating they were likely found in samples with lower microbial diversity there are no significant correlations between the measured environmental parameters microbial diversity and detection of escherichia shigella and legionella genera in cistern waters fig 5b this suggests additional factors that were not measured in our study determine the occurrence of these two genera detection of fecal indicator bacteria e faecalis is a commonly used indicator of fecal pollution in water lamp assay results showed positive detection of e faecalis in 68 of the cistern water samples 60 of coastal waters and 67 of street surface runoff table 1 the concentrations of e faecalis were generally low as shown in fig 6 but had large confidence intervals due to the lower statistical power of the data the higher mpns were found in cistern water samples in comparison with coastal waters and runoff water samples 4 discussion water quality degradation and related waterborne disease outbreaks are major concerns in the aftermath of natural disasters however water quality data in disaster regions are limited due to the difficulty of carrying out field investigations while other immediate rescue efforts take priority this is especially the case for oceanic islands where access to the region can be cut off due to paralyzed transportation systems the virgin islands are an american territory that heavily relies on the tourism industry for the local economy however 22 percent of the population in the virgin islands lives in poverty 2010 u s census fifty percent of those living below the poverty level were families led by single mothers jung 2017 poverty and poor health condition go hand in hand as evidenced by the frequent reports of infectious disease outbreaks in developing nations the study presented here is one of few studies of water quality in disaster regions and perhaps the only systematic investigation of water quality issues in a remote tropical island post natural disasters the results of this study revealed that fecal indicator bacteria were prevalent in cistern waters that were used for household water supplies legionella the major causative agent of respiratory infections through shower water was detected in over 86 of cisterns although not all species within the genus are pathogenic the high frequency of detection of this genus brings attention to the proper management of cistern water future work should screen cistern water specifically for genetic markers of pathogenic species of legionella in order to develop effective remediation strategies in st thomas biofilms in cisterns could be a source of the pathogen as suggested by previous work showing biofilms in water distribution systems as the source of legionella bacteria abu khweek and amer 2018 legionella is also ubiquitous in natural environments including soil and leaf litters van heijnsbergen et al 2015 floodwater that mobilizes surface soil may also serve as the carrier to bring the pathogen into cisterns this is supported by the positive detection of legionella in all three street runoff samples birds may also be a vector santos et al 2012 what is not clear in the results of this study is the degree of impact of hurricanes on cistern water quality since the privately owned cisterns are not routinely monitored for water quality there is a lack of historical data of cistern water quality that can be used as a baseline the only studies conducted in virgin islands cisterns were from over 30 years ago in which both fecal bacteria and legionella were reported broadhead et al 1988 crabtree et al 1996 outbreaks of legionnaire s disease have also been documented in 1985 in st thomas schlech et al 1985 regardless of impact of the hurricanes on cistern water quality the outcome of this study suggests cistern water quality needs more organized attention leaving residents of low socioeconomic status to manage their own water supply creates gaps in the national safe drinking water act protection from waterborne diseases reported cases of waterborne diseases as have been shown by recent focused effort are only the tip of the iceberg yang et al 2012 the federal and island governments should not wait until a major outbreak strikes the community to act on water quality assurance distribution of bottled water for drinking as part of post disaster management can help to prevent water ingestion related waterborne diseases but respiratory illnesses that are acquired through shower water may become a bigger outbreak threat preparation and prevention measures i e cistern water management should be taken before natural disasters strike there is a need for routine cistern water quality monitoring to demonstrate background concentrations of potential pathogens which then allows evaluation of storm event influences and guides bioremediation efforts the impact of hurricanes and floodwaters on coastal water quality degradation is easier to see in comparison with that on cistern waters fecal indicator bacteria escherichia shigella and enterococcus faecalis were found in coastal water especially near the southeast end of the island where land runoff had a significant impact on water quality although they make up small fractions of the total microbial community there was a clear sign of coastal water pollution since tourism is a mainstay of the island economy the degradation of recreational water quality not only impacts human health but also the local economy from a fundamental research point of view clear differences in microbial community structure were found in the three different types of water samples analyzed microbial diversity and community structure may be viewed as a signature of environmental conditions at a specific location and time such signatures although not currently used as a quantitative index of water quality measures may become metadata for comparison of environmental perturbation and for discovery of water quality changes with the continuous enrichment of data due to reduced costs of sequencing and the rapid advancement of data science the capability of next generation sequencing to categorize water quality including detection of genera containing potential pathogens in a microbial community can offer a water quality assessment tool for water management moreover although the study was not designed to assess the ecological burden from hurricanes to marine environments surrounding the island e g mangroves seagrass beds coral reefs the microbial diversity data might be useful for such a purpose bruce et al 2012 the major drawback of genetic based analytical methods is their inability to distinguish active bacteria from residual genetic materials one may argue the detection of legionella and the prevalence of the escherichia shigella markers are not good representations of their infectivity and health risk studies in wastewater treatment plants have shown that disinfected wastewater had similar genomic copies of bacterial target but low cultivable fecal bacteria suggesting genetic methods can significantly overestimate target bacteria he and jiang 2005 this may well be the case in cistern waters given that residents understand that animal feces e g from birds from the roof are an expected bycatch with rainwater leading to regular additions of bleach to cistern water for disinfection viability dyes such as ethidium monoazide ema and propidium monoazide pma have been used in conjunction with qpcr and illumina next generation sequencing platforms this could provide an indication of viable and intact cells reyneke et al 2017 in future research but until then the detection of genetic markers at minimum represents the recent contamination by potential pathogens mpn lamp provided the best estimates of concentration of enterococcus in the absence of the conditions for culture assay in the post disaster area in comparison with pcr lamp has improved specificity due to the adoption of six sets of primers martzy et al 2017 in comparison with a quantitative pcr assay the lamp reaction is more tolerant to the presence of inhibitors similar to pcr the lamp assay has better sensitivity than using short fragments of the 16s rrna gene for identification of specific species cai and zhang 2013 in fact enterococcus spp were not identified in our otu table the lamp assay identified a low level of these fecal indicator bacteria in surface runoff and coastal waters in comparison to the recreational water quality criteria us epa n d the large volume of stormwater flow following the hurricanes could dilute the fecal pollution to better understand the risk from exposure to poor water quality a quantitative risk assessment should be carried out to connect the exposure model with pathogen concentrations in the water since the majority of people received the government issued water quality warning and adopted bottled water as their main source of drinking water based on surveying cistern owners the risk of gastroenteritis from fecal pathogens in cistern waters is likely low respiratory illness from shower water exposure however is of greater concern the health effects could be exacerbated by the mental stress and anxiety experienced by disaster impacted local residents a future study of health effects will be helpful to better understand the water quality and health risk in the aftermath of disasters 5 conclusions a field sampling campaign for water quality assessments on a hurricane impacted tropical island were carried out the results of the study showed 1 fecal indicator bacteria and legionella were prevalent in all water samples 2 microbial community structures in water collected from cisterns coastal oceans and street surface runoff were dramatically different 3 the concentrations of legionella and fecal indicator bacteria were generally low 4 in spite of the lack of infectivity data on legionella the prevalence of this genetic marker is of great concern due to the likelihood of its transmission through shower water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

each sample including sampling location salinity and temperature were used as inputs the statistical differences in mean proportion of taxa between sample groups were estimated with two sided welch s t test with 95 confidence intervals p value correction was performed using benjamini hochberg false discovery rate bh fdr approach p 0 05 as implemented in stamp searching for potential human pathogens the otu table was searched using a list of potential human pathogens that have been identified in human sewage by metagenome analysis cai and zhang 2013 due to the limitations of sequencing small fragments of the 16s rrna gene the taxonomic information is generally insufficient to identify bacteria to the species level janda et al 2007 we focused on two bacterial genera in this report escherichia shigella is used as an indicator of fecal contamination legionella is used to indicate potential infection risks associated with aerosols since cistern water is more commonly used for showering than as a source of unfiltered drinking water the fraction of legionella and escherichia shigella in each water sample was calculated by counting the number of otus associated with each genus the relative abundance is calculated by the number of otus identified divided by the total otus in each sample other bacterial genera that may include potential human pathogens are presented in the supplementary table s4 factors that may contribute to the occurrence of legionella and escherichia shigella in samples were assessed using pearson s correlation coefficient in r version 3 3 2 input variables include phylogenetic diversity tree index mean temperature and mean salinity of top 1m of coastal water or cistern water and the top four principal coordinates from pcoa detection of enterococcus faecalis loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp was performed following the modified protocol of kanitkar et al 2017 to determine the occurrence of enterococcus faecalis in aliquots of microbial dna extracts from water samples lamp primers previously designed by kato et al 2007 targeting azoa gene of e faecalis were adapted and are summarized in table s5 the lamp reaction was carried out in a total volume of 25 μl containing 12 5 μl of 1x warmstart lamp master mix new england biolabs ma usa 1 6 m each of primer fip and bip 0 2 m each of primer f3 and b3 0 8 m each of primer lb and lf and 2 μl of dna extract the negative control substituted 2 μl of rnase free water qiagen md usa in the place of a dna sample the mixture was incubated at 65 c for 30 min and then cooled to 4 c for 5 min to terminate the reaction lamp product was visualized by the addition of 1 μl sybr green i 1 10 dilution of 10 000x stock invitrogen waltham ma usa a subset of samples was diluted to assess the presence of amplification inhibitors all diluted samples yielded negative lamp results six replicate lamp reactions were conducted for each water sample to calculate the most probable number mpn of genome concentration based on statistical probability a numerical excel spreadsheet was used for the estimation of mpn value with 95 confidence limits 3 results water quality assessment by microbial diversity and composition comparison of 16s rrna gene sequences from 45 water samples indicated that proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum identified fig s1 this result is not surprising because this phylum is composed of diverse families genera and species that are commonly found in aquatic environments delmont et al 2018 he et al 2017 bacteroidetes were the second most commonly observed phylum in all samples acidobacteria verrucomicrobia and planctomycetes that were commonly found in cistern samples were rare in coastal and runoff waters fig s1 chlamydiae seemed to be unique to cistern and runoff water and gemmatimonadetes were in low abundance but ubiquitous in cistern water cyanobacteria and marinimicrobia were present in all coastal samples but were absent in cistern samples cistern and runoff samples had more unidentified phyla than coastal waters fig s1 within sample phylogenic diversity indices are shown in fig 2 a two sided t tests showed that phylogenetic indices were significantly different between cistern and coastal samples p 10 10 and between coastal and runoff samples p 0 03 however cistern and runoff samples were not significantly different p 0 07 the pcoa plot showed that microbial communities were similar within the same type of samples but were different between sample types fig 2b surface runoff samples were tightly clustered and were distantly related to other samples coastal samples had a greater variability as indicated by the spread along both principal coordinate 1 pc1 and pc2 scales cistern samples were tightly clustered except sample 23nd which had the lowest filtration volume 860 ml highest water temperature 28 2 c and salinity 0 15psu table s2 the distinct microbial community composition in this sample together with physical water quality parameters implied contamination of the cistern by flood waters corroborated by the home owner s description of the storm events statistical comparison of microbial community composition in coastal waters versus those in cistern waters revealed that marinimicrobia acidobacteria proteobacteria and verrucomicrobia were the main phyla that contributed to the observed differences fig 3 a differences in proteobacteria among cistern and runoff samples determined their unique microbial signature fig 3b occurrence of escherichia shigella and legionella escherichia shigella were frequently found in cistern waters with 82 of the samples containing gene sequences matching these genera table 1 thirty percent 30 of the coastal water samples also contained 16s rrna gene sequences that identified as escherichia shigella one of three street surface runoff samples had a match with escherichia shigella gene sequences but all three surface runoff samples were positive for legionella legionella was also detected in 86 of rain cisterns and 10 of coastal waters table 1 the relative abundance of otus identified as escherichia shigella and legionella was plotted by sample types fig 4 the occurrence of these genera as a portion of the total microbial population varied largely among samples ranging from non detect to 0 8 escherichia shigella figs 4a and 1 of legionella fig 4b in a coastal sample the two genera although frequently detected in cistern waters accounted for very small fractions of the total microbial population 0 05 for escherichia shigella 0 4 for legionella the majority of the cistern samples had less than 0 1 of the two genera combined as indicated by the width of the plot at the base fig 4a and b the fractions of these genera were even lower in most of coastal waters with exception of a couple heavily polluted samples from south side of the island see small insert in fig 4a and b results of pearson correlation analysis of water quality parameters phylogenetic diversity pd tree index pcoa coordinates and fractions of escherichia shigella and legionella genera in each sample are shown in fig 5 there was a significant negative correlation between water temperature and salinity at coastal sites since lower salinity waters were found at coastal zones that were heavily influenced by land runoff fig 5a the fraction of legionella detected in coastal samples was found to be negatively correlated with pc3 of the pcoa fig 5a while the fraction of escherichia shigella genus had a positive correlation with pc3 suggesting these two genera may originate from different sources the detection of both genera in coastal samples was negatively correlated with microbial diversity index indicating they were likely found in samples with lower microbial diversity there are no significant correlations between the measured environmental parameters microbial diversity and detection of escherichia shigella and legionella genera in cistern waters fig 5b this suggests additional factors that were not measured in our study determine the occurrence of these two genera detection of fecal indicator bacteria e faecalis is a commonly used indicator of fecal pollution in water lamp assay results showed positive detection of e faecalis in 68 of the cistern water samples 60 of coastal waters and 67 of street surface runoff table 1 the concentrations of e faecalis were generally low as shown in fig 6 but had large confidence intervals due to the lower statistical power of the data the higher mpns were found in cistern water samples in comparison with coastal waters and runoff water samples 4 discussion water quality degradation and related waterborne disease outbreaks are major concerns in the aftermath of natural disasters however water quality data in disaster regions are limited due to the difficulty of carrying out field investigations while other immediate rescue efforts take priority this is especially the case for oceanic islands where access to the region can be cut off due to paralyzed transportation systems the virgin islands are an american territory that heavily relies on the tourism industry for the local economy however 22 percent of the population in the virgin islands lives in poverty 2010 u s census fifty percent of those living below the poverty level were families led by single mothers jung 2017 poverty and poor health condition go hand in hand as evidenced by the frequent reports of infectious disease outbreaks in developing nations the study presented here is one of few studies of water quality in disaster regions and perhaps the only systematic investigation of water quality issues in a remote tropical island post natural disasters the results of this study revealed that fecal indicator bacteria were prevalent in cistern waters that were used for household water supplies legionella the major causative agent of respiratory infections through shower water was detected in over 86 of cisterns although not all species within the genus are pathogenic the high frequency of detection of this genus brings attention to the proper management of cistern water future work should screen cistern water specifically for genetic markers of pathogenic species of legionella in order to develop effective remediation strategies in st thomas biofilms in cisterns could be a source of the pathogen as suggested by previous work showing biofilms in water distribution systems as the source of legionella bacteria abu khweek and amer 2018 legionella is also ubiquitous in natural environments including soil and leaf litters van heijnsbergen et al 2015 floodwater that mobilizes surface soil may also serve as the carrier to bring the pathogen into cisterns this is supported by the positive detection of legionella in all three street runoff samples birds may also be a vector santos et al 2012 what is not clear in the results of this study is the degree of impact of hurricanes on cistern water quality since the privately owned cisterns are not routinely monitored for water quality there is a lack of historical data of cistern water quality that can be used as a baseline the only studies conducted in virgin islands cisterns were from over 30 years ago in which both fecal bacteria and legionella were reported broadhead et al 1988 crabtree et al 1996 outbreaks of legionnaire s disease have also been documented in 1985 in st thomas schlech et al 1985 regardless of impact of the hurricanes on cistern water quality the outcome of this study suggests cistern water quality needs more organized attention leaving residents of low socioeconomic status to manage their own water supply creates gaps in the national safe drinking water act protection from waterborne diseases reported cases of waterborne diseases as have been shown by recent focused effort are only the tip of the iceberg yang et al 2012 the federal and island governments should not wait until a major outbreak strikes the community to act on water quality assurance distribution of bottled water for drinking as part of post disaster management can help to prevent water ingestion related waterborne diseases but respiratory illnesses that are acquired through shower water may become a bigger outbreak threat preparation and prevention measures i e cistern water management should be taken before natural disasters strike there is a need for routine cistern water quality monitoring to demonstrate background concentrations of potential pathogens which then allows evaluation of storm event influences and guides bioremediation efforts the impact of hurricanes and floodwaters on coastal water quality degradation is easier to see in comparison with that on cistern waters fecal indicator bacteria escherichia shigella and enterococcus faecalis were found in coastal water especially near the southeast end of the island where land runoff had a significant impact on water quality although they make up small fractions of the total microbial community there was a clear sign of coastal water pollution since tourism is a mainstay of the island economy the degradation of recreational water quality not only impacts human health but also the local economy from a fundamental research point of view clear differences in microbial community structure were found in the three different types of water samples analyzed microbial diversity and community structure may be viewed as a signature of environmental conditions at a specific location and time such signatures although not currently used as a quantitative index of water quality measures may become metadata for comparison of environmental perturbation and for discovery of water quality changes with the continuous enrichment of data due to reduced costs of sequencing and the rapid advancement of data science the capability of next generation sequencing to categorize water quality including detection of genera containing potential pathogens in a microbial community can offer a water quality assessment tool for water management moreover although the study was not designed to assess the ecological burden from hurricanes to marine environments surrounding the island e g mangroves seagrass beds coral reefs the microbial diversity data might be useful for such a purpose bruce et al 2012 the major drawback of genetic based analytical methods is their inability to distinguish active bacteria from residual genetic materials one may argue the detection of legionella and the prevalence of the escherichia shigella markers are not good representations of their infectivity and health risk studies in wastewater treatment plants have shown that disinfected wastewater had similar genomic copies of bacterial target but low cultivable fecal bacteria suggesting genetic methods can significantly overestimate target bacteria he and jiang 2005 this may well be the case in cistern waters given that residents understand that animal feces e g from birds from the roof are an expected bycatch with rainwater leading to regular additions of bleach to cistern water for disinfection viability dyes such as ethidium monoazide ema and propidium monoazide pma have been used in conjunction with qpcr and illumina next generation sequencing platforms this could provide an indication of viable and intact cells reyneke et al 2017 in future research but until then the detection of genetic markers at minimum represents the recent contamination by potential pathogens mpn lamp provided the best estimates of concentration of enterococcus in the absence of the conditions for culture assay in the post disaster area in comparison with pcr lamp has improved specificity due to the adoption of six sets of primers martzy et al 2017 in comparison with a quantitative pcr assay the lamp reaction is more tolerant to the presence of inhibitors similar to pcr the lamp assay has better sensitivity than using short fragments of the 16s rrna gene for identification of specific species cai and zhang 2013 in fact enterococcus spp were not identified in our otu table the lamp assay identified a low level of these fecal indicator bacteria in surface runoff and coastal waters in comparison to the recreational water quality criteria us epa n d the large volume of stormwater flow following the hurricanes could dilute the fecal pollution to better understand the risk from exposure to poor water quality a quantitative risk assessment should be carried out to connect the exposure model with pathogen concentrations in the water since the majority of people received the government issued water quality warning and adopted bottled water as their main source of drinking water based on surveying cistern owners the risk of gastroenteritis from fecal pathogens in cistern waters is likely low respiratory illness from shower water exposure however is of greater concern the health effects could be exacerbated by the mental stress and anxiety experienced by disaster impacted local residents a future study of health effects will be helpful to better understand the water quality and health risk in the aftermath of disasters 5 conclusions a field sampling campaign for water quality assessments on a hurricane impacted tropical island were carried out the results of the study showed 1 fecal indicator bacteria and legionella were prevalent in all water samples 2 microbial community structures in water collected from cisterns coastal oceans and street surface runoff were dramatically different 3 the concentrations of legionella and fecal indicator bacteria were generally low 4 in spite of the lack of infectivity data on legionella the prevalence of this genetic marker is of great concern due to the likelihood of its transmission through shower water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18216,photocatalysis is becoming a popular method for the inactivation of algae cells however the previous research has mainly focused on the destruction of algae cells by photocatalysis for control of harmful blooms in natural waters this study aims to investigate the effect of photocatalytic pretreatment on the coagulation process for microcystis aeruginosa removal photocatalytic pretreatment by recyclable magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles under visible light was indicated to enhance the algae removal efficiency from 10 to 96 with the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l the possible mechanism involved in the enhancement was explored by analyzing variations in the algal suspension from the aspects of cell integrity superoxide dismutase sod activity cell morphology and dissolved organic matter dom the photocatalytic process was proved to realize moderate pretreatment of algae cells by destabilization of the algae cells without damaging cell integrity the damaged cell ratios were all below 6 even after 360 min photocatalytic pretreatment which could avoid the undesirable release of intracellular organic matter iom the increase in sod activity with prolonged photocatalytic time indicated that algae cells were stimulated to extensively activate sod to resist the oxidative damage induced by the photocatalysis electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements further revealed that superoxide radicals were generated and involved in the photocatalytic pretreatment process additionally increased doc values in the algal suspension were induced by the desorption of mucilage from algae cells the desorbed mucilage was proved to be mainly composed of large or medium mw rather than small mw compounds which could further enhance the coagulation therefore the efficient coagulation of algal suspensions can be realized by moderate pretreatment of m aeruginosa via the magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particle photocatalysis process graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis aeruginosa removal coagulation moderate photocatalysis cell integrity superoxide dismutase activity mucilage desorption 1 introduction algae blooms in eutrophic water sources have already become an issue of widespread concern for drinking water production the traditional al coagulation process cannot realize the effective removal of algae cells due to their intrinsic properties including diverse morphology negatively charged surface low specific density and high motility ma et al 2007 pieterse and cloot 1997 takaara et al 2010 the significant inhibition of coagulation and sedimentation processes caused by these blooms can not only result in the subsequent problem of shortened filtration cycles kwon et al 2014 but also the deterioration of effluent water quality al tebrineh et al 2010 chen et al 2008a preoxidation has been widely used for the enhancement of algae removal by the traditional coagulation and sedimentation processes chen and yeh 2005 chen et al 2008b naceradska et al 2017 shi et al 2019 the introduction of various chemical oxidants e g cl2 clo2 o3 kmno4 has been proved to have an algae inactivation effect during pretreatment liu et al 2017 shen et al 2011 however the conventional preoxidation method requires the consumption of chemical oxidants recently photocatalytic technology come to be widely used for algae cell inactivation gu et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2018b the photocatalyst can play the role of oxidizer under light irradiation without any deterioration due to its highly stable properties therefore photocatalysis is an ideal method for algae cell inactivation from the aspects of environmental friendliness and economy the utilization of tio2 has been reported to show good performance in the oxidation of m aeruginosa cells under ultraviolet uv irradiation chen et al 2018 pinho et al 2015 however the application of tio2 as photocatalyst is limited because it requires uv irradiation and consumes a large amount of energy as the uv region only accounts for about 3 of the solar spectrum fu 2003 the application of n tio2 cu2o or g c3n4 has been proposed for visible light photocatalytic inactivation of algae cells gu et al 2016 jin et al 2019 song et al 2018 however similar to the conventional chemical oxidation process over inactivation during the photocatalytic process can result in severe damage to algae cells and the undesirable release of intracellular organic matter iom daly et al 2007 gu et al 2016 li et al 2014 pinho et al 2015 shi et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 therefore an ideal preoxidation process by photocatalysis should be moderate to achieve a balance between the avoidance of extensive algae cell damage and improvement of the efficiency of the subsequent algae removal the mucilage on algae cells was found to not only protect the algae cells from being damaged but also to reduce the algae removal efficiency the desorption of mucilage without damaging the algae cells was proven to be the key to achieving moderate pretreatment qi et al 2016a to the best of our knowledge the previous research has mainly been related to the destruction of algae cells by photocatalysis while studies focused on the utilization of photocatalysis for the preoxidation of algae cells before coagulation have been rare in addition utilization of the aforementioned photocatalyst presents difficulties in separation and recycling which not only causes waste but also has the possibility of inducing secondary pollution thus it is of great importance to find a recyclable photocatalyst to play the role of oxidant in the algae cell pretreatment process fe3o4 particles have attracted considerable attention owing to their magnetic properties laurent et al 2008 moreover zn is the most commonly used element for particle modification due to its good performance in enhancing photocatalytic activity alonso reynoso soto et al 2013 kang et al 2013 seo et al 2016 thanh binh et al 2012 therefore magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles were synthesized in this study to play the role of photocatalyst in algae pretreatment which can be recycled after realizing the visible light photocatalytic inactivation of algae cells based on the above concerns this study aims to 1 investigate the effect of zn doped fe3o4 particles in visible light photocatalytic pretreatment on the enhancement of coagulation for algae removal 2 explore the possible mechanism involved in the enhancement of algae removal from both cell integrity maintenance and mucilage desorption aspects 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the algae species used in this study was microcystis aeruginosa because of its prevalence in algae blooms and relevance to water quality and treatment challenges in waterworks kemp and john 2006 sano et al 2011 m aeruginosa strain fachb 905 as a cyanobacterium previously described by shen et al shen and song 2007 was obtained from wuhan institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences and cultured in bg 11 medium rippka et al 1979 the detailed algae growth conditions are presented in text s1 m aeruginosa cultures were harvested at the exponential growth phase and diluted to the cell density of 1 0 106 cells ml for all experiments sytox green nucleic acid stain was purchased from invitrogen usa source water was collected from the miyun reservoir located in beijing china the basic qualities of the source water were as follows turbidity 1 8 ntu ph 8 3 doc 3 76 mg l tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 02 mg l 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 synthesis of zn doped fe3o4 the zn doped fe3o4 particles were synthesized by a solvothermal method 15 ml of fecl3 6h2o 0 54 g solution and 15 ml of zncl2 0 14 g were mixed and then ch3coona 0 8 g was added slowly into the mixed solution under vigorous stirring the solvent used was composed of milli q water and glycerol with volume ratio of 1 1 the mixture was further stirred for 30 min to ensure dissolution and then transferred into a tightly sealed teflon lined autoclave and heated at 200 c for 12 h in an oven subsequently the obtained products were collected by centrifugation after cooling down to room temperature the solid samples were washed with milli q water and ethanol several times and then dried at 60 c for 6 h in an oven 2 2 2 evaluation of photocatalytic properties in order to study the photocatalytic effect of zn doped fe3o4 particles on m aeruginosa removal efficiency by coagulation the photocatalyst 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 g l was added into the m aeruginosa suspension after ultrasonication to ensure a uniform dispersion then the photocatalysis was carried out by irradiation of the suspension using a 300 w xe lamp with an uv cutoff filter λ 420 nm light intensity 50 mw cm2 the solution was homogenized by stirring at a speed of 200 rpm throughout the photocatalysis procedure next the zn doped fe3o4 particles were separated from the algal suspension by magnetic separation at given time intervals 0 60 120 240 360 min thereafter the algal suspension was transferred into a 500 ml beaker and the coagulation process was conducted on a programmable jar tester my3000 6 meiyu china al2 so4 3 solution at 20 μm was added and the samples were rapidly mixed at 200 rpm for 2 min followed by slow mixing at 40 rpm for 15 min finally samples were quiescently settled for 30 min the coagulation conditions were set according to our previous study qi et al 2016c the supernatant samples were siphoned from 2 cm below the water surface to test for residual algae the optical density at 680 nm od680 of m aeruginosa has been reported to be positively related to cell density sorokin 1973 the linear relationship indicated the significant correlation between them fig s1 thus the residual algae was assessed by measuring od680 with a u 3100 spectrophotometer hitachi co japan in addition samples were siphoned for cell integrity detection and mucilage desorption tests after separation of the zn doped fe3o4 particles from the algal suspension the siphoned samples were divided into two subsamples the first sample was evaluated for cell integrity and density superoxide dismutase sod activity and tem characterization the remaining sample was immediately filtered through a 0 45 mm glass fiber filter for the analysis of doc and molecular weight mw distribution 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 structure and magnetic property characterization x ray diffraction xrd results were analyzed using highscore plus software version 3 0e and peaks were matched using the icdd pdf 4 2004 database the surface morphologies of zn doped fe3o4 particles were observed under a transmission electron microscope tem h 7500 hitachi co japan coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer eds the magnetic susceptibility and m h hysteresis loop of zn doped fe3o4 particles were investigated at room temperature 300 k by a physical property measurement system ppms equipped with a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm quantum co usa electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra of trapping radicals were obtained by a bruker e500 epr device 2 3 2 od680 of algal suspension od680 of the algal suspension was measured with a u 3100 spectrophotometer hitachi co japan the path length of the quartz cell was 10 mm milli q water served as the control 2 3 3 cell integrity and density detection cell integrity was determined for individual cells using a flow cytometer facscalibur 4clr bd biosciences san jose usa equipped with an argon ion laser emitting at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm for fluorescence measurement sytox green nucleic acid stain was used to determine the cell integrity according to the method of daly daly et al 2007 cell density was analyzed for algal suspension by novocyte flow cytometer novocyte 1040 acea biosciences california usa full details of the cell integrity and density analysis are presented in text s2 2 3 4 sod activity the sod activity was tested by the enzychrom sod assay kit esod 100 bioassay systems 2 3 5 tem characterization of algae cells samples were immediately pre embedded with agarose after centrifugation fixed overnight in 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c and post fixed with 1 osmic acid for 2 h after washing three times in phosphate buffer solution 100 mm ph 7 2 the dehydration was performed with graded ethanol solutions the dehydrated samples were embedded in spi pon 812 followed by polymerization at 60 c for 48 h ultrathin sections 70 nm were cut with a leica em uc6 ultramicrotome stained with 2 uranyl acetate for 15 min and lead citrate for 5 min and examined using tem tecnai spirit fei 2 3 6 analysis of doc the doc concentration in the dissolved phase of algal suspensions was measured with a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer 2 3 7 mw distribution the mw distribution in the dissolved phase of the algal suspension was determined by gel permeation chromatography gpc agilent technologies usa tsk gel g3000pwxl detector uv temperature 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and magnetic properties of the zn doped fe3o4 particles the morphology and microstructure of the zn doped fe3o4 particles were investigated by tem and hrtem fig 1 a and fig 1b it can be seen in the figure that the particles were spherical with diameters in the range of 10 40 nm fig 1a the marked interplanar spacings of 2 54 å and 1 49 å in the lattice fringe high resolution tem image fig 1b are consistent with the spacings of the 311 and 440 lattice planes for fe3o4 respectively the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx element mappings of zn doped fe3o4 particles fig 1c e clearly showed a uniform distribution of zn fe and o elements in the particles xrd diffractograms of the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles are shown in fig 1f the phases present in zn doped fe3o4 were identified using xrd fig 1f and the diffraction peaks could be indexed to the cubic spinel structure with fd 3m space group jcpds 82 1049 the characteristic peaks at 2θ of 29 87 35 29 42 87 56 68 and 62 26 could be readily indexed to the 220 311 400 333 and 440 reflections of spinel respectively the magnetization curve in fig 1g showed an obvious hysteresis loop for the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles which is typical for the ferromagnetic type curves the saturation magnetization ms of the zn doped fe3o4 was estimated to be 66 2 emu g 1 which is lower than that of non doped fe3o4 particles 73 9 emu g 1 pan et al 2012 the synthesis methods associated with non magnetic impurity addition were reported to decrease the magnetization due to the disruption of the magnetic crystal structure liu et al 2012 in addition the ms value of 7 7 emu g 1 has been reported to be sufficient for the efficient capture of particles within 10 min using a 70 6 mt magnetic field qi et al 2017 thus the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles can be easily separated by magnetic separation as a magnetic field greater than 1 t has been used for ferric suspension separation from water in some high gradient magnetic separation hgms systems li et al 2012 2015 the application of hgms systems in separation was reported to have the advantages of energy saving easy handling low operating and investment cost and so on li et al 2012 therefore the magnetic separation of as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles from algal suspension can be realized with lower investment and maintenance cost 3 2 effect of photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles on enhanced coagulation for m aeruginosa removal to illustrate the effects of photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles on the removal of directly diluted m aeruginosa in source water the photocatalytic time was controlled from 0 to 6 h and the particle doses were 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 g l respectively fig 2 the removal of algae by al coagulation increased with prolonged photocatalytic time at all fixed photocatalyst doses when the catalyst dose was 0 05 g l the algae removal was increased from 10 to 96 with the prolonging of photocatalytic time from 0 to 360 min in addition the algae removal efficiency increased with elevated catalyst dose up to 0 05 g l but decreased at higher concentrations especially for the prolonged photocatalytic times of 120 240 and 360 min an elevated catalyst dose can increase the number of photogenerated electrons and holes which is beneficial to the destabilization of algae cells however the light absorption at the catalyst surface might be hindered by the light blocking effect with further elevation of the catalyst dose from 0 05 to 0 1 g l on the other hand an elevated dose can also correspondingly increase the recombination sites for photogenerated electrons and holes gu et al 2015 the separation and recombination of the carriers on the catalyst surface are balanced which is not conducive to the photocatalytic effect therefore the amount of catalyst should be controlled in the proper range to utilize the materials economically and effectively in addition only a small decrease of algae removal efficiency was observed with a catalyst subjected to three regeneration cycles for the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l fig s2 which indicated that the catalyst had good stability and could still be efficient after recycling moreover the ph value was almost unchanged after photocatalytic pretreatment and only a slight decrease was observed after the followed al coagulation fig s3 the photocatalyst can play a good role under the original ph condition of algal suspension which can further guarantee its feasibility in practical application 3 3 mechanisms in the removal of m aeruginosa cells by photocatalysis enhanced coagulation with magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles 3 3 1 effects of photocatalysis on m aeruginosa cell integrity and sod activity fig 3 illustrates the effects of photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles on algae cell integrity for photocatalyst doses from 0 to 0 1 g l the ratios of damaged cells were analyzed by flow cytometry sytox green nucleic acid stain was used to determine the percentage of damaged cells in a sample according to the method of daly daly et al 2007 sytox can permeate cells with damaged cell membranes and further induce higher fluorescence due to the staining of nucleic acids hence the algae cell integrity can be evaluated according to the variation of fluorescence after staining the cells the maintained cell integrity for the control without adding zn doped fe3o4 particles in fig 3 indicated that the sole irradiation by visible light used in this study could not induce the cell damage due to the lower light intensity in addition almost all of the algae cells maintained integrity even after 360 min photocatalysis as the ratios of damaged cells were all below 6 these results indicate that the photocatalytic effect of as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles did not damage the algae cells this can be further proved by the maintained algae cell density after photocatalysis in fig s4 photocatalysis has been utilized in many reported studies for the inactivation of algae cells chen et al 2018 gu et al 2016 jin et al 2018 pinho et al 2015 wang et al 2018b however the mechanism of all these studies was based on the destruction of algae cells which would induce the release of algal organic matter aom the released aom not only contains toxic substances but also serves as precursors for disinfection byproducts dbps fang et al 2010 qi et al 2016b compared with the previous studies the catalyst used here can realize the enhancement of algae removal without causing cell rupture and aom release problems sod has been reported to play a key role in the physiological process of resisting oxidation banci et al 2005 yang et al 2011 the dismutation of superoxide can be catalyzed by sod and thus eliminate the oxidative species inside the cells banci et al 2005 as shown in fig 4 the sod activity of the raw m aeruginosa suspension was about 0 37 10 6 u cells 1 whereas it increased markedly after photocatalysis at all the catalyst doses the highest sod activity value 0 89 10 6 u cells 1 was achieved by the 0 05 g l catalyst dose after 360 min photocatalysis the increased sod activity indicated that the algae cells were stimulated to resist the oxidative damage due to photocatalysis through the activation of sod similar results have also been reported for other treatment methods for the activation of m aeruginosa li et al 2011 xu et al 2016 therefore the higher sod activity value can directly prove the presence of stronger oxidation induced by photocatalysis notably the upward trend of sod activity at all the catalyst doses can further demonstrate the maintained cell integrity after photocatalysis otherwise the damage to cell integrity would induce a decline in sod activity due to the collapse of antioxidant defense huang et al 2012 li et al 2011 xu et al 2016 in addition the variation in sod activity is consistent with the algae removal shown in fig 2 which illustrates that the algae removal by subsequent coagulation is determined by the oxidation capacity in the photocatalytic process 3 3 2 effects of photocatalysis on mucilage desorption and characteristics of dom in m aeruginosa suspension moreover the mucilage on algae cells was found in our former study to not only interfere with the algae removal efficiency but also protect the algae cells from being damaged qi et al 2016a the mucilage includes all the surface bound organic matter on algae cells which contains not only the extracellular organic matter eom but also natural organic matter nom it has been reported to interfere the hydrolysis of coagulant through the direct interaction of its hydrophilic content with cations originated from coagulant takaara et al 2010 in addition the mucilage can serve as a protective barrier against environmental stress and thus protect the algae cell membrane from being attacked gonzález et al 2010 the desorption of mucilage without damaging the algae cells is the key to achieving moderate pretreatment by the photocatalytic process therefore the morphology of m aeruginosa cells before and after photocatalysis was characterized by tem to further investigate the photocatalytic inactivation effect of magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles fig 5 the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l was chosen because it was the most effective in improving m aeruginosa removal fig 2 as we can see from the images the m aeruginosa cells used in the experiment were of ovoid or spherical shape and around 4 0 μm in diameter in addition the presence of mucilage in the outside of algae cells can clearly be observed from fig 5a which is consistent with previous findings pinho et al 2015 the desorption of mucilage can be directly proved through the disappear of mucilaginous external layer after 360 min photocatalytic pretreatment comparing with the raw algae cell fig 5b the disappearance of mucilage in fig 5b indicated the damage induced by photocatalysis even though the cell integrity was proved to be maintained as shown in fig 3 the reactive oxygen species ros generated by the photocatalyst were measured by epr to further investigate the mechanism of photocatalytic pretreatment fig 6 signals with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 were clearly obtained in the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 suspension this result indicated that the photocatalytic pretreatment could effectively generate superoxide radicals which was responsible for the mucilage desorption therefore the improvement of algae removal in fig 2 can be explained by the mucilage desorption effect on algae cells during the photocatalytic process in addition the morphology of algae cells could still be maintained even after 360 min photocatalytic pretreatment combined with the results in fig 3 the catalyst used in this study can realize the improvement of algae removal without damaging the cell integrity which is similar to the effects of moderate pretreatment by chemical oxidants reported in our former study qi et al 2016a the mucilage has been reported to consume ros by redox reactions and prevent them from reaching the cell wall the highly functionalized organic polymers with amides carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can serve as ros scavengers planchon et al 2013 moreover the oxidizing ability of superoxide radicals are relatively weak comparing with hydroxyl radicals oh et al 2016 therefore moderate pretreatment of algae cells can be realized by photocatalytic process with the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles fig 7 a shows the variation of doc values in the m aeruginosa suspension after photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles the elevation of catalyst dose from 0 to 0 05 g l increased the doc value throughout the photocatalysis period the doc value in the algal suspension increased e g to 1 96 mg l after the 360 min photocatalysis by 0 05 g l catalyst even though the ratios of damaged cells were below 6 fig 3 the membranes of undamaged algae cells should be intact otherwise the sytox green nucleic acid stain would penetrate cells through the damaged cell membranes and finally induce the variation of fluorescence after staining the nucleic acids of cells daly et al 2007 the intact cell membrane for undamaged algae cells can ensure the iom not to be released into water combined with the mucilage desorption results shown in fig 5 the increase in doc after photocatalysis can be inferred to be due to desorbed mucilage rather than released iom similar results were reported in our previous findings with moderate preoxidation qi et al 2016a in addition the decreased doc value with the further elevated catalyst dose from 0 05 to 0 1 g l can be explained by the light blocking effect and the balance between separation and recombination of carriers gu et al 2015 epr spectra for different doses of zn doped fe3o4 particles was analyzed to reflect the quantity variation of active species fig s5 the measurement was conducted for the photocatalytic system without algae cells to eliminate the interference the peak intensities were found to increase with the elevated photocatalyst doses the highest peak intensity was achieved with the catalyst dose of 0 1 g l which indicated the most quantity of active species however the most effective mucilage desorbing result was realized with the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l this inconsistent result can be explained by the light blocking effect of algae cells in the photocatalytic pretreatment system which can hinder the light absorption at the catalyst surface therefore there is no positive correlation between amount of photocatalyst and degree of mucilage desorption furthermore the peak intensities of epr spectra could also be enhanced by the increased light intensity with the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l fig s6 this result indicated that the quantity of superoxide radicals generated during the photocatalytic pretreatment could be increased through the enhancement of light intensity the light intensity used in this study was 50 mw cm2 which was at a relatively low level therefore the photocatalysis efficiency can be enhanced by the improved superoxide radical production which can finally shorten the illumination time needed for photocatalytic pretreatment in practical applications to further illustrate the increase in doc after the photocatalysis the mw distribution of dom in m aeruginosa suspension after photocatalysis by the 0 05 g l catalyst dose was also investigated as a function of photocatalysis time from 0 to 360 min fig 7b the mw distribution of dom in the m aeruginosa suspension was from 25422 da to 645 da as shown in fig 7b the response intensity of dom was enhanced with prolonged photocatalytic time over almost the whole mw distribution which is consistent with the observed increase in the doc value fig 7a additionally the results for samples after different photocatalytic time indicated that the mucilage desorbed was mainly of large or medium mw rather than small mw this is consistent with the former findings that mucilage with large or medium mw was easier to desorb compared to that with small mw ma et al 2012 qi et al 2018 the eem spectral result in fig s7 shows that the main type of desorbed mucilage was protein like substances with large mw peaks flu 3 and 4 organics with relatively large mw have been reported to play the role of bridging between algae cells and hydrolysates of coagulant which can finally enhance the coagulation efficiency bernhardt et al 1985 chen et al 2009 ma et al 2012 paralkar and edzwald 1996 in addition the interference of coagulant hydrolysis can be eliminated for the mucilage free algae cells takaara et al 2010 therefore the efficient m aeruginosa removal can be achieved by moderate photocatalysis enhanced coagulation with magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles 4 conclusions this study directly proved that the photocatalysis of algal suspensions by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles can effectively improve the algae removal in the subsequent coagulation process by causing mucilage desorption without damaging cell integrity the photocatalyst dose of 0 05 g l could achieve moderate preoxidation of m aeruginosa cells and the algae cells maintained integrity even after 360 min photocatalysis with moderate pretreatment cell rupture and aom release problems can be avoided the upward trend of sod activity with prolonged photocatalytic time can further demonstrate the oxidative function of photocatalysis along with maintaining cell integrity superoxide radicals were proved to be generated and involved in the desorption of mucilage from algae cells the algae removal by the coagulation process could be dramatically enhanced by the elevation of catalyst doses from 0 to 0 05 g l as more mucilage was desorbed from algae cells during the photocatalytic process thus the implementation of photocatalysis by zn doped fe3o4 particles may be practically applicable for the enhancement of algae removal in the subsequent coagulation process further verification needs to be conducted to extend the technology to other algal species and use in natural water bodies declaration of competing

18216,photocatalysis is becoming a popular method for the inactivation of algae cells however the previous research has mainly focused on the destruction of algae cells by photocatalysis for control of harmful blooms in natural waters this study aims to investigate the effect of photocatalytic pretreatment on the coagulation process for microcystis aeruginosa removal photocatalytic pretreatment by recyclable magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles under visible light was indicated to enhance the algae removal efficiency from 10 to 96 with the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l the possible mechanism involved in the enhancement was explored by analyzing variations in the algal suspension from the aspects of cell integrity superoxide dismutase sod activity cell morphology and dissolved organic matter dom the photocatalytic process was proved to realize moderate pretreatment of algae cells by destabilization of the algae cells without damaging cell integrity the damaged cell ratios were all below 6 even after 360 min photocatalytic pretreatment which could avoid the undesirable release of intracellular organic matter iom the increase in sod activity with prolonged photocatalytic time indicated that algae cells were stimulated to extensively activate sod to resist the oxidative damage induced by the photocatalysis electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements further revealed that superoxide radicals were generated and involved in the photocatalytic pretreatment process additionally increased doc values in the algal suspension were induced by the desorption of mucilage from algae cells the desorbed mucilage was proved to be mainly composed of large or medium mw rather than small mw compounds which could further enhance the coagulation therefore the efficient coagulation of algal suspensions can be realized by moderate pretreatment of m aeruginosa via the magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particle photocatalysis process graphical abstract image 1 keywords microcystis aeruginosa removal coagulation moderate photocatalysis cell integrity superoxide dismutase activity mucilage desorption 1 introduction algae blooms in eutrophic water sources have already become an issue of widespread concern for drinking water production the traditional al coagulation process cannot realize the effective removal of algae cells due to their intrinsic properties including diverse morphology negatively charged surface low specific density and high motility ma et al 2007 pieterse and cloot 1997 takaara et al 2010 the significant inhibition of coagulation and sedimentation processes caused by these blooms can not only result in the subsequent problem of shortened filtration cycles kwon et al 2014 but also the deterioration of effluent water quality al tebrineh et al 2010 chen et al 2008a preoxidation has been widely used for the enhancement of algae removal by the traditional coagulation and sedimentation processes chen and yeh 2005 chen et al 2008b naceradska et al 2017 shi et al 2019 the introduction of various chemical oxidants e g cl2 clo2 o3 kmno4 has been proved to have an algae inactivation effect during pretreatment liu et al 2017 shen et al 2011 however the conventional preoxidation method requires the consumption of chemical oxidants recently photocatalytic technology come to be widely used for algae cell inactivation gu et al 2016 wang et al 2018a 2018b the photocatalyst can play the role of oxidizer under light irradiation without any deterioration due to its highly stable properties therefore photocatalysis is an ideal method for algae cell inactivation from the aspects of environmental friendliness and economy the utilization of tio2 has been reported to show good performance in the oxidation of m aeruginosa cells under ultraviolet uv irradiation chen et al 2018 pinho et al 2015 however the application of tio2 as photocatalyst is limited because it requires uv irradiation and consumes a large amount of energy as the uv region only accounts for about 3 of the solar spectrum fu 2003 the application of n tio2 cu2o or g c3n4 has been proposed for visible light photocatalytic inactivation of algae cells gu et al 2016 jin et al 2019 song et al 2018 however similar to the conventional chemical oxidation process over inactivation during the photocatalytic process can result in severe damage to algae cells and the undesirable release of intracellular organic matter iom daly et al 2007 gu et al 2016 li et al 2014 pinho et al 2015 shi et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 therefore an ideal preoxidation process by photocatalysis should be moderate to achieve a balance between the avoidance of extensive algae cell damage and improvement of the efficiency of the subsequent algae removal the mucilage on algae cells was found to not only protect the algae cells from being damaged but also to reduce the algae removal efficiency the desorption of mucilage without damaging the algae cells was proven to be the key to achieving moderate pretreatment qi et al 2016a to the best of our knowledge the previous research has mainly been related to the destruction of algae cells by photocatalysis while studies focused on the utilization of photocatalysis for the preoxidation of algae cells before coagulation have been rare in addition utilization of the aforementioned photocatalyst presents difficulties in separation and recycling which not only causes waste but also has the possibility of inducing secondary pollution thus it is of great importance to find a recyclable photocatalyst to play the role of oxidant in the algae cell pretreatment process fe3o4 particles have attracted considerable attention owing to their magnetic properties laurent et al 2008 moreover zn is the most commonly used element for particle modification due to its good performance in enhancing photocatalytic activity alonso reynoso soto et al 2013 kang et al 2013 seo et al 2016 thanh binh et al 2012 therefore magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles were synthesized in this study to play the role of photocatalyst in algae pretreatment which can be recycled after realizing the visible light photocatalytic inactivation of algae cells based on the above concerns this study aims to 1 investigate the effect of zn doped fe3o4 particles in visible light photocatalytic pretreatment on the enhancement of coagulation for algae removal 2 explore the possible mechanism involved in the enhancement of algae removal from both cell integrity maintenance and mucilage desorption aspects 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the algae species used in this study was microcystis aeruginosa because of its prevalence in algae blooms and relevance to water quality and treatment challenges in waterworks kemp and john 2006 sano et al 2011 m aeruginosa strain fachb 905 as a cyanobacterium previously described by shen et al shen and song 2007 was obtained from wuhan institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences and cultured in bg 11 medium rippka et al 1979 the detailed algae growth conditions are presented in text s1 m aeruginosa cultures were harvested at the exponential growth phase and diluted to the cell density of 1 0 106 cells ml for all experiments sytox green nucleic acid stain was purchased from invitrogen usa source water was collected from the miyun reservoir located in beijing china the basic qualities of the source water were as follows turbidity 1 8 ntu ph 8 3 doc 3 76 mg l tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 02 mg l 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 synthesis of zn doped fe3o4 the zn doped fe3o4 particles were synthesized by a solvothermal method 15 ml of fecl3 6h2o 0 54 g solution and 15 ml of zncl2 0 14 g were mixed and then ch3coona 0 8 g was added slowly into the mixed solution under vigorous stirring the solvent used was composed of milli q water and glycerol with volume ratio of 1 1 the mixture was further stirred for 30 min to ensure dissolution and then transferred into a tightly sealed teflon lined autoclave and heated at 200 c for 12 h in an oven subsequently the obtained products were collected by centrifugation after cooling down to room temperature the solid samples were washed with milli q water and ethanol several times and then dried at 60 c for 6 h in an oven 2 2 2 evaluation of photocatalytic properties in order to study the photocatalytic effect of zn doped fe3o4 particles on m aeruginosa removal efficiency by coagulation the photocatalyst 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 g l was added into the m aeruginosa suspension after ultrasonication to ensure a uniform dispersion then the photocatalysis was carried out by irradiation of the suspension using a 300 w xe lamp with an uv cutoff filter λ 420 nm light intensity 50 mw cm2 the solution was homogenized by stirring at a speed of 200 rpm throughout the photocatalysis procedure next the zn doped fe3o4 particles were separated from the algal suspension by magnetic separation at given time intervals 0 60 120 240 360 min thereafter the algal suspension was transferred into a 500 ml beaker and the coagulation process was conducted on a programmable jar tester my3000 6 meiyu china al2 so4 3 solution at 20 μm was added and the samples were rapidly mixed at 200 rpm for 2 min followed by slow mixing at 40 rpm for 15 min finally samples were quiescently settled for 30 min the coagulation conditions were set according to our previous study qi et al 2016c the supernatant samples were siphoned from 2 cm below the water surface to test for residual algae the optical density at 680 nm od680 of m aeruginosa has been reported to be positively related to cell density sorokin 1973 the linear relationship indicated the significant correlation between them fig s1 thus the residual algae was assessed by measuring od680 with a u 3100 spectrophotometer hitachi co japan in addition samples were siphoned for cell integrity detection and mucilage desorption tests after separation of the zn doped fe3o4 particles from the algal suspension the siphoned samples were divided into two subsamples the first sample was evaluated for cell integrity and density superoxide dismutase sod activity and tem characterization the remaining sample was immediately filtered through a 0 45 mm glass fiber filter for the analysis of doc and molecular weight mw distribution 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 structure and magnetic property characterization x ray diffraction xrd results were analyzed using highscore plus software version 3 0e and peaks were matched

integrity and density detection cell integrity was determined for individual cells using a flow cytometer facscalibur 4clr bd biosciences san jose usa equipped with an argon ion laser emitting at a fixed wavelength of 488 nm for fluorescence measurement sytox green nucleic acid stain was used to determine the cell integrity according to the method of daly daly et al 2007 cell density was analyzed for algal suspension by novocyte flow cytometer novocyte 1040 acea biosciences california usa full details of the cell integrity and density analysis are presented in text s2 2 3 4 sod activity the sod activity was tested by the enzychrom sod assay kit esod 100 bioassay systems 2 3 5 tem characterization of algae cells samples were immediately pre embedded with agarose after centrifugation fixed overnight in 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c and post fixed with 1 osmic acid for 2 h after washing three times in phosphate buffer solution 100 mm ph 7 2 the dehydration was performed with graded ethanol solutions the dehydrated samples were embedded in spi pon 812 followed by polymerization at 60 c for 48 h ultrathin sections 70 nm were cut with a leica em uc6 ultramicrotome stained with 2 uranyl acetate for 15 min and lead citrate for 5 min and examined using tem tecnai spirit fei 2 3 6 analysis of doc the doc concentration in the dissolved phase of algal suspensions was

technologies usa tsk gel g3000pwxl detector uv temperature 25 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure and magnetic properties of the zn doped fe3o4 particles the morphology and microstructure of the zn doped fe3o4 particles were investigated by tem and hrtem fig 1 a and fig 1b it can be seen in the figure that the particles were spherical with diameters in the range of 10 40 nm fig 1a the marked interplanar spacings of 2 54 å and 1 49 å in the lattice fringe high resolution tem image fig 1b are consistent with the spacings of the 311 and 440 lattice planes for fe3o4 respectively the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx element mappings of zn doped fe3o4 particles fig 1c e clearly showed a uniform distribution of zn fe and o elements in the particles xrd diffractograms of the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles are shown in fig 1f the phases present in zn doped fe3o4 were identified using xrd fig 1f and the diffraction peaks could be indexed to the cubic spinel structure with fd 3m space group jcpds 82 1049 the characteristic peaks at 2θ of 29 87 35 29 42 87 56 68 and 62 26 could be readily indexed to the 220 311 400 333 and 440 reflections of spinel respectively the magnetization curve in fig 1g showed an obvious hysteresis loop for the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles which is typical for the ferromagnetic type curves the saturation magnetization ms of the zn doped fe3o4 was estimated to be 66 2 emu g 1 which is lower than that of non doped fe3o4 particles 73 9 emu g 1 pan et al 2012 the synthesis methods associated with non magnetic impurity addition were reported to decrease the magnetization due to the disruption of the magnetic crystal structure liu et al 2012 in addition the ms value of 7 7 emu g 1 has been reported to be sufficient for the efficient capture of particles within 10 min using a 70 6 mt magnetic field qi et al 2017 thus the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles can be easily separated by magnetic separation as a magnetic field greater than 1 t has been used for ferric suspension separation from water in some high gradient magnetic separation hgms systems li et al 2012 2015 the application of hgms systems in separation was reported to have the advantages of energy saving easy handling low operating and investment cost and so on li et al 2012 therefore the magnetic separation of as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles from algal suspension can be realized with lower investment and maintenance cost 3 2 effect of photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles on enhanced coagulation for m aeruginosa removal to illustrate the effects of photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles on the removal of directly diluted m aeruginosa in source water the photocatalytic time was controlled from 0 to 6 h and the particle doses were 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 g l respectively fig 2 the removal of algae by al coagulation increased with prolonged photocatalytic time at all fixed photocatalyst doses when the catalyst dose was 0 05 g l the algae removal was increased from 10 to 96 with the prolonging of photocatalytic time from 0 to 360 min in addition the algae removal efficiency increased with elevated catalyst dose up to 0 05 g l but decreased at higher concentrations especially for the prolonged photocatalytic times of 120 240 and 360 min an elevated catalyst dose can increase the number of photogenerated electrons and holes which is beneficial to the destabilization of algae cells however the light absorption at the catalyst surface might be hindered by the light blocking effect with further elevation of the catalyst dose from 0 05 to 0 1 g l on the other hand an elevated dose can also correspondingly increase the recombination sites for photogenerated electrons and holes gu et al 2015 the separation and recombination of the carriers on the catalyst surface are balanced which is not conducive to the photocatalytic effect therefore the amount of catalyst should be controlled in the proper range to utilize the materials economically and effectively in addition only a small decrease of algae removal efficiency was observed with a catalyst subjected to three regeneration cycles for the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l fig s2 which indicated that the catalyst had good stability and could still be efficient after recycling moreover the ph value was almost unchanged after photocatalytic pretreatment and only a slight decrease was observed after the followed al coagulation fig s3 the photocatalyst can play a good role under the original ph condition of algal suspension which can further guarantee its feasibility in practical application 3 3 mechanisms in the removal of m aeruginosa cells by photocatalysis enhanced coagulation with magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles 3 3 1 effects of photocatalysis on m aeruginosa cell integrity and sod activity fig 3 illustrates the effects of photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles on algae cell integrity for photocatalyst doses from 0 to 0 1 g l the ratios of damaged cells were analyzed by flow cytometry sytox green nucleic acid stain was used to determine the percentage of damaged cells in a sample according to the method of daly daly et al 2007 sytox can permeate cells with damaged cell membranes and further induce higher fluorescence due to the staining of nucleic acids hence the algae cell integrity can be evaluated according to the variation of fluorescence after staining the cells the maintained cell integrity for the control without adding zn doped fe3o4 particles in fig 3 indicated that the sole irradiation by visible light used in this study could not induce the cell damage due to the lower light intensity in addition almost all of the algae cells maintained integrity even after 360 min photocatalysis as the ratios of damaged cells were all below 6 these results indicate that the photocatalytic effect of as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles did not damage the algae cells this can be further proved by the maintained algae cell density after photocatalysis in fig s4 photocatalysis has been utilized in many reported studies for the inactivation of algae cells chen et al 2018 gu et al 2016 jin et al 2018 pinho et al 2015 wang et al 2018b however the mechanism of all these studies was based on the destruction of algae cells which would induce the release of algal organic matter aom the released aom not only contains toxic substances but also serves as precursors for disinfection byproducts dbps fang et al 2010 qi et al 2016b compared with the previous studies the catalyst used here can realize the enhancement of algae removal without causing cell rupture and aom release problems sod has been reported to play a key role in the physiological process of resisting oxidation banci et al 2005 yang et al 2011 the dismutation of superoxide can be catalyzed by sod and thus eliminate the oxidative species inside the cells banci et al 2005 as shown in fig 4 the sod activity of the raw m aeruginosa suspension was about 0 37 10 6 u cells 1 whereas it increased markedly after photocatalysis at all the catalyst doses the highest sod activity value 0 89 10 6 u cells 1 was achieved by the 0 05 g l catalyst dose after 360 min photocatalysis the increased sod activity indicated that the algae cells were stimulated to resist the oxidative damage due to photocatalysis through the activation of sod similar results have also been reported for other treatment methods for the activation of m aeruginosa li et al 2011 xu et al 2016 therefore the higher sod activity value can directly prove the presence of stronger oxidation induced by photocatalysis notably the upward trend of sod activity at all the catalyst doses can further demonstrate the maintained cell integrity after photocatalysis otherwise the damage to cell integrity would induce a decline in sod activity due to the collapse of antioxidant defense huang et al 2012 li et al 2011 xu et al 2016 in addition the variation in sod activity is consistent with the algae removal shown in fig 2 which illustrates that the algae removal by subsequent coagulation is determined by the oxidation capacity in the photocatalytic process 3 3 2 effects of photocatalysis on mucilage desorption and characteristics of dom in m aeruginosa suspension moreover the mucilage on algae cells was found in our former study to not only interfere with the algae removal efficiency but also protect the algae cells from being damaged qi et al 2016a the mucilage includes all the surface bound organic matter on algae cells which contains not only the extracellular organic matter eom but also natural organic matter nom it has been reported to interfere the hydrolysis of coagulant through the direct interaction of its hydrophilic content with cations originated from coagulant takaara et al 2010 in addition the mucilage can serve as a protective barrier against environmental stress and thus protect the algae cell membrane from being attacked gonzález et al 2010 the desorption of mucilage without damaging the algae cells is the key to achieving moderate pretreatment by the photocatalytic process therefore the morphology of m aeruginosa cells before and after photocatalysis was characterized by tem to further investigate the photocatalytic inactivation effect of magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles fig 5 the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l was chosen because it was the most effective in improving m aeruginosa removal fig 2 as we can see from the images the m aeruginosa cells used in the experiment were of ovoid or spherical shape and around 4 0 μm in diameter in addition the presence of mucilage in the outside of algae cells can clearly be observed from fig 5a which is consistent with previous findings pinho et al 2015 the desorption of mucilage can be directly proved through the disappear of mucilaginous external layer after 360 min photocatalytic pretreatment comparing with the raw algae cell fig 5b the disappearance of mucilage in fig 5b indicated the damage induced by photocatalysis even though the cell integrity was proved to be maintained as shown in fig 3 the reactive oxygen species ros generated by the photocatalyst were measured by epr to further investigate the mechanism of photocatalytic pretreatment fig 6 signals with an intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 were clearly obtained in the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 suspension this result indicated that the photocatalytic pretreatment could effectively generate superoxide radicals which was responsible for the mucilage desorption therefore the improvement of algae removal in fig 2 can be explained by the mucilage desorption effect on algae cells during the photocatalytic process in addition the morphology of algae cells could still be maintained even after 360 min photocatalytic pretreatment combined with the results in fig 3 the catalyst used in this study can realize the improvement of algae removal without damaging the cell integrity which is similar to the effects of moderate pretreatment by chemical oxidants reported in our former study qi et al 2016a the mucilage has been reported to consume ros by redox reactions and prevent them from reaching the cell wall the highly functionalized organic polymers with amides carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can serve as ros scavengers planchon et al 2013 moreover the oxidizing ability of superoxide radicals are relatively weak comparing with hydroxyl radicals oh et al 2016 therefore moderate pretreatment of algae cells can be realized by photocatalytic process with the as synthesized zn doped fe3o4 particles fig 7 a shows the variation of doc values in the m aeruginosa suspension after photocatalysis by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles the elevation of catalyst dose from 0 to 0 05 g l increased the doc value throughout the photocatalysis period the doc value in the algal suspension increased e g to 1 96 mg l after the 360 min photocatalysis by 0 05 g l catalyst even though the ratios of damaged cells were below 6 fig 3 the membranes of undamaged algae cells should be intact otherwise the sytox green nucleic acid stain would penetrate cells through the damaged cell membranes and finally induce the variation of fluorescence after staining the nucleic acids of cells daly et al 2007 the intact cell membrane for undamaged algae cells can ensure the iom not to be released into water combined with the mucilage desorption results shown in fig 5 the increase in doc after photocatalysis can be inferred to be due to desorbed mucilage rather than released iom similar results were reported in our previous findings with moderate preoxidation qi et al 2016a in addition the decreased doc value with the further elevated catalyst dose from 0 05 to 0 1 g l can be explained by the light blocking effect and the balance between separation and recombination of carriers gu et al 2015 epr spectra for different doses of zn doped fe3o4 particles was analyzed to reflect the quantity variation of active species fig s5 the measurement was conducted for the photocatalytic system without algae cells to eliminate the interference the peak intensities were found to increase with the elevated photocatalyst doses the highest peak intensity was achieved with the catalyst dose of 0 1 g l which indicated the most quantity of active species however the most effective mucilage desorbing result was realized with the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l this inconsistent result can be explained by the light blocking effect of algae cells in the photocatalytic pretreatment system which can hinder the light absorption at the catalyst surface therefore there is no positive correlation between amount of photocatalyst and degree of mucilage desorption furthermore the peak intensities of epr spectra could also be enhanced by the increased light intensity with the catalyst dose of 0 05 g l fig s6 this result indicated that the quantity of superoxide radicals generated during the photocatalytic pretreatment could be increased through the enhancement of light intensity the light intensity used in this study was 50 mw cm2 which was at a relatively low level therefore the photocatalysis efficiency can be enhanced by the improved superoxide radical production which can finally shorten the illumination time needed for photocatalytic pretreatment in practical applications to further illustrate the increase in doc after the photocatalysis the mw distribution of dom in m aeruginosa suspension after photocatalysis by the 0 05 g l catalyst dose was also investigated as a function of photocatalysis time from 0 to 360 min fig 7b the mw distribution of dom in the m aeruginosa suspension was from 25422 da to 645 da as shown in fig 7b the response intensity of dom was enhanced with prolonged photocatalytic time over almost the whole mw distribution which is consistent with the observed increase in the doc value fig 7a additionally the results for samples after different photocatalytic time indicated that the mucilage desorbed was mainly of large or medium mw rather than small mw this is consistent with the former findings that mucilage with large or medium mw was easier to desorb compared to that with small mw ma et al 2012 qi et al 2018 the eem spectral result in fig s7 shows that the main type of desorbed mucilage was protein like substances with large mw peaks flu 3 and 4 organics with relatively large mw have been reported to play the role of bridging between algae cells and hydrolysates of coagulant which can finally enhance the coagulation efficiency bernhardt et al 1985 chen et al 2009 ma et al 2012 paralkar and edzwald 1996 in addition the interference of coagulant hydrolysis can be eliminated for the mucilage free algae cells takaara et al 2010 therefore the efficient m aeruginosa removal can be achieved by moderate photocatalysis enhanced coagulation with magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles 4 conclusions this study directly proved that the photocatalysis of algal suspensions by magnetic zn doped fe3o4 particles can effectively improve the algae removal in the subsequent coagulation process by causing mucilage desorption without damaging cell integrity the photocatalyst dose of 0 05 g l could achieve moderate preoxidation of m aeruginosa cells and the algae cells maintained integrity even after 360 min photocatalysis with moderate pretreatment cell rupture and aom release problems can be avoided the upward trend of sod activity with prolonged photocatalytic time can further demonstrate the oxidative function of photocatalysis along with maintaining cell integrity superoxide radicals were proved to be generated and involved in the desorption of mucilage from algae cells the algae removal by the coagulation process could be dramatically enhanced by the elevation of catalyst doses from 0 to 0 05 g l as more mucilage was desorbed from algae cells during the photocatalytic process thus the implementation of photocatalysis by zn doped fe3o4 particles may be practically applicable for the enhancement of algae removal in the subsequent coagulation process further verification needs to be conducted to extend the technology to other algal species and use in natural water bodies declaration of competing

18217,reclaiming abundant phosphorus from sewage sludge ss via pyrolysis for use as a fertilizer has gained increasing attention owing to the rapid depletion of global p reserves in this study the enhancement effect of ca based additives on sludge p transformation to hydroxylapatite through pyrolysis was systematically investigated three ca based additives were added in the pyrolysis of ss and they were found to promote the conversion of sludge p to hydroxylapatite which is bioavailable to plants the characterization of the sludge derived pyrochars indicated that the addition of 10 cao 5 ca oh 2 or 10 ca3 po4 2 facilitated peak hydroxylapatite production the thermodynamic simulation of the production of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis showed that these additives increased the enthalpy of the pyrolysis system furthermore the pyrolysis with cao addition had the lowest enthalpy thereby suggesting that the addition of cao during sludge pyrolysis was preferable for recovering sludge p in the form of hydroxylapatite moreover the hydroxylapatite produced with these additives was unstable when the pyrolysis temperature was above 900 c the pot experiment demonstrated the feasibility using the sludge derived pyrochars as p fertilizer for plant growth therefore changing the ca form and or ca p ratio with the addition of ca based additives could be an effective strategy for reclaiming p from ss in the form of hydroxylapatite and this demonstrates a pathway for global p sustainability by recycling p from p abundant wastes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge pyrolysis phosphorus transformation ca based additives hydroxylapatite p sustainability 1 introduction phosphorus is a non renewable but essential element for all living organisms in the synthesis of nucleic acid and the transfer of energy at the cell level conley et al 2009 it is estimated that the current worldwide p reserves will be exhausted within the next 50 100 y atienza martínez et al 2014 or even sooner at the current peak rate of production with the increasing population and strong demand for p based products such as fertilizers detergents and insecticides the depletion of p reserves threatens the future supply of p needed for agriculture and human life rahaman et al 2014 scholz et al 2013 considering that phosphate rocks are the exclusive sources of p and are non renewable there is a pressing need to find alternative p resources to ensure its sustainability it is well known that a large portion of p consumed by human activities eventually accumulates in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps through urban wastewater pipelines cieślik and konieczka 2017 for example in china over 28 million metric tons of dehydrated sewage sludge ss with a moisture content of 85 was generated in 2015 which needed to be urgently disposed of with fast volume reduction and in an environmentally benign manner as the wastewater in wwtps is processed soluble p is bound to or precipitated in ss the content of p in the ss can be up to 2 4 by weight depending on the source of the sewage and the sewage treatment process günther 1997 rappaport et al 1987 consequently ss rich in p is generated with the biological p removal technologies widely used in wwtps considering the continuous production of ss in wwtps it appears that p enriched sludge will be a substantial source of p huang et al 2015b shiba and ntuli 2017 previous studies focused on the recycling of p from the incinerated sewage sludge ash issa generated by combusting ss in the ambient atmosphere at 850 c biswas et al 2009 ottosen et al 2013 petzet et al 2012 wzorek et al 2006 compared with that of the raw sludge matrix the mass content of p enriched in issa reached approximately 8 wt biswas et al 2009 however the p in issa cannot be directly utilized by plants as a fertilizer owing to its inert bioavailability kleemann et al 2017 currently the research on recovering p from issa mainly includes acidic leaching alkaline leaching thermal treatment and electrodialysis guedes et al 2014 petzet et al 2012 in addition a direct recovery method of p from ss has been explored by meyer et al 2018 who found that p fertilizer derived from ss through sequential extraction by resin and nahco3 was almost as effective as the reference water soluble p fertilizer a key issue with these methods is achieving efficient separation of p and heavy metals concentrated in issa after combustion herzel et al 2016 furthermore even if these methods could separate p and the heavy metals in issa to some extent other concerns still persist such as the complexity of the process significant consumption of chemicals and the large number of by products that are produced donatello and cheeseman 2013 ebbers et al 2015 fang et al 2018 guedes et al 2014 therefore a satisfactory approach to recover p from ss should not only reconcile the presence of heavy metals but also enhance the biocompatibility and bioavailability of p so that it can be directly used the bioavailability of heavy metals in ss is rapidly reduced after pyrolysis involving the occurrence of various thermochemical reactions in an oxygen limited or absent atmosphere devi and saroha 2014 jin et al 2016 li et al 2018 natural p minerals are mainly composed of three morphologies of apatite with a general formula of ca5 po4 3x x oh f or cl kazin et al 2014 among these three forms the apatite with x oh i e hydroxylapatite is the most abundant morphology in natural p rocks and is more stable and easier to generate lower steven et al 1998 furthermore it has been recognized that hydroxylapatite is biocompatible with soil and can enhance plant growth jiang et al 2012 therefore specifically transforming the p in ss to hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis seems to be the most reasonable method to realize the optimal recycling of p as shown in equation 1 joris and amberg 1971 kreidler and hummel 1970 the production of hydroxylapatite depends strongly on the value of x ranging from 0 to 1 x 0 and x 1 indicated the maximum and minimum content respectively where the corresponding ca p molar ratio falls within 1 67 x 0 to 1 50 x 1 accordingly the enrichment of hydroxylapatite can be achieved by adjusting the ca p ratio furthermore the forms of ca and p determine the evolution of the generated hydroxylapatite thus efficiently converting the p in ss to the species of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis is crucial to reclaiming sludge p resources therefore simultaneously adjusting the ca p ratio and the forms of ca and p is expected to promote the formation of the desired p mineral furthermore it is necessary to study the effects of different chemical forms of ca on hydroxylapatite formation to achieve an optimal method of enrichment this in turn provide a solution for the disposal of ss and recycling of p as a fertilizer 1 c a 10 x p o 4 6 x h p o 4 x o h 2 x s i n t e r i n g 1 x c a 10 p o 4 6 o h 2 3 x c a 3 p o 4 2 in this work we investigated the production of hydroxylapatite during ss pyrolysis by simultaneously adjusting the molar ratios of ca p and changing the forms of ca and p using common chemicals three ca p based chemicals namely cao ca oh 2 and ca3 po4 2 were used and the addition ratios were changed with reference to cao addition 5 50 in addition to understand the regulation mechanism of the ca p ratio on the evolution of hydroxylapatite thermodynamic simulation using the principle of gibbs free energy minimization was performed for the ss pyrolysis process the results are expected to guide the recovery of p from ss with the addition of feasible ca based additives during sludge pyrolysis thereby further facilitating p recovery and reclamation in practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sample preparation the ss with a moisture content of 85 90 was sampled from a wwtp located in shenzhen china in this wwtp the municipal sewage was treated by biological active sludge treatment units the dewatered sludge was heated in an oven at 105 c for 2 days then oven dried sludge samples were sequentially ground screened and sieved with a 100 mesh screen to collect the sludge sample for further use the composition characteristics of the sludge feedstock to be used in the experiments are listed in table 1 2 2 pyrolysis of sewage sludge the pyrolysis of ss was conducted in a lab scale horizontal electric heated tube furnace nbd 1200 nobody china the sludge samples were placed in a quartz combustion chamber with a length of 1000 mm and inner diameter of 80 mm the pyrolysis temperatures of the raw ss were 300 500 700 and 900 c which were within the commonly used temperature range of ss pyrolysis chen et al 2014 yu et al 2018 heating was conducted at a constant heating rate of 10 c min with n2 as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 100 ml min the weighed raw sludge which was approximately 10 00 g was held in an alumina crucible the crucible was immediately pushed to the center of the combustion chamber and held for 60 min upon the furnace reaching the desired pyrolysis temperature when the heating program ended the alumina crucible was immediately moved to the end of the chamber and then quenched by means of purging with n2 the sludge derived pyrochars were collected and labeled as per the pyrolysis temperature to explore the enhancement effect of different ratios of ca to p and the chemical form of ca on p speciation during the ss pyrolysis three types of additives namely cao 99 95 alfa aesar usa ca oh 2 95 00 macklin china and ca3 po4 2 96 00 aladdin china were employed these additives were adequately mixed with the raw sludge at different mass ratios of 5 10 15 20 and 50 by a ball mill the amount of ca oh 2 and ca3 po4 2 added was based on the amount of ca in cao to maintain the same ratio of ca p with the three different additives since the temperature dominated the production of hydroxylapatite as revealed by equation 1 a lower temperature 500 c and a higher temperature 900 c were selected among the above four temperatures to pyrolyze the mixed sludge samples under the same operating conditions as those of the raw sludge the mixed sludge samples were pyrolyzed at 500 c and 900 c under the same operating conditions as those of the raw sludge the sludge derived pyrochars were labeled according to the mass ratio and pyrolysis temperature for example the label 15 ca3 po4 2 900 c represented pyrochar generated from the pyrolysis of the sludge with the addition of 15 ca3 po4 2 at 900 c 2 3 the determination of total phosphorus content the content of total phosphorus in the sludge and derived sludge pyrochars was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry cary 60 agilent usa the method for measuring the quantity of total phosphorus was based on the method reported by huang and tang 2015 and tang et al 2018 prior to the measurement the sludge feedstock and its derived pyrochars were first combusted in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 2 h and the obtained residues were dissolved in 1m hcl solution followed by a vibration at a rotational speed of 180 rpm in a shaker next the solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm in a centrifuge st40 thermo fisher usa the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and the filtrate was analyzed at 700 nm using the uv vis spectrophotometer the standard curve of the total phosphorus using kh2po4 as standard shown in fig s1 was made in accordance with the national standard method hj 631 2011 2 4 characterization of phosphorus speciation quantitative 31p solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker 600 mhz avance iii hd wide bore spectrometer with magic angle spinning mas the solid samples were packed into a zirconia rotor and rotated at a spinning speed of 12 khz the parameters of data acquisition using direct polarization mode were 2048 data points over an acquisition time of 20 9 ms a recycle delay of 30 s and 400 scans chemical shift corrections were externally referenced to nh4 2hpo4 at 1 0 ppm the processing of the nmr spectra was accomplished by using mestrenova software version 8 1 4 additionally x ray photoelectron spectra xps were obtained using a physical electronic phi 5000 versaprobe iii spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev and the most frequently used x ray setting was 200 μm 50 w 15 kv all spectra were corrected to the main line of the c 1s spectrum adventitious c and set to a binding energy of 284 8 ev the acquired data were analyzed using phi multipak software version 9 8 the shirley background subtraction method was used to fit the curve line shape with the gaussian lorentzian function the x ray powder diffraction xrd patterns of the mixed sludge and derived pyrochars were obtained using a rigaku smartlab powder diffractometer equipped with cu kα radiation operating at 45 kv and 200 ma the scanning was conducted in the 2θ range between 10 and 80 with a scan speed corresponding to 2 min in addition the pyrochar samples were measured by fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 thermal scientific usa the samples blended with kbr at a ratio of 1 200 were pelletized and the spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 2 cm 1 2 5 thermodynamic simulation for phosphorus speciation during sludge pyrolysis after determining the chemical composition of the raw sludge and the blending ratio of the additives p transformation towards equilibrium conditions of the pyrolysis reaction could be predicted using factsage software bale et al 2016 this software is specialized in describing equilibrium ash properties the behavior of p and thermodynamic parameters in the factsage platform version 7 2 three main principles namely mass balance energy balance and minimum gibbs free energy are involved in the simulation of sludge pyrolysis bale et al 2016 the criterion directed in this calculation is to minimize the gibbs free energy based on two hypotheses li et al 2012 that is 1 all the input reactants were considered ideal substances and were assumed to be completely mixed when two or more substances were defined as being in the same phase and 2 the initial system would eventually reach steady state equilibrium in thermodynamics in the thermodynamic simulation we chose the equilib module which is the main force for gibbs energy minimization in factsage it calculated the concentrations of chemical substance when specified elements or compounds reached chemical equilibrium bale et al 2009 we input the sludge composition with different mass ratios of additives based in 1 g of ss and chose the ftoxid database mineral and ftmisc database miscellaneous for possible products pure solid and gas determination the pyrolysis temperature was selected in the range of 300 1200 c with an increment of 100 c and the total pressure of the sludge pyrolysis system closed system was assumed to be 1 atm the total gibbs energy of the pyrolysis system can be calculated using equation 2 by minimizing the total gibbs energy of the system the combinations of n i p i and x i could be determined 2 g i d e a l g a s n i g i o r t ln p i p u r e c o n d e n s e d p h a s e s n i g i o s o l u t i o n 1 n i g i o r t ln x i r t ln γ i s o l u t

performed using these pyrochars as a fertilizer the chemical characteristics of the soil feedstock are listed in table s1 in this study a soil sample was which free from heavy metal contamination in accordance with the chinese standard for soil quality was collected in the sustech campus shenzhen china table s2 the obtained soil was air dried and then sequentially ground screened and passed through a 2 mm sieve for further use five hundred grams of the soil was adequately mixed with the sludge derived pyrochars at two different mass ratios namely 1 and 4 the pyrochars were harvested from the pyrolyzed sludge samples with the addition of 15 ca based additives at 500 c and 900 c ryegrass which is sensitive to the abundance or paucity of p in fertilizer during growth was selected a duplicate experiment was conducted and a control experiment was also conducted as a blank run without the addition of sludge pyrochar to serve as a reference after the ryegrass was grown for 30 d it was harvested and photographs were taken which are shown in fig s2 the height and chlorophyll content of the obtained ryegrass were determined to evaluate its growth olorunfemi et al 2008 the determination of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll in fresh leaves was based on the standard method of arnon 1949 3 results and discussion 3 1 total p content in the sludge samples and sludge derived pyrochars fig 1 presents the pyrochar yields and their total p tp content the calculation of the tp mass balance showed that the p in the ss was almost retained in the pyrochars obtain from the pyrolysis of either the raw sludge or the mixed sludge samples table s3 as shown in fig 1 a the pyrochar yield increased with the increase in the addition of ca based additives the three additives showed different effects on the production of pyrochar depending on the pyrolysis temperature an increase in the pyrolysis temperature led to a decrease in the pyrochar yield because the increased pyrolysis temperature induced the yield of pyrolysis gas the yield of pyrochar tended to decline liu et al 2015 these results indicated that the form of ca or the ratio of ca p influenced the pyrolytic reactions of the ss which was reflected in the amount of produced pyrochar chanaka udayanga et al 2019 the change in the tp in the sludge derived pyrochar when ca based additives were added during the pyrolysis was determined as shown in fig 1 b the tp contents in the raw sludge pyrochar at 500 c and 900 c were 2 87 104 mg kg and 3 83 104 mg kg of dry sludge respectively when the ca based additives were mixed with the raw sludge the sludge derived pyrochars showed lowered tp contents compared with those of the pyrochars derived from the raw sludge except in the case of ca3 po4 2 this might have been attributed to the decomposition of organic components in the sludge feedstock which could be observed from the decreased intensities of the organic functional bonds in the derived sludge see in fig s3 furthermore an increase in the addition of cao and ca oh 2 appeared to decrease the content of tp in the sludge derived pyrochars while an increase in the addition of ca3 po4 2 increased the tp content which could be attributed to the introduction of p considering the results of the sludge biochar yield the change in the tp content in the sludge biochar varied with the form of ca and or the ratio of ca p 3 2 characteristics of phosphorus speciation during sludge pyrolysis with calcium based additives precisely characterizing the distribution behaviors of p in pyrochar is crucial to understand the effects of ca based additives or the ratio of ca p on the recovery of p the cutting edge technique of solid state 31p mas nmr was used to measure the species of p in the sludge derived pyrochars and was supplemented by p 2p xps and xrd fig 2 a c e show the obtained solid state 31p mas nmr of the sludge derived pyrochars when the sludge samples with ca based additives were pyrolyzed at 900 c the resonance centered at a chemical shift of 3 8 ppm was considered to be the center band reflecting the isotropic 31p chemical shift while the other resonances symmetrically spaced from the center band were spinning sidebands represented by the spades bleam et al 1989 deconvolution for the spectra in the range of 20 ppm 20 ppm was performed to quantify the species of p cade menun 2005 a lorentzian 80 gaussian 20 function was employed in the spectral deconvolution and the resulting deconvolution is shown in figs s4 6 fig 2 b d f show the fractions of the p species identified in the pyrochars according to the particular chemical shift characteristics of each p species detailed data for the fractions of these identified species are presented in table s4 for the pyrochar derived from the pyrolysis of raw sludge the al p i e al2 oh 3po4 76 8 and alpo4 12 4 were the main p subcomponents fig s7 this could be ascribed to the use of al containing flocculants for the enhancement of ss dewatering in the sewage treatment process golob et al 2005 when these three ca based additives were added during the ss pyrolysis the speciation of p changed dramatically with the ratio of addition we found that the addition of ca based additives transformed the p present mostly in the form of inorganic p species including al p and hydroxylapatite ca5 po4 3oh the new species of hydroxylapatite with a low dissociation constant and a high bioavailability for plant growth misra and chaturvedi 2007 suhartono et al 2015 strengthened the feasibility of the use of sludge derived pyrochars as slow release p fertilizer meyer et al 2018 also observed that the presence of p in the form of hydroxylapatite in rock phosphate can promote plant growth thus the addition of ca based additives was beneficial to the formation of hydroxylapatite however the benefit differed based on the additive and ratio as shown in fig 2 b the p subcomponents identified in the sludge derived pyrochars from the pyrolysis of sludge with cao addition included orthophosphate orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diesters polyphosphate with a terminal p group and hydroxylapatite the addition of cao promoted the transformation of organic p to inorganic p species orthophosphate polyphosphate with terminal p group and hydroxylapatite which was evident from p the increased fraction of inorganic p orthophosphate monoesters were the main forms of organic p while orthophosphate and hydroxylapatite were the main forms of inorganic p as the addition of cao increased the fraction of organic p decreased sharply while the fraction of inorganic p increased particularly the fraction of hydroxylapatite increased with the increase in cao addition when the addition was below 10 however it decreased when the addition was increased further therefore the optimal fraction 37 53 of hydroxylapatite was achieved with the addition of 10 cao table s4 in the case of ca oh 2 the same p subcomponents were identified in the sludge derived pyrochars the trends of the fractions of inorganic p and organic p were similar to those in the case of cao addition furthermore the change in the hydroxylapatite fraction was consistent with that observed in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludge with cao addition however the promotion effect of the transformation of organic p to inorganic p induced by the addition of ca oh 2 was inferior to that induced by the addition of cao this effect was also reflected in the change in the hydroxylapatite fraction when the two additions were compared we found that the addition of 5 ca oh 2 results in the peak hydroxylapatite fraction this result indicated that the ca form influenced the formation of hydroxylapatite in the process of ss pyrolysis the fraction of orthophosphate in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludge with ca oh 2 addition tended to decrease with the increase in ca oh 2 addition over 5 compared with that of cao addition which supported the previous statement as shown in fig 2 f the enhancement of the transformation of organic p to inorganic p induced by ca3 po4 2 became weaker compared with that in the case of the former two ca based additives the case with 10 ca3 po4 2 addition appeared to reach the peak hydroxylapatite fraction in addition the decreasing trend of the orthophosphate fraction in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludge with ca3 po4 2 addition occurred with the increase in addition these results verified that the ratio of ca p as well as the form influenced the formation of hydroxylapatite in the process of ss pyrolysis and this forms the basis for a strategy for the recovery of p from the ss to further support the analysis of p speciation in the derived sludge pyrochars in accordance with the obtained 31p nmr spectra the p 2p xps and xrd techniques were specifically used fig 3 a b c show the p 2p xps spectra of the sludge derived pyrochars after pyrolysis and the spectral deconvolution was performed on these spectra fig 3 d e f show the resulting fraction of p associated species from the spectral deconvolution we found that inorganic p bound to the ca related minerals ca hpo4 2 and ca2p2o7 as well as the al related minerals alpo4 was identified in the pyrochar derived from the pyrolysis of raw sludge when these ca based additives were added to the raw sludge the new p species of hydroxylapatite was identified in all the sludge derived pyrochars and the dehydration of alpo4 produced anhydrous berlinite this indicated the evolution of p bound minerals related to the pyrolytic reactions during sludge pyrolysis as also revealed by the c 1s xps spectra fig s8 as for the change in the hydroxylapatite fraction with the increasing addition of ca based additives the maximum fraction of hydroxylapatite was obtained with 10 cao addition 5 ca oh 2 addition or 10 ca3 po4 2 addition this was in good agreement with the results found in the aforementioned analysis of 31p nmr spectra the fractional change in al p between alpo4 and berlinite with the increasing addition of ca based additives showed that the dehydration of alpo4 was enhanced to form berlinite whose fraction was negligible because alpo4 with bound water cannot be detected using the 31p nmr technique the trend of the al p fraction with the addition observed in the analysis of p 2p xps spectra was consistent with that in the analysis of 31p nmr spectra the difference between the nmr and xps results for the number of p species might have been due to the different principles of the nmr and xps techniques the nmr technique detects the spin orbit difference of the nucleus and the xps technique does not consider this difference when detecting the photoelectron energy andrade 1985 wolff and ziegler 1998 additional information revealed by the xrd patterns of all the sludge derived pyrochars was obtained for the evolution of the mineral phase and is presented in fig 4 in the xrd patterns of the raw sludge derived pyrochar sio2 and cao were identified as the main phase fig s9 after adding ca based additives the main phases identified in the sludge derived pyrochars included caco3 ca5 po4 3 oh cao ca oh 2 ca3 po4 2 and cahx po4 moreover their intensity changed with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature as shown in fig 4 we found that the intensity of these additives was strengthened when the mass ratio of ca based additives exceeded 15 thereby suggesting their excess after pyrolysis the major phase of caco3 formed in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludges with cao addition and ca oh 2 addition appeared at 500 c but disappeared at 900 c which revealed that the increasing temperature could enhance the reactions of cao and ca oh 2 with the sludge matrix in p transformation during pyrolysis however the intensities of these detected major phases were changed slightly with the increase in the addition of ca based additives the addition of ca based additives appeared to enhance the formation of hydroxylapatite as indicated by the increased intensities importantly the intensity of hydroxylapatite in the sludge derived pyrochars was notably larger at 900 c compared with that at 500 c which revealed that the production of hydroxylapatite could be thermodynamics dependent the al associated minerals were not identified in the obtained xrd patterns possibly due to the dilution effect caused by the introduction of ca based additives in addition the cahx po4 phase present in the derived pyrochars pyrolyzed with the addition of ca based additives at 900 c revealed that curbing the development of cahx po4 at a high temperature during sludge pyrolysis could increase hydroxylapatite production therefore the supplementary characterizations of p 2p xps and xrd further supported that the change in ca form and or ca p ratio can be regarded as an effective strategy to recover p resources from ss in the form of hydroxylapatite 3 3 thermodynamic simulation of hydroxylapatite production during sludge pyrolysis with calcium based additives as stated above section 3 2 the formation of hydroxylapatite strongly depend on the pyrolysis temperature thus performing thermodynamic simulation of hydroxylapatite production during sludge pyrolyzed with the addition of ca based additives can improve the understanding of the transformation of sludge p fig 5 shows the resulting concentration of hydroxylapatite generated when the process of sludge pyrolysis reached equilibrium at the determined temperatures the largest concentration 0 052 g g ss of hydroxylapatite in the raw sludge derived pyrochar was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature between 700 c and 900 c and as the temperature increased beyond 900 c its concentration approached near zero fig s10 after adding the ca based additives the concentration of hydroxylapatite increased by 180 0 1460 g g ss 165 0 1379 g g ss and 165 0 1379 g g ss in the pyrochars derived from sludge with cao addition ca oh 2 addition and ca3 po4 2 addition at 900 c respectively compared with that 0 0520 g g ss in the raw sludge derived pyrochar this indicated that the addition of ca based additives could enhance the conversion of p to hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis which was consistent with the experimental results more specifically when the pyrolysis temperature was higher than 1000 c the concentration of hydroxyapatite in the sludge derived pyrochars decreased by 16 58 as shown in fig 5 a and b when the addition of cao and ca oh 2 was below 15 the trends of hydroxylapatite production between pyrolysis of sludge with ca addition and sludge with ca oh 2 addition at equilibrium were similar as long as the pyrolysis temperature was below 900 c table s5 while the difference in hydroxylapatite production appeared to become pronounced when the temperature approached 900 c at which the concentrations of hydroxylapatite were 0 1460 g g ss and 0 1379 g g ss in the pyrochar derived from sludge with cao addition and ca oh 2 addition respectively with the further increase in the additives i e beyond 15 the equilibrium content of hydroxylapatite 0 3312 g g remained constant as long as the pyrolysis temperature was below 900 c the content of hydroxylapatite decreased notably with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature beyond 900 c and this revealed that the hydroxylapatite phase was not stable above 900 c on the other hand the hydroxylapatite production at equilibrium during the pyrolysis of sludge with ca3 po4 2 addition remained nearly constant with the increase in pyrolysis temperature while an increase in the addition markedly increased the equilibrium content of the hydroxylapatite as shown in fig 5 c it was also observed that when the pyrolysis temperature was over 900 c a clear decrease in the hydroxylapatite production occurred which confirmed the stability of hydroxylapatite shown in the cases of sludge with cao and ca oh 2 addition the differences in the production of hydroxylapatite with the addition of different ca based additives indicated that the form of ca and or the change in the ca p ratio influenced the transformation of p in the sludge to hydroxylapatite in addition the enthalpy increased with the increase in the amount of ca based additives or the increase in the pyrolysis temperature fig 5 d however the enthalpy during the pyrolysis of sludge with cao showed the lowest values which suggested that cao was preferable for the conversion of sludge p to hydroxylapatite in terms of the energy input to the pyrolysis system a difference in the hydroxylapatite production between the experimental and simulated results was observed as shown in fig 5 the difference could have been attributed to the hypothesis used in the simulation huang et al 2015a and the limitations in the experimental determination of the hydroxylapatite content jäger et al 2006 in the simulation the method of gibbs free energy minimization was adopted to calculate the pyrolysis system reaching the thermodynamic steady state based on two hypotheses li et al 2012 specifically all input reactants were considered ideal substances and they were assumed to be completely mixed when two or more substances were allocated as being in the same phase the initial pyrolysis system would eventually reach steady state equilibrium in thermodynamics however this discrepancy did not affect the simulation of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis with the addition of ca based additives to gain a deep insight into the transformation of sludge p during sludge pyrolysis for efficient recovery therefore it could be inferred that the introduction of ca based additives enhanced the transformation of sludge p to hydroxylapatite which is preferred by plants and the addition of cao appeared to be an optimal solution for the enhancement of hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis in terms of energy savings 3 4 environmental application fig 6 shows the growth of ryegrass in terms of height and chlorophyll a b contents with the utilization of the sludge derived pyrochars as a prospective p fertilizer as shown in fig 6 a the ryegrass in the control group had an average plant height 20 randomly selected ryegrasses plants were measured of 9 3 cm whereas the average plant heights of ryegrass in the experimental groups were increased this indicated that the derived pyrochars from the pyrolysis of sludge with the addition of ca based additives could be beneficial to the growth of ryegrass furthermore by comparing the heights of the ryegrass in the experimental runs it was noticed that the plants that utilized the pyrochars produced at 900 c were taller than those that utilized the pyrochars produced at 500 c this suggested that p enriched in the pyrochars produced at 900 c was more amenable to be adsorbed by ryegrass during growth in other words the enhancement effect of the sludge derived pyrochars on plant growth was strengthened with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature the chlorophyll content in the blank control run was 1 15 mg g and the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b was 2 2 except for the experimental group with the addition of pyrochar labeled 15 ca3 po4 2 900 c at a blending ratio of 1 the contents of chlorophyll in the other experimental groups were higher than that of the control group furthermore the content of chlorophyll varied with the blending ratio and the pyrolysis temperature we found that the content of chlorophyll in the ryegrass plants that utilized the pyrochars labeled 15 cao 500 c 15 ca oh 2 900 c and 15 ca3 po4 2 900 c reached their local peaks when the blending ratios were 4 1 and 4 respectively this result was in agreement with that observed in the resulting ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b in addition meyer et al 2018 found that hydroxylapatite from rock phosphate can be employed as a p fertilizer for ryegrass growth it could be inferred that the bioavailability of p in the derived sludge pyrochars was related to i the difference in the ca form and or ca p ratio with the addition of ca based additives and ii the increase in the blending ratio which tended to enhance the uptake of p during plant growth in terms of the energy savings for the pyrochar preparation the addition of cao appeared to be advantageous in sludge p transformation this agreed well with the findings in the theoretical simulation for sludge p transformation to hydroxylapatite through pyrolysis therefore the results from this bioassay established that pyrochars derived from the addition of ca based additives can be employed as a novel p fertilizer to promote plant growth based on the aforementioned results the introduction of ca based additives during sludge pyrolysis can promote the conversion of p to hydroxylapatite in produced pyrochars a scheme was proposed for the enhancement of the addition of ca based additives in sludge p transformation to hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis as shown in fig 7 previous studies confirmed that sludge p is composed of orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diester orthophosphate polyphosphate and p bound minerals ca p and al p huang and tang 2015 tang et al 2018 without the addition of ca based additives the sludge p species were mainly comprised of al p minerals al2 oh 3po4 and a portion of ca2p2o7 after pyrolysis which cannot be easily absorbed by the plants however when ca based additives were added during sludge pyrolysis the transformed sludge p was mainly present in ca p particularly hydroxylapatite the addition of cao ca oh 2 and ca3 po4 2 enhanced the transformation of sludge p to hydroxylapatite jin et al 2016 we found that the addition of 10 cao 5 ca oh 2 or 10 ca3 po4 2 facilitated peak hydroxylapatite production simultaneously the addition of ca based additives to some degree decreased the apparent content of al p minerals which are harmful for plant growth thereby facilitating the agricultural utilization of pyrochar rich in p in the form of hydroxylapatite therefore reclaiming p from ss via pyrolysis with the addition of ca based additives could be an effective strategy for enriching p in pyrochar in the form of hydroxylapatite to be utilized in agriculture 4 conclusion the transformation of sludge p during pyrolysis with the addition of ca based additives was investigated in this study the ca based additives were beneficial to the conversion of p in the ss to hydroxylapatite which is more amenable to absorption by plants than other p associated phases such as al p the addition of 10 cao 5 ca oh 2 or 10 ca3 po4 2 facilitated the peak production of hydroxylapatite the thermodynamic simulation of hydroxylapatite production during pyrolysis demonstrated that these three additives increased the enthalpy of the total pyrolysis system and the addition of cao resulted in the lowest enthalpy of sludge pyrolysis this implied that the addition of cao during ss pyrolysis may be considered preferentially over the other two ca based additive to recover sludge p in the form of hydroxylapatite in terms of energy savings the pot experiment verified that the pyrochar derived from the pyrolysis of ss with the addition of ca based additives can be regarded as p fertilizer to promote plant growth author contributions the experiment was conducted by jingjing chen and the manuscript was written through the contributions of all

18217,reclaiming abundant phosphorus from sewage sludge ss via pyrolysis for use as a fertilizer has gained increasing attention owing to the rapid depletion of global p reserves in this study the enhancement effect of ca based additives on sludge p transformation to hydroxylapatite through pyrolysis was systematically investigated three ca based additives were added in the pyrolysis of ss and they were found to promote the conversion of sludge p to hydroxylapatite which is bioavailable to plants the characterization of the sludge derived pyrochars indicated that the addition of 10 cao 5 ca oh 2 or 10 ca3 po4 2 facilitated peak hydroxylapatite production the thermodynamic simulation of the production of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis showed that these additives increased the enthalpy of the pyrolysis system furthermore the pyrolysis with cao addition had the lowest enthalpy thereby suggesting that the addition of cao during sludge pyrolysis was preferable for recovering sludge p in the form of hydroxylapatite moreover the hydroxylapatite produced with these additives was unstable when the pyrolysis temperature was above 900 c the pot experiment demonstrated the feasibility using the sludge derived pyrochars as p fertilizer for plant growth therefore changing the ca form and or ca p ratio with the addition of ca based additives could be an effective strategy for reclaiming p from ss in the form of hydroxylapatite and this demonstrates a pathway for global p sustainability by recycling p from p abundant wastes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge pyrolysis phosphorus transformation ca based additives hydroxylapatite p sustainability 1 introduction phosphorus is a non renewable but essential element for all living organisms in the synthesis of nucleic acid and the transfer of energy at the cell level conley et al 2009 it is estimated that the current worldwide p reserves will be exhausted within the next 50 100 y atienza martínez et al 2014 or even sooner at the current peak rate of production with the increasing population and strong demand for p based products such as fertilizers detergents and insecticides the depletion of p reserves threatens the future supply of p needed for agriculture and human life rahaman et al 2014 scholz et al 2013 considering that phosphate rocks are the exclusive sources of p and are non renewable there is a pressing need to find alternative p resources to ensure its sustainability it is well known that a large portion of p consumed by human activities eventually accumulates in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps through urban wastewater pipelines cieślik and konieczka 2017 for example in china over 28 million metric tons of dehydrated sewage sludge ss with a moisture content of 85 was generated in 2015 which needed to be urgently disposed of with fast volume reduction and in an environmentally benign manner as the wastewater in wwtps is processed soluble p is bound to or precipitated in ss the content of p in the ss can be up to 2 4 by weight depending on the source of the sewage and the sewage treatment process günther 1997 rappaport et al 1987 consequently ss rich in p is generated with the biological p removal technologies widely used in wwtps considering the continuous production of ss in wwtps it appears that p enriched sludge will be a substantial source of p huang et al 2015b shiba and ntuli 2017 previous studies focused on the recycling of p from the incinerated sewage sludge ash issa generated by combusting ss in the ambient atmosphere at 850 c biswas et al 2009 ottosen et al 2013 petzet et al 2012 wzorek et al 2006 compared with that of the raw sludge matrix the mass content of p enriched in issa reached approximately 8 wt biswas et al 2009 however the p in issa cannot be directly utilized by plants as a fertilizer owing to its inert bioavailability kleemann et al 2017 currently the research on recovering p from issa mainly includes acidic leaching alkaline leaching thermal treatment and electrodialysis guedes et al 2014 petzet et al 2012 in addition a direct recovery method of p from ss has been explored by meyer et al 2018 who found that p fertilizer derived from ss through sequential extraction by resin and nahco3 was almost as effective as the reference water soluble p fertilizer a key issue with these methods is achieving efficient separation of p and heavy metals concentrated in issa after combustion herzel et al 2016 furthermore even if these methods could separate p and the heavy metals in issa to some extent other concerns still persist such as the complexity of the process significant consumption of chemicals and the large number of by products that are produced donatello and cheeseman 2013 ebbers et al 2015 fang et al 2018 guedes et al 2014 therefore a satisfactory approach to recover p from ss should not only reconcile the presence of heavy metals but also enhance the biocompatibility and bioavailability of p so that it can be directly used the bioavailability of heavy metals in ss is rapidly reduced after pyrolysis involving the occurrence of various thermochemical reactions in an oxygen limited or absent atmosphere devi and saroha 2014 jin et al 2016 li et al 2018 natural p minerals are mainly composed of three morphologies of apatite with a general formula of ca5 po4 3x x oh f or cl kazin et al 2014 among these three forms the apatite with x oh i e hydroxylapatite is the most abundant morphology in natural p rocks and is more stable and easier to generate lower steven et al 1998 furthermore it has been recognized that hydroxylapatite is biocompatible with soil and can enhance plant growth jiang et al 2012 therefore specifically transforming the p in ss to hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis seems to be the most reasonable method to realize the optimal recycling of p as shown in equation 1 joris and amberg 1971 kreidler and hummel 1970 the production of hydroxylapatite depends strongly on the value of x ranging from 0 to 1 x 0 and x 1 indicated the maximum and minimum content respectively where the corresponding ca p molar ratio falls within 1 67 x 0 to 1 50 x 1 accordingly the enrichment of hydroxylapatite can be achieved by adjusting the ca p ratio furthermore the forms of ca and p determine the evolution of the generated hydroxylapatite thus efficiently converting the p in ss to the species of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis is crucial to reclaiming sludge p resources therefore simultaneously adjusting the ca p ratio and the forms of ca and p is expected to promote the formation of the desired p mineral furthermore it is necessary to study the effects of different chemical forms of ca on hydroxylapatite formation to achieve an optimal method of enrichment this in turn provide a solution for the disposal of ss and recycling of p as a fertilizer 1 c a 10 x p o 4 6 x h p o 4 x o h 2 x s i n t e r i n g 1 x c a 10 p o 4 6 o h 2 3 x c a 3 p o 4 2 in this work we investigated the production of hydroxylapatite during ss pyrolysis by simultaneously adjusting the molar ratios of ca p and changing the forms of ca and p using common chemicals three ca p based chemicals namely cao ca oh 2 and ca3 po4 2 were used and the addition ratios were changed with reference to cao addition 5 50 in addition to understand the regulation mechanism of the ca p ratio on the evolution of hydroxylapatite thermodynamic simulation using the principle of gibbs free energy minimization was performed for the ss pyrolysis process the results are expected to guide the recovery of p from ss with the addition of feasible ca based additives during sludge pyrolysis thereby further facilitating p recovery and reclamation in practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sample preparation the ss with a moisture content of 85 90 was sampled from a wwtp located in shenzhen china in this wwtp the municipal sewage was treated by biological active sludge treatment units the dewatered sludge was heated in an oven at 105 c for 2 days then oven dried sludge samples were sequentially ground screened and sieved with a 100 mesh screen to collect the sludge sample for further use the composition characteristics of the sludge feedstock to be used in the experiments are listed in table 1 2 2 pyrolysis of sewage sludge the pyrolysis of ss was conducted in a lab scale horizontal electric heated tube furnace nbd 1200 nobody china the sludge samples were placed in a quartz combustion chamber with a length of 1000 mm and inner diameter of 80 mm the pyrolysis temperatures of the raw ss were 300 500 700 and 900 c which were within the commonly used temperature range of ss pyrolysis chen et al 2014 yu et al 2018 heating was conducted at a constant heating rate of 10 c min with n2 as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 100 ml min the weighed raw sludge which was approximately 10 00 g was held in an alumina crucible the crucible was immediately pushed to the center of the combustion chamber and held for 60 min upon the furnace reaching the desired pyrolysis temperature when the heating program ended the alumina crucible was immediately moved to the end of the chamber and then quenched by means of purging with n2 the sludge derived pyrochars were collected and labeled as per the pyrolysis temperature to explore the enhancement effect of different ratios of ca to p and the chemical form of ca on p speciation during the ss pyrolysis three types of additives namely cao 99 95 alfa aesar usa ca oh 2 95 00 macklin china and ca3 po4 2 96 00 aladdin china were employed these additives were adequately mixed with the raw sludge at different mass ratios of 5 10 15 20 and 50 by a ball mill the amount of ca oh 2 and ca3 po4 2 added was based on the amount of ca in cao to maintain the same ratio of ca p with the three different additives since the temperature dominated the production of hydroxylapatite as revealed by equation 1 a lower temperature 500 c and a higher temperature 900 c were selected among the above four temperatures to pyrolyze the mixed sludge samples under the same operating conditions as those of the raw sludge the mixed sludge samples were pyrolyzed at 500 c and 900 c under the same operating conditions as those of the raw sludge the sludge derived pyrochars were labeled according to the mass ratio and pyrolysis temperature for example the label 15 ca3 po4 2 900 c represented pyrochar generated from the pyrolysis of the sludge with the addition of 15 ca3 po4 2 at 900 c 2 3 the determination of total phosphorus content the content of total phosphorus in the sludge and derived sludge pyrochars was determined by uv vis spectrophotometry cary 60 agilent usa the method for measuring the quantity of total phosphorus was based on the method reported by huang and tang 2015 and tang et al 2018 prior to the measurement the sludge feedstock and its derived pyrochars were first combusted in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 2 h and the obtained residues were dissolved in 1m hcl solution followed by a vibration at a rotational speed of 180 rpm in a shaker next the solution was centrifuged at 10000 rpm in a centrifuge st40 thermo fisher usa the suspension was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane and the filtrate was analyzed at 700 nm using the uv vis spectrophotometer the standard curve of the total phosphorus using kh2po4 as standard shown in fig s1 was made in accordance with the national standard method hj 631 2011 2 4 characterization of phosphorus speciation quantitative 31p solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker 600 mhz avance iii hd wide bore spectrometer with magic angle spinning mas the solid samples were packed into a zirconia rotor and rotated at a spinning speed of 12 khz the parameters of data acquisition using direct polarization mode were 2048 data points over an acquisition time of 20 9 ms a recycle delay of 30 s and 400 scans chemical shift corrections were externally referenced to nh4 2hpo4 at 1 0 ppm the processing of the nmr spectra was accomplished by using mestrenova software version 8 1 4 additionally x ray photoelectron spectra xps were obtained using a physical electronic phi 5000 versaprobe iii spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic al kα x ray source 1486 6 ev and the most frequently used x ray setting was 200 μm 50 w 15 kv all spectra were corrected to the main line of the c 1s spectrum adventitious c and set to a binding energy of 284 8 ev the acquired data were analyzed using phi multipak software version 9 8 the shirley background subtraction method was used to fit the curve line shape with the gaussian lorentzian function the x ray powder diffraction xrd patterns of the mixed sludge and derived pyrochars were obtained using a rigaku smartlab powder diffractometer equipped with cu kα radiation operating at 45 kv and 200 ma the scanning was conducted in the 2θ range between 10 and 80 with a scan speed corresponding to 2 min in addition the pyrochar samples were measured by fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy ftir nicolet is50 thermal scientific usa the samples blended with kbr at a ratio of 1 200 were pelletized and the spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a resolution of 2 cm 1 2 5 thermodynamic simulation for phosphorus speciation during sludge pyrolysis after determining the chemical composition of the raw sludge and the blending ratio of the additives p transformation towards equilibrium conditions of the pyrolysis reaction could be predicted using factsage software bale et al 2016 this software is specialized in describing equilibrium ash properties the behavior of p and thermodynamic parameters in the factsage platform version 7 2 three main principles namely mass balance energy balance and minimum gibbs free energy are involved in the simulation of sludge pyrolysis bale et al 2016 the criterion directed in this calculation is to minimize the gibbs free energy based on two hypotheses li et al 2012 that is 1 all the input reactants were considered ideal substances and were assumed to be completely mixed when two or more substances were defined as being in the same phase and 2 the initial system would eventually reach steady state equilibrium in thermodynamics in the thermodynamic simulation we chose the equilib module which is the main force for gibbs energy minimization in factsage it calculated the concentrations of chemical substance when specified elements or compounds reached chemical equilibrium bale et al 2009 we input the sludge composition with different mass ratios of additives based in 1 g of ss and chose the ftoxid database mineral and ftmisc database miscellaneous for possible products pure solid and gas determination the pyrolysis temperature was selected in the range of 300 1200 c with an increment of 100 c and the total pressure of the sludge pyrolysis system closed system was assumed to be 1 atm the total gibbs energy of the pyrolysis system can be calculated using equation 2 by minimizing the total gibbs energy of the system the combinations of n i p i and x i could be determined 2 g i d e a l g a s n i g i o r t ln p i p u r e c o n d e n s e d p h a s e s n i g i o s o l u t i o n 1 n i g i o r t ln x i r t ln γ i s o l u t

performed using these pyrochars as a fertilizer the chemical characteristics of the soil feedstock are listed in table s1 in this study a soil sample was which free from heavy metal contamination in accordance with the chinese standard for soil quality was collected in the sustech campus shenzhen china table s2 the obtained soil was air dried and then sequentially ground screened and passed through a 2 mm sieve for further use five hundred grams of the soil was adequately mixed with the sludge derived pyrochars at two different mass ratios namely 1 and 4 the pyrochars were harvested from the pyrolyzed sludge samples with the addition of 15 ca based additives at 500 c and 900 c ryegrass which is sensitive to the abundance or paucity of p in fertilizer during growth was selected a duplicate experiment was conducted and a control experiment was also conducted as a blank run without the addition of sludge pyrochar to serve as a reference after the ryegrass was grown for 30 d it was harvested and photographs were taken which are shown in fig s2 the height and chlorophyll content of the obtained ryegrass were determined to evaluate its growth olorunfemi et al 2008 the determination of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll in fresh leaves was based on the standard method of arnon 1949 3 results and discussion 3 1 total p content in the sludge samples and sludge derived pyrochars fig 1 presents the pyrochar yields and their total p tp content the calculation of the tp mass balance showed that the p in the ss was almost retained in the pyrochars obtain from the pyrolysis of either the raw sludge or the mixed sludge samples table s3 as shown in fig 1 a the pyrochar yield increased with the increase in the addition of ca based additives the three additives showed different effects on the production of pyrochar depending on the pyrolysis temperature an increase in the pyrolysis temperature led to a decrease in the pyrochar yield because the increased pyrolysis temperature induced the yield of pyrolysis gas the yield of pyrochar tended to decline liu et al 2015 these results indicated that the form of ca or the ratio of ca p influenced the pyrolytic reactions of the ss which was reflected in the amount of produced pyrochar chanaka udayanga et al 2019 the change in the tp in the sludge derived pyrochar when ca based additives were added during the pyrolysis was determined as shown in fig 1 b the tp contents in the raw sludge pyrochar at 500 c and 900 c were 2 87 104 mg kg and 3 83 104 mg kg of dry sludge respectively when the ca based additives were mixed with the raw sludge the sludge derived pyrochars showed lowered tp contents compared with those of the pyrochars derived from the raw sludge except in the case of ca3 po4 2 this might have been attributed to the decomposition of organic components in the sludge feedstock which could be observed from the decreased intensities of the organic functional bonds in the derived sludge see in fig s3 furthermore an increase in the addition of cao and ca oh 2 appeared to decrease the content of tp in the sludge derived pyrochars while an increase in the addition of ca3 po4 2 increased the tp content which could be attributed to the introduction of p considering the results of the sludge biochar yield the change in the tp content in the sludge biochar varied with the form of ca and or the ratio of ca p 3 2 characteristics of phosphorus speciation during sludge pyrolysis with calcium based additives precisely characterizing the distribution behaviors of p in pyrochar is crucial to understand the effects of ca based additives or the ratio of ca p on the recovery of p the cutting edge technique of solid state 31p mas nmr was used to measure the species of p in the sludge derived pyrochars and was supplemented by p 2p xps and xrd fig 2 a c e show the obtained solid state 31p mas nmr of the sludge derived pyrochars when the sludge samples with ca based additives were pyrolyzed at 900 c the resonance centered at a chemical shift of 3 8 ppm was considered to be the center band reflecting the isotropic 31p chemical shift while the other resonances symmetrically spaced from the center band were spinning sidebands represented by the spades bleam et al 1989 deconvolution for the spectra in the range of 20 ppm 20 ppm was performed to quantify the species of p cade menun 2005 a lorentzian 80 gaussian 20 function was employed in the spectral deconvolution and the resulting deconvolution is shown in figs s4 6 fig 2 b d f show the fractions of the p species identified in the pyrochars according to the particular chemical shift characteristics of each p species detailed data for the fractions of these identified species are presented in table s4 for the pyrochar derived from the pyrolysis of raw sludge the al p i e al2 oh 3po4 76 8 and alpo4 12 4 were the main p subcomponents fig s7 this could be ascribed to the use of al containing flocculants for the enhancement of ss dewatering in the sewage treatment process golob et al 2005 when these three ca based additives were added during the ss pyrolysis the speciation of p changed dramatically with the ratio of addition we found that the addition of ca based additives transformed the p present mostly in the form of inorganic p species including al p and hydroxylapatite ca5 po4 3oh the new species of hydroxylapatite with a low dissociation constant and a high bioavailability for plant growth misra and chaturvedi 2007 suhartono et al 2015 strengthened the feasibility of the use of sludge derived pyrochars as slow release p fertilizer meyer et al 2018 also observed that the presence of p in the form of hydroxylapatite in rock phosphate can promote plant growth thus the addition of ca based additives was beneficial to the formation of hydroxylapatite however the benefit differed based on the additive and ratio as shown in fig 2 b the p subcomponents identified in the sludge derived pyrochars from the pyrolysis of sludge with cao addition included orthophosphate orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diesters polyphosphate with a terminal p group and hydroxylapatite the addition of cao promoted the transformation of organic p to inorganic p species orthophosphate polyphosphate with terminal p group and hydroxylapatite which was evident from p the increased fraction of inorganic p orthophosphate monoesters were the main forms of organic p while orthophosphate and hydroxylapatite were the main forms of inorganic p as the addition of cao increased the fraction of organic p decreased sharply while the fraction of inorganic p increased particularly the fraction of hydroxylapatite increased with the increase in cao addition when the addition was below 10 however it decreased when the addition was increased further therefore the optimal fraction 37 53 of hydroxylapatite was achieved with the addition of 10 cao table s4 in the case of ca oh 2 the same p subcomponents were identified in the sludge derived pyrochars the trends of the fractions of inorganic p and organic p were similar to those in the case of cao addition furthermore the change in the hydroxylapatite fraction was consistent with that observed in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludge with cao addition however the promotion effect of the transformation of organic p to inorganic p induced by the addition of ca oh 2 was inferior to that induced by the addition of cao this effect was also reflected in the change in the hydroxylapatite fraction when the two additions were compared we found that the addition of 5 ca oh 2 results in the peak hydroxylapatite fraction this result indicated that the ca form influenced the formation of hydroxylapatite in the process of ss pyrolysis the fraction of orthophosphate in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludge with ca oh 2 addition tended to decrease with the increase in ca oh 2 addition over 5 compared with that of cao addition which supported the previous statement as shown in fig 2 f the enhancement of the transformation of organic p to inorganic p induced by ca3 po4 2 became weaker compared with that in the case of the former two ca based additives the case with 10 ca3 po4 2 addition appeared to reach the peak hydroxylapatite fraction in addition the decreasing trend of the orthophosphate fraction in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludge with ca3 po4 2 addition occurred with the increase in addition these results verified that the ratio of ca p as well as the form influenced the formation of hydroxylapatite in the process of ss pyrolysis and this forms the basis for a strategy for the recovery of p from the ss to further support the analysis of p speciation in the derived sludge pyrochars in accordance with the obtained 31p nmr spectra the p 2p xps and xrd techniques were specifically used fig 3 a b c show the p 2p xps spectra of the sludge derived pyrochars after pyrolysis and the spectral deconvolution was performed on these spectra fig 3 d e f show the resulting fraction of p associated species from the spectral deconvolution we found that inorganic p bound to the ca related minerals ca hpo4 2 and ca2p2o7 as well as the al related minerals alpo4 was identified in the pyrochar derived from the pyrolysis of raw sludge when these ca based additives were added to the raw sludge the new p species of hydroxylapatite was identified in all the sludge derived pyrochars and the dehydration of alpo4 produced anhydrous berlinite this indicated the evolution of p bound minerals related to the pyrolytic reactions during sludge pyrolysis as also revealed by the c 1s xps spectra fig s8 as for the change in the hydroxylapatite fraction with the increasing addition of ca based additives the maximum fraction of hydroxylapatite was obtained with 10 cao addition 5 ca oh 2 addition or 10 ca3 po4 2 addition this was in good agreement with the results found in the aforementioned analysis of 31p nmr spectra the fractional change in al p between alpo4 and berlinite with the increasing addition of ca based additives showed that the dehydration of alpo4 was enhanced to form berlinite whose fraction was negligible because alpo4 with bound water cannot be detected using the 31p nmr technique the trend of the al p fraction with the addition observed in the analysis of p 2p xps spectra was consistent with that in the analysis of 31p nmr spectra the difference between the nmr and xps results for the number of p species might have been due to the different principles of the nmr and xps techniques the nmr technique detects the spin orbit difference of the nucleus and the xps technique does not consider this difference when detecting the photoelectron energy andrade 1985 wolff and ziegler 1998 additional information revealed by the xrd patterns of all the sludge derived pyrochars was obtained for the evolution of the mineral phase and is presented in fig 4 in the xrd patterns of the raw sludge derived pyrochar sio2 and cao were identified as the main phase fig s9 after adding ca based additives the main phases identified in the sludge derived pyrochars included caco3 ca5 po4 3 oh cao ca oh 2 ca3 po4 2 and cahx po4 moreover their intensity changed with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature as shown in fig 4 we found that the intensity of these additives was strengthened when the mass ratio of ca based additives exceeded 15 thereby suggesting their excess after pyrolysis the major phase of caco3 formed in the pyrochars derived from the pyrolysis of sludges with cao addition and ca oh 2 addition appeared at 500 c but disappeared at 900 c which revealed that the increasing temperature could enhance the reactions of cao and ca oh 2 with the sludge matrix in p transformation during pyrolysis however the intensities of these detected major phases were changed slightly with the increase in the addition of ca based additives the addition of ca based additives appeared to enhance the formation of hydroxylapatite as indicated by the increased intensities importantly the intensity of hydroxylapatite in the sludge derived pyrochars was notably larger at 900 c compared with that at 500 c which revealed that the production of hydroxylapatite could be thermodynamics dependent the al associated minerals were not identified in the obtained xrd patterns possibly due to the dilution effect caused by the introduction of ca based additives in addition the cahx po4 phase present in the derived pyrochars pyrolyzed with the addition of ca based additives at 900 c revealed that curbing the development of cahx po4 at a high temperature during sludge pyrolysis could increase hydroxylapatite production therefore the supplementary characterizations of p 2p xps and xrd further supported that the change in ca form and or ca p ratio can be regarded as an effective strategy to recover p resources from ss in the form of hydroxylapatite 3 3 thermodynamic simulation of hydroxylapatite production during sludge pyrolysis with calcium based additives as stated above section 3 2 the formation of hydroxylapatite strongly depend on the pyrolysis temperature thus performing thermodynamic simulation of hydroxylapatite production during sludge pyrolyzed with the addition of ca based additives can improve the understanding of the transformation of sludge p fig 5 shows the resulting concentration of hydroxylapatite generated when the process of sludge pyrolysis reached equilibrium at the determined temperatures the largest concentration 0 052 g g ss of hydroxylapatite in the raw sludge derived pyrochar was achieved at a pyrolysis temperature between 700 c and 900 c and as the temperature increased beyond 900 c its concentration approached near zero fig s10 after adding the ca based additives the concentration of hydroxylapatite increased by 180 0 1460 g g ss 165 0 1379 g g ss and 165 0 1379 g g ss in the pyrochars derived from sludge with cao addition ca oh 2 addition and ca3 po4 2 addition at 900 c respectively compared with that 0 0520 g g ss in the raw sludge derived pyrochar this indicated that the addition of ca based additives could enhance the conversion of p to hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis which was consistent with the experimental results more specifically when the pyrolysis temperature was higher than 1000 c the concentration of hydroxyapatite in the sludge derived pyrochars decreased by 16 58 as shown in fig 5 a and b when the addition of cao and ca oh 2 was below 15 the trends of hydroxylapatite production between pyrolysis of sludge with ca addition and sludge with ca oh 2 addition at equilibrium were similar as long as the pyrolysis temperature was below 900 c table s5 while the difference in hydroxylapatite production appeared to become pronounced when the temperature approached 900 c at which the concentrations of hydroxylapatite were 0 1460 g g ss and 0 1379 g g ss in the pyrochar derived from sludge with cao addition and ca oh 2 addition respectively with the further increase in the additives i e beyond 15 the equilibrium content of hydroxylapatite 0 3312 g g remained constant as long as the pyrolysis temperature was below 900 c the content of hydroxylapatite decreased notably with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature beyond 900 c and this revealed that the hydroxylapatite phase was not stable above 900 c on the other hand the hydroxylapatite production at equilibrium during the pyrolysis of sludge with ca3 po4 2 addition remained nearly constant with the increase in pyrolysis temperature while an increase in the addition markedly increased the equilibrium content of the hydroxylapatite as shown in fig 5 c it was also observed that when the pyrolysis temperature was over 900 c a clear decrease in the hydroxylapatite production occurred which confirmed the stability of hydroxylapatite shown in the cases of sludge with cao and ca oh 2 addition the differences in the production of hydroxylapatite with the addition of different ca based additives indicated that the form of ca and or the change in the ca p ratio influenced the transformation of p in the sludge to hydroxylapatite in addition the enthalpy increased with the increase in the amount of ca based additives or the increase in the pyrolysis temperature fig 5 d however the enthalpy during the pyrolysis of sludge with cao showed the lowest values which suggested that cao was preferable for the conversion of sludge p to hydroxylapatite in terms of the energy input to the pyrolysis system a difference in the hydroxylapatite production between the experimental and simulated results was observed as shown in fig 5 the difference could have been attributed to the hypothesis used in the simulation huang et al 2015a and the limitations in the experimental determination of the hydroxylapatite content jäger et al 2006 in the simulation the method of gibbs free energy minimization was adopted to calculate the pyrolysis system reaching the thermodynamic steady state based on two hypotheses li et al 2012 specifically all input reactants were considered ideal substances and they were assumed to be completely mixed when two or more substances were allocated as being in the same phase the initial pyrolysis system would eventually reach steady state equilibrium in thermodynamics however this discrepancy did not affect the simulation of hydroxylapatite during pyrolysis with the addition of ca based additives to gain a deep insight into the transformation of sludge p during sludge pyrolysis for efficient recovery therefore it could be inferred that the introduction of ca based additives enhanced the transformation of sludge p to hydroxylapatite which is preferred by plants and the addition of cao appeared to be an optimal solution for the enhancement of hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis in terms of energy savings 3 4 environmental application fig 6 shows the growth of ryegrass in terms of height and chlorophyll a b contents with the utilization of the sludge derived pyrochars as a prospective p fertilizer as shown in fig 6 a the ryegrass in the control group had an average plant height 20 randomly selected ryegrasses plants were measured of 9 3 cm whereas the average plant heights of ryegrass in the experimental groups were increased this indicated that the derived pyrochars from the pyrolysis of sludge with the addition of ca based additives could be beneficial to the growth of ryegrass furthermore by comparing the heights of the ryegrass in the experimental runs it was noticed that the plants that utilized the pyrochars produced at 900 c were taller than those that utilized the pyrochars produced at 500 c this suggested that p enriched in the pyrochars produced at 900 c was more amenable to be adsorbed by ryegrass during growth in other words the enhancement effect of the sludge derived pyrochars on plant growth was strengthened with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature the chlorophyll content in the blank control run was 1 15 mg g and the ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b was 2 2 except for the experimental group with the addition of pyrochar labeled 15 ca3 po4 2 900 c at a blending ratio of 1 the contents of chlorophyll in the other experimental groups were higher than that of the control group furthermore the content of chlorophyll varied with the blending ratio and the pyrolysis temperature we found that the content of chlorophyll in the ryegrass plants that utilized the pyrochars labeled 15 cao 500 c 15 ca oh 2 900 c and 15 ca3 po4 2 900 c reached their local peaks when the blending ratios were 4 1 and 4 respectively this result was in agreement with that observed in the resulting ratio of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b in addition meyer et al 2018 found that hydroxylapatite from rock phosphate can be employed as a p fertilizer for ryegrass growth it could be inferred that the bioavailability of p in the derived sludge pyrochars was related to i the difference in the ca form and or ca p ratio with the addition of ca based additives and ii the increase in the blending ratio which tended to enhance the uptake of p during plant growth in terms of the energy savings for the pyrochar preparation the addition of cao appeared to be advantageous in sludge p transformation this agreed well with the findings in the theoretical simulation for sludge p transformation to hydroxylapatite through pyrolysis therefore the results from this bioassay established that pyrochars derived from the addition of ca based additives can be employed as a novel p fertilizer to promote plant growth based on the aforementioned results the introduction of ca based additives during sludge pyrolysis can promote the conversion of p to hydroxylapatite in produced pyrochars a scheme was proposed for the enhancement of the addition of ca based additives in sludge p transformation to hydroxylapatite during sludge pyrolysis as shown in fig 7 previous studies confirmed that sludge p is composed of orthophosphate monoesters orthophosphate diester orthophosphate polyphosphate and p bound minerals ca p and al p huang and tang 2015 tang et al 2018 without the addition of ca based additives the sludge p species were mainly comprised of al p minerals al2 oh 3po4 and a portion of ca2p2o7 after pyrolysis which cannot be easily absorbed by the plants however when ca based additives were added during sludge pyrolysis the transformed sludge p was mainly present in ca p particularly hydroxylapatite the addition of cao ca oh 2 and ca3 po4 2 enhanced the transformation of sludge p to hydroxylapatite jin et al 2016 we found that the addition of 10 cao 5 ca oh 2 or 10 ca3 po4 2 facilitated peak hydroxylapatite production simultaneously the addition of ca based additives to some degree decreased the apparent content of al p minerals which are harmful for plant growth thereby facilitating the agricultural utilization of pyrochar rich in p in the form of hydroxylapatite therefore reclaiming p from ss via pyrolysis with the addition of ca based additives could be an effective strategy for enriching p in pyrochar in the form of hydroxylapatite to be utilized in agriculture 4 conclusion the transformation of sludge p during pyrolysis with the addition of ca based additives was investigated in this study the ca based additives were beneficial to the conversion of p in the ss to hydroxylapatite which is more amenable to absorption by plants than other p associated phases such as al p the addition of 10 cao 5 ca oh 2 or 10 ca3 po4 2 facilitated the peak production of hydroxylapatite the thermodynamic simulation of hydroxylapatite production during pyrolysis demonstrated that these three additives increased the enthalpy of the total pyrolysis system and the addition of cao resulted in the lowest enthalpy of sludge pyrolysis this implied that the addition of cao during ss pyrolysis may be considered preferentially over the other two ca based additive to recover sludge p in the form of hydroxylapatite in terms of energy savings the pot experiment verified that the pyrochar derived from the pyrolysis of ss with the addition of ca based additives can be regarded as p fertilizer to promote plant growth author contributions the experiment was conducted by jingjing chen and the manuscript was written through the contributions of all

18218,endoxifen is an effective metabolite of a common chemotherapy agent tamoxifen endoxifen which is toxic to aquatic animals has been detected in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent this research investigates ultraviolet uv radiation 253 7 nm application to degrade e and z endoxifen in water and wastewater and phototransformation by products pbps and their toxicity the effects of light intensity ph and initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen on the photodegradation rate were examined endoxifen in water was eliminated 99 1 after 35 s of irradiation light dose of 598 5 mj cm 2 light intensity and initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen exhibited positive trends with the photodegradation rates while ph had no effect photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in water resulted in three pbps toxicity assessments through modeling of the identified pbps suggest higher toxicity than the parent compounds photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater at light doses used for disinfection in wwtps 16 30 and 97 mj cm 2 resulted in reductions of e and z endoxifen from 30 to 71 two of the three pbps observed in the experiments with water were detected in the wastewater experiments therefore toxic compounds are potentially generated at wwtps by uv disinfection if e and z endoxifen are present in treated wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords by products endoxifen photodegradation toxicity uv light 1 introduction during the last decade the presence of cytostatic drugs in the environment has been a growing concern worldwide cytostatic drugs are a group of chemotherapy drugs used to inhibit the proliferation of carcinogenic cells the abundance of these chemotherapy drugs in the environment is related to their frequency of consumption johnson et al 2013 in the last 40 years tamoxifen has been the most widely used cytostatic drug to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancer the type that accounts for 70 of all breast cancer cases worldwide johnson et al 2004 negreira et al 2015 furthermore tamoxifen is used as a preventive long term treatment for women with high risk of breast cancer fisher et al 2005 the effectiveness of tamoxifen for patients diagnosed with breast cancer relies on an ability of the liver to actively metabolize the drug by the cyp2d6 enzyme to endoxifen zhang et al 2015 the major and most effective metabolite resulting from tamoxifen conversion is trans isomer z endoxifen or commonly called endoxifen jaremko et al 2010 milroy et al 2018 however z endoxifen easily undergoes cis isomerization to e endoxifen elkins et al 2014 although both isomers present antiestrogenic activity z endoxifen is considered the isomer responsible for the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation due to its higher antiestrogenic ability jaremko et al 2010 despite the fact endoxifen is an effective treatment for breast cancer it presents possible consequences on the environment environment canada 2015 endoxifen is not completely metabolized in human body and is actively excreted kisanga et al 2005 as a result endoxifen is potentially released to the water environment via wastewater treatment plants wwtps negreira et al 2014 endoxifen has been detected in hospital effluents and wastewater but there is no data on its concentration in the environment evgenidou et al 2015 olalla et al 2018 several studies reported the presence of tamoxifen in the level of ng l 1 to μg l 1 in surface water and wastewater ashton et al 2004 coetsier et al 2009 environment canada 2015 lara martín et al 2014 roberts and thomas 2006 thomas and hilton 2004 tamoxifen and endoxifen present similar chemical and molecular structures which suggest a similar fate the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen produces negative effects on fish reproduction and physiology maradonna et al 2009 because endoxifen is 30 100 times more potent than tamoxifen jager et al 2012 and presents antiestrogenic activity johnson et al 2004 environment canada 2015 its presence in natural water bodies could result in a toxic effect on aquatic lives there has been only one study on the toxicity of endoxifen on aquatic lives borgatta et al 2015 the study showed a reproductive decline and mortality of daphnia pulex exposed to endoxifen at the level of μg l 1 d pulex is a primary consumer of the tropic network in freshwater environments grzesiuk et al 2019 d pulex population is directly related to algal biomass and is the main food source for planktivorous fishes sommer et al 1986 grzesiuk et al 2019 reduction in d pulex reproductive abilities together with increased mortality caused by the presence of endoxifen in water environments could trigger a serious adverse effect to the survival of other aquatic species furthermore the predicted no effect concentration of tamoxifen in aquatic environment is 0 51 μg l 1 and is considered applicable to endoxifen due the lack of toxicology studies specifically on endoxifen environment canada 2015 therefore the elimination of endoxifen from water and wastewater is necessary to avoid possible toxicological effects there have been increasing interests in finding a suitable technique for treating pharmaceutical compounds phcs in water and wastewater among these techniques photodegradation with uv light 253 7 nm has demonstrated to be a highly efficient method to eliminate pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater previous laboratory bench scale studies using low pressure lp mercury lamps emitting uv light at 253 7 nm reported efficient degradation of phcs including antibiotic nitromidazoles and endocrine disruptors such as norfloxacin doxycycline and mefenamic pereira et al 2007 prados joya et al 2011 rivas et al 2010 the treatment of phcs by uv light should produce photodegradation by products pbps that are less toxic than their parent compounds larson and berenbaum 1988 the identification and the toxicity assessment of potential pbps need to be investigated before actual applications of the technique lp mercury lamps 253 7 nm are also commonly used in uv disinfection process at wwtps however the uv light doses applied at wwtps are lower than those applied for photodegradation of contaminants because the use of uv light for disinfection of treated wastewater has gained more attention guo et al 2009 it might be interesting to determine the photodegradability of endoxifen in wastewater at light doses similar to those applied for disinfection at wwtps the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of uv light 253 7 nm to photodegrade e and z endoxifen in water and wastewater the identification of potential photodegradation by products and the assessment of their toxicity were carried out the photodegradation efficiency and rate of endoxifen in wastewater at uv light intensities typically used for disinfection at wwtps were also elucidated in addition the effects of uv light intensity ph and initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen in water on the photodegradation rate were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals preparations of stock and standard solutions and water and

optimization of photodegradation kinetics and efficiency 2 3 1 effect of uv light intensity photodegradation kinetics and efficiency of e and z endoxifen were tested at the following emission uv light intensities in triplicate 28 w 2 lamps 56 w 4 lamps 112 w 8 lamps 168 w 12 lamps and 224 w 16 lamps five ml water samples directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 2 μg ml 1 total endoxifen concentration 1 μg ml 1 for each type of endoxifen at ph 7 were exposed to uv light 253 7 nm the concentration of e and z endoxifen used for photodegradation optimization was according to the maximum solubility of both e and z endoxifen in water 1 μg ml 1 vcclab 2016 this concentration was selected based on the ability of hplc dad to determine the e and z endoxifen concentrations accurately and precisely and in turn the confidence on the results on effect of uv light intensity on endoxifen concentrations the concentration was also well below the estimated maximum solubility of endoxifen of 2 79 μg ml 1 reported by environment canada 2015 the water samples were irradiated for 80 s at 28 w 60 s at 56 w 45 s at 112 w and 30 s at 168 and 224 w at different time intervals 1 ml aliquots were collected by sacrificing samples as described above in subsection 2 2 and analyzed for endoxifen concentrations controls in the dark were ran in parallel for 80 s different irradiation time periods chosen for different light intensities were based on preliminary results these time periods allowed observations of adequate endoxifen degradation profiles for kinetics determination 2 3 2 effect of initial ph five ml water samples directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 2 μg ml 1 were irradiated in triplicate at a constant uv light intensity of 28 w for 80 s the lower uv light intensity of 28 w was selected because it allowed longer photodegradation time and consequently the ability to collect enough number of samples 1 ml aliquot for every 10 s for endoxifen concentration determination by hplc dad to observe the effect of ph on e and z endoxifen photodegradation kinetics the initial ph of the samples was varied at 5 6 7 8 and 9 the ph adjustment was performed by using 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh the ph after the irradiation was also recorded 2 3 3 effect of initial endoxifen concentrations effect of initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen total

were irradiated for 1 min controls were run in the dark in parallel one milliliter aliquots of water samples exposed to uv light were collected every 5 s while aliquots of water samples exposed to sunlight and indoor lamp were collected every 15 s the collected samples were analyzed for e and z endoxifen using hplc dad 2 4 role of hydroxyl radicals the contribution of e and z endoxifen degradation by hydroxyl radicals generated during uv photodegradation was investigated isopropyl alcohol ipa and benzoic acid ba were separately added to water samples to quench hydroxyl radical

determinations are described in supplementary data section s3 2 6 mineralization of e and z endoxifen by uv light mineralization of e and z endoxifen was tested in a water sample directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 2 μg ml 1 and exposed to uv light 253 7 nm at 224 w for 60 and 120 min forty milliliters aliquots at each testing time point were collected and analyzed for total organic carbon toc as described in subsection 2 9 the experiment was tested in triplicate and dark control samples were run in parallel 2 7 toxicity evaluation details on the toxicity evaluation of endoxifen and pbps are provided in supplementary data section s4 2 8 photodegradation experiments in wastewater two experiments were conducted with the secondary treated wastewater samples described in subsection 2 1 one to determine the photodegradation kinetics of e and z endoxifen in wastewater and the other to simulate photodegradation of e and z endoxifen at light doses used in wwtps for disinfection process for both experiments 5 ml water samples directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 1 μg ml 1 and control samples were run in parallel in the dark to determine the presence of side reactions that could reduce the concentrations of e and z endoxifen in the sample to determine the photodegradation kinetics of e and z endoxifen wastewater samples were irradiated with an emission light intensity of 56 w for 45 s the experiment was triplicated one milliliter aliquot was collected with time by sacrificing sample and analyzed for e and z endoxifen concentrations by hplc dad for the second experiment wastewater samples were irradiated at an emission uv light intensity of 56 w incident light intensity 2 77 mw cm 2 details in subsection 3 3 for 6 11 and 35 s in order to simulate the uv light doses applied at wwtps of 16 usepa 2006 30 shin et al 2001 and 97 darby et al 1993 mj cm 2 respectively irradiation time periods of 15 25 and 45 s corresponding to light doses of 42 69 and 125 mj cm 2 were also experimented for more data points to confirm a trend if there was any between light dose and endoxifen reduction one milliliter aliquots were collected at the specified time points and analyzed for e and z endoxifen concentrations by hplc dad the potential molecular structures of observed pbps at 35 s were identified by uhplc ms ms following the previously described method 2 9 chemical analyses toc was determined using a uv persulfate oxidation toc analyzer phoenix 8000 tekmar dohrmann oh usa nitrite and nitrate concentrations of the wastewater samples were analyzed using the nitrite tnt840 plus vial test and nitrate tnt835 plus vial test respectively hach loveland co usa ph of the water and wastewater samples was measured by a ph meter thermo scientific orion stara2110 equipped with a ph probe orion ross ultra glass triode 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis of data was performed by the analysis of variance anova using minitab 1 7 the significance of the independent variable light intensity ph initial concentration and ipa was evaluated for e and z photodegradation rate in water with a 95 level of confidence using the tukey test the obtained p values 0 05 indicated the significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of photodegradation kinetics and efficiency 3 1 1 effect of light intensity on endoxifen photodegradation e and z endoxifen photodegradation at five different emission light intensities 28 56 112 168 and 224 w followed first order kinetics fig 1 a and b the determination coefficient values r2 of the fitness were greater than 0 97 at all light intensities for first order reaction while zero and second order fits had lower r2 the photodegradation rate constants k of e and z endoxifen isomers for the first order kinetic model and the emission light intensities were linearly related r2 0 949 and 0 935 for e and z endoxifen respectively anova results also indicated that the effect of light intensity on the photodegradation rate was significant p 1 10 8 for e and z endoxifen the maximum emission light intensity of 224 w provided the highest photodegradation rates of e and z endoxifen isomers with k values of 0 077 0 0054 and 0 083 0 0056 s 1 respectively previous studies focused on phenol photodegradation reported that the greater uv light intensity the greater the number of photons present in the water sample to carry on first order photodegradation reactions chiou and juang 2007 udom et al 2014 likewise the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen was greater as the emission light intensity increased 3 1 2 effect of ph on endoxifen photodegradation the maximum k values for e and z endoxifen isomers of 0 017 and 0 015 s 1 were observed at initial ph 7 and 9 respectively supplementary data fig s1 the differences between the maximum and minimum k values for e and z endoxifen isomers for different ph values tested were 0 002 s 1 for both isomers these results suggest that the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen isomers in water was not ph dependent statistical analysis anova confirms that the photodegradation rate was independent of the ph tested p 0 950 for e endoxifen and p 0 884 for z endoxifen changes in ph before and after 80 s of photodegradation reaction with an emission light intensity of 28 w were calculated ph decreased in all the cases except for the initial ph of 5 this acidification could be due to the presence of a hydroxyaromatic group in the molecular structure of endoxifen it is well known that hydroxyaromatic compounds present a different pka value during the lowest excitation state due to their acid base property jin et al 2017 lawrence et al 1991 it is also well known that pka of aromatic hydroxyl groups will decrease upon photoexcitation clay et al 2018 the formation of phenantrene derivative one the photoproducts discussed in subsection 3 4 2 likely impacted the ph profile of the solution the pka values of endoxifen calculated by modeling and reported by environment canada 2015 are 10 36 acid and 9 4 base experimental work needs to be conducted in order to accurately determine the pka of e and z endoxifen and the photoproducts formed under the same conditions experimented in this study 3 1 3 effect of initial endoxifen concentration on endoxifen photodegradation the reaction rate constants k for e and z endoxifen exhibit positive linear relationships with their initial concentrations r2 0 99 supplementary data fig s2 the photodegradation rate was dependent on initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen p 0 0001 for e and z endoxifen the percent photodegradation of e and z endoxifen notably decreased by 59 and 57 respectively when the concentration was reduced from 2 to 0 5 mg l 1 previous studies reported a similar correlation between k pseudo first order and the initial concentrations of aromatic compounds oxytetracycline chrysene benzo a pyrene phenanthrene and acenaphthene during photodegradation jin et al 2017 miller and olejnik 2001 according to jin et al 2017 a thermodynamic collision could occur along with photolysis in this study two photo excited endoxifen molecules could collide triggering the thermodynamic collision reaction therefore the number of excited molecules is directly proportional to the concentration of endoxifen in the ground state hence the photolysis of e and z endoxifen is not only due to the light energy but molecular collision could also play an important role 3 1 4 effect of light source on endoxifen photodegradation the concentrations of e and z endoxifen isomers remained constant with time after 60 s of indoor and sunlight irradiation fig 2 effective photodegradation of e and z endoxifen isomers was observed when the water samples were exposed to uv light 253 7 nm after 35 s of uv light exposure the concentrations of e and z endoxifen isomers were below the lower limit of detection llod llod e endoxifen 12 66 ng ml 1 llod z endoxifen 12 12 ng ml 1 therefore the concentrations of both isomers e and z endoxifen were reduced by at least 99 1 after 35 s of irradiation by an emission uv light intensity of 224 w incident light intensity of 17 1 mw cm 2 details in subsection 3 3 corresponding to a uv light dose of 598 5 mj cm 2 these results showed the suitability of uv light to effectively photodegrade e and z endoxifen isomers in water 3 2 role of hydroxyl radicals hplc water was used as solvent for e and z endoxifen isomers during uv photodegradation reactions at 254 nm the formation of oh from water irradiated with uv light at 254 nm was unlikely to confirm that the contribution of oh to photodegradation of e and z endoxifen was examined ipa 1 and ba 50 mg l 1 were used as oh scavengers during the photodegradation the samples with and without ipa or ba showed similar photodegradation reaction profiles but anova results showed that photodegradation rates of e and z endoxifen were dependent on the presence of ipa or ba p 0 003 for both e and z endoxifen fig 3 the samples with ipa had the k values of 0 06 0 0006 and 0 07 0 001 s 1 while the samples with ba had the k values of 0 12 0 0009 and 0 12 0 0003 s 1 for e and z endoxifen respectively however the samples without ipa and ba resulted in the k values of 0 08 0 0007 and 0 09 0 0007 s 1 for e and z endoxifen respectively if e and z endoxifen photodegradation was enhanced by the presence of oh in the solution lower k values were expected for e and z endoxifen photodegradation with the addition of oh scavengers the presence of ba in the solution enhanced the photodegradation reaction while ipa reduced the photodegradation reaction kinetic of e and z endoxifen this difference in photodegradation performance between oh quenchers was previously reported by wu et al 2015 in a study focusing on chlorine uv degradation of a common azo dye c i reactive red 2 rr2 in water the addition of ba also resulted in higher removal efficiency of rr2 than other oh quenchers a previous study demonstrated that ba when irradiated with light acted as an electron donor enhancing photodegradation rate of an aromatic compound tartrazine zhou et al 2019 therefore the addition of ipa or ba itself seems to affect the photodegradation reaction rate of e and z endoxifen rather than oh radicals a previous study on the photodegradation of low brominated diphenyl ether in water reported similar results and attributed to the effect of ipa addition dual solvent of ipa and hplc water versus single solvent of hplc water rather than oh contribution wang et al 2015 that is also likely the case for the observed e and z endoxifen photodegradation results these results suggest that oh radicals do not play an important role during photodegradation reaction of e and z endoxifen with uv light 253 7 nm 3 3 quantum yield and emission light intensity the quantum yield value decreased as the emission light intensity increased supplementary data fig s3 this observation suggests that photons absorbance by e and z endoxifen were more efficient at lower light intensities this inverse relationship between emission light intensity and quantum yield was previously observed in previous photoreaction studies chowdhury et al 2017 fujishima et al 2000 although e and z endoxifen were photodegraded more efficiently and rapidly at higher emission light intensities fig 1 and supplementary data table s1 when taking quatum yield into consideration supplementary data fig s3 e and z endoxifen photodegradation at lower emission light intensities was more energy efficient there is a need to calculate the incident light intensity in the sample as the emission light intensity is attenuated by several factors such as lamp aging lamp bulb wall temperature lamp operating frequency quartz sleeve absorption and distance between sample and light source as expected emission light intensities were much higher than the incident light intensities supplementary data table s2 the incident light intensities allow the calculation of light doses applied to the water samples by multiplying by the irradiation time as expected lower irradiation intensities need longer irradiation time to achieve a targeted light dose however the incident light intensity at the lower emission intensity 56 w was remarkably low this result suggests that light energy dissipation was even higher when lower emission energy was applied to the water samples in the photoreactor 3 4 detection and identification of photodegradation by products and degree of mineralization 3 4 1 detection of photodegradation by products by hplc dad the chromatogram peak areas corresponding to e and z endoxifen isomers decreased with time until they became undetectable lod e endoxifen 12 66 ng ml 1 lod z endoxifen 12 12 ng ml 1 after 35 s of uv light exposure at 224 w data not shown however a new chromatogram peak with a retention time of 11 43 min was observed as e and z endoxifen isomers were degraded after 30 s of photodegradation the new peak presented a total chromatogram percentage area of 82 the presence of this new peak suggested the formation of at least one photodegradation by product s 3 4 2 identification of photodegradation by products by uhplc ms ms a water sample containing e and z endoxifen isomers was exposed to uv light 253 7 nm for 35 s and then injected to uplc ms ms in order to identify the molecular weight of the photodegradation by products three new peaks were observed in the resultant chromatogram supplementary data fig s4 the first peak pb1a and second peak pb1b had the same ion m z value 372 19 this ion m z value indicated an aromatization of e and z endoxifen isomers forming a phenanthrene skeleton by the elimination of two hydrogen h and the formation of one molecular bond between two benzene rings the reaction led to a con rotatory 6π photocyclization resulting in the formation of a dihydrophenanthrene skeleton supplementary data scheme s1 the subsequent oxidation reaction leading to the aromatic phenanthrene is favorable due the formation conjugated aromatic system enhanced aromaticity a previous study on the detection of endoxifen by hplc with a fluorescence detector reported the formation of a photocycled derivate with a phenanthrene nucleus after the irradiation of endoxifen by uv light aranda et al 2011 furthermore the minimal differences in ppm 10 between the expected ion m z mass and the theoretical ion m z mass of the proposed molecular structures for pb1a and pb1b support the suggested aromatization of e and z endoxifen after 35 s of uv irradiation table 1 the third new peak observed with a retention time of 2 03 min pb2 showed an ion m z value of 374 21 this ion m z value observed at 35 s was similar to the observed ion m z value of e and z endoxifen isomers however the retention time of pb2 was different from the retention times observed for e and z endoxifen isomers therefore the presence of this new peak pb2 with the same ion m z value as e and z endoxifen isomers but different retention time suggests the presence of a new pbp with the same molecular weight as e and z endoxifen isomers the primary photoproduct dihydrophenanthrene formed during the con rotatory 6π photocyclization features the same molecular weight as endoxifen explaining the obtained ion m z value of pb2 however the determination of the molecular structure of pb2 was challenging due the presence of only one peak instead of two peaks nevertheless the stilbene chromophore in endoxifen went common intermediate that might also explain the lack of the regioisomers in pb2 supplementary data scheme s1 pb1 showed two peaks corresponding to the aromatization of e and z endoxifen isomers resulting in two well differentiated photodegradation by products the observation of only one peak for pb2 suggests that either only one of the two endoxifen isomers underwent hydrogenation to pb2 or two peaks got overlapped however pb2 was not considered as the main photodegradation by product due to a small percentage of the chromatogram peak area table 1 shows the two possible molecular structures of pb2 which are isomers depending on whether the hydrogenation occurred in the e endoxifen isomer or the z endoxifen isomer the proposed molecular structures of pb1 a b and pb2 were analyzed through uplc ms ms in order to identify the formed product ions after the fragmentation of e z endoxifen and pb2 through ms ms the ion m z value of 374 21 was selected and fragmented with a cone voltage of 27 ev e and z endoxifen present similar formed product ions as pb2 but the resultant ion m z 223 1140 and the ion m z 194 0757 were not observed on the pb2 ms ms spectrum supplementary data fig s5 the proposed molecular structure of pb2 contains a phenanthrene nucleus that could hinder the cleavage of pb2 to generate the fragment ion m z values of 223 1140 and 194 0757 furthermore the proposed molecular structures of pb1 a b also present a phenanthrene nucleus as molecular core ms ms spectra for pb1 a b showed no fragmentation within the phenanthrene nucleus supplementary data fig s6 these findings and explanations agree with transformation products of pb1 a b and pb2 supplementary data fig s7 identified through a similar ms ms analysis approach by li and hu 2018 finally two more peaks 1 and 2 were observed in the chromatogram these two peaks had the same retention times and ion m z values as the peaks observed in the initial chromatogram before the photodegradation reaction therefore these two peaks represented the remaining e and z endoxifen isomers present in the water sample after 35 s of photodegradation reaction that were undetectable by hplc dad the observation of e and z endoxifen isomers after 35 s of photodegradation using uplc ms ms could be explained by the higher sensitivity of ms ms than dad techniques kopec et al 2013 compared ms and dad detector during a quantitative analysis and showed that ms detector was 37 times more sensitive than dad detector 3 4 3 degree of mineralization mineralization by uv light 253 7 nm of endoxifen was the most desirable outcome toc analysis revealed that e and z endoxifen were mineralized 33 6 and 73 4 after 60 and 120 min of uv light radiation at 224 w respectively supplementary data fig s8 mineralization of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by direct photolysis with uv light 253 7 nm was reported by yazdanbakhsh et al 2018 the uv light mineralized 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by breaking the aromatic ring to small molecules such as carboxylic acids which can be easily converted to co2 and h2o that is also likely the case for the observed e and z endoxifen mineralization 3 5 toxicity study 3 5 1 toxicity assessment the toxicity of e endoxifen z endoxifen pb1a pb1b and pb2 were assessed using test developed by the usepa 2016 acute toxicity 48 h results for d magna as the 50 lethal concentration lc50 were 2 80 μg ml 1 for e and z endoxifen 0 43 μg ml 1 for pb1a and pb1b and 0 16 μg ml 1 for pb2 these modeling results suggest that pb1a pb1b and pb2 are more toxic than e and z endoxifen the results for fathead minnow showed the same trend as those for d magna therefore the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen provided more toxic photodegradation by products according to the european commission regulation no 1272 2008 substances with acute toxicity lc50 for d magna and fathead minnow 1 μg ml 1 are considered hazardous to the aquatic environment however further experimental toxicology analyses are needed to confirm the modeling results although test relies on the quantitative structure activity relationship predictions which are known to be reliable if the molecular structures of the compounds used for the analyses are sufficiently similar to the analyte of interest he and jurs 2005 3 5 2 acute toxicity test the acute ecotoxicity of e and z endoxifen is evaluated by measuring the mortality of d magna exposed for 48 h to five different concentrations of endoxifen 11 60 5 80 2 90 1 45 and 0 73 μg ml 1 these concentrations were selected based on previous test modeling results where the lc50 48 h of d magna was 1 45 μg ml 1 however the modeling result showed lower lc50 value for d magna than the in vivo test result fig 4 a linear regression analysis based on the in vivo acute toxicity test of d magna showed a lc50 48 h value of 4 96 0 84 μg ml 1 according to blaauboer et al 2006 biokinetics of the target compound could play an important role during in vivo analyses the distribution of the target compound in the solution could be uneven due to absorption metabolism or elimination by the target organ ending up in lower or higher concentrations blaauboer et al 2006 therefore it is difficult to extrapolate a toxic dose from modeling analysis to in vivo assays blaauboer et al 2006 the available information to compare the acute ecotoxicity result is very limited borgatta et al 2015 performed a two generation study in vivo where the effect of endoxifen on reproduction and growth was determined for d pulex they reported a 100 mortality of d pulex exposed to endoxifen at 0 2 μg ml 1 for 4 days which was the higher tested concentration in the present work the lc50 value was higher than that reported by borgatta et al 2015 it could be explained by the shorter exposure time of d magna to endoxifen 2 days versus 4 days for borgatta s study and the established mortality measurement at 50 of the population instead of 100 it should be noted that the acute toxicity test was not performed on pbps because they cannot be isolated samples after photodegradation contained all pbps and remaining e and z endoxifen 3 6 photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in treated wastewater the photodegradation reaction of e and z endoxifen in treated wastewater followed a second order kinetic reaction with r2 0 99 and reaction rate constants k of 72 9 and 75 9 μm s 1 respectively based on r2 of the fittings the second order model is a more suitable choice than the zero and first order models using the same emission light intensity 56 w the photodegradation reaction rates of e and z endoxifen in wastewater were almost twice greater than the reaction rate constants in hplc water samples this large difference in k values could be explained by the presence of different photochemical processes or secondary processes that are quite likely in wastewater versus hplc water the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in hplc water samples occurred through direct photolysis by the direct absorption of uv light that resulted in a chemical transformation of the molecular structures of e and z endoxifen however the presence of other molecules such as natural and xenobiotic organics in the wastewater sample that also absorbed uv light could induce the chemical transformation of e and z endoxifen through indirect or sensitized photolysis therefore photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater occurred likely through two different photochemical processes direct photolysis and indirect photolysis resulting in higher k values the indirect photolysis of e and z endoxifen in wastewater samples also explains the difference in the photodegradation kinetics first order in water and second order in wastewater it should be noted that secondary treated wastewater is complex and contains many other chemical ionic species such as bicarbonate nitrite and nitrate that could enhance and or reduce photodegradation kang et al 2018 the effect of each of these species could only be isolated only through experiments in high purity water such as distilled deionized or hplc water in order to determine if e and z endoxifen photodegradation takes place during uv light disinfection at wwtps wastewater samples spiked with e and z endoxifen were irradiated with light doses similar to those applied at wwtps fig 5 more efficient e and z endoxifen photodegradation was observed at higher uv light doses the initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen in wastewater were reduced by 30 and 31 after receiving the minimal uv light dose for disinfection established by the usepa 2006 of 16 mj cm 2 wwtps with filtered nitrified secondary effluents normally apply a minimal uv light dose of 30 mj cm 2 shin et al 2001 the irradiation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater with a light dose of 30 mj cm 2 resulted in a reduction of the concentrations by 44 and 46 respectively moreover the use of higher light dose of 97 mj cm 2 which is not uncommon for conventional wwtps darby et al 1993 reduced e and z endoxifen by 71 and 72 respectively therefore e and z endoxifen if present in secondary treated wastewater would be photodegraded by uv disinfection process in order to determine the presence of pb1 a b and pb2 in the wastewater sample after the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen isomers uplc ms ms analyses were performed before and 35 s after irradiation at an emission light intensity of 56 w the chromatogram of the wastewater sample before irradiation with uv light showed two main peaks rt 1 71 min and rt 1 83 min with the same ion m z values as endoxifen ion m z 374 21 supplementary data fig s9 the absence of these two peaks in the initial chromatogram before e and z endoxifen were spiked suggests that these two peaks were e and z endoxifen isomers the chromatogram after 35 s of irradiation had four main peaks two of the peaks rt 1 57 min and rt 1 64 min had the same ion m z value as pb1 a b ion m z 372 19 further ms ms analyses revealed that these two peaks represented pb1 a b the other two peaks at the chromatogram after 35 s of irradiation showed similar retention times rt 1 71 min and rt 1 84 min and the same ion m z values ion m z 374 21 as the peaks observed in the initial chromatogram before the photodegradation reaction these two peaks were therefore residual e and z endoxifen in the wastewater sample therefore the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wwtps potentially led to the generation of the toxic pb1 a b 4 conclusions photodegradation process based on monochromatic uv light irradiation at 253 7 nm is an efficient process for removing e and z endoxifen from water the irradiation resulted in 99 1 elimination of e and z endoxifen in 35 s at a light dose of 598 5 mj cm 2 the irradiation of e and z endoxifen with uv light intensity at 224 w for 120 min resulted in mineralization of endoxifen in water at 73 4 photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater was more efficient than that in water although uv photodegradation is a promising process for degrading e and z endoxifen in water three pbps potentially more toxic than e and z endoxifen based on modeling prediction were observed along the photodegradation time course two of the three pbps were also observed during the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater with uv light doses similar to those applied at wwtps suggesting that uv disinfection process can deliver an undesirable side effect on chemical water quality environmental risk assessments and in vivo toxicity studies of endoxifen and its pbps in the aquatic environment are recommended for future work in addition advanced oxidation processes using uv in combination with strong oxidants such as ozone and peroxide and photocatalysis and extended photolysis with visible light should be investigated as alternative methods to degrade endoxifen especially to drive the degradation pathway completely beyond its toxic pbps research along these lines is currently being conducted by the

18218,endoxifen is an effective metabolite of a common chemotherapy agent tamoxifen endoxifen which is toxic to aquatic animals has been detected in wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent this research investigates ultraviolet uv radiation 253 7 nm application to degrade e and z endoxifen in water and wastewater and phototransformation by products pbps and their toxicity the effects of light intensity ph and initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen on the photodegradation rate were examined endoxifen in water was eliminated 99 1 after 35 s of irradiation light dose of 598 5 mj cm 2 light intensity and initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen exhibited positive trends with the photodegradation rates while ph had no effect photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in water resulted in three pbps toxicity assessments through modeling of the identified pbps suggest higher toxicity than the parent compounds photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater at light doses used for disinfection in wwtps 16 30 and 97 mj cm 2 resulted in reductions of e and z endoxifen from 30 to 71 two of the three pbps observed in the experiments with water were detected in the wastewater experiments therefore toxic compounds are potentially generated at wwtps by uv disinfection if e and z endoxifen are present in treated wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords by products endoxifen photodegradation toxicity uv light 1 introduction during the last decade the presence of cytostatic drugs in the environment has been a growing concern worldwide cytostatic drugs are a group of chemotherapy drugs used to inhibit the proliferation of carcinogenic cells the abundance of these chemotherapy drugs in the environment is related to their frequency of consumption johnson et al 2013 in the last 40 years tamoxifen has been the most widely used cytostatic drug to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancer the type that accounts for 70 of all breast cancer cases worldwide johnson et al 2004 negreira et al 2015 furthermore tamoxifen is used as a preventive long term treatment for women with high risk of breast cancer fisher et al 2005 the effectiveness of tamoxifen for patients diagnosed with breast cancer relies on an ability of the liver to actively metabolize the drug by the cyp2d6 enzyme to endoxifen zhang et al 2015 the major and most effective metabolite resulting from tamoxifen conversion is trans isomer z endoxifen or commonly called endoxifen jaremko et al 2010 milroy et al 2018 however z endoxifen easily undergoes cis isomerization to e endoxifen elkins et al 2014 although both isomers present antiestrogenic activity z endoxifen is considered the isomer responsible for the inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation due to its higher antiestrogenic ability jaremko et al 2010 despite the fact endoxifen is an effective treatment for breast cancer it presents possible consequences on the environment environment canada 2015 endoxifen is not completely metabolized in human body and is actively excreted kisanga et al 2005 as a result endoxifen is potentially released to the water environment via wastewater treatment plants wwtps negreira et al 2014 endoxifen has been detected in hospital effluents and wastewater but there is no data on its concentration in the environment evgenidou et al 2015 olalla et al 2018 several studies reported the presence of tamoxifen in the level of ng l 1 to μg l 1 in surface water and wastewater ashton et al 2004 coetsier et al 2009 environment canada 2015 lara martín et al 2014 roberts and thomas 2006 thomas and hilton 2004 tamoxifen and endoxifen present similar chemical and molecular structures which suggest a similar fate the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen produces negative effects on fish reproduction and physiology maradonna et al 2009 because endoxifen is 30 100 times more potent than tamoxifen jager et al 2012 and presents antiestrogenic activity johnson et al 2004 environment canada 2015 its presence in natural water bodies could result in a toxic effect on aquatic lives there has been only one study on the toxicity of endoxifen on aquatic lives borgatta et al 2015 the study showed a reproductive decline and mortality of daphnia pulex exposed to endoxifen at the level of μg l 1 d pulex is a primary consumer of the tropic network in freshwater environments grzesiuk et al 2019 d pulex population is directly related to algal biomass and is the main food source for planktivorous fishes sommer et al 1986 grzesiuk et al 2019 reduction in d pulex reproductive abilities together with increased mortality caused by the presence of endoxifen in water environments could trigger a serious adverse effect to the survival of other aquatic species furthermore the predicted no effect concentration of tamoxifen in aquatic environment is 0 51 μg l 1 and is considered applicable to endoxifen due the lack of toxicology studies specifically on endoxifen environment canada 2015 therefore the elimination of endoxifen from water and wastewater is necessary to avoid possible toxicological effects there have been increasing interests in finding a suitable technique for treating pharmaceutical compounds phcs in water and wastewater among these techniques photodegradation with uv light 253 7 nm has demonstrated to be a highly efficient method to eliminate pharmaceuticals in water and wastewater previous laboratory bench scale studies using low pressure lp mercury lamps emitting uv light at 253 7 nm reported efficient degradation of phcs including antibiotic nitromidazoles and endocrine disruptors such as norfloxacin doxycycline and mefenamic pereira et al 2007 prados joya et al 2011 rivas et al 2010 the treatment of phcs by uv light should produce photodegradation by products pbps that are less toxic than their parent compounds larson and berenbaum 1988 the identification and the toxicity assessment of potential pbps need to be investigated before actual applications of the technique lp mercury lamps 253 7 nm are also commonly used in uv disinfection process at wwtps however the uv light doses applied at wwtps are lower than those applied for photodegradation of contaminants because the use of uv light for disinfection of treated wastewater has gained more attention guo et al 2009 it might be interesting to determine the photodegradability of endoxifen in wastewater at light doses similar to those applied for disinfection at wwtps the objective of this study was to investigate the ability of uv light 253 7 nm to photodegrade e and z endoxifen in water and wastewater the identification of potential photodegradation by products and the assessment of their toxicity were carried out the photodegradation efficiency and rate of endoxifen in wastewater at uv light intensities typically used for disinfection at wwtps were also elucidated in addition the effects of uv light intensity ph and initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen in water on the photodegradation rate were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals preparations of stock and standard solutions and water and

activated sludge and moving bed bioreactor processes the samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane filter whatman pittsburgh pa usa before being spiked with e and z endoxifen 2 2 photodegradation experimental setup and procedure laboratory scale photodegradation experiments were performed in a rpr 200 rayonet photoreactor southern new england ultraviolet company branford ct usa equipped with a cooling fan to keep the photoreactor temperature at 23 25 c the photoreactor could accommodate sixteen 14 w lamps emitting uv light at 253 7 nm the emission light

optimization of photodegradation kinetics and efficiency 2 3 1 effect of uv light intensity photodegradation kinetics and efficiency of e and z endoxifen were tested at the following emission uv light intensities in triplicate 28 w 2 lamps 56 w 4 lamps 112 w 8 lamps 168 w 12 lamps and 224 w 16 lamps five ml water samples directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 2 μg ml 1 total endoxifen concentration 1 μg ml 1 for each type of endoxifen at ph 7 were exposed to uv light 253 7 nm the concentration of e and z endoxifen used for photodegradation optimization was according to the maximum solubility of both e and z endoxifen in water 1 μg ml 1 vcclab 2016 this concentration was selected based on the ability of hplc dad to determine the e and z endoxifen concentrations accurately and precisely and in turn the confidence on the results on effect of uv light intensity on endoxifen concentrations the concentration was also well below the estimated maximum solubility of endoxifen of 2 79 μg ml 1 reported by environment canada 2015 the water samples were irradiated for 80 s at 28 w 60 s at 56 w 45 s at 112 w and 30 s at 168 and 224 w at different time intervals 1 ml aliquots were collected by sacrificing samples as described above in subsection 2 2 and analyzed for endoxifen concentrations controls in the dark were ran in parallel for 80 s different irradiation time periods chosen for different light intensities were based on preliminary results these time periods allowed observations of adequate endoxifen degradation profiles for kinetics determination 2 3 2 effect of initial ph five ml water samples directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 2 μg ml 1 were irradiated in triplicate at a constant uv light intensity of 28 w for 80 s the lower uv light intensity of 28 w was selected because it allowed longer photodegradation time and consequently the ability to collect enough number of samples 1 ml aliquot for every 10 s for endoxifen concentration determination by hplc dad to observe the effect of ph on e and z endoxifen photodegradation kinetics the initial ph of the samples was varied at 5 6 7 8 and 9 the ph adjustment was performed by using 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh the ph after the irradiation was also recorded 2 3 3 effect of initial endoxifen concentrations effect of initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen total endoxifen concentrations of 0 5 1 and 2 μg ml 1 1 1 w w on the photodegradation kinetics and efficiency was tested in triplicate water samples directly spiked with the desired concentrations of e and

sunlight and indoor lamp were collected every 15 s the collected samples were analyzed for e and z endoxifen using hplc dad 2 4 role of hydroxyl radicals the contribution of e and z endoxifen degradation by hydroxyl radicals generated during uv photodegradation was investigated isopropyl alcohol ipa and benzoic acid ba were separately added to water samples to quench hydroxyl radical generated by uv light 253 7 nm jo et al 2017 wu et al 2015 water samples with ipa 1 v v with ba 50 mg l 1 and without ipa or ba all of them directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 2 μg ml 1 were irradiated by uv light 253 7 nm at a constant light intensity of 224 w for 30 s the experiment was conducted in triplicate controls dark condition were included one milliliter aliquot was collected with time and analyzed for e and z endoxifen concentrations 2 5 quantum yield incident light intensity and light dose quantum yield φ incident light intensity and light dose determinations are described in supplementary data section s3 2 6 mineralization of e and z endoxifen by uv light mineralization of e and z endoxifen was tested in a water sample directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 2 μg ml 1 and exposed to uv light 253 7 nm at 224 w for 60 and 120 min forty milliliters aliquots at each testing time point were collected and analyzed for total organic carbon toc as described in subsection 2 9 the experiment was tested in triplicate and dark control samples were run in parallel 2 7 toxicity evaluation details on the toxicity evaluation of endoxifen and pbps are provided in supplementary data section s4 2 8 photodegradation experiments in wastewater two experiments were conducted with the secondary treated wastewater samples described in subsection 2 1 one to determine the photodegradation kinetics of e and z endoxifen in wastewater and the other to simulate photodegradation of e and z endoxifen at light doses used in wwtps for disinfection process for both experiments 5 ml water samples directly spiked with a mixture of e and z endoxifen 1 1 w w at 1 μg ml 1 and control samples were run in parallel in the dark to determine the presence of side reactions that could reduce the concentrations of e and z endoxifen in the sample to determine the photodegradation kinetics of e and z endoxifen wastewater samples were irradiated with an emission light intensity of 56 w for 45 s the experiment was triplicated one milliliter aliquot was collected with time by sacrificing sample and analyzed for e and z endoxifen concentrations by hplc dad for the second experiment wastewater samples were irradiated at an emission uv light intensity of 56 w incident light intensity 2 77 mw cm 2 details in subsection 3 3 for 6 11 and 35 s in order to simulate the uv light doses applied at wwtps of 16 usepa 2006 30 shin et al 2001 and 97 darby et al 1993 mj cm 2 respectively irradiation time periods of 15 25 and 45 s corresponding to light doses of 42 69 and 125 mj cm 2 were also experimented for more data points to confirm a trend if there was any between light dose and endoxifen reduction one milliliter aliquots were collected at the specified time points and analyzed for e and z endoxifen concentrations by hplc dad the potential molecular structures of observed pbps at 35 s were identified by uhplc ms ms following the previously described method 2 9 chemical analyses toc was determined using a uv persulfate oxidation toc analyzer phoenix 8000 tekmar dohrmann oh usa nitrite and nitrate concentrations of the wastewater samples were analyzed using the nitrite tnt840 plus vial test and nitrate tnt835 plus vial test respectively hach loveland co usa ph of the water and wastewater samples was measured by a ph meter thermo scientific orion stara2110 equipped with a ph probe orion ross ultra glass triode 2 10 statistical analysis statistical analysis of data was performed by the analysis of variance anova using minitab 1 7 the significance of the independent variable light intensity ph initial concentration and ipa was evaluated for e and z photodegradation rate in water with a 95 level of confidence using the tukey test the obtained p values 0 05 indicated the significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of photodegradation kinetics and efficiency 3 1 1 effect of light intensity on endoxifen photodegradation e and z endoxifen photodegradation at five different emission light intensities 28 56 112 168 and 224 w followed first order kinetics fig 1 a and b the determination coefficient values r2 of the fitness were greater than 0 97 at all light intensities for first order reaction while zero and second order fits had lower r2 the photodegradation rate constants k of e and z endoxifen isomers for the first order kinetic model and the emission light intensities were linearly related r2 0 949 and 0 935 for e and z endoxifen respectively anova results also indicated that the effect of light intensity on the photodegradation rate was significant p 1 10 8 for e and z endoxifen the maximum emission light intensity of 224 w provided the highest photodegradation rates of e and z endoxifen isomers with k values of 0 077 0 0054 and 0 083 0 0056 s 1 respectively previous studies focused on phenol photodegradation reported that the greater uv light intensity the greater the number of photons present in the water sample to carry on first order photodegradation reactions chiou and juang 2007 udom et al 2014 likewise the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen was greater as the emission light intensity increased 3 1 2 effect of ph on endoxifen photodegradation the maximum k values for e and z endoxifen isomers of 0 017 and 0 015 s 1 were observed at initial ph 7 and 9 respectively supplementary data fig s1 the differences between the maximum and minimum k values for e and z endoxifen isomers for different ph values tested were 0 002 s 1 for both isomers these results suggest that the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen isomers in water was not ph dependent statistical analysis anova confirms that the photodegradation rate was independent of the ph tested p 0 950 for e endoxifen and p 0 884 for z endoxifen changes in ph before and after 80 s of photodegradation reaction with an emission light intensity of 28 w were calculated ph decreased in all the cases except for the initial ph of 5 this acidification could be due to the presence of a hydroxyaromatic group in the molecular structure of endoxifen it is well known that hydroxyaromatic compounds present a different pka value during the lowest excitation state due to their acid base property jin et al 2017 lawrence et al 1991 it is also well known that pka of aromatic hydroxyl groups will decrease upon photoexcitation clay et al 2018 the formation of phenantrene derivative one the photoproducts discussed in subsection 3 4 2 likely impacted the ph profile of the solution the pka values of endoxifen calculated by modeling and reported by environment canada 2015 are 10 36 acid and 9 4 base experimental work needs to be conducted in order to accurately determine the pka of e and z endoxifen and the photoproducts formed under the same conditions experimented in this study 3 1 3 effect of initial endoxifen concentration on endoxifen photodegradation the reaction rate constants k for e and z endoxifen exhibit positive linear relationships with their initial concentrations r2 0 99 supplementary data fig s2 the photodegradation rate was dependent on initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen p 0 0001 for e and z endoxifen the percent photodegradation of e and z endoxifen notably decreased by 59 and 57 respectively when the concentration was reduced from 2 to 0 5 mg l 1 previous studies reported a similar correlation between k pseudo first order and the initial concentrations of aromatic compounds oxytetracycline chrysene benzo a pyrene phenanthrene and acenaphthene during photodegradation jin et al 2017 miller and olejnik 2001 according to jin et al 2017 a thermodynamic collision could occur along with photolysis in this study two photo excited endoxifen molecules could collide triggering the thermodynamic collision reaction therefore the number of excited molecules is directly proportional to the concentration of endoxifen in the ground state hence the photolysis of e and z endoxifen is not only due to the light energy but molecular collision could also play an important role 3 1 4 effect of light source on endoxifen photodegradation the concentrations of e and z endoxifen isomers remained constant with time after 60 s of indoor and sunlight irradiation fig 2 effective photodegradation of e and z endoxifen isomers was observed when the water samples were exposed to uv light 253 7 nm after 35 s of uv light exposure the concentrations of e and z endoxifen isomers were below the lower limit of detection llod llod e endoxifen 12 66 ng ml 1 llod z endoxifen 12 12 ng ml 1 therefore the concentrations of both isomers e and z endoxifen were reduced by at least 99 1 after 35 s of irradiation by an emission uv light intensity of 224 w incident light intensity of 17 1 mw cm 2 details in subsection 3 3 corresponding to a uv light dose of 598 5 mj cm 2 these results showed the suitability of uv light to effectively photodegrade e and z endoxifen isomers in water 3 2 role of hydroxyl radicals hplc water was used as solvent for e and z endoxifen isomers during uv photodegradation reactions at 254 nm the formation of oh from water irradiated with uv light at 254 nm was unlikely to confirm that the contribution of oh to photodegradation of e and z endoxifen was examined ipa 1 and ba 50 mg l 1 were used as oh scavengers during the photodegradation the samples with and without ipa or ba showed similar photodegradation reaction profiles but anova results showed that photodegradation rates of e and z endoxifen were dependent on the presence of ipa or ba p 0 003 for both e and z endoxifen fig 3 the samples with ipa had the k values of 0 06 0 0006 and 0 07 0 001 s 1 while the samples with ba had the k values of 0 12 0 0009 and 0 12 0 0003 s 1 for e and z endoxifen respectively however the samples without ipa and ba resulted in the k values of 0 08 0 0007 and 0 09 0 0007 s 1 for e and z endoxifen respectively if e and z endoxifen photodegradation was enhanced by the presence of oh in the solution lower k values were expected for e and z endoxifen photodegradation with the addition of oh scavengers the presence of ba in the solution enhanced the photodegradation reaction while ipa reduced the photodegradation reaction kinetic of e and z endoxifen this difference in photodegradation performance between oh quenchers was previously reported by wu et al 2015 in a study focusing on chlorine uv degradation of a common azo dye c i reactive red 2 rr2 in water the addition of ba also resulted in higher removal efficiency of rr2 than other oh quenchers a previous study demonstrated that ba when irradiated with light acted as an electron donor enhancing photodegradation rate of an aromatic compound tartrazine zhou et al 2019 therefore the addition of ipa or ba itself seems to affect the photodegradation reaction rate of e and z endoxifen rather than oh radicals a previous study on the photodegradation of low brominated diphenyl ether in water reported similar results and attributed to the effect of ipa addition dual solvent of ipa and hplc water versus single solvent of hplc water rather than oh contribution wang et al 2015 that is also likely the case for the observed e and z endoxifen photodegradation results these results suggest that oh radicals do not play an important role during photodegradation reaction of e and z endoxifen with uv light 253 7 nm 3 3 quantum yield and emission light intensity the quantum yield value decreased as the emission light intensity increased supplementary data fig s3 this observation suggests that photons absorbance by e and z endoxifen were more efficient at lower light intensities this inverse relationship between emission light intensity and quantum yield was previously observed in previous photoreaction studies chowdhury et al 2017 fujishima et al 2000 although e and z endoxifen were photodegraded more efficiently and rapidly at higher emission light intensities fig 1 and supplementary data table s1 when taking quatum yield into consideration supplementary data fig s3 e and z endoxifen photodegradation at lower emission light intensities was more energy efficient there is a need to calculate the incident light intensity in the sample as the emission light intensity is attenuated by several factors such as lamp aging lamp bulb wall temperature lamp operating frequency quartz sleeve absorption and distance between sample and light source as expected emission light intensities were much higher than the incident light intensities supplementary data table s2 the incident light intensities allow the calculation of light doses applied to the water samples by multiplying by the irradiation time as expected lower irradiation intensities need longer irradiation time to achieve a targeted light dose however the incident light intensity at the lower emission intensity 56 w was remarkably low this result suggests that light energy dissipation was even higher when lower emission energy was applied to the water samples in the photoreactor 3 4 detection and identification of photodegradation by products and degree of mineralization 3 4 1 detection of photodegradation by products by hplc dad the chromatogram peak areas corresponding to e and z endoxifen isomers decreased with time until they became undetectable lod e endoxifen 12 66 ng ml 1 lod z endoxifen 12 12 ng ml 1 after 35 s of uv light exposure at 224 w data not shown however a new chromatogram peak with a retention time of 11 43 min was observed as e and z endoxifen isomers were degraded after 30 s of photodegradation the new peak presented a total chromatogram percentage area of 82 the presence of this new peak suggested the formation of at least one photodegradation by product s 3 4 2 identification of photodegradation by products by uhplc ms ms a water sample containing e and z endoxifen isomers was exposed to uv light 253 7 nm for 35 s and then injected to uplc ms ms in order to identify the molecular weight of the photodegradation by products three new peaks were observed in the resultant chromatogram supplementary data fig s4 the first peak pb1a and second peak pb1b had the same ion m z value 372 19 this ion m z value indicated an aromatization of e and z endoxifen isomers forming a phenanthrene skeleton by the elimination of two hydrogen h and the formation of one molecular bond between two benzene rings the reaction led to a con rotatory 6π photocyclization resulting in the formation of a dihydrophenanthrene skeleton supplementary data scheme s1 the subsequent oxidation reaction leading to the aromatic phenanthrene is favorable due the formation conjugated aromatic system enhanced aromaticity a previous study on the detection of endoxifen by hplc with a fluorescence detector reported the formation of a photocycled derivate with a phenanthrene nucleus after the irradiation of endoxifen by uv light aranda et al 2011 furthermore the minimal differences in ppm 10 between the expected ion m z mass and the theoretical ion m z mass of the proposed molecular structures for pb1a and pb1b support the suggested aromatization of e and z endoxifen after 35 s of uv irradiation table 1 the third new peak observed with a retention time of 2 03 min pb2 showed an ion m z value of 374 21 this ion m z value observed at 35 s was similar to the observed ion m z value of e and z endoxifen isomers however the retention time of pb2 was different from the retention times observed for e and z endoxifen isomers therefore the presence of this new peak pb2 with the same ion m z value as e and z endoxifen isomers but different retention time suggests the presence of a new pbp with the same molecular weight as e and z endoxifen isomers the primary photoproduct dihydrophenanthrene formed during the con rotatory 6π photocyclization features the same molecular weight as endoxifen explaining the obtained ion m z value of pb2 however the determination of the molecular structure of pb2 was challenging due the presence of only one peak instead of two peaks nevertheless the stilbene chromophore in endoxifen went common intermediate that might also explain the lack of the regioisomers in pb2 supplementary data scheme s1 pb1 showed two peaks corresponding to the aromatization of e and z endoxifen isomers resulting in two well differentiated photodegradation by products the observation of only one peak for pb2 suggests that either only one of the two endoxifen isomers underwent hydrogenation to pb2 or two peaks got overlapped however pb2 was not considered as the main photodegradation by product due to a small percentage of the chromatogram peak area table 1 shows the two possible molecular structures of pb2 which are isomers depending on whether the hydrogenation occurred in the e endoxifen isomer or the z endoxifen isomer the proposed molecular structures of pb1 a b and pb2 were analyzed through uplc ms ms in order to identify the formed product ions after the fragmentation of e z endoxifen and pb2 through ms ms the ion m z value of 374 21 was selected and fragmented with a cone voltage of 27 ev e and z endoxifen present similar formed product ions as pb2 but the resultant ion m z 223 1140 and the ion m z 194 0757 were not observed on the pb2 ms ms spectrum supplementary data fig s5 the proposed molecular structure of pb2 contains a phenanthrene nucleus that could hinder the cleavage of pb2 to generate the fragment ion m z values of 223 1140 and 194 0757 furthermore the proposed molecular structures of pb1 a b also present a phenanthrene nucleus as molecular core ms ms spectra for pb1 a b showed no fragmentation within the phenanthrene nucleus supplementary data fig s6 these findings and explanations agree with transformation products of pb1 a b and pb2 supplementary data fig s7 identified through a similar ms ms analysis approach by li and hu 2018 finally two more peaks 1 and 2 were observed in the chromatogram these two peaks had the same retention times and ion m z values as the peaks observed in the initial chromatogram before the photodegradation reaction therefore these two peaks represented the remaining e and z endoxifen isomers present in the water sample after 35 s of photodegradation reaction that were undetectable by hplc dad the observation of e and z endoxifen isomers after 35 s of photodegradation using uplc ms ms could be explained by the higher sensitivity of ms ms than dad techniques kopec et al 2013 compared ms and dad detector during a quantitative analysis and showed that ms detector was 37 times more sensitive than dad detector 3 4 3 degree of mineralization mineralization by uv light 253 7 nm of endoxifen was the most desirable outcome toc analysis revealed that e and z endoxifen were mineralized 33 6 and 73 4 after 60 and 120 min of uv light radiation at 224 w respectively supplementary data fig s8 mineralization of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by direct photolysis with uv light 253 7 nm was reported by yazdanbakhsh et al 2018 the uv light mineralized 2 4 6 trichlorophenol by breaking the aromatic ring to small molecules such as carboxylic acids which can be easily converted to co2 and h2o that is also likely the case for the observed e and z endoxifen mineralization 3 5 toxicity study 3 5 1 toxicity assessment the toxicity of e endoxifen z endoxifen pb1a pb1b and pb2 were assessed using test developed by the usepa 2016 acute toxicity 48 h results for d magna as the 50 lethal concentration lc50 were 2 80 μg ml 1 for e and z endoxifen 0 43 μg ml 1 for pb1a and pb1b and 0 16 μg ml 1 for pb2 these modeling results suggest that pb1a pb1b and pb2 are more toxic than e and z endoxifen the results for fathead minnow showed the same trend as those for d magna therefore the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen provided more toxic photodegradation by products according to the european commission regulation no 1272 2008 substances with acute toxicity lc50 for d magna and fathead minnow 1 μg ml 1 are considered hazardous to the aquatic environment however further experimental toxicology analyses are needed to confirm the modeling results although test relies on the quantitative structure activity relationship predictions which are known to be reliable if the molecular structures of the compounds used for the analyses are sufficiently similar to the analyte of interest he and jurs 2005 3 5 2 acute toxicity test the acute ecotoxicity of e and z endoxifen is evaluated by measuring the mortality of d magna exposed for 48 h to five different concentrations of endoxifen 11 60 5 80 2 90 1 45 and 0 73 μg ml 1 these concentrations were selected based on previous test modeling results where the lc50 48 h of d magna was 1 45 μg ml 1 however the modeling result showed lower lc50 value for d magna than the in vivo test result fig 4 a linear regression analysis based on the in vivo acute toxicity test of d magna showed a lc50 48 h value of 4 96 0 84 μg ml 1 according to blaauboer et al 2006 biokinetics of the target compound could play an important role during in vivo analyses the distribution of the target compound in the solution could be uneven due to absorption metabolism or elimination by the target organ ending up in lower or higher concentrations blaauboer et al 2006 therefore it is difficult to extrapolate a toxic dose from modeling analysis to in vivo assays blaauboer et al 2006 the available information to compare the acute ecotoxicity result is very limited borgatta et al 2015 performed a two generation study in vivo where the effect of endoxifen on reproduction and growth was determined for d pulex they reported a 100 mortality of d pulex exposed to endoxifen at 0 2 μg ml 1 for 4 days which was the higher tested concentration in the present work the lc50 value was higher than that reported by borgatta et al 2015 it could be explained by the shorter exposure time of d magna to endoxifen 2 days versus 4 days for borgatta s study and the established mortality measurement at 50 of the population instead of 100 it should be noted that the acute toxicity test was not performed on pbps because they cannot be isolated samples after photodegradation contained all pbps and remaining e and z endoxifen 3 6 photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in treated wastewater the photodegradation reaction of e and z endoxifen in treated wastewater followed a second order kinetic reaction with r2 0 99 and reaction rate constants k of 72 9 and 75 9 μm s 1 respectively based on r2 of the fittings the second order model is a more suitable choice than the zero and first order models using the same emission light intensity 56 w the photodegradation reaction rates of e and z endoxifen in wastewater were almost twice greater than the reaction rate constants in hplc water samples this large difference in k values could be explained by the presence of different photochemical processes or secondary processes that are quite likely in wastewater versus hplc water the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in hplc water samples occurred through direct photolysis by the direct absorption of uv light that resulted in a chemical transformation of the molecular structures of e and z endoxifen however the presence of other molecules such as natural and xenobiotic organics in the wastewater sample that also absorbed uv light could induce the chemical transformation of e and z endoxifen through indirect or sensitized photolysis therefore photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater occurred likely through two different photochemical processes direct photolysis and indirect photolysis resulting in higher k values the indirect photolysis of e and z endoxifen in wastewater samples also explains the difference in the photodegradation kinetics first order in water and second order in wastewater it should be noted that secondary treated wastewater is complex and contains many other chemical ionic species such as bicarbonate nitrite and nitrate that could enhance and or reduce photodegradation kang et al 2018 the effect of each of these species could only be isolated only through experiments in high purity water such as distilled deionized or hplc water in order to determine if e and z endoxifen photodegradation takes place during uv light disinfection at wwtps wastewater samples spiked with e and z endoxifen were irradiated with light doses similar to those applied at wwtps fig 5 more efficient e and z endoxifen photodegradation was observed at higher uv light doses the initial concentrations of e and z endoxifen in wastewater were reduced by 30 and 31 after receiving the minimal uv light dose for disinfection established by the usepa 2006 of 16 mj cm 2 wwtps with filtered nitrified secondary effluents normally apply a minimal uv light dose of 30 mj cm 2 shin et al 2001 the irradiation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater with a light dose of 30 mj cm 2 resulted in a reduction of the concentrations by 44 and 46 respectively moreover the use of higher light dose of 97 mj cm 2 which is not uncommon for conventional wwtps darby et al 1993 reduced e and z endoxifen by 71 and 72 respectively therefore e and z endoxifen if present in secondary treated wastewater would be photodegraded by uv disinfection process in order to determine the presence of pb1 a b and pb2 in the wastewater sample after the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen isomers uplc ms ms analyses were performed before and 35 s after irradiation at an emission light intensity of 56 w the chromatogram of the wastewater sample before irradiation with uv light showed two main peaks rt 1 71 min and rt 1 83 min with the same ion m z values as endoxifen ion m z 374 21 supplementary data fig s9 the absence of these two peaks in the initial chromatogram before e and z endoxifen were spiked suggests that these two peaks were e and z endoxifen isomers the chromatogram after 35 s of irradiation had four main peaks two of the peaks rt 1 57 min and rt 1 64 min had the same ion m z value as pb1 a b ion m z 372 19 further ms ms analyses revealed that these two peaks represented pb1 a b the other two peaks at the chromatogram after 35 s of irradiation showed similar retention times rt 1 71 min and rt 1 84 min and the same ion m z values ion m z 374 21 as the peaks observed in the initial chromatogram before the photodegradation reaction these two peaks were therefore residual e and z endoxifen in the wastewater sample therefore the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wwtps potentially led to the generation of the toxic pb1 a b 4 conclusions photodegradation process based on monochromatic uv light irradiation at 253 7 nm is an efficient process for removing e and z endoxifen from water the irradiation resulted in 99 1 elimination of e and z endoxifen in 35 s at a light dose of 598 5 mj cm 2 the irradiation of e and z endoxifen with uv light intensity at 224 w for 120 min resulted in mineralization of endoxifen in water at 73 4 photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater was more efficient than that in water although uv photodegradation is a promising process for degrading e and z endoxifen in water three pbps potentially more toxic than e and z endoxifen based on modeling prediction were observed along the photodegradation time course two of the three pbps were also observed during the photodegradation of e and z endoxifen in wastewater with uv light doses similar to those applied at wwtps suggesting that uv disinfection process can deliver an undesirable side effect on chemical water quality environmental risk assessments and in vivo toxicity studies of endoxifen and its pbps in the aquatic environment are recommended for future work in addition advanced oxidation processes using uv in combination with strong oxidants such as ozone and peroxide and photocatalysis and extended photolysis with visible light should be investigated as alternative methods to degrade endoxifen especially to drive the degradation pathway completely beyond its toxic pbps research along these lines is currently being conducted by the

18219,the electric field assisted membrane bioreactor mbr is an effective technique to alleviate membrane fouling in this study the spontaneous electric field was introduced into the mbr to observe the growth process of cake layer on the membrane surface the external resistance for spontaneous electric field mbr s 50 and s 500 were 50 ω and 500 ω respectively during the experiments s 50 maintained the highest electric field intensity of 11 83 mv cm the reduction of extracellular polymeric substances eps content in activated sludge transmembrane pressure tmp growth rate reached 52 8 and 51 7 respectively after 28 days operation s 50 obtained the minimum contaminant specific biovolume 23 316 μm3 μm2 which was 68 2 lower than that of it in control mbr the metal oxide or metal hydroxide were distributed in the cake layer eps played a significant role in the formation and growth of the cake layer based on the results obtained in this study the growth of the biofouling layer on the membrane surface could be divided into three stages eps first deposited on the membrane surface and then microorganisms embedded in the cake layer to form clusters after that eps and total cells further increased and led to a faster biovolume growth rate subsequently the biovolume growth rate decreased in the cake layer the spontaneous electric field delayed the deposition of eps on the membrane surface the produced h2o2 and oh were beneficial to the degradation of organics causing the smaller contaminant biovolume on the membrane surface this work aims to provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of the electric field to control membrane fouling graphical abstract image 1 keywords spontaneous electric field intensity membrane fouling mitigation growth process 1 introduction the membrane bioreactor mbr is an advanced technology that combines membrane separation and biological process for wastewater treatment the excellent effluent with high pollutant removal efficiency and scarce pathogenic microorganisms could be reused as reclaimed water such preponderance caused the wide application of the mbr in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps with the improvement of mbr technology and accumulation of operation experience exceed 200 mbr wwtps with a capacity of over 10 000 tons d have been installed in china by 2017 xiao et al 2019 the largest mbr wwtp with a designed capacity of 860 000 tons d being constructed is located in stockholm sweden meng et al 2017 although the annual growth rate of the mbr market worldwide increased rapidly the membrane fouling is still an inevitable obstacle for the commercial application judd 2016 it has been widely accepted that membrane fouling is mainly attributed to pore blockage and sludge cake deposition on the membrane surface meng et al 2009 many investigations revealed that the cake layer was the main contributor to membrane fouling meng et al 2007 2009 chao et al 2011 the cake layer formation process involves biofouling i e deposition growth and metabolism of bacteria cells or sludge flocs organic fouling i e adsorption of proteins and polysaccharides and inorganic fouling e g carbonates and metal ions meng et al 2009 classically biofouling and organic fouling rather than inorganic fouling dominate the cake layer formation and further govern the membrane fouling in mbrs the contaminants embedded in the cake layer are mainly derived from sludge flocs wei et al 2018 thus modifying sludge properties is beneficial in controlling membrane fouling most reported fouling control strategies including chemical biological and physical methods are closely related to the improvement of the activated sludge properties chang et al 2019 the aluminum sulfate liu et al 2011a and ozone liu et al 2011b were added respectively to the influent of mbr the sludge properties e g dissolved organic matter content particle size were changed due to the improved pollutant removal rate as a consequence the transmembrane pressures tmp were 13 5 kpa and 12 5 kpa lower than that of conventional mbr within the same operation time however the addition of chemicals increased the cost and caused secondary pollution adding predatory microorganisms to mbr promoted the decrease of extracellular polymeric substances eps content of the activated sludge finally maintained the tmp below 5 kpa during 100 days operation while the final tmp in the conventional mbr increased to 30 kpa tian et al 2012 however the growth and distribution of microorganisms were difficult to control accurately recent efforts have been mostly focused on the electric field belonged to physical method to mitigate membrane fouling the electric field force effectively prevented the negatively charged sludge and colloids depositing on the membrane surface fan et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 appropriate electric field intensity also could promote the metabolism of sludge through electrical stimulation thus enhancing the degradation of organics and reducing the membrane fouling ma et al 2015 moreover the generated h2o2 in the reactor contributed to alleviating membrane fouling via in situ oxidization of the organics in the sludge wang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2012 used an applied external voltage in a mbr the electric field intensity of 0 073 v cm was generated in the reactor the results showed that compared with the traditional mbr 20 0 25 0 flux enhancement and 20 times reduction of filtration resistance were achieved besides the eps content decreased by 33 5 and the sludge activity increased by 24 8 a study was conducted by wang et al 2016 to investigate the impact of the spontaneous electric field an intensity of 0 114 v cm on membrane fouling mitigation the tmp growth rate was 47 5 57 5 lower than that of traditional mbr however the electric field mbr could not eliminate membrane fouling the pollutants still deposited on the membrane surface our previous studies have found that the foulant composition of the cake layer in electric field mbr was similar to that of traditional mbr huang et al 2017 yin et al 2019 the formation and growth of cake layer on the membrane

lantian peier membrane co ltd china as the cathode control mbr 2 3 inoculation and operation the activated sludge collected from the laboratory scale mbr was inoculated in the anaerobic 3 g l and

concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were 330 0 6 2 34 8 1 2 37 8 2 5 and 2 8 0 2 mg l respectively the anaerobic effluent passed through the baffle zone and then flowed into the aerobic tank the aerobic effluent was filtered by the membrane module under a constant flux 15 74 l m2 h with an intermittent suction of 8 min

effluent quality indicated the successful startup table 1 and table s2 an operation cycle was finished every time the tmp reached 25 kpa all the reactors were operated at a constant temperature of 30 1 c 2 4 offline batch experiments for eps adsorption on the membrane surface the commercial pvdf membrane and cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane were respectively used to filter the activated sludge mixture 4 g l in the cup ultrafilter 300 ml msc300 shanghai mosu scientific equipment co ltd china the operating pressure was 25 kpa after the filtration the eps content in activated sludge on

was spectrophotometrically determined by the potassium iodide method plakas et al 2013 oh concentration was determined by the phenanthroline method ning et al 2015 the components of eps were measured by the three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem f 7000 hitachi japan yang et al 2016 the colorimetric experiments were used to determine the eps content liu et al 2017 particle size distribution psd of sludge was determined by the laser particle size analyzer bt 2003 dandong baite instrument co ltd china the fouled membranes were imaged using scanning electron microscope sem su1510 hitachi japan and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm 710 zeiss germany yuan et al 2015 the clsm image was segmented into binary image based on image pixels segmentation by a software named phlip which equipped with automated threshold determination to quantitatively analyze clsm data mueller et al 2006 the cake layer parameters including substratum coverage c biovolume v μm3 thickness m μm and roughness r were calculated from the binary image stacks the formulas were as follows 1 c foreground pixels total number of pixels 100 where the foreground was defined as each pixel with a grey value above a given threshold 2 v n px2 z 3 vs v a where n was the number of foreground pixels px2 was the squared pixel size z was the scanning step size vs was the specific biovolume μm3 μm2 a was the area in the field of view of clsm 1353964 96 μm2 4 m h where h was the maximal height of every point in the xy plane corresponding foreground pixels in z direction 5 r σx 2 σy 2 σz 2 m where σx σy and σz was the standard deviation of the distribution containing the value of the x y and z coordinates of each foreground pixel the element composition of the fouling membranes was determined using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx falona edax usa liu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 tmp variation the electric field intensities were controlled at 11 83 mv cm and 3 79 mv cm for s 50 and s 500 respectively no electric field was detected in control mbr due to the high electro resistance of the pvdf membrane wang et al 2017 the two electron reduction reaction occurred in the cathode in sef mbrs the generated h2o2 contents were 1 46 mg l and 1 22 mg l for s 50 and s 500 respectively the effluent quality cod nh4 n tn and tp of sef mbrs was complied with the criterion of integrated wastewater discharge standard gb18918 2002 class a of the first grade standard in china the effect of electric field intensity on tmp was shown in fig 2 after 28 days operation the tmp of control mbr reached 25 kpa the membrane fouling rate 0 89 kpa d of control mbr was 43 8 and 51 7 higher than that of s 500 and s 50 respectively with the increase of electric field intensity membrane fouling rate decreased the electric fields in the sef mbrs retarded the pollutants deposition on the membrane surfaces liu et al 2012 for each reactor sem edx observed that fe ca mg na and k were the main metals in the dense cake layer on the membrane surface fig 3 and table 2 the content of the o element in the membrane cake layer was the highest revealing the presence of metals and metallic oxides or metallic hydroxides on the membrane surface with the increase of electric field intensity the metal elements content adsorbed on the membrane surface increased the metal content of s 50 was 36 2 which was 8 6 and 36 5 higher than that of s 500 and control mbr respectively as the r ex decreased from 500 ω to 50 ω the electron transfer resistance reduced thus more electrons were enriched on the membrane surface attracting more metal ions adewale et al 2015 however s 50 with the highest metal elements content achieved the lowest tmp growth rate it could be presumed that inorganic fouling was subordinate to membrane fouling based on the above variations of tmp three points in the control mbr were selected for investigating the growth of organic and biofouling layer on the membrane surface point 1 on the 6th day represented the initial deposition of sludge stage 1 point 2 on the 10th day stood for the period of the cake layer formation stage 2 besides point 3 on the 28th day was chosen to investigate the long term operation of control mbr stage 3 fig 2 also showed that variations of tmp in s 50 and s 500 were similar to that in the control mbr during the same running time of 6 and 10 days respectively indicating that the fouled cu nws conductive microfiltration membranes taken out from sef mbrs could represent the cake layers formed on the membrane surface in days 6 and 10 respectively in a long term operation 3 2 the organic fouling and biofouling in the cake layer the clsm images of fouled membranes were exhibited to represent organic fouling and biofouling in the cake layer fig 4 and table 3 it was obvious that proteins polysaccharides and total cells were distributed on the cultured membrane surfaces eps a highly viscous substance secreted by bacteria was the major membrane fouling factor biswas et al 2015 meng et al 2017 the eps contents on the membrane surfaces were shown in table s3 with the prolongation of the operation time the increasing eps content enhanced the roughness of the cake layer the higher roughness of the cake layer led to more microorganisms adhering to the membrane surface increasing the thickness of the cake layer after 28 days operation s 50 with highest electric field intensity obtained a lowest eps content 928 4 29 5 mg m2 and a minimum growth rate of cake layer thickness 1 8 μm d while control mbr achieved a highest eps content 2410 3 25 5 mg m2 and a maximum growth rate of cake layer thickness 4 2 μm d it was obvious that the spontaneous electric field in the sef mbrs reduced the adhesion of contaminants on the membrane surface on the one hand the positively charged protons on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface could neutralize the negative charges of the eps thus inhibiting the growth of eps on the membrane surface tian et al 2015 on the other hand the produced h2o2 and oh radicals in sef mbrs degraded the eps wu et al 2017 eem spectra of eps in cake layers figs s3 s5 and tables s4 s6 showed that compared with control mbr redshifts for characteristic peaks were observed in sef mbrs due to the cleavage of the conjugated double bond besides there was almost no difference in eps content between s 50 and s 500 after 28 days operation which might be due to the higher metal content on the membrane surface as known proteins and polysaccharides contained a large number of negatively charged functional groups such as carboxyl phosphorus hydroxyl and sulfuric acid groups which were easy to combine with metal ions meng et al 2009 the highest metal content 36 2 on the s 50 membrane caused a high concentration of eps 3 2 1 clsm images of polysaccharides β d glucopyranose polysaccharides are one of the major components of the membrane fouling yuan et al 2015 s 50 had less distribution of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides on the membrane surface on the 6th day fig s6 with the increment of operation a denser cake layer gradually formed on the membrane surface however a uniform layer was formed in the control mbr on the 6th day and most of them aggregated into a cluster then the clusters grew larger and more porous during the 28 days operation the biovolumes of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in sef mbrs were always lower than that of control mbr table 4 however the biovolume proportion of s 50 was larger than that of s 500 and control mbr indicating the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides were abundant in the whole growth process of the cake layer in s 50 the biodegradability of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides was different from that of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides exhibiting the different biovolume and biovolume proportion the α d glucopyranose polysaccharides distributed in clusters with a highly non uniform manner during the entire operation fig s7 it was noteworthy that no α d glucopyranose polysaccharides were detected in s 50 on the 6th day table 4 however the α d glucopyranose polysaccharides specific biovolumes were 3 724 μm3 μm2 and 6 155 μm3 μm2 for s 500 and control mbr respectively it could be attributed to the degradation of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides by higher h2o2 and oh radicals contents in s 50 drews 2010 compared to the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in s 50 α d glucopyranose polysaccharides were less during the entire growth process of the cake layer illustrating that β d glucopyranose polysaccharides played a more important role in the growth process of the cake layer the increasing polysaccharides coverages and biovolumes of s 50 and control mbr demonstrated no detachment from the cake layer table 4 table s7 showed that the growth trend of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides of s 50 in three stages was similar to that of control mbr s 50 had a maximum α d glucopyranose polysaccharides growth rate in stage 2 while the faster α d glucopyranose polysaccharides growth rates appeared in stage 1 for s 500 and control mbr 3 2 2 clsm images of proteins proteins are also one of the main components of the cake layer yuan et al 2015 proteins in the cake layer were distributed in dispersed form and had aggregated into some clusters on the 6th day fig s8 the distribution and abundance developed with a further operation for s 50 and s 500 however the proteins biovolume of control mbr decreased on the 10th day due to the detachment of proteins in the same running time the biovolume of proteins in the control mbr was much higher than that in sef mbrs table 4 s 50 with the highest electric field intensity obtained the minimum proteins biovolume in addition to the presence of cu nws on membrane surfaces liu 2004 stronger electric field force and higher oxidant concentration in s 50 reduced the deposition of proteins on the membrane surface 3 2 3 clsm images of total cells it could be seen from fig s9 that small aggregates of the cells were observed in s 50 on the 6th day similar to the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and proteins of s 50 more cells deposited and formed a comparatively continuous layer on the 10th day and the thickness of the cake layer further increased on the 28th day table 3 however cells had formed uniform fouling cake layers on the 6th day in s 500 and control mbr subsequently most cells aggregated into clusters with the development of the cake layer the cluster of cells became larger and more porosity as that of polysaccharides the biovolume growth trends of cells for 3 reactors were similar to those of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides table 4 and table s7 3 3 the growth process of organic fouling and biofouling in the cake layer based on the clsm images and phlip software quantitative results the development of the cake layer on the membrane surface was investigated table 3 showed that thickness growth rates in three stages of control mbr were higher than those of s 50 and s 500 the electrostatic repulsion force in the electric field made the negatively charged pollutants move away from the membrane surface and reduced the mlss content on the membrane surface table s3 furthermore h2o2 and oh radicals degraded the eps adsorbed on the membrane surface thus reducing the adsorption of pollutants eventually the thickness of the cake layer decreased in the sef mbrs in every stage the specific biovolume of polysaccharides proteins and total cells in control mbr were always higher than those in sef mbrs table 4 showed that the s 50 always obtained the minimum total specific biovolumes of pollutants in three stages which was 84 4 64 3 and 68 2 lower than control mbr respectively it was calculated that with the extension of time the specific biovolumes of polysaccharides for three reactors increased table s7 during 28 days operation the dominant components of the cake layer were polysaccharides for three reactors the specific biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides in s 50 0 42 μm3 μm2 d and s 500 0 44 μm3 μm2 d were similar which were lower than that in control mbr 0 97 μm3 μm2 d the specific biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides of control mbr in stage 1 1 83 μm3 μm2 d and stage 2 1 89 μm3 μm2 d were higher than that of sef mbrs in s 50 the minimum and maximum specific biovolume growth rates of polysaccharides were in stage 1 0 22 μm3 μm2 d and stage 2 1 46 μm3 μm2 d respectively however the s 500 obtained the maximum specific biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides in stage 1 1 14 μm3 μm2 d it could be concluded that the spontaneous electric field reduced the deposition rate of pollutants the initial deposition of sludge in s 50 was restricted by the electrostatic repulsion and degradation of oxidants the polysaccharides deposited on the membrane surface adsorbed more pollutants leading to the acceleration of biovolume growth rate of polysaccharide in stage 2 subsequently the biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides tended to be slow which indicated that the cake layer on the membrane had been formed and grew slowly during 28 days operation the specific biovolumes of proteins for s 50 and s 500 kept increasing however the reduction of proteins biovolume in control mbr from the 6th to 10th day might be due to the detachment of proteins from the cake layer over the next 18 days the continuous deposition of sludge on the membrane surface resulted in an increase of protein biovolume in s 50 the maximum specific biovolume growth rate of proteins was in stage 2 0 46 μm3 μm2 d however the specific biovolume growth rates of proteins for s 500 0 58 μm3 μm2 d and control mbr 1 31 μm3 μm2 d increased fastest in stage 1 this revealed that besides the resistance of copper to proteins liu 2004 the larger electric field force and the higher concentration of oxidant produced by the stronger electric field intensity greatly alleviated the formation rate of cake layer on the membrane surface the temporal variations of specific biovolumes of total cells for three reactors were consistent with those of polysaccharides similar to proteins the maximum specific biovolume growth rate of total cells for s 50 was in stage 2 0 62 μm3 μm2 d while those of s 500 0 92 μm3 μm2 d and control mbr 1 15 μm3 μm2 d were in stage 1 in addition to the damage of h2o2 and oh on cells the repulsion force between negatively charged microbial cells and cu nws microfiltration membranes with electrons reduced the deposition of cells on the membrane surface thus decreasing the formation rate of cake layer polysaccharides and proteins are important components of eps meng et al 2009 as calculated above eps accounted for more than 60 of contaminants in the cake layers for 3 reactors eps promoted microbial cell aggregation zhang et al 2014 and the proportion of cells increased gradually throughout the operation process considering that the biovolume of eps in the cake layer was much larger than that of total cells eps played a significant role in the formation and growth of cake layer which was consistent with the structure of biofilm on the membrane surface in the conventional mbr yuan et al 2015 according to the above analysis the growth process of the cake layer on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface in s 50 could be divided into three stages firstly polysaccharides and proteins deposited on the membrane surface gradually adhered to microbial cells and formed large aggregates then the roughness of the cake layer was improved and more microorganisms adhered to the membrane surface resulting in a rapid growth rate of eps and total cells biovolume therefore the contaminants biovolume and thickness of the cake layer were further increased finally total cells had a faster biovolume growth rate than other three substances might be due to the more eps produced in the previous stage though the growth rates of biovolume and cake layer thickness decreased the contaminants biovolume and cake layer thickness still increased during the cake layer development process eps was much more abundant than microorganisms indicating that eps was significant for the formation and development of the cake layer 3 4 mechanisms of the spontaneous electric field to alleviate membrane fouling as shown in table s8 there was no significant difference in polysaccharide adsorption between the two membranes however the protein content in eps on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane was 56 5 lower than that on the pvdf membrane the possible reason was that the smaller binding constant and number of binding sites between cu nws and protein chains reduced the adsorption between protein and membrane liu 2004 it could be concluded that the antimicrobial ability of the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane was beneficial to reduce the deposition of pollutants besides the anti fouling performance of the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane the restraint of the electric field on membrane fouling mitigated membrane fouling the electric field might affect membrane fouling in three ways firstly electric field force produced in sef mbrs drove charged particles in the sludge mixture to move away from the membrane surface liu et al 2012 tian et al 2015 electrostatic repulsion force could effectively prevent the deposition of contaminants on the membrane surface also the negatively charged particles on the membrane surface tended to break away from the membrane surface and prevented the formation of dense gel layers in the spontaneous electric field the sheer force produced by aeration made the loose cake layer easier to be washed away the permeate drag force was 2 6 10 12 n for control mbr 2 4 10 12 n for s 500 and 2 0 10 12 n for s 50 respectively generally speaking permeate drag force range was 10 12 10 18 n liu 2009 due to the absence of electrostatic repulsion force in the control mbr pollutants could not move away from the membrane surface causing the thicker fouling layer although the electrostatic repulsion force was less than the permeate drag force it could retard the adsorption rate of pollutants on the membrane surface the electrostatic repulsion force of s 50 3 5 10 15 n was 54 3 higher than that of s 500 the higher electrostatic repulsion force reduced the growth rate of tmp secondly the electrochemical production h2o2 and oh radicals on the membrane surface contributed to the membrane fouling mitigation except for in situ degradation of organics h2o2 and oh radicals enhanced the electrochemical activity and catalytic capacity for orr of the cu nws conductive membrane causing the less accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surface most importantly the electric field improved the activated sludge properties total eps contents in sef mbrs were lower than those in control mbr table 5 eem spectra of eps in activated sludge fig 5 and table 6 showed that with the increase of electric field intensity the peak intensities of characteristic peaks represented protein and humic acid decreased this illustrated that the h2o2 and oh radicals were beneficial to the reduction of eps content moreover electroosmosis induced by the electric field could remove bound water from sludge which would reduce the average particle size of sludge flocs tian et al 2015 the migration rate of smaller size sludge to the membrane surface was higher thus filling the voids between the large particles deposited on the membrane surface and causing membrane fouling meng et al 2007 activated sludge particle sizes in sef mbrs were smaller than that in control mbr table s9 shimizu et al 1996 considered that the particle size of 8 15 μm had a great influence on membrane flux s 50 had a maximum proportion of 8 15 μm 19 82 7 62 but the growth rate of tmp was lower than that in control mbr which mainly due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic repulsion and oxidant in the sef mbr the organics in the anaerobic tank were oxidized by the metabolism of exoelectrogens to release electrons and protons electrons were transferred from the cell to the anode surface and to the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface through the external circuit protons transferred to the aerobic tank through the baffle plates in the aerobic tank the electron acceptor o2 received electrons on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface and combined with the protons to produce a reduction reaction which completed the electricity generation process and generated a spontaneous electric field as mentioned above it could be confirmed that the spontaneous electric field without additional energy consumption instead of traditional high energy consumption was conducive to alleviate membrane fouling it could be inferred that compared with the constant potential instrument rated power of 100 w chi700e shanghai chenhua instrument co ltd china continuously applying voltage to mbr a total of 67 2 kw h of electric energy would be saved during 28 days operation moreover the membrane fouling rate of sef mbr was 43 52 lower than that of control mbr the reduction of membrane fouling rate could reduce cleaning frequency which meant the reduction of cleaning cost 4 conclusions in this study a novel sef mbr was developed to achieve the membrane fouling mitigation and investigate the growth process of the cake layer in the electric field the synergistic effects of copper antimicrobial performance electric field force and in situ degradation of oxidants alleviated membrane fouling in the presence of the electric field the development of the cake layer on the membrane surface could be divided into three stages in stage 1 polysaccharides and proteins deposited on the membrane surface and then cells embedded in a matrix of eps to form clusters more microorganisms were adhered to the membrane surface after the initial formation process causing the increasing biovolume growth rates of eps and total cells finally the growth rates of biovolume and cake layer thickness decreased while the contaminant biovolume and cake layer thickness still increased however various operational and configurational factors such as influent components electrode distance and ambient temperature etc in the sef mbr device would cause the different number of electrons received on membrane surface which would further make the electric field force and oxidant concentration on membrane surface different and finally would cause the different membrane fouling behavior the reactor parameters should be further optimized to explore the optimal spontaneous electric field intensity and prolong the operational period without the chemical membrane cleaning the novel cleaning strategy also should be developed aimed at the fouled membrane in sef mbrs to promote the practical application process and enrich the theoretical results of mbr technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18219,the electric field assisted membrane bioreactor mbr is an effective technique to alleviate membrane fouling in this study the spontaneous electric field was introduced into the mbr to observe the growth process of cake layer on the membrane surface the external resistance for spontaneous electric field mbr s 50 and s 500 were 50 ω and 500 ω respectively during the experiments s 50 maintained the highest electric field intensity of 11 83 mv cm the reduction of extracellular polymeric substances eps content in activated sludge transmembrane pressure tmp growth rate reached 52 8 and 51 7 respectively after 28 days operation s 50 obtained the minimum contaminant specific biovolume 23 316 μm3 μm2 which was 68 2 lower than that of it in control mbr the metal oxide or metal hydroxide were distributed in the cake layer eps played a significant role in the formation and growth of the cake layer based on the results obtained in this study the growth of the biofouling layer on the membrane surface could be divided into three stages eps first deposited on the membrane surface and then microorganisms embedded in the cake layer to form clusters after that eps and total cells further increased and led to a faster biovolume growth rate subsequently the biovolume growth rate decreased in the cake layer the spontaneous electric field delayed the deposition of eps on the membrane surface the produced h2o2 and oh were beneficial to the degradation of organics causing the smaller contaminant biovolume on the membrane surface this work aims to provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of the electric field to control membrane fouling graphical abstract image 1 keywords spontaneous electric field intensity membrane fouling mitigation growth process 1 introduction the membrane bioreactor mbr is an advanced technology that combines membrane separation and biological process for wastewater treatment the excellent effluent with high pollutant removal efficiency and scarce pathogenic microorganisms could be reused as reclaimed water such preponderance caused the wide application of the mbr in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps with the improvement of mbr technology and accumulation of operation experience exceed 200 mbr wwtps with a capacity of over 10 000 tons d have been installed in china by 2017 xiao et al 2019 the largest mbr wwtp with a designed capacity of 860 000 tons d being constructed is located in stockholm sweden meng et al 2017 although the annual growth rate of the mbr market worldwide increased rapidly the membrane fouling is still an inevitable obstacle for the commercial application judd 2016 it has been widely accepted that membrane fouling is mainly attributed to pore blockage and sludge cake deposition on the membrane surface meng et al 2009 many investigations revealed that the cake layer was the main contributor to membrane fouling meng et al 2007 2009 chao et al 2011 the cake layer formation process involves biofouling i e deposition growth and metabolism of bacteria cells or sludge flocs organic fouling i e adsorption of proteins and polysaccharides and inorganic fouling e g carbonates and metal ions meng et al 2009 classically biofouling and organic fouling rather than inorganic fouling dominate the cake layer formation and further govern the membrane fouling in mbrs the contaminants embedded in the cake layer are mainly derived from sludge flocs wei et al 2018 thus modifying sludge properties is beneficial in controlling membrane fouling most reported fouling control strategies including chemical biological and physical methods are closely related to the improvement of the activated sludge properties chang et al 2019 the aluminum sulfate liu et al 2011a and ozone liu et al 2011b were added respectively to the influent of mbr the sludge properties e g dissolved organic matter content particle size were changed due to the improved pollutant removal rate as a consequence the transmembrane pressures tmp were 13 5 kpa and 12 5 kpa lower than that of conventional mbr within the same operation time however the addition of chemicals increased the cost and caused secondary pollution adding predatory microorganisms to mbr promoted the decrease of extracellular polymeric substances eps content of the activated sludge finally maintained the tmp below 5 kpa during 100 days operation while the final tmp in the conventional mbr increased to 30 kpa tian et al 2012 however the growth and distribution of microorganisms were difficult to control accurately recent efforts have been mostly focused on the electric field belonged to physical method to mitigate membrane fouling the electric field force effectively prevented the negatively charged sludge and colloids depositing on the membrane surface fan et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 appropriate electric field intensity also could promote the metabolism of sludge through electrical stimulation thus enhancing the degradation of organics and reducing the membrane fouling ma et al 2015 moreover the generated h2o2 in the reactor contributed to alleviating membrane fouling via in situ oxidization of the organics in the sludge wang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 liu et al 2012 used an applied external voltage in a mbr the electric field intensity of 0 073 v cm was generated in the reactor the results showed that compared with the traditional mbr 20 0 25 0 flux enhancement and 20 times reduction of filtration resistance were achieved besides the eps content decreased by 33 5 and the sludge activity increased by 24 8 a study was conducted by wang et al 2016 to investigate the impact of the spontaneous electric field an intensity of 0 114 v cm on membrane fouling mitigation the tmp growth rate was 47 5 57 5 lower than that of traditional mbr however the electric field mbr could not eliminate membrane fouling the pollutants still deposited on the membrane surface our previous studies have found that the foulant composition of the cake layer in electric field mbr was similar to that of traditional mbr huang et al 2017 yin et al 2019 the formation and growth of cake layer on the membrane surface in an electric field mbr have been less involved in the existing literature in this study a spontaneous electric field mbr sef mbr equipped with conductive microfiltration membranes was first constructed electric field intensity was controlled by adjusting the external resistance the effect of spontaneous electric field on foulant composition and content were studied besides the growth process of the cake layer on the membrane surface was tracked and monitored this work aims to provide a theoretical basis for the practical application of electric field to control membrane fouling 2

lantian peier membrane co ltd china as the cathode control mbr 2 3 inoculation and operation the activated sludge collected from the laboratory scale mbr was inoculated in the anaerobic 3 g l and

by the three dimensional excitation emission matrix eem f 7000 hitachi japan yang et al 2016 the colorimetric experiments were used to determine the eps content liu et al 2017 particle size distribution psd of sludge was determined by the laser particle size analyzer bt 2003 dandong baite instrument co ltd china the fouled membranes were imaged using scanning electron microscope sem su1510 hitachi japan and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm 710 zeiss germany yuan et al 2015 the clsm image was segmented into binary image based on image pixels segmentation by a

membranes was determined using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx falona edax usa liu et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 tmp variation the electric field intensities were controlled at 11 83 mv cm and 3 79 mv cm for s 50 and s 500 respectively no electric field was detected in control mbr due to the high electro resistance of the pvdf membrane wang et al 2017 the two electron reduction reaction occurred in the cathode in sef mbrs the generated h2o2 contents were 1 46 mg l and 1 22 mg l for s 50 and s 500 respectively the effluent quality cod nh4 n tn and tp of sef mbrs was complied with the criterion of integrated wastewater discharge standard gb18918 2002 class a of the first grade standard in china the effect of electric field intensity on tmp was shown in fig 2 after 28 days operation the tmp of control mbr reached 25 kpa the membrane fouling rate 0 89 kpa d of control mbr was 43 8 and 51 7 higher than that of s 500 and s 50 respectively with the increase of electric field intensity membrane fouling rate decreased the electric fields in the sef mbrs retarded the pollutants deposition on the membrane surfaces liu et al 2012 for each reactor sem edx observed that fe ca mg na and k were the main metals in the dense cake layer on the membrane surface fig 3 and table 2 the content of the o element in the membrane cake layer was the highest revealing the presence of metals and metallic oxides or metallic hydroxides on the membrane surface with the increase of electric field intensity the metal elements content adsorbed on the membrane surface increased the metal content of s 50 was 36 2 which was 8 6 and 36 5 higher than that of s 500 and control mbr respectively as the r ex decreased from 500 ω to 50 ω the electron transfer resistance reduced thus more electrons were enriched on the membrane surface attracting more metal ions adewale et al 2015 however s 50 with the highest metal elements content achieved the lowest tmp growth rate it could be presumed that inorganic fouling was subordinate to membrane fouling based on the above variations of tmp three points in the control mbr were selected for investigating the growth of organic and biofouling layer on the membrane surface point 1 on the 6th day represented the initial deposition of sludge stage 1 point 2 on the 10th day stood for the period of the cake layer formation stage 2 besides point 3 on the 28th day was chosen to investigate the long term operation of control mbr stage 3 fig 2 also showed that variations of tmp in s 50 and s 500 were similar to that in the control mbr during the same running time of 6 and 10 days respectively indicating that the fouled cu nws conductive microfiltration membranes taken out from sef mbrs could represent the cake layers formed on the membrane surface in days 6 and 10 respectively in a long term operation 3 2 the organic fouling and biofouling in the cake layer the clsm images of fouled membranes were exhibited to represent organic fouling and biofouling in the cake layer fig 4 and table 3 it was obvious that proteins polysaccharides and total cells were distributed on the cultured membrane surfaces eps a highly viscous substance secreted by bacteria was the major membrane fouling factor biswas et al 2015 meng et al 2017 the eps contents on the membrane surfaces were shown in table s3 with the prolongation of the operation time the increasing eps content enhanced the roughness of the cake layer the higher roughness of the cake layer led to more microorganisms adhering to the membrane surface increasing the thickness of the cake layer after 28 days operation s 50 with highest electric field intensity obtained a lowest eps content 928 4 29 5 mg m2 and a minimum growth rate of cake layer thickness 1 8 μm d while control mbr achieved a highest eps content 2410 3 25 5 mg m2 and a maximum growth rate of cake layer thickness 4 2 μm d it was obvious that the spontaneous electric field in the sef mbrs reduced the adhesion of contaminants on the membrane surface on the one hand the positively charged protons on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface could neutralize the negative charges of the eps thus inhibiting the growth of eps on the membrane surface tian et al 2015 on the other hand the produced h2o2 and oh radicals in sef mbrs degraded the eps wu et al 2017 eem spectra of eps in cake layers figs s3 s5 and tables s4 s6 showed that compared with control mbr redshifts for characteristic peaks were observed in sef mbrs due to the cleavage of the conjugated double bond besides there was almost no difference in eps content between s 50 and s 500 after 28 days operation which might be due to the higher metal content on the membrane surface as known proteins and polysaccharides contained a large number of negatively charged functional groups such as carboxyl phosphorus hydroxyl and sulfuric acid groups which were easy to combine with metal ions meng et al 2009 the highest metal content 36 2 on the s 50 membrane caused a high concentration of eps 3 2 1 clsm images of polysaccharides β d glucopyranose polysaccharides are one of the major components of the membrane fouling yuan et al 2015 s 50 had less distribution of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides on the membrane surface on the 6th day fig s6 with the increment of operation a denser cake layer gradually formed on the membrane surface however a uniform layer was formed in the control mbr on the 6th day and most of them aggregated into a cluster then the clusters grew larger and more porous during the 28 days operation the biovolumes of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in sef mbrs were always lower than that of control mbr table 4 however the biovolume proportion of s 50 was larger than that of s 500 and control mbr indicating the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides were abundant in the whole growth process of the cake layer in s 50 the biodegradability of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides was different from that of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides exhibiting the different biovolume and biovolume proportion the α d glucopyranose polysaccharides distributed in clusters with a highly non uniform manner during the entire operation fig s7 it was noteworthy that no α d glucopyranose polysaccharides were detected in s 50 on the 6th day table 4 however the α d glucopyranose polysaccharides specific biovolumes were 3 724 μm3 μm2 and 6 155 μm3 μm2 for s 500 and control mbr respectively it could be attributed to the degradation of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides by higher h2o2 and oh radicals contents in s 50 drews 2010 compared to the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides in s 50 α d glucopyranose polysaccharides were less during the entire growth process of the cake layer illustrating that β d glucopyranose polysaccharides played a more important role in the growth process of the cake layer the increasing polysaccharides coverages and biovolumes of s 50 and control mbr demonstrated no detachment from the cake layer table 4 table s7 showed that the growth trend of β d glucopyranose polysaccharides of s 50 in three stages was similar to that of control mbr s 50 had a maximum α d glucopyranose polysaccharides growth rate in stage 2 while the faster α d glucopyranose polysaccharides growth rates appeared in stage 1 for s 500 and control mbr 3 2 2 clsm images of proteins proteins are also one of the main components of the cake layer yuan et al 2015 proteins in the cake layer were distributed in dispersed form and had aggregated into some clusters on the 6th day fig s8 the distribution and abundance developed with a further operation for s 50 and s 500 however the proteins biovolume of control mbr decreased on the 10th day due to the detachment of proteins in the same running time the biovolume of proteins in the control mbr was much higher than that in sef mbrs table 4 s 50 with the highest electric field intensity obtained the minimum proteins biovolume in addition to the presence of cu nws on membrane surfaces liu 2004 stronger electric field force and higher oxidant concentration in s 50 reduced the deposition of proteins on the membrane surface 3 2 3 clsm images of total cells it could be seen from fig s9 that small aggregates of the cells were observed in s 50 on the 6th day similar to the β d glucopyranose polysaccharides and proteins of s 50 more cells deposited and formed a comparatively continuous layer on the 10th day and the thickness of the cake layer further increased on the 28th day table 3 however cells had formed uniform fouling cake layers on the 6th day in s 500 and control mbr subsequently most cells aggregated into clusters with the development of the cake layer the cluster of cells became larger and more porosity as that of polysaccharides the biovolume growth trends of cells for 3 reactors were similar to those of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides table 4 and table s7 3 3 the growth process of organic fouling and biofouling in the cake layer based on the clsm images and phlip software quantitative results the development of the cake layer on the membrane surface was investigated table 3 showed that thickness growth rates in three stages of control mbr were higher than those of s 50 and s 500 the electrostatic repulsion force in the electric field made the negatively charged pollutants move away from the membrane surface and reduced the mlss content on the membrane surface table s3 furthermore h2o2 and oh radicals degraded the eps adsorbed on the membrane surface thus reducing the adsorption of pollutants eventually the thickness of the cake layer decreased in the sef mbrs in every stage the specific biovolume of polysaccharides proteins and total cells in control mbr were always higher than those in sef mbrs table 4 showed that the s 50 always obtained the minimum total specific biovolumes of pollutants in three stages which was 84 4 64 3 and 68 2 lower than control mbr respectively it was calculated that with the extension of time the specific biovolumes of polysaccharides for three reactors increased table s7 during 28 days operation the dominant components of the cake layer were polysaccharides for three reactors the specific biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides in s 50 0 42 μm3 μm2 d and s 500 0 44 μm3 μm2 d were similar which were lower than that in control mbr 0 97 μm3 μm2 d the specific biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides of control mbr in stage 1 1 83 μm3 μm2 d and stage 2 1 89 μm3 μm2 d were higher than that of sef mbrs in s 50 the minimum and maximum specific biovolume growth rates of polysaccharides were in stage 1 0 22 μm3 μm2 d and stage 2 1 46 μm3 μm2 d respectively however the s 500 obtained the maximum specific biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides in stage 1 1 14 μm3 μm2 d it could be concluded that the spontaneous electric field reduced the deposition rate of pollutants the initial deposition of sludge in s 50 was restricted by the electrostatic repulsion and degradation of oxidants the polysaccharides deposited on the membrane surface adsorbed more pollutants leading to the acceleration of biovolume growth rate of polysaccharide in stage 2 subsequently the biovolume growth rate of polysaccharides tended to be slow which indicated that the cake layer on the membrane had been formed and grew slowly during 28 days operation the specific biovolumes of proteins for s 50 and s 500 kept increasing however the reduction of proteins biovolume in control mbr from the 6th to 10th day might be due to the detachment of proteins from the cake layer over the next 18 days the continuous deposition of sludge on the membrane surface resulted in an increase of protein biovolume in s 50 the maximum specific biovolume growth rate of proteins was in stage 2 0 46 μm3 μm2 d however the specific biovolume growth rates of proteins for s 500 0 58 μm3 μm2 d and control mbr 1 31 μm3 μm2 d increased fastest in stage 1 this revealed that besides the resistance of copper to proteins liu 2004 the larger electric field force and the higher concentration of oxidant produced by the stronger electric field intensity greatly alleviated the formation rate of cake layer on the membrane surface the temporal variations of specific biovolumes of total cells for three reactors were consistent with those of polysaccharides similar to proteins the maximum specific biovolume growth rate of total cells for s 50 was in stage 2 0 62 μm3 μm2 d while those of s 500 0 92 μm3 μm2 d and control mbr 1 15 μm3 μm2 d were in stage 1 in addition to the damage of h2o2 and oh on cells the repulsion force between negatively charged microbial cells and cu nws microfiltration membranes with electrons reduced the deposition of cells on the membrane surface thus decreasing the formation rate of cake layer polysaccharides and proteins are important components of eps meng et al 2009 as calculated above eps accounted for more than 60 of contaminants in the cake layers for 3 reactors eps promoted microbial cell aggregation zhang et al 2014 and the proportion of cells increased gradually throughout the operation process considering that the biovolume of eps in the cake layer was much larger than that of total cells eps played a significant role in the formation and growth of cake layer which was consistent with the structure of biofilm on the membrane surface in the conventional mbr yuan et al 2015 according to the above analysis the growth process of the cake layer on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface in s 50 could be divided into three stages firstly polysaccharides and proteins deposited on the membrane surface gradually adhered to microbial cells and formed large aggregates then the roughness of the cake layer was improved and more microorganisms adhered to the membrane surface resulting in a rapid growth rate of eps and total cells biovolume therefore the contaminants biovolume and thickness of the cake layer were further increased finally total cells had a faster biovolume growth rate than other three substances might be due to the more eps produced in the previous stage though the growth rates of biovolume and cake layer thickness decreased the contaminants biovolume and cake layer thickness still increased during the cake layer development process eps was much more abundant than microorganisms indicating that eps was significant for the formation and development of the cake layer 3 4 mechanisms of the spontaneous electric field to alleviate membrane fouling as shown in table s8 there was no significant difference in polysaccharide adsorption between the two membranes however the protein content in eps on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane was 56 5 lower than that on the pvdf membrane the possible reason was that the smaller binding constant and number of binding sites between cu nws and protein chains reduced the adsorption between protein and membrane liu 2004 it could be concluded that the antimicrobial ability of the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane was beneficial to reduce the deposition of pollutants besides the anti fouling performance of the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane the restraint of the electric field on membrane fouling mitigated membrane fouling the electric field might affect membrane fouling in three ways firstly electric field force produced in sef mbrs drove charged particles in the sludge mixture to move away from the membrane surface liu et al 2012 tian et al 2015 electrostatic repulsion force could effectively prevent the deposition of contaminants on the membrane surface also the negatively charged particles on the membrane surface tended to break away from the membrane surface and prevented the formation of dense gel layers in the spontaneous electric field the sheer force produced by aeration made the loose cake layer easier to be washed away the permeate drag force was 2 6 10 12 n for control mbr 2 4 10 12 n for s 500 and 2 0 10 12 n for s 50 respectively generally speaking permeate drag force range was 10 12 10 18 n liu 2009 due to the absence of electrostatic repulsion force in the control mbr pollutants could not move away from the membrane surface causing the thicker fouling layer although the electrostatic repulsion force was less than the permeate drag force it could retard the adsorption rate of pollutants on the membrane surface the electrostatic repulsion force of s 50 3 5 10 15 n was 54 3 higher than that of s 500 the higher electrostatic repulsion force reduced the growth rate of tmp secondly the electrochemical production h2o2 and oh radicals on the membrane surface contributed to the membrane fouling mitigation except for in situ degradation of organics h2o2 and oh radicals enhanced the electrochemical activity and catalytic capacity for orr of the cu nws conductive membrane causing the less accumulation of pollutants on the membrane surface most importantly the electric field improved the activated sludge properties total eps contents in sef mbrs were lower than those in control mbr table 5 eem spectra of eps in activated sludge fig 5 and table 6 showed that with the increase of electric field intensity the peak intensities of characteristic peaks represented protein and humic acid decreased this illustrated that the h2o2 and oh radicals were beneficial to the reduction of eps content moreover electroosmosis induced by the electric field could remove bound water from sludge which would reduce the average particle size of sludge flocs tian et al 2015 the migration rate of smaller size sludge to the membrane surface was higher thus filling the voids between the large particles deposited on the membrane surface and causing membrane fouling meng et al 2007 activated sludge particle sizes in sef mbrs were smaller than that in control mbr table s9 shimizu et al 1996 considered that the particle size of 8 15 μm had a great influence on membrane flux s 50 had a maximum proportion of 8 15 μm 19 82 7 62 but the growth rate of tmp was lower than that in control mbr which mainly due to the synergistic effect of electrostatic repulsion and oxidant in the sef mbr the organics in the anaerobic tank were oxidized by the metabolism of exoelectrogens to release electrons and protons electrons were transferred from the cell to the anode surface and to the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface through the external circuit protons transferred to the aerobic tank through the baffle plates in the aerobic tank the electron acceptor o2 received electrons on the cu nws conductive microfiltration membrane surface and combined with the protons to produce a reduction reaction which completed the electricity generation process and generated a spontaneous electric field as mentioned above it could be confirmed that the spontaneous electric field without additional energy consumption instead of traditional high energy consumption was conducive to alleviate membrane fouling it could be inferred that compared with the constant potential instrument rated power of 100 w chi700e shanghai chenhua instrument co ltd china continuously applying voltage to mbr a total of 67 2 kw h of electric energy would be saved during 28 days operation moreover the membrane fouling rate of sef mbr was 43 52 lower than that of control mbr the reduction of membrane fouling rate could reduce cleaning frequency which meant the reduction of cleaning cost 4 conclusions in this study a novel sef mbr was developed to achieve the membrane fouling mitigation and investigate the growth process of the cake layer in the electric field the synergistic effects of copper antimicrobial performance electric field force and in situ degradation of oxidants alleviated membrane fouling in the presence of the electric field the development of the cake layer on the membrane surface could be divided into three stages in stage 1 polysaccharides and proteins deposited on the membrane surface and then cells embedded in a matrix of eps to form clusters more microorganisms were adhered to the membrane surface after the initial formation process causing the increasing biovolume growth rates of eps and total cells finally the growth rates of biovolume and cake layer thickness decreased while the contaminant biovolume and cake layer thickness still increased however various operational and configurational factors such as influent components electrode distance and ambient temperature etc in the sef mbr device would cause the different number of electrons received on membrane surface which would further make the electric field force and oxidant concentration on membrane surface different and finally would cause the different membrane fouling behavior the reactor parameters should be further optimized to explore the optimal spontaneous electric field intensity and prolong the operational period without the chemical membrane cleaning the novel cleaning strategy also should be developed aimed at the fouled membrane in sef mbrs to promote the practical application process and enrich the theoretical results of mbr technology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
