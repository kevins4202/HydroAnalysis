21675,in this article gaussian mixture models are used to estimate the probability density function of wave elevation in the context of the second order random wave theory two approaches are used to construct the gaussian mixture probability distribution one is the moment estimate in which the unknown parameters are determined by matching the moments of gaussian mixture model with those of the real wave process the other is the maximum likelihood estimation in which the expectation maximization em algorithm is used to determine the parameters in statistical models the proposed gaussian mixture distribution is favorably validated by using monte carlo simulations in comparison with other theoretical distribution models numerical results reveal a clear dependence of the probability distribution structure on the wave steepness and the spectral shape finally three sets of observation data are applied to further confirm the accuracy and efficiency of gaussian mixture model keywords statistic distribution wave elevation gaussian mixture model em algorithm 1 introduction the distribution of wave characteristics like wave height wave period etc has been studied extensively for a long time which is of great importance for the design of coastal and offshore structures and the stability analysis of ships and floating structures among the various statistical distribution of wave characteristics wave elevation i e the elevation of water surface above the mean water level plays a key role in the statistical theory of random waves because with the assumption of narrowband spectrum other wave characteristics distribution can be obtained from the probability distribution of wave elevation by using standard statistical techniques the parameter distribution model of wave characteristics needs to be verified by numerical simulation experiment or situ measurement undoubtedly the numerical simulation is the most economical and efficient approach thus modeling the sea surface elevation is important in this paper we simulate the wave elevation based on the second order random wave theory it is known that deep water waves with small amplitude are considered to be a linear gaussian random process using the central limit theorem the wave elevation distribution has been theoretically shown to obey the gaussian probability law however it is known that as the sea severity increases and the water depth decreases the nonlinearity of water waves becomes more and more relevant and the random waves deviate from the gaussian assumption ochi 2005 under these conditions the wave profile becomes asymmetric with higher and steeper crests and shallower and flatter troughs due to wave interactions and bottom effects in the existing literature there are two mainstream probabilistic models for surface wave elevation distribution in nonlinear random waves one is the edgeworth series model attributed to longuet higgins 1963 who derived a approximate distribution in terms of edgeworth series by inversion of the cumulant generating function through a set of carefully arranged experiments to test the edgeworth series model huang and long 1980 showed that the wave elevation distribution can be approximated by a four term edgeworth series model even under these highly non gaussian conditions and more terms will make the approximation worse the other is the tayfun model also referred to as narrowband model proposed by tayfun 1980 he simplified second order narrowband deep water waves to a form in which each realization of the wave elevation becomes an amplitude modulated stokes wave with a mean frequency and a random phase and proposed a complex expression for the wave elevation distribution by using standard statistical technique on the basis of previous work tayfun and alkhalidi 2016 derived an explicit expression amenable to theoretical and practical applications for the probability distribution of wave elevation based on the assumption of narrowband spectrum subsequent approximate wave elevation distributions include those described by huang et al 1983 dai et al 2002 socquet juglard et al 2005 and hou et al 2006 and others actually not all sea states have a single peaked spectrum with narrowband spectral width and the assumption of the random wave process as being a stokes type expression is not totally accurate this may limit the application of tayfun model tung et al 1989 derived an expression for the probability density function of random deep water waves when the spectrum of the first order wave elevation is of finite bandwidth srokosz 1998 proposed a new statistical distribution for the wave elevation by using the pearson system of distributions moreover some other methods were used for the study of wave elevation distribution such as the four moment maximum entropy method zhang and xu 2005 cieślikiewicz 2001 the saddle point approximation method machado 2003 the characteristic function expansion method langley 1987 song et al 2002 and the transformed gaussian method ochi and ahn 1994 winterstein 1988 rychlik et al 1997 however except for the edgeworth series approximation of wave elevation distribution longuet higgins 1963 most of the approximations or formulations derived from different methods have not been widely popular nor have they received the attention they certainly deserve this is possibly because some formulations do not have a simple explicit form suitable for practical or theoretical applications and others are only applicable for narrowband wave field case motivated by the above mentioned facts a gaussian mixture model is proposed to estimate the wave elevation distribution tatarskii 2003 used the gaussian mixture model to estimate the probability distribution function of ocean wave slopes allowing the calculation of all mean values in the theory of electromagnetic wave scattering on the sea surface in a closed analytical form the gaussian mixture probabilistic model is positive everywhere without any limitations regarding spectral bandwidth and water depth in order to substantiate the proposed approach it is applied to estimate the wave elevation distribution of some sea states in which different spectral bandwidth and water depth has been considered the calculation results will be validated against monte carlo simulation results meanwhile edgeworth model and tayfun model will also be included for comparison purpose finally comparisons with three sets of measured data also yield a good agreement the structure of the paper is as follow in section 2 we introduce the knowledge of the second order random waves model in section 3 we present the theoretical background of the proposed gaussian mixture model and how to determine parameters of this probabilistic model in section 4 the calculation examples and discussions are provided and section 5 are conclusions 2 nonlinear random waves 2 1 second order description of surface waves for linear random sea waves it is assumed to be representable as a sum of an infinite number of small amplitude waves having different frequencies and directions of propagation in this paper we only consider a long crested sea with a unidirectional wave spectrum s ω i e the wave elevation does not depend on the y coordinate and all waves travel along the x axis with positive velocity under this assumption the first order wave elevation η 1 consisting of n cosine waves takes the following form 1 η 1 x t r e n 1 n a n e i θ n where a n is the wave amplitude which is related to the wave spectrum s ω as 2 1 2 a n 2 s ω n d ω and θ n k n x ω n t ε n is the total phase x and t are the space and time coordinates respectively the random phases ε n distribute uniformly in an interval of 2 π there exist the linear dispersion relationship between the wavenumber k and the angular frequency ω 3 ω 2 g k tanh k h where g and h are the acceleration of gravity and water depth respectively real sea state shows that sea surface elevations deviate from the gaussian distribution this means that the nonlinear part of random waves should be considered combined with quadratic terms to the linear random wave model we obtain the second order random wave theory which has been used extensively for the statistical analysis of non gaussian sea states following langley 1987 the quadratic terms η 2 are given by 4 η 2 x t r e n 1 n m 1 m a n a m r n m e i θ n m q n m e i θ n m where θ n m θ n θ m r n m and q n m are referred to as quadratic transfer function with the following mathematical expression 5 r n m 1 g g n m d n m ω n ω m cosh k n k m h 1 4 g ω n ω m k n k m g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 where g n m 1 4 ω n ω m 2 ω n ω m ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 d n m ω n ω m 2 cosh k n k m h g k n k m sinh k n k m h and 6 q n m 1 g f n m s n m ω n ω m cosh k n k m h 1 4 g ω n ω m k n k m g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 where f n m 1 4 ω n ω m 2 ω n ω m ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 s n m ω n ω m 2 cosh k n k m h g k n k m sinh k n k m h the second order solutions agree with the original derivation bysharma and dean 1981 and contain all the second order bound waves that are generated by interactions between the free waves the positive interaction terms θ n m are responsible for the sharpness of crests and flatness of troughs while the negative interaction terms θ n m produce the set down beneath energetic parts and the set up between these regions toffoli et al 2006 from eqs 5 and 6 it can be seen that r n m r m n and q n m q m n for deep water waves the above quadratic transfer functions can be simplified to the following form 7 r n m 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 q n m 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 finally by combining eqs 1 and 4 the second order random waves are expressed as 8 η x t η 1 x t η 2 x t r e n 1 n a n e i θ n r e n 1 n m 1 n r n m a n a m e i θ n m q n m a n a m e i θ n m 2 2 cumulant and moment in probability theory and statistics the cumulants k n or moments m n of a probability distribution are a set of quantities that provide clear information about the distribution s shape thus the cumulants or moments are commonly estimated and used as input to calculate the probability distribution function of wave elevation by combining the second order random waves theory the general form of moments of the wave elevation will be presented below as is shown in appendix the wave elevation of the second order random wave model can be written as which is sometimes referred to as kac siegert s solution kac and siegert 1947 9 η t j 1 2 n β j z j λ j z j 2 where β j and λ j are coefficients computed by eq a 15 according to the above equation the wave elevation η t can be expressed as a sum of statistically independent random variables x j i e 10 x j β j z j λ j z j 2 the characteristic function m j θ of x j is defined as 11 m j θ e e i θ x j e i θ β j z j λ j z j 2 p z j d z j where p z j is the probability density function of z j and has a standard normal distribution form 12 p z j 1 2 π exp z j 2 2 therefore eq 11 can be evaluated to give 13 m j θ 1 1 2 i λ j θ exp β j 2 θ 2 2 1 2 i λ j θ the fact that the variables x j are statistically independent implies that the characteristic function m θ of η can be obtained as 14 m θ e e i θ η e e i θ x j j 1 2 n m j θ through the inverse fourier transform langley 1987 obtained the probability density function p η as the following expression 15 p η 1 2 π exp i θ η m θ d θ which is difficult to be evaluated analytically and computationally intensive in numerical calculations maybe this is the reason why it has not been widely used in practical applications the cumulants of a random variable are defined using the cumulant generating function k θ which is the natural logarithm of the characteristic function m θ as follow 16 k n 1 i n d n d θ n k θ θ 0 d n d θ n ln m θ θ 0 in the present case the cumulants of wave elevation can be obtained by substituting eqs 13 and 14 into the above equation to give 17 k n 1 2 j 1 2 n 2 λ j n n 1 β j 2 λ j 2 n δ n 1 where δ n 1 is zero for n 1 and unity otherwise specifically the first four cumulants are given as follows 18 k 1 j 1 2 n λ j k 3 j 1 2 n 8 λ j 3 6 β j 2 λ j k 2 j 1 2 n 2 λ j 2 β j 2 k 4 j 1 2 n 48 λ j 4 β j 2 λ j 2 where the first cumulant k 1 is the mean μ the second cumulant k 2 is the variance σ 2 and the third cumulant k 3 and the fourth cumulant k 4 are respectively related to the skewness and excess kurtosis of a random wave process although we have got the specific form of the characteristic function in eq 17 it is still difficult to estimate moments from a power series expansion of the characteristic function m θ fortunately the relationship between cumulants and moments provides a simple alternative to estimating moments using the fact that the cumulant generating function is the logarithm of the characteristic function one obtains the following equation 19 m θ 1 n 1 m n i θ n n exp n 1 k n i θ n n exp k θ equating coefficients of i θ n we can express moments in terms of cumulants the first five expressions are 20 m 1 k 1 m 2 k 2 k 1 2 m 3 k 3 3 k 2 k 1 k 1 3 m 4 k 4 4 k 3 k 1 3 k 2 2 6 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 4 m 5 k 5 5 k 4 k 1 10 k 3 k 2 10 k 3 k 1 2 15 k 2 2 k 1 10 k 2 k 1 3 k 1 5 where the n t h cumulant k n has been calculated in eq 17 for a general gaussian distribution n μ σ 2 the plain moments can be expressed in terms of mean μ and variance σ 2 i e m n μ σ x n n μ σ 2 d x the first five moments are given as 21 m 1 μ m 2 μ 2 σ 2 m 3 μ 3 3 μ σ 2 m 4 μ 4 6 μ 2 σ 2 σ 4 m 5 μ 5 10 μ 3 σ 2 15 μ σ 4 which will be used in gaussian mixture model to calculate the wave elevation distribution 2 3 some theoretical distributions longuet higgins 1963 has shown that the wave elevation distribution can be approximated through the edgeworth series in most applications the edgeworth series model is truncated after the fourth cumulant and can be written as in the form 22 p η 2 π σ 1 2 e 1 2 t 2 1 1 6 λ 3 h 3 t 1 24 λ 4 h 4 t 1 72 λ 3 2 h 6 t where t η σ and h n denotes the hermite polynomial of degree n the skewness λ 3 and excess kurtosis λ 4 are defined as 23 λ 3 k 3 σ 3 λ 4 k 4 σ 4 note that the skewness is the measure of the lopsidedness of the distribution and the kurtosis is the measure of the tailedness of the distribution tayfun 1980 simplified the weakly nonlinear waves with a narrowband spectrum as the following form 24 η t a cos θ 1 2 ε a 2 cos 2 θ where η has been normalized by σ and the wave amplitude a obey standard rayleigh distribution ε is a measure of nonlinearity of random waves and is given by 25 ε k m σ r n n q n n where k m ω m 2 g and ω m m 1 m 0 m j is the moment of s ω and defined by 26 m j ω j s ω d ω the spectral width parameter ν is defined by 27 ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 from eqs 5 and 6 we find 28 r n n k m 4 3 tanh 2 κ tanh 3 κ q n n k m 4 g h g h c g 2 2 1 tanh 2 κ tanh κ 1 κ where κ k m h is the relative water depth letting ν 0 and κ lead to 29 ε k p σ λ 3 3 with the standard statistical technique and reasonable simplification tayfun and alkhalidi 2016 derived an explicit closed form for the wave elevation distribution 30 p η σ η α 2 π exp f 2 2 ε 2 f 1 η η in this expression α 1 p 1 ε is a scaling factor ensuring that the integral of probability density function over the entire space equals unity where p is the standard normal cumulative probability distribution and 31 σ η 1 ε 2 2 β 4 ε 1 2 η m ε β 2 β α exp 1 2 ε 2 2 π f 1 2 ε σ η η η m 1 η 1 ε β ε 2 2 ε σ η 3 gaussian mixture model probability mixture model e g mclachlan and peel 2004 is a convex combination of two or more individual probability distributions which is very popular in density estimation and clustering the number of components in mixture distribution is often restricted to be finite although in some cases the components may be countably infinite given a finite set of probability density functions f i x and weights α i such that α i 0 and α i 1 the probability mixture model p x can be written in the form of a sum as 32 p x i 1 n α i f i x the mixture model guarantees two basic properties of probability density function 1 it is nonnegative everywhere 2 its integral over the entire space is equal to 1 compared with a single probability model mixture models can better describe complex data distributions gaussian distribution is usually used as the mixture component wilson 2000 has proved that gaussian mixture model has a good approximation ability 3 1 moment estimate in statistics the moment estimate is a method of estimation of population parameters it starts by setting the population moment equal to the sample moments and expressing the population moments as functions of the parameters of interest the number of such equations is the same as the number of parameters to be estimated in the present paper instead of sample moments we have derived the population moment in eq 20 from the second order random wave model finally the unknown parameters in the gaussian mixture model can be determined by solving those equations here we give a approximation for wave elevation distribution by using two gaussian distributions and take the following form 33 p η α n 1 μ 1 σ 1 1 α n 2 μ 2 σ 2 where n i is normal distribution with mean μ i and variance σ i 2 α and 1 α are weight coefficients for the two gaussian distributions respectively in eq 33 there are five unknown parameters α m 1 σ 1 m 2 σ 2 that need to be determined we set the mean of surface elevations to be zero i e m 1 k 1 0 it is a trivial matter to note that the n t h moments of gaussian mixture probability distribution is simply a weighted average of the n t h moments of the two components 34 η n η n i 1 2 α i n i η d η α m n μ 1 σ 1 1 α m n μ 2 σ 2 where denotes expectation and m n μ i σ i is the n t h moment of a gaussian distribution with mean μ i and variance σ i 2 which has been calculated in eq 21 the information about the moments of the wave process can be obtained by resorting to theoretical models eq 20 through calibrating the first five moments of gaussian mixture model to match the moments of the true sea wave process we obtain the five unknown parameters α m 1 σ 1 m 2 σ 2 by solving the following equations 35 0 α μ 1 1 α μ 2 k 2 α μ 1 2 σ 1 2 1 α μ 2 2 σ 2 2 k 3 α μ 1 3 3 μ 1 σ 1 2 1 α μ 2 3 3 μ 2 σ 2 2 k 4 3 k 2 2 α μ 1 4 6 μ 1 2 σ 1 2 3 σ 1 4 1 α μ 2 4 6 μ 2 2 σ 2 2 3 σ 2 4 k 5 10 k 3 k 2 α μ 1 5 10 μ 1 3 σ 1 2 15 μ 1 σ 1 4 1 α μ 2 5 10 μ 2 3 σ 2 2 15 μ 2 σ 2 4 where the cumulant k n has been given in eq 17 3 2 em algorithm maximum likelihood estimation mle is another method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing the logarithm of likelihood function dempster et al 1977 the aim of mle is to find the values of these parameters that maximize the likelihood function that is 36 θ ˆ arg max log l θ x where θ is a vector of unknown parameters x x 1 x 2 x n is a set of observed data and l is the likelihood function in order to determine the parameters of gaussian mixture models we use em algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of latent variables or missing data z z 1 z 2 z n that determine the component from which the observation originates em algorithm is an efficient iterative method and each iteration consists of two processes 1 e step determine the conditional expectation e z x θ log l θ x z 2 m step maximize this conditional expectation with respect to θ in the e step given the current estimate of the parameters θ t the conditional distribution of the z i is determined to be the proportional height of the normal density weighted by α j 37 t i j t p z i j x i θ j t α j t n x i μ j t σ j t j m α j t n x i μ j t σ j t where θ j α j μ j σ j is a vector of parameters representing the weight value the mean and variance of the j t h gaussian component n j then the conditional expectation can be constructed 38 q θ θ t e z x θ t log l θ x z i 1 n e z i x θ t log l θ x i z i i 1 n j 1 m t i j t log α j 1 2 log σ j 1 2 σ j 1 x i μ j 2 1 2 log 2 π in the e step everything is known before the step starts except t i j t which can be computed according to eq 37 in the m step the next estimates of θ t 1 can be determined by maximizing the conditional expectation q from e step and α j μ j σ j can be maximized independently since they all appear in separate linear terms thus for the next estimates of α j μ j σ j we obtain 39a α j t 1 1 n i 1 n t i j t 39b μ j t 1 i 1 n t i j t x i i 1 n t i j t 39c σ j t 1 i 1 n t i j t x i μ j t 1 2 i 1 n t i j t finally with repeated iteration between the two steps to met predefined convergence conditions one can obtain the unknown parameters of gaussian mixture models 4 calculation examples and discussions in order to verify the validity of the gaussian mixture model monte carlo simulations are performed for the second order random waves in eq 8 and comparisons with other theoretical probability models are presented the effects of wave steepness spectral width and water depth on the probability distribution of wave elevation are discussed in detail moreover three sets of observation data are used to further study the accuracy and efficiency of gaussian mixture model in our calculation examples we find that em algorithm is more efficient and accurate in comparison with the moment estimation thus we will use em algorithm to determine unknown parameters in gaussian mixture model the results show that three gauss components are sufficient to give satisfactory results both in monte carlo simulations and the observation data furthermore two kinds of error metrics are applied to measure the differences between parametric distribution models p i and empirical distributions p ˆ i one is the root mean square error rmse rmse i 1 n p ˆ i p i 2 n and the other is the mean absolute percentage error mape mape 1 n i 1 n p ˆ i p i p ˆ i 4 1 monte carlo simulation numerical simulations are initialized with the wallops spectrum huang et al 1981 in the following form 40 s ω α a c 2 ω p ω p ω m exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 where a c 2 σ is the characteristic wave amplitude ω p is the peak angular frequency corresponding to peak wavenumber k p ω p 2 g m is the measure of spectral bandwidth the dimensionless parameter α is chosen to satisfy 41 s ω d ω a c 2 2 the wave steepness is ε k p a c and the dimensionless water depth is κ k m h the wave time series have been simulated by applying nondeterministic spectral amplitude nsa method tuah and hudspeth 1982 the upper cut off ω c should meet the following condition 0 ω c s ω d ω 0 95 0 s ω d ω the time step δ t has to obey the nyquist frequency condition δ t π ω c about 1000 realizations with 1000 wave periods long in each time series are performed to reduce the variance of estimates subsequently the wave elevation η is scaled by standard deviation σ and the corresponding probability is multiplied by σ to make a better comparison with the standard normal distribution in order to analyze the influence of wave steepness spectral width and relative water depth on wave elevation distribution we select four cases appropriately and give the values of their parameters in table 1 including the skewness and excess kurtosis in fig 1 the probability of wave elevation is plotted for monte carlo simulations and compared against the present gaussian mixture distribution model in eq 33 the tayfun narrowband model in eq 30 the edgeworth series model in eq 22 and the standard normal distribution from fig 1 a to fig 1 c both the gaussian mixture distribution model and other theoretical distribution models have a good agreement with that of monte carlo simulations except for edgeworth series model shown in fig 1 b this is because the edgeworth model violates the non negativity condition of probability densities and the effective range of approximation shortens as the wave steepness increases comparing fig 1 a with fig 1 b we can see that the deviation from the standard normal distribution becomes significant with the increase of wave steepness as shown in fig 1 a and c m 200 means ν 0 and the skewness of wave elevation distribution becomes weaken slightly with the relative water depth form κ to κ 1 89 which can also be seen from the variation of skewness in table 1 for further illustration fig 2 shows the relationship between relative water depth and skewness under the assumption of narrowband spectrum from fig 2 it is apparent that the skewness decreases at first and then increases as the water depth decreases note that the second order random wave model is no longer valid in shallow water due to the violation of the assumption of narrowband spectrum as shown in fig 1 d tayfun model does not describe simulated data well at the tail of probability distribution according to the rmse and mape values shown in table 2 it is easy to conclude that from case a to case c all nonlinear distribution models are better than the normal distribution and have a similar approximation effect for case d with a finite spectral width gaussian mixture models are obviously superior to others 4 2 observation data to further validate our gaussian mixture distribution model we use three sets of oceanic measured data and refer them to as wacsis tern and gfaks for simplicity wacsis data comes from wave crest sensor intercomparison study prevosto et al 2001 and comprises the wave elevation data gathered with a thorn wave height sensor on february 28 1998 it was measured at the meetpost noordwijk measurement platform which was located approximately 10 kilometers from the dutch coast in a mean water depth of 18 m tern data was measured with a marex wave radar during a extreme storm occurred on january 4 1993 at the tern platform the platform was located in the northern north sea between the shetland islands and norway in a water depth of 167 m more information about tern can be found in forristall 2000 gfaks data was measured on 24 december 1989 at the gullfaks platform in the north sea with emi laser sensors the water depth of 218 meters is regarded as deep water for the most important wave components gfaks data comes from wafo brodtkorb et al 2000 which is a toolbox of matlab routines for statistical analysis and simulation of random waves according to relative water depth shown in table 3 tern and gfaks represent deep water sea states tern has a unimodal spectrum shown in fig 4 while gfaks has a bimodal spectrum shown in fig 5 wacsis is random waves with a single peaked spectrum in transitional waters shown in fig 3 their spectrum all tend to a power law ω 4 approximately over the high frequency region here the angular frequency is scaled by ω m 2 π t m and the spectrum is multiplied by ω m m 0 more specifics and statistical parameters of these data sets are presented in table 3 to compensate for the non stationarity of observation data the full duration is cut into 20 min segments and all analyses will be based on the overall averages of segmental estimates fig 3 shows that the empirical distribution of wacsis in comparison with gaussian mixture model and other models all of these models appear to explain observation data qualitatively well except normal distribution and there is no obvious difference between them in fig 4 edgeworth model turns down sharply in the range of large negative wave elevations this is due to the appearance of negative probability therefore the effective interval of edgeworth model is worthy of consideration the gaussian mixture model also describes well the wave elevation distribution from gfaks shown in fig 5 but the difference between tayfun model and the empirical distribution becomes significant falling within a band of 4 2 this is because the wave steepness calculated by eq 25 is not applicable to bimodal spectrum and tayfun model is derived based on the narrowband assumption however when the wave spectrum is unimodal tayfun model shows a good fitting effect even though the spectral width is considerable for example tern has a broadband spectrum characterized with spectral width ν 0 63 but tayfun model still gives a good agreement with the empirical distribution furthermore two kinds of error metrics are used to quantitatively evaluate each distribution model as shown in table 4 all of the nonlinear distribution models present a good result except for the case gfaks with a bimodal spectrum in this case gaussian mixture models also give good approximation it is worth mentioning that the difference between parametric models and the empirical distribution appears to be larger overall than those in monte carlo simulations according to rmse this is probably because the observed data have more uncertainty 5 conclusions gaussian mixture models for estimating the probability density function of wave elevation were proposed in this paper the model is positive everywhere without any limitations regarding spectral bandwidth and water depth moment estimation and em algorithm were proposed to determine the unknown parameters of gaussian mixture models the proposed model was favorably validated by monte carlo simulations and three sets of observation data the effects of wave steepness spectral width and water depth on the wave elevation distribution were discussed in detail moreover edgeworth model can be inaccurate especially in the tails so its effective interval is worthy of consideration even though the bandwidth of a unimodal spectrum is considerable tayfun model shows a good agreement with the empirical distribution but it seems to not be applicable to sea states of the bimodal spectrum credit authorship contribution statement zhe gao data curation writing original draft software zhaochen sun conceptualization

21675,in this article gaussian mixture models are used to estimate the probability density function of wave elevation in the context of the second order random wave theory two approaches are used to construct the gaussian mixture probability distribution one is the moment estimate in which the unknown parameters are determined by matching the moments of gaussian mixture model with those of the real wave process the other is the maximum likelihood estimation in which the expectation maximization em algorithm is used to determine the parameters in statistical models the proposed gaussian mixture distribution is favorably validated by using monte carlo simulations in comparison with other theoretical distribution models numerical results reveal a clear dependence of the probability distribution structure on the wave steepness and the spectral shape finally three sets of observation data are applied to further confirm the accuracy and efficiency of gaussian mixture model keywords statistic distribution wave elevation gaussian mixture model em algorithm 1 introduction the distribution of wave characteristics like wave height wave period etc has been studied extensively for a long time which is of great importance for the design of coastal and offshore structures and the stability analysis of ships and floating structures among the various statistical distribution of wave characteristics wave elevation i e the elevation of water surface above the mean water level plays a key role in the statistical theory of random waves because with the assumption of narrowband spectrum other wave characteristics distribution can be obtained from the probability distribution of wave elevation by using standard statistical techniques the parameter distribution model of wave characteristics needs to be verified by numerical simulation experiment or situ measurement undoubtedly the numerical simulation is the most economical and efficient approach thus modeling the sea surface elevation is important in this paper we simulate the wave elevation based on the second order random wave theory it is known that deep water waves with small amplitude are considered to be a linear gaussian random process using the central limit theorem the wave elevation distribution has been theoretically shown to obey the gaussian probability law however it is known that as the sea severity increases and the water depth decreases the nonlinearity of water waves becomes more and more relevant and the random waves deviate from the gaussian assumption ochi 2005 under these conditions the wave profile becomes asymmetric with higher and steeper crests and shallower and flatter troughs due to wave interactions and bottom effects in the existing literature there are two mainstream probabilistic models for surface wave elevation distribution in nonlinear random waves one is the edgeworth series model attributed to longuet higgins 1963 who derived a approximate distribution in terms of edgeworth series by inversion of the cumulant generating function through a set of carefully arranged experiments to test the edgeworth series model huang and long 1980 showed that the wave elevation distribution can be approximated by a four term edgeworth series model even under these highly non gaussian conditions and more terms will make the approximation worse the other is the tayfun model also referred to as narrowband model proposed by tayfun 1980 he simplified second order narrowband deep water waves to a form in which each realization of the wave elevation becomes an amplitude modulated stokes wave with a mean frequency and a random phase and proposed a complex expression for the wave elevation distribution by using standard statistical technique on the basis of previous work tayfun and alkhalidi 2016 derived an explicit expression amenable to theoretical and practical applications for the probability distribution of wave elevation based on the assumption of narrowband spectrum subsequent approximate wave elevation distributions include those described by huang et al 1983 dai et al 2002 socquet juglard et al 2005 and hou et al 2006 and others actually not all sea states have a single peaked spectrum with narrowband spectral width and the assumption of the random wave process as being a stokes type expression is not totally accurate this may limit the application of tayfun model tung et al 1989 derived an expression for the probability density function of random deep water waves when the spectrum of the first order wave elevation is of finite bandwidth srokosz 1998 proposed a new statistical distribution for the wave elevation by using the pearson system of distributions moreover some other methods were used for the study of wave elevation distribution such as the four moment maximum entropy method zhang and xu 2005 cieślikiewicz 2001 the saddle point approximation method machado 2003 the characteristic function expansion method langley 1987 song et al 2002 and the transformed gaussian method ochi and ahn 1994 winterstein 1988 rychlik et al 1997 however except for the edgeworth series approximation of wave elevation distribution longuet higgins 1963 most of the approximations or formulations derived from different methods have not been widely popular nor have they received the attention they certainly deserve this is possibly because some formulations do not have a simple explicit form suitable for practical or theoretical applications and others are only applicable for narrowband wave field case motivated by the above mentioned facts a gaussian mixture model is proposed to estimate the wave elevation distribution tatarskii 2003 used the gaussian mixture model to estimate the probability distribution function of ocean wave slopes allowing the calculation of all mean values in the theory of electromagnetic wave scattering on the sea surface in a closed analytical form the gaussian mixture probabilistic model is positive everywhere without any limitations regarding spectral bandwidth and water depth in order to substantiate the proposed approach it is applied to estimate the wave elevation distribution of some sea states in which different spectral bandwidth and water depth has been considered the calculation results will be validated against monte carlo simulation results meanwhile edgeworth model and tayfun model will also be included for comparison purpose finally comparisons with three sets of measured data also yield a good agreement the structure of the paper is as follow in section 2 we introduce the knowledge of the second order random waves model in section 3 we present the theoretical background of the proposed gaussian mixture model and how to determine parameters of this probabilistic model in section 4 the calculation examples and discussions are provided and section 5 are conclusions 2 nonlinear random waves 2 1 second order description of surface waves for linear random sea waves it is assumed to be representable as a sum of an infinite number of small amplitude waves having different frequencies and directions of propagation in this paper we only consider a long crested sea with a unidirectional wave spectrum s ω i e the wave elevation does not depend on the y coordinate and all waves travel along the x axis with positive velocity under this assumption the first order wave elevation η 1 consisting of n cosine waves takes the following form 1 η 1 x t r e n 1 n a n e i θ n where a n is the wave amplitude which is related to the wave spectrum s ω as 2 1 2 a n 2 s ω n d ω and θ n k n x ω n t ε n is the total phase x and t are the space and time coordinates respectively the random phases ε n distribute uniformly in an interval of 2 π there exist the linear dispersion relationship between the wavenumber k and the angular frequency ω 3 ω 2 g k tanh k h where g and h are the acceleration of gravity and water depth respectively real sea state shows that sea surface elevations deviate from the gaussian distribution this means that the nonlinear part of random waves should be considered combined with quadratic terms to the linear random wave model we obtain the second order random wave theory which has been used extensively for the statistical analysis of non gaussian sea states following langley 1987 the quadratic terms η 2 are given by 4 η 2 x t r e n 1 n m 1 m a n a m r n m e i θ n m q n m e i θ n m where θ n m θ n θ m r n m and q n m are referred to as quadratic transfer function with the following mathematical expression 5 r n m 1 g g n m d n m ω n ω m cosh k n k m h 1 4 g ω n ω m k n k m g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 where g n m 1 4 ω n ω m 2 ω n ω m ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 d n m ω n ω m 2 cosh k n k m h g k n k m sinh k n k m h and 6 q n m 1 g f n m s n m ω n ω m cosh k n k m h 1 4 g ω n ω m k n k m g 2 ω n 2 ω m 2 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 where f n m 1 4 ω n ω m 2 ω n ω m ω n 2 ω m 2 k n k m g 2 ω n ω m 4 g 2 k m 2 ω m ω n 4 g 2 k n 2 s n m ω n ω m 2 cosh k n k m h g k n k m sinh k n k m h the second order solutions agree with the original derivation bysharma and dean 1981 and contain all the second order bound waves that are generated by interactions between the free waves the positive interaction terms θ n m are responsible for the sharpness of crests and flatness of troughs while the negative interaction terms θ n m produce the set down beneath energetic parts and the set up between these regions toffoli et al 2006 from eqs 5 and 6 it can be seen that r n m r m n and q n m q m n for deep water waves the above quadratic transfer functions can be simplified to the following form 7 r n m 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 q n m 1 4 g ω n 2 ω m 2 finally by combining eqs 1 and 4 the second order random waves are expressed as 8 η x t η 1 x t η 2 x t r e n 1 n a n e i θ n r e n 1 n m 1 n r n m a n a m e i θ n m q n m a n a m e i θ n m 2 2 cumulant and moment in probability theory and statistics the cumulants k n or moments m n of a probability distribution are a set of quantities that provide clear information about the distribution s shape thus the cumulants or moments are commonly estimated and used as input to calculate the probability distribution function of wave elevation by combining the second order random waves theory the general form of moments of the wave elevation will be presented below as is shown in appendix the wave elevation of the second order random wave model can be written as which is sometimes referred to as kac siegert s solution kac and siegert 1947 9 η t j 1 2 n β j z j λ j z j 2 where β j and λ j are coefficients computed by eq a 15 according to the above equation the wave elevation η t can be expressed as a sum of statistically independent random variables x j i e 10 x j β j z j λ j z j 2 the characteristic function m j θ of x j is defined as 11 m j θ e e i θ x j e i θ β j z j λ j z j 2 p z j d z j where p z j is the probability density function of z j and has a standard normal distribution form 12 p z j 1 2 π exp z j 2 2 therefore eq 11 can be evaluated to give 13 m j θ 1 1 2 i λ j θ exp β j 2 θ 2 2 1 2 i λ j θ the fact that the variables x j are statistically independent implies that the characteristic function m θ of η can be obtained as 14 m θ e e i θ η e e i θ x j j 1 2 n m j θ through the inverse fourier transform langley 1987 obtained the probability density function p η as the following expression 15 p η 1 2 π exp i θ η m θ d θ which is difficult to be evaluated analytically and computationally intensive in numerical calculations maybe this is the reason why it has not been widely used in practical applications the cumulants of a random variable are defined using the cumulant generating function k θ which is the natural logarithm of the characteristic function m θ as follow 16 k n 1 i n d n d θ n k θ θ 0 d n d θ n ln m θ θ 0 in the present case the cumulants of wave elevation can be obtained by substituting eqs 13 and 14 into the above equation to give 17 k n 1 2 j 1 2 n 2 λ j n n 1 β j 2 λ j 2 n δ n 1 where δ n 1 is zero for n 1 and unity otherwise specifically the first four cumulants are given as follows 18 k 1 j 1 2 n λ j k 3 j 1 2 n 8 λ j 3 6 β j 2 λ j k 2 j 1 2 n 2 λ j 2 β j 2 k 4 j 1 2 n 48 λ j 4 β j 2 λ j 2 where the first cumulant k 1 is the mean μ the second cumulant k 2 is the variance σ 2 and the third cumulant k 3 and the fourth cumulant k 4 are respectively related to the skewness and excess kurtosis of a random wave process although we have got the specific form of the characteristic function in eq 17 it is still difficult to estimate moments from a power series expansion of the characteristic function m θ fortunately the relationship between cumulants and moments provides a simple alternative to estimating moments using the fact that the cumulant generating function is the logarithm of the characteristic function one obtains the following equation 19 m θ 1 n 1 m n i θ n n exp n 1 k n i θ n n exp k θ equating coefficients of i θ n we can express moments in terms of cumulants the first five expressions are 20 m 1 k 1 m 2 k 2 k 1 2 m 3 k 3 3 k 2 k 1 k 1 3 m 4 k 4 4 k 3 k 1 3 k 2 2 6 k 2 k 1 2 k 1 4 m 5 k 5 5 k 4 k 1 10 k 3 k 2 10 k 3 k 1 2 15 k 2 2 k 1 10 k 2 k 1 3 k 1 5 where the n t h cumulant k n has been calculated in eq 17 for a general gaussian distribution n μ σ 2 the plain moments can be expressed in terms of mean μ and variance σ 2 i e m n μ σ x n n μ σ 2 d x the first five moments are given as 21 m 1 μ m 2 μ 2 σ 2 m 3 μ 3 3 μ σ 2 m 4 μ 4 6 μ 2 σ 2 σ 4 m 5 μ 5 10 μ 3 σ 2 15 μ σ 4 which will be used in gaussian mixture model to calculate the wave elevation distribution 2 3 some theoretical distributions longuet higgins 1963 has shown that the wave elevation distribution can be approximated through the edgeworth series in most applications the edgeworth series model is truncated after the fourth cumulant and can be written as in the form 22 p η 2 π σ 1 2 e 1 2 t 2 1 1 6 λ 3 h 3 t 1 24 λ 4 h 4 t 1 72 λ 3 2 h 6 t where t η σ and h n denotes the hermite polynomial of degree n the skewness λ 3 and excess kurtosis λ 4 are defined as 23 λ 3 k 3 σ 3 λ 4 k 4 σ 4 note that the skewness is the measure of the lopsidedness of the distribution and the kurtosis is the measure of the tailedness of the distribution tayfun 1980 simplified the weakly nonlinear waves with a narrowband spectrum as the following form 24 η t a cos θ 1 2 ε a 2 cos 2 θ where η has been normalized by σ and the wave amplitude a obey standard rayleigh distribution ε is a measure of nonlinearity of random waves and is given by 25 ε k m σ r n n q n n where k m ω m 2 g and ω m m 1 m 0 m j is the moment of s ω and defined by 26 m j ω j s ω d ω the spectral width parameter ν is defined by 27 ν m 0 m 2 m 1 2 1 from eqs 5 and 6 we find 28 r n n k m 4 3 tanh 2 κ tanh 3 κ q n n k m 4 g h g h c g 2 2 1 tanh 2 κ tanh κ 1 κ where κ k m h is the relative water depth letting ν 0 and κ lead to 29 ε k p σ λ 3 3 with the standard statistical technique and reasonable simplification tayfun and alkhalidi 2016 derived an explicit closed form for the wave elevation distribution 30 p η σ η α 2 π exp f 2 2 ε 2 f 1 η η in this expression α 1 p 1 ε is a scaling factor ensuring that the integral of probability density function over the entire space equals unity where p is the standard normal cumulative probability distribution and 31 σ η 1 ε 2 2 β 4 ε 1 2 η m ε β 2 β α exp 1 2 ε 2 2 π f 1 2 ε σ η η η m 1 η 1 ε β ε 2 2 ε σ η 3 gaussian mixture model probability mixture model e g mclachlan and peel 2004 is a convex combination of two or more individual probability distributions which is very popular in density estimation and clustering the number of components in mixture distribution is often restricted to be finite although in some cases the components may be countably infinite given a finite set of probability density functions f i x and weights α i such that α i 0 and α i 1 the probability mixture model p x can be written in the form of a sum as 32 p x i 1 n α i f i x the mixture model guarantees two basic properties of probability density function 1 it is nonnegative everywhere 2 its integral over the entire space is equal to 1 compared with a single probability model mixture models can better describe complex data distributions gaussian distribution is usually used as the mixture component wilson 2000 has proved that gaussian mixture model has a good approximation ability 3 1 moment estimate in statistics the moment estimate is a method of estimation of population parameters it starts by setting the population moment equal to the sample moments and expressing the population moments as functions of the parameters of interest the number of such equations is the same as the number of parameters to be estimated in the present paper instead of sample moments we have derived the population moment in eq 20 from the second order random wave model finally the unknown parameters in the gaussian mixture model can be determined by solving those equations here we give a approximation for wave elevation distribution by using two gaussian distributions and take the following form 33 p η α n 1 μ 1 σ 1 1 α n 2 μ 2 σ 2 where n i is normal distribution with mean μ i and variance σ i 2 α and 1 α are weight coefficients for the two gaussian distributions respectively in eq 33 there are five unknown parameters α m 1 σ 1 m 2 σ 2 that need to be determined we set the mean of surface elevations to be zero i e m 1 k 1 0 it is a trivial matter to note that the n t h moments of gaussian mixture probability distribution is simply a weighted average of the n t h moments of the two components 34 η n η n i 1 2 α i n i η d η α m n μ 1 σ 1 1 α m n μ 2 σ 2 where denotes expectation and m n μ i σ i is the n t h moment of a gaussian distribution with mean μ i and variance σ i 2 which has been calculated in eq 21 the information about the moments of the wave process can be obtained by resorting to theoretical models eq 20 through calibrating the first five moments of gaussian mixture model to match the moments of the true sea wave process we obtain the five unknown parameters α m 1 σ 1 m 2 σ 2 by solving the following equations 35 0 α μ 1 1 α μ 2 k 2 α μ 1 2 σ 1 2 1 α μ 2 2 σ 2 2 k 3 α μ 1 3 3 μ 1 σ 1 2 1 α μ 2 3 3 μ 2 σ 2 2 k 4 3 k 2 2 α μ 1 4 6 μ 1 2 σ 1 2 3 σ 1 4 1 α μ 2 4 6 μ 2 2 σ 2 2 3 σ 2 4 k 5 10 k 3 k 2 α μ 1 5 10 μ 1 3 σ 1 2 15 μ 1 σ 1 4 1 α μ 2 5 10 μ 2 3 σ 2 2 15 μ 2 σ 2 4 where the cumulant k n has been given in eq 17 3 2 em algorithm maximum likelihood estimation mle is another method of estimating the parameters of a probability distribution by maximizing the logarithm of likelihood function dempster et al 1977 the aim of mle is to find the values of these parameters that maximize the likelihood function that is 36 θ ˆ arg max log l θ x where θ is a vector of unknown parameters x x 1 x 2 x n is a set of observed data and l is the likelihood function in order to determine the parameters of gaussian mixture models we use em algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of latent variables or missing data z z 1 z 2 z n that determine the component from which the observation originates em algorithm is an efficient iterative method and each iteration consists of two processes 1 e step determine the conditional expectation e z x θ log l θ x z 2 m step maximize this conditional expectation with respect to θ in the e step given the current estimate of the parameters θ t the conditional distribution of the z i is determined to be the proportional height of the normal density weighted by α j 37 t i j t p z i j x i θ j t α j t n x i μ j t σ j t j m α j t n x i μ j t σ j t where θ j α j μ j σ j is a vector of parameters representing the weight value the mean and variance of the j t h gaussian component n j then the conditional expectation can be constructed 38 q θ θ t e z x θ t log l θ x z i 1 n e z i x θ t log l θ x i z i i 1 n j 1 m t i j t log α j 1 2 log σ j 1 2 σ j 1 x i μ j 2 1 2 log 2 π in the e step everything is known before the step starts except t i j t which can be computed according to eq 37 in the m step the next estimates of θ t 1 can be determined by maximizing the conditional expectation q from e step and α j μ j σ j can be maximized independently since they all appear in separate linear terms thus for the next estimates of α j μ j σ j we obtain 39a α j t 1 1 n i 1 n t i j t 39b μ j t 1 i 1 n t i j t x i i 1 n t i j t 39c σ j t 1 i 1 n t i j t x i μ j t 1 2 i 1 n t i j t finally with repeated iteration between the two steps to met predefined convergence conditions one can obtain the unknown parameters of gaussian mixture models 4 calculation examples and discussions in order to verify the validity of the gaussian mixture model monte carlo simulations are performed for the second order random waves in eq 8 and comparisons with other theoretical probability models are presented the effects of wave steepness spectral width and water depth on the probability distribution of wave elevation are discussed in detail moreover three sets of observation data are used to further study the accuracy and efficiency of gaussian mixture model in our calculation examples we find that em algorithm is more efficient and accurate in comparison with the moment estimation thus we will use em algorithm to determine unknown parameters in gaussian mixture model the results show that three gauss components are sufficient to give satisfactory results both in monte carlo simulations and the observation data furthermore two kinds of error metrics are applied to measure the differences between parametric distribution models p i and empirical distributions p ˆ i one is the root mean square error rmse rmse i 1 n p ˆ i p i 2 n and the other is the mean absolute percentage error mape mape 1 n i 1 n p ˆ i p i p ˆ i 4 1 monte carlo simulation numerical simulations are initialized with the wallops spectrum huang et al 1981 in the following form 40 s ω α a c 2 ω p ω p ω m exp 5 4 ω p ω 4 where a c 2 σ is the characteristic wave amplitude ω p is the peak angular frequency corresponding to peak wavenumber k p ω p 2 g m is the measure of spectral bandwidth the dimensionless parameter α is chosen to satisfy 41 s ω d ω a c 2 2 the wave steepness is ε k p a c and the dimensionless water depth is κ k m h the wave time series have been simulated by applying nondeterministic spectral amplitude nsa method tuah and hudspeth 1982 the upper cut off ω c should meet the following condition 0 ω c s ω d ω 0 95 0 s ω d ω the time step δ t has to obey the nyquist frequency condition δ t π ω c about 1000 realizations with 1000 wave periods long in each time series are performed to reduce the variance of estimates subsequently the wave elevation η is scaled by standard deviation σ and the corresponding probability is multiplied by σ to make a better comparison with the standard normal distribution in order to analyze the influence of wave steepness spectral width and relative water depth on wave elevation distribution we select four cases appropriately and give the values of their parameters in table 1 including the skewness and excess kurtosis in fig 1 the probability of wave elevation is plotted for monte carlo simulations and compared against the present gaussian mixture distribution model in eq 33 the tayfun narrowband model in eq 30 the edgeworth series model in eq 22 and the standard normal distribution from fig 1 a to fig 1 c both the gaussian mixture distribution model and other theoretical distribution models have a good agreement with that of monte carlo simulations except for edgeworth series model shown in fig 1 b this is because the edgeworth model violates the non negativity condition of probability densities and the effective range of approximation shortens as the wave steepness increases comparing fig 1 a with fig 1 b we can see that the deviation from the standard normal distribution becomes significant with the increase of wave steepness as shown in fig 1 a and c m 200 means ν 0 and the skewness of wave elevation distribution becomes weaken slightly with the relative water depth form κ to κ 1 89 which can also be seen from the variation of skewness in table 1 for further illustration fig 2 shows the relationship between relative water depth and skewness under the assumption of narrowband spectrum from fig 2 it is apparent that the skewness decreases at first and then increases as the water depth decreases note that the second order random wave model is no longer valid in shallow water due to the violation of the assumption of narrowband spectrum as shown in fig 1 d tayfun model does not describe simulated data well at the tail of probability distribution according to the rmse and mape values shown in table 2 it is easy to conclude that from case a to case c all nonlinear distribution models are better than the normal distribution and have a similar approximation effect for case d with a finite spectral width gaussian mixture models are obviously superior to others 4 2 observation data to further validate our gaussian mixture distribution model we use three sets of oceanic measured data and refer them to as wacsis tern and gfaks for simplicity wacsis data comes from wave crest sensor intercomparison study prevosto et al 2001 and comprises the wave elevation data gathered with a thorn wave height sensor on february 28 1998 it was measured at the meetpost noordwijk measurement platform which was located approximately 10 kilometers from the dutch coast in a mean water depth of 18 m tern data was measured with a marex wave radar during a extreme storm occurred on january 4 1993 at the tern platform the platform was located in the northern north sea between the shetland islands and norway in a water depth of 167 m more information about tern can be found in forristall 2000 gfaks data was measured on 24 december 1989 at the gullfaks platform in the north sea with emi laser sensors the water depth of 218 meters is regarded as deep water for the most important wave components gfaks data comes from wafo brodtkorb et al 2000 which is a toolbox of matlab routines for statistical analysis and simulation of random waves according to relative water depth shown in table 3 tern and gfaks represent deep water sea states tern has a unimodal spectrum shown in fig 4 while gfaks has a bimodal spectrum shown in fig 5 wacsis is random waves with a single peaked spectrum in transitional waters shown in fig 3 their spectrum all tend to a power law ω 4 approximately over the high frequency region here the angular frequency is scaled by ω m 2 π t m and the spectrum is multiplied by ω m m 0 more specifics and statistical parameters of these data sets are presented in table 3 to compensate for the non stationarity of observation data the full duration is cut into 20 min segments and all analyses will be based on the overall averages of segmental estimates fig 3 shows that the empirical distribution of wacsis in comparison with gaussian mixture model and other models all of these models appear to explain observation data qualitatively well except normal distribution and there is no obvious difference between them in fig 4 edgeworth model turns down sharply in the range of large negative wave elevations this is due to the appearance of negative probability therefore the effective interval of edgeworth model is worthy of consideration the gaussian mixture model also describes well the wave elevation distribution from gfaks shown in fig 5 but the difference between tayfun model and the empirical distribution becomes significant falling within a band of 4 2 this is because the wave steepness calculated by eq 25 is not applicable to bimodal spectrum and tayfun model is derived based on the narrowband assumption however when the wave spectrum is unimodal tayfun model shows a good fitting effect even though the spectral width is considerable for example tern has a broadband spectrum characterized with spectral width ν 0 63 but tayfun model still gives a good agreement with the empirical distribution furthermore two kinds of error metrics are used to quantitatively evaluate each distribution model as shown in table 4 all of the nonlinear distribution models present a good result except for the case gfaks with a bimodal spectrum in this case gaussian mixture models also give good approximation it is worth mentioning that the difference between parametric models and the empirical distribution appears to be larger overall than those in monte carlo simulations according to rmse this is probably because the observed data have more uncertainty 5 conclusions gaussian mixture models for estimating the probability density function of wave elevation were proposed in this paper the model is positive everywhere without any limitations regarding spectral bandwidth and water depth moment estimation and em algorithm were proposed to determine the unknown parameters of gaussian mixture models the proposed model was favorably validated by monte carlo simulations and three sets of observation data the effects of wave steepness spectral width and water depth on the wave elevation distribution were discussed in detail moreover edgeworth model can be inaccurate especially in the tails so its effective interval is worthy of consideration even though the bandwidth of a unimodal spectrum is considerable tayfun model shows a good agreement with the empirical distribution but it seems to not be applicable to sea states of the bimodal spectrum credit authorship contribution statement zhe gao data curation writing original draft software zhaochen sun conceptualization

21676,free surface of parametric sloshing will undergo unbounded motion resulting in destabilization if the combination of excitation frequency and amplitude is located in instable regions in studies of parametric sloshing high modes are of great concern our experimental results showed that dimensionless free surface elevations of parametric sloshing in a clean tank induced by high frequency excitation were much larger than that induced by low frequency excitation the effectiveness of baffles in suppressing parametric sloshing and the damping mechanism of baffles were investigated and analyzed results showed that vertical baffles performed well in suppressing parametric sloshing the optimal number and position of baffles to suppress sloshing depended on sloshing modes two noteworthy findings were revealed one was the complete failure of one baffle in suppressing parametric sloshing of the second mode and the other was that two baffles were less effective than one baffle in suppressing parametric sloshing of the first and the third modes by changing the number and positions of baffles it was concluded that the closer the position of the baffles to the nodes of sloshing modes the more powerful the damping effect of baffles the discovery of damping mechanism cogently explained the two noteworthy findings mentioned above keywords parametric sloshing vertical baffle damping mechanism vertical excitation high frequency 1 introduction parametric sloshing is of concern in several fields such as structures aircrafts and marine crafts kolukula and chellapandi 2013 chen and xue 2018 xue et al 2019 dou et al 2020 for example propellant tanks vibrate along the thrust or g vector direction rather than along the transverse direction in some applications and scenarios dodge 2000 the liquid sloshing in the tank produced by such a tank vibration is called parametric sloshing or faraday wave ibrahim 2005 parametric sloshing is a classic example of parametric instability although parametric sloshing is of secondary design interest in engineering it can still be catastrophic for a tank if it is not properly suppressed during the design phase dodge 1966 ibrahim 2005 in addition liquid parametric sloshing will be induced by the excitation with a shorter duration on the tank if a motion in other degrees of freedom is pre applied to the liquid tank in reality liquids with free surfaces move in response to loads such as wind earthquakes impacts and waves in any orientation the violent liquid movement can lead to the destruction of the tank and even the destabilization of the structure for example vertical excitation is often combined with excitation in other degrees of freedom in the case of vessels there are numerous experimental analytical and numerical studies on the characteristics of parametric sloshing faraday 1831 was the first to study standing waves excited by the vertical motion of a tank basing on experimental observations following that benjamin and ursell 1954 and perlin and schultz 1996 investigated the same problem using theoretical methods in studies on vertical oscillations kinematic and dynamical features of waves such as rich liquid free surface shape wave patterns edwards and fauve 1994 kudrolli and gollub 1966 westra et al 2003 chen and viñals 1999 and instability regions threshold frequencies and amplitudes required to excite surface waves bechhoefer et al 1995 feng et al 2016 batson et al 2013 were observed and obtained recently ibrahim 2015 made a cogent review of parametric sloshing the characteristics of parametric sloshing are significantly different from those of direct sloshing since the forced mechanism of parametric sloshing is parametrical rather than direct parametric resonance system instability was triggered at the excitation frequency close to twice the natural frequency rather than at the natural frequency of the liquid tank benjamin and ursell 1954 frandsen and borthwick 2003 ibrahim 2005 sanapala et al 2018 which may result in an exponential rather than linear increase in liquid sloshing amplitude benjamin and ursell 1954 concluded that the linear solutions are always unstable under the excitation frequency equal to twice the natural frequency another difference is that the response of parametric sloshing to excitation is non immediate under the vertical excitation the motion of the liquid free surface often lags far behind the onset of excitation instead of moving immediately the free surface continues to remain stationary as it did before the excitation was applied until it reaches a critical state furthermore it was observed experimentally that under horizontal excitation only odd mode sloshing was excited while no even mode sloshing was excited davis and weidman 2000 whereas sloshing of both odd mode and even mode may grow into violent motion under vertical excitation in addition faltinsen et al 2007 developed an analytical method which accurately predicted linear piston like sloshing under forced heave motions in a moonpool as an important complement to the theoretical approach of faltinsen et al 2007 faltinsen and timokha 2015 quantified the aforementioned steady state wave response the key to the new solution was the proposed pressure discharge in the moonpool opening based on the similarity between piston mode sloshing in a two dimensional rectangular moonpool and small amplitude oscillatory flows through a slot in a slatted baffle zhao et al 2017 conducted a set of experiments to investigate the gap resonant induced by transient focused wave groups and for the first time presented time histories and successfully extracted higher harmonics they also found that both odd and even modes of the gap resonant were excited under the asymmetric excitation head seas while much research has been done on parametric sloshing there is very limited research on the suppression of parametric sloshing chiba et al 2016 investigated the liquid sloshing characteristics in a spherical tank covered with a diaphragm under vertical excitation basing on the experimental results they concluded that the diaphragm covering the free surface significantly suppressed the large amplitude nonlinear response of the free surface sanapala et al 2018 simulated parametric sloshing of various slosh modes in a rectangular tank with a horizontal baffle by a numerical program it is generally accepted that the first sloshing mode is of primary importance under the horizontal excitation however under the vertical excitation sanapala et al 2018 concluded that the involvement of higher modes is the prime concern a finding that is identical to that of faltinsen and timokha 2009 basing on studies on parameters of the baffle sanapala et al 2018 obtained the optimal position and width of baffle to suppress sloshing under coupled excitation however the horizontal baffle failed to suppress sloshing induced by pure vertical excitation in addition to the aforementioned regular excitation veldman et al 2007 javanshir et al 2013a b elahi et al 2015 studied liquid sloshing induced by complex excitation basing on a developed and improved numerical model of fluid structure interaction they also described the effects of sloshing induced by complex excitation such as excitation with components in both x and y directions and ferris wheel motion on the movement of the tank javanshir et al 2013a b used baffles to suppress sloshing and found that installing baffles significantly reduced the effects of liquid sloshing induced by complex excitation on tank motion it is well known that installing baffles in liquid tanks is one of the most commonly used measures to suppress sloshing induced by horizontal excitation xue et al 2017 experimentally investigated four types of baffles i e immersed bottom mounted vertical baffles vertical baffles flushing with free surface surface piercing bottom mounted vertical baffles and perforated vertical baffles the results showed that perforated vertical baffle is more effective in suppressing sloshing faltinsen et al 2011a faltinsen et al 2011b wei et al 2015 extensively investigated another special perforated vertical baffles with uniformly distributed holes to suppress the resonant sloshing induced by horizontal excitation careful arrangement of baffles increases the hydraulic damping of baffles to suppress direct sloshing the hydrodynamic damping of baffles against direct sloshing depends on drilling holes installation location and number of baffles yu et al 2019 baffles damping is first achieved by blocking fluid movement a second obvious damping mechanism is that the baffles change natural frequencies of fluid system moreover baffles create vortexes as the fluid moves increasing the dissipation of fluid energy turner et al 2013 xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2013 however most of the studies on the suppressing of liquid sloshing by baffles have been conducted under horizontal excitation therefore the primary goal of this work is to suppress parametric sloshing by baffles the baffles used in the experiments were vertical baffles with uniformly distributed holes through a series of experiments the optimal baffle design for the mitigation of parametric sloshing was obtained and the damping mechanism of baffles was analyzed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes experimental setup section 3 presents the experiments results and discussion section 3 1 describes the specific cases of parametric sloshing in a clean tank the relationship between excitation and parametric sloshing tested is depicted on the idealized stability diagram time histories of the free surface elevations and the compositions of the parametric sloshing waves are given at different modes of parametric sloshing induced by excitation with different frequencies sections 3 2 and 3 3 analyze the effect of vertical baffles on parameter sloshing of different modes since one baffle placed in the center of the tank failed to suppress second mode parametric sloshing the number and position of baffles were varied to study the effect of baffles on parametric sloshing and to optimize the baffle design finally section 4 is a brief summary and conclusion of the study 2 experimental setup a detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in yu et al 2019 listed below are some of the important experimental parameters used to investigate parametric sloshing a rectangular tank was tested with the internal dimensions of length l 1000 mm height h 700 mm width b 100 mm the water depth h adopted was 120 mm fig 1 a the parameters of the vertical baffle were solidity ratio s n 0 6 slot height z p 5 mm slat height z s 7 5 mm and baffle bottom margins z b 5 mm the position and configuration of the baffle are shown in fig 1 b the rectangular tank was driven by a six degree of freedom motion simulation platform with dimensions of 3m 3m and a payload of 1000 kg see fig 1 in yu et al 2019 the platform is flexible enough to provide multiple forms of motion basing on the time series of inputs the maximum translation displacement of the platform along the coordinate axis is 400 mm and the maximum rotation displacement around the coordinate axis is 40 the maximum movement frequency is 20 hz the corresponding motion precision is 0 1 mm 0 1 and 0 1hz respectively in the experiments presented here the tank was subjected to vertical excitation by the platform as if it was in an environment that is under idealized earthquake the response of the liquid was measured by a wave probe wh200 located 15 mm from the vertical wall of the tank see fig 1 a the sampling rate of time series of free surface elevations was 100 hz the sampling precision of the wave probe was 0 5 f s the accuracy of amplitude frequency combination of the motion platform as well as the reliability of the experiments procedure and experiments data have been verified in yu et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 parametric sloshing in a clean tank this paper focused on the suppression of parametric sloshing by vertical baffles a set of experiments was designed to achieve this purpose the tank was driven by a heave oscillation z t a sin 2π f t the sloshing nature frequencies ω n in a clean tank were computed from analytical solution lamb 1932 given by the following 1 ω n g k n tanh k n h f n ω n 2 π where k n n l π l is the tank length h is the water depth and n is the sloshing mode number in parametric sloshing induced by vertical excitation the free surface remains stationary over a considerable range of excitation parameters a range of parameters known as stable region under the excitation parameter close to twice the natural frequencies of the liquid the free surface moves where the excitation parameters constitute the parameter unstable region this property of parametric sloshing can be represented by a stability map benjamin and ursell 1954 frandsen and borthwick 2003 ibrahim 2005 sanapala et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a in fig 2 the blue regions and purple shadow regions represent the unstable ranges of sloshing motion in a vertically excited tank as presented by sanapala et al 2018 and frandsen and borthwick 2003 respectively as shown in fig 2 a all excitation parameters frequency and amplitude tested in the experiments are marked on the stability map this experiments were divided into two phases the first phase was to obtain the excitation parameters that can excite the parametric sloshing in different modes in the first phase the response of the parametric sloshing to the excitation amplitude was tested where the excitation frequency was close to twice the natural frequency the tested excitation frequencies and amplitudes either fell in the unstable regions parameter resonant zone or fell in the stable regions free surface remained stationary the specific excitation parameters frequency and amplitude tested is listed in the columns named stable regions and the columns named unstable regions in table 1 in fig 2 b we plot mark to show that the liquid free surface remains stationary which means the parametric sloshing is not excited at its corresponding frequency and amplitude with the excitation input exceeding more than 300s the different excitation frequencies corresponding to different natural frequencies of sloshing modes n are represented by different colors and different fill shapes in fig 2 c we use mark to indicate that the liquid free surface begins to move i e parametric sloshing is excited at the corresponding frequency and amplitude of excitation the different excitation frequencies exciting parametric sloshing of different modes n are distinguished by different colors in the second phase the response of parametric sloshing to frequency of excitation was tested with a frequency sweep rate of approximately 0 01 hz based on the appropriate amplitude of excitation obtained in the first phase the specific excitation parameters frequency and amplitude tested is listed in the column named frequency sweeping in table 1 in fig 2 d the different excitation frequencies exciting parametric sloshing of different modes n are distinguished by marks of different colors and different fill shapes taking the parametric sloshing mode n 1 as an example the frequency of excitation tested was nearly twice the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode at excitation amplitudes of 5 mm 20 mm or 30 mm the liquid free surface remains stationary for excitation durations exceeding 300s another very important phenomenon is that under parametric excitation even mode sloshing is excited and gradually develops into violent fluid motion a phenomenon that does not occur in direct sloshing in parametric sloshing studies high modes are of great interest specifically fig 3 presents the free surface elevations of parametric sloshing in a clean tank left and corresponding power spectral density right column under different excitation frequencies the excitation frequencies in fig 3 a to e are close to twice the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode to the fifth sloshing mode respectively it should be noted that the longitudinal coordinate of fig 3 a is different from those of fig 3 b d under the excitation parameters listed in table 1 the wave heights of parametric sloshing of the second mode fig 3 b and other higher modes fig 3 c e are much greater than that of parametric sloshing of the first mode fig 3 a as shown in fig 3 parametric sloshing lags far behind the onset of excitation i e it takes some time for parametric sloshing to be excited and grow the range of frequencies and amplitudes of the vertical excitation that can excite parametric sloshing is very limited compared to the range of horizontal excitation that can excite direct sloshing in the description of fig 2 we mentioned the strict limits on the range of the excitation amplitude to excite parametric sloshing in fig 3 a we presented the strict limits on the range of the excitation frequency to excite parametric sloshing by time history of the free surface elevations as shown in fig 3 a the liquid free surface remains stationary at excitation frequency f 1 15 hz while the free surface begins to move violently at excitation frequency f 1 09 hz the experimental results show that the excitation frequency is still required to be within a very narrow frequency range near twice the natural frequency in order to generate parametric sloshing under large amplitude excitation such as a 40 mm in order to further analyze the effect of the excitation frequency on parametric sloshing fast fourier transform of the free surface elevations were performed to obtain the frequency compositions of the sloshing waves as shown in the right column of fig 3 a the dominant response frequencies of sloshing awoken by excitation frequency f 1 12hz are 0 5332hz and 1 692hz corresponding to ω 1 and 3ω 1 the dominant response frequencies are 0 5500hz 1 092hz and 1 633hz corresponding to ω 1 excitation frequency and 3ω 1 at excitation frequency f 1 09hz closest to 2ω 1 in the three examples in fig 3 a as shown in fig 3 b a very important phenomenon is that even modes which do not appear in direct sloshing are excited in parametric sloshing the dominant response frequencies at excitation frequency f 2 00hz are 1 010hz and 2 020hz corresponding to ω 2 and 2ω 2 the dominant response frequencies are 0 9933hz and 1 990hz corresponding to ω 2 excitation frequency and 3ω 2 at excitation frequency f 1 97hz closest to 2ω 2 in the three examples in fig 3 b the amplitude corresponding to the frequency 2 983hz is less than one tenth of that corresponding to 0 9933hz and is negligible in fig 3 c the time histories of free surface elevations are presented under three different excitation amplitudes where the excitation frequency f 2 80 hz is close to 2ω 3 as the excitation amplitude increases the complexity of wave compositions increases at the excitation amplitude a 4 mm dominant response frequencies are 1 417hz and 2 825hz corresponding to ω 3 and corresponding to 2ω 3 at the excitation amplitude a 5 mm dominant response frequencies are 1 392hz 0 9833hz 0 5000hz and 1 867hz corresponding to ω 3 ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω 1 as shown in fig 3 d and e increasing excitation frequency to 2ω 4 and 2ω 5 the energy transfers to the side band near ω 4 and ω 5 in fig 3 e the side band energy appears at the frequency f 1 8000 under the excitation amplitude of 2 mm and side band energy appears at frequencies f 1 862 hz and f 1 750 under the excitation amplitude of 3 mm the distribution of energy in side band reflects the kinematic violence and strong nonlinearity of the parameter sloshing of high mode excited by excitation with high frequency 3 2 parametric sloshing in the tank with a different number of baffles vertical baffles with uniformly distributed holes were used in the experiments to suppress parametric sloshing the experiments results on the effect of baffles on parametric sloshing reveal two noteworthy and interesting findings in the experiments we first tested the dampening of one baffle on parametric sloshing and obtained our first finding it is well known that one baffle placed in the center of a tank can suppress direct sloshing however this conclusion does not hold for parametric sloshing in fig 4 one vertical baffle disposed in the tank center effectively suppresses parametric sloshing of the first fig 4 a and the third mode fig 4 c1 fig 4 c2 but fails to suppress parametric sloshing of the second fig 4 b the fourth fig 4 d and the fifth mode fig 4 e consequently two baffles and three baffles were investigated to effectively suppress parametric sloshing we use the symbol m to denote the number of baffles in the experiments with two baffles the two vertical baffles were located at one third and two thirds of the characteristic length of the tank i e d a 1 3 in the experiments with three baffles two of the threes baffles arranged at 1 3 and 2 3 of tank s length and the other one was attached to the tank center fig 1 a parametric sloshing of the second fig 4 b the fourth fig 4 d and the fifth mode fig 4 e are significantly suppressed by two baffles and three baffles the suppression effects of different numbers of baffles on mitigating sloshing were ranked from strong to weak according to the maximum value of free surface displacement at the vicinity of the tank wall from smallest to largest and were listed in table 2 in table 2 labeled threebaffles twobaffles onebaffle means that the suppression of parametric sloshing is most pronounced by three baffles and least pronounced by one baffle under the corresponding excitation so for the other interesting finding was discovered two baffles were more effective than one baffle in suppressing sloshing of the second mode see fig 4 b but not as effective as one baffle in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode see fig 4 a and c2 with respect to the damping mechanisms of baffles turner et al 2013 and xue and lin 2011 concluded that baffles suppressed sloshing through blocking the fluid motion changing the natural frequency of the fluid system inducing vortexes to enhance fluid energy dissipation however the summarized damping mechanisms of baffles do not explain the two interesting phenomena found in the experiments according to the experiments results it can be thought that baffles in our experiments do not change the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing in fig 3 of section 3 1 parametric sloshing in the clean tank is multi frequency waves with nonlinearity in fig 5 of section 3 2 the fft of the time histories of the free surface show that the components of the sloshing wave corresponding to the high mode and excitation frequency disappear due to baffles under the excitation frequency close to 2ω 5 side band energy disappear duo to baffles comparing fig 5 e with fig 3 e more specific results are described below comparing the free surface wave elevations in fig 5 b with the free surface wave elevations in the clean tank in fig 3 b where f 2 0 hz and a 4 mm two baffles fig 5 b and three baffles fig 5 b almost completely suppress the parametric sloshing therefore the liquid free surface remains stationary and the sloshing response in the frequency domain corresponding fft results disappears under the excitation the reasons for the results in fig 5 c are the same as above however under the excitation frequencies close to twice the second and the fourth natural frequency respectively one baffle placed in the tank center completely fails in suppressing sloshing as shown in figs 4 b 5 b and fig 4 d 5 d the dominant response frequencies of parametric sloshing wave include not only the natural frequency but also the double frequency fig 5 b and fig 5 d 3 3 parametric sloshing in the tank with two baffles of different positions for sloshing induced by horizontal excitation the experimental results yu et al 2019 showed a significant effect of installing position on the baffle suppression effect in section 3 2 we found two interesting phenomena one is the complete failure of one baffle in suppressing parameter sloshing of second mode and the other is that two baffles are weaker than one baffle in suppressing parameter sloshing of the first and the third modes a series of experiments were therefore conducted to investigate the effect of installing position on baffle damping in parametric sloshing according to the experimental results of parametric sloshing searching for the causes of these two phenomena and baffles that can effectively suppress parametric sloshing under a wider range of excitation based on the effect of baffle position on direct sloshing five installing positions were set up including the positon of two baffles cases in fig 4 in the suppression experiments of parametric sloshing fig 6 shows the position of the two baffles and the first five mode profiles of sloshing in a clean tank fig 7 shows the frequency response of the parameter sloshing in the tank with different baffle positions the suppression of sloshing by baffles with different positions is ranked and listed in table 3 the rule of ordering labeled as cm cn is the maximum value of free surface displacement at the wave probe from smallest to largest for example under the excitation frequency close to twice the natural frequency of the first mode position c5 d a 0 2 and position c6 d a 0 8 corresponds to as the most effective position and least effective position on suppressing parametric sloshing among the five locations tested in our experiments respectively parametric sloshing is almost completely suppressed by the two baffles with right position for example under excitation frequency close to 2ω 1 see fig 7 a and table 3 the two baffles at the position of c5 d a 0 2 and c2 d a 1 3 almost completely suppress fluid motion as shown in fig 7 and table 3 the important result is that the optimal position varies depending on the excitation that determines the sloshing mode the ordering results show that the closer the position of the baffles to the node of the sloshing mode the more powerful the damping effect of the baffles this finding cogently explains that one baffle is more effective than two baffles in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode moreover in order to provide an effective damping effect over a wide range of excitation it is recommended that baffles be placed at the node positions of various sloshing modes there are multiple nodes in sloshing of high mode in order to suppress high mode sloshing more effectively the baffles can be positioned at nodes closer to the liquid tank wall for example the position marked as c7 is more effective than c5 and the position marked as c6 is more effective than c2 on suppressing sloshing of the fourth mode this finding helps to solve the problem of the sometimes effective and sometimes ineffective of baffles on suppressing sloshing and contributes to the generality of damping mechanism and design principles of baffles this may be attributed to the fact that baffles impede the maximum fluid velocity because the fluid velocity is greatest at the node position of sloshing modes in other words baffles damping effect is greatest as baffles impedes the maximum fluid velocity in addition it may imply that the baffle location affects the baffle damping more than the energy dissipated by the vortexes etc if considering that the damping mechanisms of baffles are to block the flow movement change the sloshing natural frequency and generate more vortex to dissipate energy turner et al 2013 xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2013 then we believe that an increase in the number of baffles will result in a more significant sloshing mitigation effect while in our experiments where the excitation frequency was close to twice the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode one baffle was superior to the sloshing reduction of the two baffles thus we speculate the position of baffles has a greater effect on baffles damping than the energy dissipated by the vortexes however more quantitative effects of the different damping mechanisms need to be given to rigorously arrive at this conclusion the experimental results show that the position of baffles also does not change the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing in order to clearly show the difference in the sloshing suppression between different baffle positions free surface elevations and fft results in different tanks with baffles at different positions are presented in fig 8 the excitation frequencies are closer to natural frequencies and the excitation amplitudes are larger the baffles positions presented in fig 8 are selected according to the first three largest of the order in table 3 for example under the excitation frequency f 1 07 hz fig 8 a baffles located at positions c4 c7 and c6 are less effective than the positions c2 and c5 on parametric sloshing finally the suppression of parametric sloshing by baffles is presented quantitatively in table 4 based on equation 2 2 η η max none η max screens η max none where η max none is the maximum free surface elevation in the clean tank η max baffles is the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with baffles the five frequencies selected in table 4 are each close to twice the natural frequency of the first mode to fifth mode in addition the parameters of excitation and fft results in the experiments of baffle free fig 3 baffles with different numbers fig 5 and baffles located in different positions fig 8 are summarized in table 5 in table 5 amp 0 means that the amplitude and energy are zero at the corresponding f peak which indicates the parametric sloshing is completely suppressed under the excitation by the baffles symbol indicates that no test data is available 4 conclusions parametric sloshing is a concern in many fields including structure aircraft and marine crafts to investigate effects of vertical baffles on parametric sloshing experiments were conducted on a six degree of freedom motion platform the duration of excitation on the tank in the experiments of parametric sloshing was much longer than that in the experiments of direct sloshing in addition the range of excitation frequencies and excitation amplitudes that can excite parametric sloshing was very limited and this range was called instability region however parametric sloshing is more likely to be excited if the excitation of other degrees of freedom is applied to the liquid system in advance more importantly both even modes that do not occur in direct sloshing and odd modes can be violent under the vertical excitation in fact the dimensionless wave heights of parametric sloshing of the second mode and other higher modes are much larger than that of the first mode in contrast to horizontal baffles that failed to suppress sloshing induced by pure vertical excitation sanapala et al 2018 vertical baffles performed well in suppressing parametric sloshing however the optimal number of baffles to reduce sloshing varied depending on the mode of sloshing among the number of baffles tested in our experiments the most effective number of baffles is three and the least effective number of baffles is two in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode in suppressing sloshing of the second fourth and fifth mode the most effective number of baffles is three and the least effective number of baffles is one two noteworthy and interesting findings were revealed in the experiments one was that one baffle completely failed to suppress sloshing of the second mode the other was that one baffle performed better than two baffles in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode these two findings challenged the previously summarized damping mechanism of baffles as shown by the fft results baffles in our experiments did not change the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing a series of experiments were conducted varying the installing position of the two baffles the excitation frequencies in the experiments covered the first five natural frequencies of sloshing similarly the optimal position of two baffles varied depending on the mode of sloshing the dampening effect of the baffle position on sloshing of the first mode was in the order c5 d a 0 2 c2 d a 1 3 c4 d a 0 5 c7 d a 0 75 c6 d a 0 8 the order of the second mode sloshing was c4 c2 c7 c5 c6 the order of the third mode sloshing was c7 c6 c4 c5 c2 the order of the forth mode sloshing was c7 c5 c6 c2 c4 and of the fifth mode sloshing was c6 c7 c2 c4 c5 it can be concluded that the closer the position of the baffles to the sloshing mode nodes the more powerful the damping effect in addition to suppress high mode sloshing more effectively the baffles can be positioned at nodes closer to the liquid tank wall for example position marked as c7 is more effective than c5 and position marked as c6 is more effective than c2 in suppressing sloshing of the fourth mode this may be attributed to the baffle impeding the maximum velocity of the fluid the discovery of damping mechanism cogently explained the two noteworthy and interesting findings mentioned above credit authorship contribution statement

21676,free surface of parametric sloshing will undergo unbounded motion resulting in destabilization if the combination of excitation frequency and amplitude is located in instable regions in studies of parametric sloshing high modes are of great concern our experimental results showed that dimensionless free surface elevations of parametric sloshing in a clean tank induced by high frequency excitation were much larger than that induced by low frequency excitation the effectiveness of baffles in suppressing parametric sloshing and the damping mechanism of baffles were investigated and analyzed results showed that vertical baffles performed well in suppressing parametric sloshing the optimal number and position of baffles to suppress sloshing depended on sloshing modes two noteworthy findings were revealed one was the complete failure of one baffle in suppressing parametric sloshing of the second mode and the other was that two baffles were less effective than one baffle in suppressing parametric sloshing of the first and the third modes by changing the number and positions of baffles it was concluded that the closer the position of the baffles to the nodes of sloshing modes the more powerful the damping effect of baffles the discovery of damping mechanism cogently explained the two noteworthy findings mentioned above keywords parametric sloshing vertical baffle damping mechanism vertical excitation high frequency 1 introduction parametric sloshing is of concern in several fields such as structures aircrafts and marine crafts kolukula and chellapandi 2013 chen and xue 2018 xue et al 2019 dou et al 2020 for example propellant tanks vibrate along the thrust or g vector direction rather than along the transverse direction in some applications and scenarios dodge 2000 the liquid sloshing in the tank produced by such a tank vibration is called parametric sloshing or faraday wave ibrahim 2005 parametric sloshing is a classic example of parametric instability although parametric sloshing is of secondary design interest in engineering it can still be catastrophic for a tank if it is not properly suppressed during the design phase dodge 1966 ibrahim 2005 in addition liquid parametric sloshing will be induced by the excitation with a shorter duration on the tank if a motion in other degrees of freedom is pre applied to the liquid tank in reality liquids with free surfaces move in response to loads such as wind earthquakes impacts and waves in any orientation the violent liquid movement can lead to the destruction of the tank and even the destabilization of the structure for example vertical excitation is often combined with excitation in other degrees of freedom in the case of vessels there are numerous experimental analytical and numerical studies on the characteristics of parametric sloshing faraday 1831 was the first to study standing waves excited by the vertical motion of a tank basing on experimental observations following that benjamin and ursell 1954 and perlin and schultz 1996 investigated the same problem using theoretical methods in studies on vertical oscillations kinematic and dynamical features of waves such as rich liquid free surface shape wave patterns edwards and fauve 1994 kudrolli and gollub 1966 westra et al 2003 chen and viñals 1999 and instability regions threshold frequencies and amplitudes required to excite surface waves bechhoefer et al 1995 feng et al 2016 batson et al 2013 were observed and obtained recently ibrahim 2015 made a cogent review of parametric sloshing the characteristics of parametric sloshing are significantly different from those of direct sloshing since the forced mechanism of parametric sloshing is parametrical rather than direct parametric resonance system instability was triggered at the excitation frequency close to twice the natural frequency rather than at the natural frequency of the liquid tank benjamin and ursell 1954 frandsen and borthwick 2003 ibrahim 2005 sanapala et al 2018 which may result in an exponential rather than linear increase in liquid sloshing amplitude benjamin and ursell 1954 concluded that the linear solutions are always unstable under the excitation frequency equal to twice the natural frequency another difference is that the response of parametric sloshing to excitation is non immediate under the vertical excitation the motion of the liquid free surface often lags far behind the onset of excitation instead of moving immediately the free surface continues to remain stationary as it did before the excitation was applied until it reaches a critical state furthermore it was observed experimentally that under horizontal excitation only odd mode sloshing was excited while no even mode sloshing was excited davis and weidman 2000 whereas sloshing of both odd mode and even mode may grow into violent motion under vertical excitation in addition faltinsen et al 2007 developed an analytical method which accurately predicted linear piston like sloshing under forced heave motions in a moonpool as an important complement to the theoretical approach of faltinsen et al 2007 faltinsen and timokha 2015 quantified the aforementioned steady state wave response the key to the new solution was the proposed pressure discharge in the moonpool opening based on the similarity between piston mode sloshing in a two dimensional rectangular moonpool and small amplitude oscillatory flows through a slot in a slatted baffle zhao et al 2017 conducted a set of experiments to investigate the gap resonant induced by transient focused wave groups and for the first time presented time histories and successfully extracted higher harmonics they also found that both odd and even modes of the gap resonant were excited under the asymmetric excitation head seas while much research has been done on parametric sloshing there is very limited research on the suppression of parametric sloshing chiba et al 2016 investigated the liquid sloshing characteristics in a spherical tank covered with a diaphragm under vertical excitation basing on the experimental results they concluded that the diaphragm covering the free surface significantly suppressed the large amplitude nonlinear response of the free surface sanapala et al 2018 simulated parametric sloshing of various slosh modes in a rectangular tank with a horizontal baffle by a numerical program it is generally accepted that the first sloshing mode is of primary importance under the horizontal excitation however under the vertical excitation sanapala et al 2018 concluded that the involvement of higher modes is the prime concern a finding that is identical to that of faltinsen and timokha 2009 basing on studies on parameters of the baffle sanapala et al 2018 obtained the optimal position and width of baffle to suppress sloshing under coupled excitation however the horizontal baffle failed to suppress sloshing induced by pure vertical excitation in addition to the aforementioned regular excitation veldman et al 2007 javanshir et al 2013a b elahi et al 2015 studied liquid sloshing induced by complex excitation basing on a developed and improved numerical model of fluid structure interaction they also described the effects of sloshing induced by complex excitation such as excitation with components in both x and y directions and ferris wheel motion on the movement of the tank javanshir et al 2013a b used baffles to suppress sloshing and found that installing baffles significantly reduced the effects of liquid sloshing induced by complex excitation on tank motion it is well known that installing baffles in liquid tanks is one of the most commonly used measures to suppress sloshing induced by horizontal excitation xue et al 2017 experimentally investigated four types of baffles i e immersed bottom mounted vertical baffles vertical baffles flushing with free surface surface piercing bottom mounted vertical baffles and perforated vertical baffles the results showed that perforated vertical baffle is more effective in suppressing sloshing faltinsen et al 2011a faltinsen et al 2011b wei et al 2015 extensively investigated another special perforated vertical baffles with uniformly distributed holes to suppress the resonant sloshing induced by horizontal excitation careful arrangement of baffles increases the hydraulic damping of baffles to suppress direct sloshing the hydrodynamic damping of baffles against direct sloshing depends on drilling holes installation location and number of baffles yu et al 2019 baffles damping is first achieved by blocking fluid movement a second obvious damping mechanism is that the baffles change natural frequencies of fluid system moreover baffles create vortexes as the fluid moves increasing the dissipation of fluid energy turner et al 2013 xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2013 however most of the studies on the suppressing of liquid sloshing by baffles have been conducted under horizontal excitation therefore the primary goal of this work is to suppress parametric sloshing by baffles the baffles used in the experiments were vertical baffles with uniformly distributed holes through a series of experiments the optimal baffle design for the mitigation of parametric sloshing was obtained and the damping mechanism of baffles was analyzed the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes experimental setup section 3 presents the experiments results and discussion section 3 1 describes the specific cases of parametric sloshing in a clean tank the relationship between excitation and parametric sloshing tested is depicted on the idealized stability diagram time histories of the free surface elevations and the compositions of the parametric sloshing waves are given at different modes of parametric sloshing induced by excitation with different frequencies sections 3 2 and 3 3 analyze the effect of vertical baffles on parameter sloshing of different modes since one baffle placed in the center of the tank failed to suppress second mode parametric sloshing the number and position of baffles were varied to study the effect of baffles on parametric sloshing and to optimize the baffle design finally section 4 is a brief summary and conclusion of the study 2 experimental setup a detailed description of the experimental setup can be found in yu et al 2019 listed below are some of the important experimental parameters used to investigate parametric sloshing a rectangular tank was tested with the internal dimensions of length l 1000 mm height h 700 mm width b 100 mm the water depth h adopted was 120 mm fig 1 a the parameters of the vertical baffle were solidity ratio s n 0 6 slot height z p 5 mm slat height z s 7 5 mm and baffle bottom margins z b 5 mm the position and configuration of the baffle are shown in fig 1 b the rectangular tank was driven by a six degree of freedom motion simulation platform with dimensions of 3m 3m and a payload of 1000 kg see fig 1 in yu et al 2019 the platform is flexible enough to provide multiple forms of motion basing on the time series of inputs the maximum translation displacement of the platform along the coordinate axis is 400 mm and the maximum rotation displacement around the coordinate axis is 40 the maximum movement frequency is 20 hz the corresponding motion precision is 0 1 mm 0 1 and 0 1hz respectively in the experiments presented here the tank was subjected to vertical excitation by the platform as if it was in an environment that is under idealized earthquake the response of the liquid was measured by a wave probe wh200 located 15 mm from the vertical wall of the tank see fig 1 a the sampling rate of time series of free surface elevations was 100 hz the sampling precision of the wave probe was 0 5 f s the accuracy of amplitude frequency combination of the motion platform as well as the reliability of the experiments procedure and experiments data have been verified in yu et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 parametric sloshing in a clean tank this paper focused on the suppression of parametric sloshing by vertical baffles a set of experiments was designed to achieve this purpose the tank was driven by a heave oscillation z t a sin 2π f t the sloshing nature frequencies ω n in a clean tank were computed from analytical solution lamb 1932 given by the following 1 ω n g k n tanh k n h f n ω n 2 π where k n n l π l is the tank length h is the water depth and n is the sloshing mode number in parametric sloshing induced by vertical excitation the free surface remains stationary over a considerable range of excitation parameters a range of parameters known as stable region under the excitation parameter close to twice the natural frequencies of the liquid the free surface moves where the excitation parameters constitute the parameter unstable region this property of parametric sloshing can be represented by a stability map benjamin and ursell 1954 frandsen and borthwick 2003 ibrahim 2005 sanapala et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 a in fig 2 the blue regions and purple shadow regions represent the unstable ranges of sloshing motion in a vertically excited tank as presented by sanapala et al 2018 and frandsen and borthwick 2003 respectively as shown in fig 2 a all excitation parameters frequency and amplitude tested in the experiments are marked on the stability map this experiments were divided into two phases the first phase was to obtain the excitation parameters that can excite the parametric sloshing in different modes in the first phase the response of the parametric sloshing to the excitation amplitude was tested where the excitation frequency was close to twice the natural frequency the tested excitation frequencies and amplitudes either fell in the unstable regions parameter resonant zone or fell in the stable regions free surface remained stationary the specific excitation parameters frequency and amplitude tested is listed in the columns named stable regions and the columns named unstable regions in table 1 in fig 2 b we plot mark to show that the liquid free surface remains stationary which means the parametric sloshing is not excited at its corresponding frequency and amplitude with the excitation input exceeding more than 300s the different excitation frequencies corresponding to different natural frequencies of sloshing modes n are represented by different colors and different fill shapes in fig 2 c we use mark to indicate that the liquid free surface begins to move i e parametric sloshing is excited at the corresponding frequency and amplitude of excitation the different excitation frequencies exciting parametric sloshing of different modes n are distinguished by different colors in the second phase the response of parametric sloshing to frequency of excitation was tested with a frequency sweep rate of approximately 0 01 hz based on the appropriate amplitude of excitation obtained in the first phase the specific excitation parameters frequency and amplitude tested is listed in the column named frequency sweeping in table 1 in fig 2 d the different excitation frequencies exciting parametric sloshing of different modes n are distinguished by marks of different colors and different fill shapes taking the parametric sloshing mode n 1 as an example the frequency of excitation tested was nearly twice the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode at excitation amplitudes of 5 mm 20 mm or 30 mm the liquid free surface remains stationary for excitation durations exceeding 300s another very important phenomenon is that under parametric excitation even mode sloshing is excited and gradually develops into violent fluid motion a phenomenon that does not occur in direct sloshing in parametric sloshing studies high modes are of great interest specifically fig 3 presents the free surface elevations of parametric sloshing in a clean tank left and corresponding power spectral density right column under different excitation frequencies the excitation frequencies in fig 3 a to e are close to twice the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode to the fifth sloshing mode respectively it should be noted that the longitudinal coordinate of fig 3 a is different from those of fig 3 b d under the excitation parameters listed in table 1 the wave heights of parametric sloshing of the second mode fig 3 b and other higher modes fig 3 c e are much greater than that of parametric sloshing of the first mode fig 3 a as shown in fig 3 parametric sloshing lags far behind the onset of excitation i e it takes some time for parametric sloshing to be excited and grow the range of frequencies and amplitudes of the vertical excitation that can excite parametric sloshing is very limited compared to the range of horizontal excitation that can excite direct sloshing in the description of fig 2 we mentioned the strict limits on the range of the excitation amplitude to excite parametric sloshing in fig 3 a we presented the strict limits on the range of the excitation frequency to excite parametric sloshing by time history of the free surface elevations as shown in fig 3 a the liquid free surface remains stationary at excitation frequency f 1 15 hz while the free surface begins to move violently at excitation frequency f 1 09 hz the experimental results show that the excitation frequency is still required to be within a very narrow frequency range near twice the natural frequency in order to generate parametric sloshing under large amplitude excitation such as a 40 mm in order to further analyze the effect of the excitation frequency on parametric sloshing fast fourier transform of the free surface elevations were performed to obtain the frequency compositions of the sloshing waves as shown in the right column of fig 3 a the dominant response frequencies of sloshing awoken by excitation frequency f 1 12hz are 0 5332hz and 1 692hz corresponding to ω 1 and 3ω 1 the dominant response frequencies are 0 5500hz 1 092hz and 1 633hz corresponding to ω 1 excitation frequency and 3ω 1 at excitation frequency f 1 09hz closest to 2ω 1 in the three examples in fig 3 a as shown in fig 3 b a very important phenomenon is that even modes which do not appear in direct sloshing are excited in parametric sloshing the dominant response frequencies at excitation frequency f 2 00hz are 1 010hz and 2 020hz corresponding to ω 2 and 2ω 2 the dominant response frequencies are 0 9933hz and 1 990hz corresponding to ω 2 excitation frequency and 3ω 2 at excitation frequency f 1 97hz closest to 2ω 2 in the three examples in fig 3 b the amplitude corresponding to the frequency 2 983hz is less than one tenth of that corresponding to 0 9933hz and is negligible in fig 3 c the time histories of free surface elevations are presented under three different excitation amplitudes where the excitation frequency f 2 80 hz is close to 2ω 3 as the excitation amplitude increases the complexity of wave compositions increases at the excitation amplitude a 4 mm dominant response frequencies are 1 417hz and 2 825hz corresponding to ω 3 and corresponding to 2ω 3 at the excitation amplitude a 5 mm dominant response frequencies are 1 392hz 0 9833hz 0 5000hz and 1 867hz corresponding to ω 3 ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 ω 1 as shown in fig 3 d and e increasing excitation frequency to 2ω 4 and 2ω 5 the energy transfers to the side band near ω 4 and ω 5 in fig 3 e the side band energy appears at the frequency f 1 8000 under the excitation amplitude of 2 mm and side band energy appears at frequencies f 1 862 hz and f 1 750 under the excitation amplitude of 3 mm the distribution of energy in side band reflects the kinematic violence and strong nonlinearity of the parameter sloshing of high mode excited by excitation with high frequency 3 2 parametric sloshing in the tank with a different number of baffles vertical baffles with uniformly distributed holes were used in the experiments to suppress parametric sloshing the experiments results on the effect of baffles on parametric sloshing reveal two noteworthy and interesting findings in the experiments we first tested the dampening of one baffle on parametric sloshing and obtained our first finding it is well known that one baffle placed in the center of a tank can suppress direct sloshing however this conclusion does not hold for parametric sloshing in fig 4 one vertical baffle disposed in the tank center effectively suppresses parametric sloshing of the first fig 4 a and the third mode fig 4 c1 fig 4 c2 but fails to suppress parametric sloshing of the second fig 4 b the fourth fig 4 d and the fifth mode fig 4 e consequently two baffles and three baffles were investigated to effectively suppress parametric sloshing we use the symbol m to denote the number of baffles in the experiments with two baffles the two vertical baffles were located at one third and two thirds of the characteristic length of the tank i e d a 1 3 in the experiments with three baffles two of the threes baffles arranged at 1 3 and 2 3 of tank s length and the other one was attached to the tank center fig 1 a parametric sloshing of the second fig 4 b the fourth fig 4 d and the fifth mode fig 4 e are significantly suppressed by two baffles and three baffles the suppression effects of different numbers of baffles on mitigating sloshing were ranked from strong to weak according to the maximum value of free surface displacement at the vicinity of the tank wall from smallest to largest and were listed in table 2 in table 2 labeled threebaffles twobaffles onebaffle means that the suppression of parametric sloshing is most pronounced by three baffles and least pronounced by one baffle under the corresponding excitation so for the other interesting finding was discovered two baffles were more effective than one baffle in suppressing sloshing of the second mode see fig 4 b but not as effective as one baffle in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode see fig 4 a and c2 with respect to the damping mechanisms of baffles turner et al 2013 and xue and lin 2011 concluded that baffles suppressed sloshing through blocking the fluid motion changing the natural frequency of the fluid system inducing vortexes to enhance fluid energy dissipation however the summarized damping mechanisms of baffles do not explain the two interesting phenomena found in the experiments according to the experiments results it can be thought that baffles in our experiments do not change the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing in fig 3 of section 3 1 parametric sloshing in the clean tank is multi frequency waves with nonlinearity in fig 5 of section 3 2 the fft of the time histories of the free surface show that the components of the sloshing wave corresponding to the high mode and excitation frequency disappear due to baffles under the excitation frequency close to 2ω 5 side band energy disappear duo to baffles comparing fig 5 e with fig 3 e more specific results are described below comparing the free surface wave elevations in fig 5 b with the free surface wave elevations in the clean tank in fig 3 b where f 2 0 hz and a 4 mm two baffles fig 5 b and three baffles fig 5 b almost completely suppress the parametric sloshing therefore the liquid free surface remains stationary and the sloshing response in the frequency domain corresponding fft results disappears under the excitation the reasons for the results in fig 5 c are the same as above however under the excitation frequencies close to twice the second and the fourth natural frequency respectively one baffle placed in the tank center completely fails in suppressing sloshing as shown in figs 4 b 5 b and fig 4 d 5 d the dominant response frequencies of parametric sloshing wave include not only the natural frequency but also the double frequency fig 5 b and fig 5 d 3 3 parametric sloshing in the tank with two baffles of different positions for sloshing induced by horizontal excitation the experimental results yu et al 2019 showed a significant effect of installing position on the baffle suppression effect in section 3 2 we found two interesting phenomena one is the complete failure of one baffle in suppressing parameter sloshing of second mode and the other is that two baffles are weaker than one baffle in suppressing parameter sloshing of the first and the third modes a series of experiments were therefore conducted to investigate the effect of installing position on baffle damping in parametric sloshing according to the experimental results of parametric sloshing searching for the causes of these two phenomena and baffles that can effectively suppress parametric sloshing under a wider range of excitation based on the effect of baffle position on direct sloshing five installing positions were set up including the positon of two baffles cases in fig 4 in the suppression experiments of parametric sloshing fig 6 shows the position of the two baffles and the first five mode profiles of sloshing in a clean tank fig 7 shows the frequency response of the parameter sloshing in the tank with different baffle positions the suppression of sloshing by baffles with different positions is ranked and listed in table 3 the rule of ordering labeled as cm cn is the maximum value of free surface displacement at the wave probe from smallest to largest for example under the excitation frequency close to twice the natural frequency of the first mode position c5 d a 0 2 and position c6 d a 0 8 corresponds to as the most effective position and least effective position on suppressing parametric sloshing among the five locations tested in our experiments respectively parametric sloshing is almost completely suppressed by the two baffles with right position for example under excitation frequency close to 2ω 1 see fig 7 a and table 3 the two baffles at the position of c5 d a 0 2 and c2 d a 1 3 almost completely suppress fluid motion as shown in fig 7 and table 3 the important result is that the optimal position varies depending on the excitation that determines the sloshing mode the ordering results show that the closer the position of the baffles to the node of the sloshing mode the more powerful the damping effect of the baffles this finding cogently explains that one baffle is more effective than two baffles in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode moreover in order to provide an effective damping effect over a wide range of excitation it is recommended that baffles be placed at the node positions of various sloshing modes there are multiple nodes in sloshing of high mode in order to suppress high mode sloshing more effectively the baffles can be positioned at nodes closer to the liquid tank wall for example the position marked as c7 is more effective than c5 and the position marked as c6 is more effective than c2 on suppressing sloshing of the fourth mode this finding helps to solve the problem of the sometimes effective and sometimes ineffective of baffles on suppressing sloshing and contributes to the generality of damping mechanism and design principles of baffles this may be attributed to the fact that baffles impede the maximum fluid velocity because the fluid velocity is greatest at the node position of sloshing modes in other words baffles damping effect is greatest as baffles impedes the maximum fluid velocity in addition it may imply that the baffle location affects the baffle damping more than the energy dissipated by the vortexes etc if considering that the damping mechanisms of baffles are to block the flow movement change the sloshing natural frequency and generate more vortex to dissipate energy turner et al 2013 xue and lin 2011 xue et al 2013 then we believe that an increase in the number of baffles will result in a more significant sloshing mitigation effect while in our experiments where the excitation frequency was close to twice the natural frequency of the first sloshing mode one baffle was superior to the sloshing reduction of the two baffles thus we speculate the position of baffles has a greater effect on baffles damping than the energy dissipated by the vortexes however more quantitative effects of the different damping mechanisms need to be given to rigorously arrive at this conclusion the experimental results show that the position of baffles also does not change the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing in order to clearly show the difference in the sloshing suppression between different baffle positions free surface elevations and fft results in different tanks with baffles at different positions are presented in fig 8 the excitation frequencies are closer to natural frequencies and the excitation amplitudes are larger the baffles positions presented in fig 8 are selected according to the first three largest of the order in table 3 for example under the excitation frequency f 1 07 hz fig 8 a baffles located at positions c4 c7 and c6 are less effective than the positions c2 and c5 on parametric sloshing finally the suppression of parametric sloshing by baffles is presented quantitatively in table 4 based on equation 2 2 η η max none η max screens η max none where η max none is the maximum free surface elevation in the clean tank η max baffles is the maximum free surface elevation in the tank with baffles the five frequencies selected in table 4 are each close to twice the natural frequency of the first mode to fifth mode in addition the parameters of excitation and fft results in the experiments of baffle free fig 3 baffles with different numbers fig 5 and baffles located in different positions fig 8 are summarized in table 5 in table 5 amp 0 means that the amplitude and energy are zero at the corresponding f peak which indicates the parametric sloshing is completely suppressed under the excitation by the baffles symbol indicates that no test data is available 4 conclusions parametric sloshing is a concern in many fields including structure aircraft and marine crafts to investigate effects of vertical baffles on parametric sloshing experiments were conducted on a six degree of freedom motion platform the duration of excitation on the tank in the experiments of parametric sloshing was much longer than that in the experiments of direct sloshing in addition the range of excitation frequencies and excitation amplitudes that can excite parametric sloshing was very limited and this range was called instability region however parametric sloshing is more likely to be excited if the excitation of other degrees of freedom is applied to the liquid system in advance more importantly both even modes that do not occur in direct sloshing and odd modes can be violent under the vertical excitation in fact the dimensionless wave heights of parametric sloshing of the second mode and other higher modes are much larger than that of the first mode in contrast to horizontal baffles that failed to suppress sloshing induced by pure vertical excitation sanapala et al 2018 vertical baffles performed well in suppressing parametric sloshing however the optimal number of baffles to reduce sloshing varied depending on the mode of sloshing among the number of baffles tested in our experiments the most effective number of baffles is three and the least effective number of baffles is two in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode in suppressing sloshing of the second fourth and fifth mode the most effective number of baffles is three and the least effective number of baffles is one two noteworthy and interesting findings were revealed in the experiments one was that one baffle completely failed to suppress sloshing of the second mode the other was that one baffle performed better than two baffles in suppressing sloshing of the first and the third mode these two findings challenged the previously summarized damping mechanism of baffles as shown by the fft results baffles in our experiments did not change the natural frequencies of liquid sloshing a series of experiments were conducted varying the installing position of the two baffles the excitation frequencies in the experiments covered the first five natural frequencies of sloshing similarly the optimal position of two baffles varied depending on the mode of sloshing the dampening effect of the baffle position on sloshing of the first mode was in the order c5 d a 0 2 c2 d a 1 3 c4 d a 0 5 c7 d a 0 75 c6 d a 0 8 the order of the second mode sloshing was c4 c2 c7 c5 c6 the order of the third mode sloshing was c7 c6 c4 c5 c2 the order of the forth mode sloshing was c7 c5 c6 c2 c4 and of the fifth mode sloshing was c6 c7 c2 c4 c5 it can be concluded that the closer the position of the baffles to the sloshing mode nodes the more powerful the damping effect in addition to suppress high mode sloshing more effectively the baffles can be positioned at nodes closer to the liquid tank wall for example position marked as c7 is more effective than c5 and position marked as c6 is more effective than c2 in suppressing sloshing of the fourth mode this may be attributed to the baffle impeding the maximum velocity of the fluid the discovery of damping mechanism cogently explained the two noteworthy and interesting findings mentioned above credit authorship contribution statement

21677,pipeline embedment into a seabed has a great effect on its integrity during its installation and operation to assess the embedment accurately inelastic behavior of the seabed should be considered this paper presents feasible numerical model for the analysis of a pipeline umbilical or cable configuration in installation on inelastic seabed capturing irreversible embedment the model considers the entire pipeline as a single continuous segment and is valid for s lay j lay and reel lay techniques the numerical solution adopts finite difference discretization of the pipeline and proceeds sequentially following actual pipe lay process allowing for an efficient contact detection at each length increment a new consequent equilibrium configuration is assessed by consistent minimization of a total potential energy which allows considering non conservative and path dependent systems representative parametric study is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method the effects of seabed loading and unloading stiffnesses for varying lay tension are considered the parameter analysis has revealed that accepted static touchdown lay factor should depend on a seabed loading stiffness in a non monotonic manner the proposed model provides a less time consuming alternative to the available special purpose commercial software that imposes the use of cumbersome graphical user interface for model definition and result processing keywords finite difference method consistent energy minimization nonlinear analysis pipeline seabed interaction plastic seabed moving boundary conditions 1 introduction a design of submarine pipelines is highly affected by an interaction mechanism between the pipeline and the seabed soil randolph and white 2008 pipeline seabed interaction mechanism defines the amount of a vertical penetration of a pipeline into the seabed pipeline s horizontal displacements sideways and its axial movement as a function of an interaction contact forces between the pipeline and the seabed the slope of the interaction curves defines a seabed stiffness which in general changes with a penetration depth the observations show that while the seabed stiffness has no major direct effect on the internal forces and the global stress states within the pipeline trapper 2019 wriggers 2006 it does have a crucial effect on the pipeline embedment into the seabed dean 2010 mccarron 2011 randolph and gourvenec 2011 in fact accurately assessing pipeline embedment into the seabed during its installation and operation especially in soft submarine soils is very important since it affects lateral and axial seabed resistance pipeline on bottom lateral stability against hydrodynamic forces pipeline on bottom lateral stability against laying vessel movements sideways stability against lateral global buckling walking assessments and thermal insulation aubeny and biscontin 2009 chee et al 2019 dean 2010 mccarron 2011 palmer 2008 randolph and gourvenec 2011 randolph and white 2008 shiri 2014 consequently pipeline embedment into the seabed should be thoroughly addressed the most straightforward but also the roughest way to estimate the pipeline embedment is by dividing its submerged self weight by a seabed stiffness i e self weight embedment however the observations indicate that in reality the pipeline embedment typically appears to be deeper than the one predicted solely by the self weight bai and bai 2014 carneiro et al 2010 guo et al 2014 westgate et al 2010a 2010b 2009 the main reason for this phenomenon appears to be driven by the lay effects during the laying process pipeline becomes severely bent at the vicinity of the touch down point tdp forming there a sag bend and thus causing there extra stress concentrations as a result near the tdp the pipeline induces additional pressure on a seabed which exceeds the pipeline s submerged self weight and thus leads to a deeper embedment bai and bai 2014 dean 2010 palmer 2008 randolph and white 2008 however it was further observed that beyond the touch down zone where the front of a stress concentration zone has already moved on and the above static lay effects are no longer active the as laid embedment does not fully recover itself to pipeline s submerged self weight embedment either the reason for the later is as follows submarine soil usually exhibits inelastic irreversible behavior which leads to irrecoverable plastic embedment this indicates that though the seabed is frequently assumed as elastic in order to accurately predict pipeline embedment inelastic behavior of the seabed soil should be considered yuan et al 2014 2012 moreover cyclic loading induced by the environment causes further changes in the soil properties further contributing to the increased embedment dutta et al 2018 kim et al 2017 yu et al 2015 2013 yuan et al 2012 in order to save on the calculations in the design it is a common practice to account for those static lay effects in the assessment of an as laid embedment by simply multiplying the submerged self weight by some static touchdown lay factor bai and bai 2014 dean 2010 palmer 2008 randolph and white 2008 however this static touchdown lay factor should apparently depend on many various factors and details of lay process such as lay tension pipeline cross section geometry pipeline and seabed stiffness etc so the above empirical definition is too general and oversimplifying hu et al 2011 thus leading to wide uncertainty randolph and white 2008 the as laid embedment obtained this way in most cases will apparently deviate from the actual one on a soft seabed for example it overpredicts the embedment yu et al 2017 yuan et al 2012 in order to perform a more efficient design apparently more accurate tools for the analysis of a pipeline embedment into inelastic seabed are required in the recent years pipeline seabed interaction have been extensively studied both experimentally and numerically and a few relations which link between the vertical penetration and the vertical resistance force which also account for a more realistic seabed behavior rather than linear elastic have been proposed aubeny et al 2005 bruton et al 2008 randolph and white 2008 verley and m lund 1995 the proposed relations have been later implemented in some commercial fem software which is able to treat the problem in 3d such as offpipe orcaflex riflex etc e g gong et al 2014 jiwa et al 2017 however the use of this software usually imposes dealing with a cumbersome graphical user interface gui for a model definition and subsequently for a data processing through the design process where usually multiple simulations have to be carried out it becomes burdensome and very time consuming some packages allow creating fe models using scripted pre processors which enable batch running of parametric models and rapid iteration of model inputs e g abaqus orcaflex however it requires certain programming expertise in python environment consequently the above penetration resistance relations have been also adopted in some simpler 2d models whose aim is to provide a less time consuming alternative which avoids the use of cumbersome gui inherent to the above 3d software considering that the dominant first order effects which define a general pipe lay configuration are usually static and occur in plane lenci and callegari 2005 in the recent decades there was a variety of such models suggested both analytical e g lenci and callegari 2005 yuan et al 2014 2012 and numerical e g wang et al 2015 l z wang et al 2010 zan et al 2016 those models are usually based on a division of the pipeline into a number of segments within each one idealizing its particular structural behavior for example the suspended part is usually modeled as a cable disregarding the bending stiffness and the laid on part as a small deformation beam e g zan et al 2016 however in some proposed models the number of such segments is even higher e g l z wang et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 as a result relatively restricting assumptions regarding the continuity of internal forces between the segments have to be adopted which unfortunately do not contribute to the accuracy and limit the method s range of applicability trapper 2019 for example those models cannot automatically adapt any new loads or any geometric constraints and analyze variations in laying angle and lay tension independently as such those models are very specific to the particular laying technique s lay or j lay in fact though these laying techniques differ in the typical laying angles fig 1 typical lay tensions typical lay rates typical pipe diameters and typical water depths in which they are employed both cases can be described by the same governing equations and consequently can be analyzed with the same computational tools in order to overcome those issues trapper 2019 has presented a simple feasible numerical model for a pipe lay configuration analysis which considered the entire pipeline as a single segment undergoing large deformations considering a bending stiffness in a suspended part allowed analyzing variations in laying angle and lay tension independently of each other and made the model available for analyzing both s lay and j lay techniques the configuration at equilibrium was defined by direct minimization of a total potential energy and it was shown how the use of those energy principles may simplify the mathematical formulation of a problem however direct minimization of a total potential energy was valid only for conservative and path independent systems i e for elastic seabed only inelastic seabed behavior was out of the scope in the present paper we want to take the advantages of both the mathematical formulation and the numerical techniques used in trapper 2019 and extend them to non conservative path dependent cases i e inelastic irrecoverable seabed where particularly the proposed technique of a contact detection becomes essential the proposed model is subjected to the assumptions and the limitations as follows we consider only static planar 2d case as such all the out of plane phenomena and dynamic effects are out of the scope nevertheless soil softening due to cyclic loading induced by the environment can be considered in a simplified manner by reducing the soil stiffness through the coefficient dependent on the number of loading cycles e g yuan et al 2012 the pipeline is assumed to undergo only elastic flexural deformations axial and shear deformations are not considered at last in this paper we consider exclusively horizontal flat frictionless seabed and still water 2 methodology since we assume a seabed to be flat and leave out possible environmental loading variations structural analysis of a static configuration of a pipeline in installation becomes a stationary problem in this problem only suspended portion of a pipeline and some laid on portion beyond the tdp where the internal forces and the embedment still vary with a distance from the tdp should be analyzed however not the length of the suspended portion nor the length of the laid on one are known in advance in fact pipe lay is a consecutive process where the pipeline is gradually being released from the laying vessel and consecutively approaches the seabed i e it is predefined in advance what next material point of the pipeline will come into a contact with a seabed following this scenario will not only allow us to track the length of the pipeline in our computational domain at any instant but also to track the lengths of both the laid on and the suspended portions trapper 2019 trapper and mishal 2020 moreover setting the solution to proceed this way will also allow us to circumvent the cumbersome techniques proposed by the theory of constrained optimization which apply special algorithms to identify the active set of the equality constraints for material points to which these contact conditions should be applied nocedal and wright 2006 consequently in this paper to define a pipe lay configuration at equilibrium the solution will be carried out sequentially following the real pipe lay process e g as is also employed in the simla software sævik et al 2004 fig 2 first we set some initial configuration of a pipeline of some initial length l 0 such that it will have no more than one point in a contact with a seabed for this purpose it usually makes sense to provide a free hanging catenary shape e g kang et al 2015 trapper 2020 which will provide both the initial length of the suspended part and its configuration in terms of node angles given water depth lay tension and boundary condition at the fixed point fp dashed line in fig 2 trapper 2019 this initial configuration serves as initial estimate for numerical solution onwards for each loading step j the length of the pipeline is being increased by δ l such that l j l j 1 δ l and a new sequential equilibrium configuration is being iteratively obtained by newton raphson technique at each loading step as initial estimate serves the configuration from the previous converged length increment j 1 fig 2 at each instant the current total length of the pipe is known since it is being prescribed and the updated length of the laid on part is then being detected by testing if the next material point potential to come into contact falls beyond the water depth i e z h w the process should quit when the steady state configuration is achieved where the effect of laid end fig 2 point fp boundary conditions on the as laid embedment and the internal forces right beyond the sagbend becomes negligible while trapper 2019 have considered only an elastic seabed i e conservative path independent problem following the real pipe lay process was an efficient but not a unique way to solve the problem in contrast in the present case where the seabed deformation is irrecoverable in order to account for a plastic deformation at each material point of pipeline seabed contact domain the time history of the embedment must be considered and thus the above technique becomes essential 3 mathematical formulation the model is set up in a cartesian frame xyz with x axis oriented to the right z axis oriented downwards and y axis perpendicular to the xz plane the origin is placed at top left corner of the xz domain fig 3 we consider a pipeline of length l constrained to deform in xz plane partially suspended and partially laid on a seabed with a stiffness per unit length k s b fig 3 the pipeline is subjected to an immersed gravitational load w and lay tension p 0 applied at lift off point lop by the laying facility which propagates in x direction the pipeline configuration is described by function θ s which determines the local inclination of the pipeline centerline from x direction where s is the arc length along the pipeline centerline 0 s l the above configuration is subjected to the following boundary conditions the pipeline is restricted to move in x direction and rotate around z axis at point fp 1 x 0 0 2 θ 0 2 π and restricted to move in z direction while being rotated at fixed angle ϕ 0 around z axis at lop 3 z l 0 4 θ l 2 π ϕ 0 then the pipeline position is defined as follows 5 x s 0 s cos θ s d s 6 z s s l sin θ s d s where 1 and 3 are automatically adapted setting up model in the other frame may significantly complicate the formulation and require the definition of additional variables and constraints 3 1 consistent minimization of total potential energy in this paper we derive equations which characterize the pipeline configuration at equilibrium by minimization of a total potential energy of the system e g reddy 2015 trapper 2019 while a more widespread way in engineering to obtain the governing equations is by considering force equilibrium of a differential element of the body e g lenci and callegari 2005 l z wang et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 2012 zan et al 2016 the energy minimization approach is typically more convenient since it naturally considers all the applied loads including the point ones and changes in material or geometrical properties along the pipeline without dividing it into segments thus considering each segment separately as such it typically leads towards more straightforward mathematical expressions audoly and pomeau 2010 and consequently numerical implementation the limitation of the direct application of the above principle is that in general it is valid only for conservative systems where after the loading removal both the pipeline and the seabed return to their initial undisturbed state i e inelastic seabed deformation inelastic pipeline deformation and hydrodynamic loads are out of the scope however as we set the solution to follow the actual pipe lay process the solution is being proceeded sequentially in an incremental way as described in the previous section at each increment the length of the pipeline is being increased and a new sequential energy minimization assessment is being performed to define a new pipeline equilibrium based on a deviation from a configuration from the previous converged increment at the beginning of each increment by adding a new piece of a pipeline on one hand we supply a new amount of energy to the system and by the end of the increment on the other hand some amount of energy is dissipated in an irrecoverable deformation of the inelastic seabed since the length increment is supposed to be small it is reasonable to assume that the energy throughout the proceeding increment does not change and to update its value by calculation of the dissipated amount through the increment after the increment completion this way for each subsequent length increment we can define a new constant pseudo conservative total energy by subtracting the dissipated energy over the past increments and adding a new segment to the pipeline in order to account for the energy dissipation we shall introduce a new variable e r which is the residual embedment of the pipeline into the seabed this variable is cumulative throughout the whole course of the solution and is defined at each material point of the pipeline seabed contact domain hence let us introduce the total potential energy of the system at some instant as shown in fig 3 as follows 7 u t o t 0 l 1 2 e i d θ s d s 2 d s 0 l u s b s e s e r s d s 0 l w z s d s p 0 x l where e is the young s modulus of the pipeline material i is the moment of inertia of the pipeline cross section given by i π 4 d 2 4 d 2 t 4 u s b s e e r is the energy accumulated in deformed seabed per unit length of the pipeline in contact e s is the total pipeline embedment which is given by 8 e s e z s 0 z s h w z s h w h w z s and e r s as was already mentioned is the residual embedment which stays on once the load is completely removed and is responsible for energy dissipation considering the pipeline being filled with water in a process of the installation the submerged gravity per unit length of the pipeline is given by w ρ b g a where a π d 2 2 d 2 t 2 is the area of pipe s cross section g is an acceleration of gravity and ρ b is a submerged buoyant density of the pipe obtained by subtracting water density ρ w from the density of the pipeline s material ρ s as follows ρ b ρ s ρ w the first term in eq 7 stands for the strain energy accumulated in a deformed pipeline which due to the adopted assumptions in this paper is provided purely by bending the second term stands for the energy accumulated in the deformation of a seabed the third term stands for the gravitational energy of the pipeline and the last one stands for the potential energy associated with the lay tension p 0 3 2 seabed response the relationship between the seabed vertical resistance and the embedment in the recent years has been extensively investigated so far there are several empirical relations have been proposed typically these relations depend on a pipeline diameter pipe roughness shear strength of a seabed soil and have a form of a power law e g aubeny et al 2005 bruton et al 2008 carneiro 2014 carneiro et al 2015b 2015a 2010 randolph and white 2008 thomaz et al 2019 verley and m lund 1995 westgate et al 2012a 2010a 2010b 2009 2012b however as was shown in yuan et al 2014 2012 by assuming the shear strength to grow proportionally with a depth of a penetration the nonlinearity in those relations weakens and the resulting relation can be well linearly fitted by defining the secant loading stiffness k s l z wang et al 2010 l wang et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 2012 the unloading rebound stiffness k r which is active during the unloading and the reloading phase can be also linearly approximated in similar way yuan et al 2014 as follows in this work we shall adopt both linear loading and unloading stiffness fig 4 since there is only a fraction of the pipeline that is in contact with a seabed while the other one is being suspended and the contact domain contains loading and unloading regions the seabed stiffness function k s b s as appears in fig 4b is given piecewise as follows 9 k s b s k s b z s 0 e s e r s k r e r s e s e m a x s k s e m a x s e s where e m a x is the absolute maximum embedment that occurs at any loading stage and given by 10 e m a x s e z m a x s 0 z m a x s h w z m a x s h w h w z m a x s where z m a x is the absolute maximum pipeline displacement along the pipeline in z direction throughout the whole progress of the solution the relation presented in fig 4 supposes linear relation between e r and e m a x as follows 11 e r s 1 k s k r e m a x s the seabed vertical resistance per unit length is given by 12 r s s 0 e s e r s k r e s e r s e r s e s e m a x k s e s e m a x s e s s where seabed resistance at as laid part is r s w and the seabed energy per unit

is defined all the embedments as shown in fig 4b the self weight embedment the maximum embedment the residual embedment and the as laid embedment can be respectively obtained as follows 14 e w s w k s 15 e m a x s r s m a x s k s 16 e r s 1 k s k r r s m a x s k s 17 e s w k r 1 k s 1 k r r s m a x s 3 3 back calculation of internal forces as soon as θ s is defined bending moments shear forces and tension can be back calculated by means of the following relations 18 m s e i d θ s d s 19 s s d m s d s 20 d t s d s w sin θ s 4 numerical implementation 4 1 finite difference discretization for the given problem we adopt the finite difference method we discretize pipeline with n subintervals of size δ s l n and n 1 nodes fig 5 node positions of the pipeline are obtained by writing eqs 5 and 6 as left riemann sums 21 x i j 1 i 1 cos θ j δ s 22 z i j i n sin θ j δ s a discretized potential energy of the pipeline is obtained by writing eq 7 in a similar way 23 u t o t δ s i 1 n 1 2 e i θ i 1 θ i

follows 25 e i z i h w z i h w 0 z i h w thus only nodes in contact with a seabed can have nonzero embedment for those in contact we define two additional node variables e m a x i which is a node maximum embedment into the seabed and e r i which is a node residual embedment 26 e r i 1 k s k r e m a x i further we define the node seabed stiffness end effective residual embedment respectively as

length of the pipeline is being increased by δ s i e l m l m 1 δ s and thus are growing the dimensions of the system n m n m 1 1 the system 30 31 35 given for the increment m in a matrix form is as follows 36 k θ m f θ m 0 then 36 is being solved iteratively by newton raphson method nocedal and wright 2006 linearizing 36 for iteration n as follows 37 k d f d θ θ m n 1 δ θ m n k θ m n 1 f θ m n 1 with 38 θ m n θ m n 1 δ θ m n as initial estimate serves the converged solution from the previous increment θ m 0 θ m 1 then 37 38 is being solved repeatedly until the convergence criterion for δ θ m

parameter analysis the validation of the proposed method with abaqus dassault systems 2016 for the case with elastic seabed was presented in trapper 2019 in what follows we present the finite difference grid convergence analysis for inelastic seabed and then parameter analysis all the computations within the proposed method are performed with matlab in all the simulations the basic selection of parameters is as presented in table 1 the pipeline dimensions and materials were selected following lenci and callegari 2005 other parameters were picked up within ranges proposed by bai and bai 2014 guo et al 2014 randolph and gourvenec 2011 the quantities considered in the following subsections are illustrated in fig 6 for a more convenient representation of the results we shall introduce two additional abscissas both are opposite to the global x orientation x l o p determined from lop and x t d p determined from tdp fig 6 5 1 convergence analysis first we analyze the convergence of the proposed method through the basic set of parameters as presented in table 1 the loading stiffness k s is set to 4 kn m2 while the unloading stiffness is set to k r 6 k s for the sake of comparison in all the simulations a pipeline of a total length of 836 m was selected the effects of finite difference grid density on the embedment bending moments shear forces and tension are tested the plots of embedment bending moments shear forces and tension at the entire tested pipeline domain for different grid densities are shown in fig 7 a b c d respectively fig 7 shows that the highest errors in all the considered quantities appear at their maximum values consequently we shall test the convergence of maximum solution values fig 8 shows the convergence of maximum values of those variables vs number of subintervals it can be seen that all the tested variables with a grid refinement asymptotically converge from the below to definite values while maximum errors for bending moments and shear forces take place at lop for tension they occur about 50 m away towards tdp fig 6 in order to quantify the convergence for all those tested variables we adopt the solution with the finest grid δ s 0 5 m to serve as a reference solution and compare to it the solutions with other grids the maximum errors of the solution for various grids relatively to reference solution δ s 0 5 m are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that all the force variables have errors from 11 to 7 for δ s 8 m and 0 7 to 0 5 for δ s 1 m on the other hand the errors for the maximum embedment are much smaller from about 0 3 for δ s 8 m to 0 005 for δ s 1 m 5 2 parameter analysis further we bring the parameter analysis the basic selection of the parameters is as appears in table 1 at each series we modify values of only one specific parameter the aim of this study is to show a general feasibility of the suggested method and indicate on the general trends rather than supply specific design values consequently since the parameter analysis presented in this paper is by no means comprehensive the conclusions brought up in the following subsections are referred exclusively to the selected parameter ranges in this paper we shall concentrate on a response of the inelastic seabed and particularly we shall consider the effects of seabed loading and unloading stiffnesses 5 2 1 effect of a seabed loading stiffness in this series we perform a set of nine simulations for different seabed stiffness k s 2 kn m2 3 kn m2 4 kn m2 6 kn m2 8 kn m2 12 kn m2 16 kn m2 20 kn m2 and 32 kn m2 the ranges are as used in yuan et al 2014 2012 the unloading rebound seabed stiffness k r in all the simulations remains constant and is set to 32 kn m2 fig 9 other parameters used in this series also remain constant and as given in table 1 fig 10 a b c d show the configuration bending moments shear forces and axial tension for different seabed loading stiffness it can be seen that all the curves are almost identical this indicates that as in a case with an elastic seabed trapper 2019 for a plastic seabed the internal forces within the pipeline are practically insensitive to a seabed loading stiffness fig 11 a b c d show that as a seabed stiffness rises from 2 kn m2 to 32 kn m2 the maximum values of all the above mentioned internal forces vary by less than 0 03 horizontal distance between lop and tdp l l o p t d p fig 11f though grows by 0 12 for p 0 1 106 n and by 0 096 for p 0 3 106 n fig 11a b c d e also show that with a rise in a loading stiffness its effect on all the monitored maximum values slows down fig 12 a depicts a plot of seabed vertical resistance for different seabed loading stiffness k s it can be seen that near the tdp the seabed resistance is maximal while beyond that zone it drops to pipeline s submerged self weight it can be also seen that the growth in the seabed loading stiffness leads to the growth in the maximum seabed resistance while as softer the seabed the effect of sagbend becomes less substantial and the vertical resistance along the whole laid on part approaches the self weight fig 12b however the zone where the resistance exceeds the self weight becomes longer fig 12a fig 12c presents an amplification factor for maximum seabed vertical resistance relative to pipeline submerged self weight e m a x e w it can be seen that for softer seabed this ratio is low whilst for stiffer seabed it becomes higher however the above ratio strongly depends on a magnitude of lay tension force for low tension it can double the submerged self weight the amplification factor can be reduced by increasing the lay tension fig 13 a shows the plots of the pipeline embedment full lines and submerged self weight embedment dotted lines for different seabed loading stiffness k s maximum embedment e m a x as laid embedment e and self weight embedment e w all exponentially drop with growing seabed loading stiffness fig 13b it can be seen that for lower seabed loading stiffness as laid embedment e approaches e m a x while for its higher values it approaches the self weight one e w fig 13b can be alternatively represented by scaling the x coordinate as k r k s where k r is still constant for varying k s fig 13c shows the plots of maximum embedment e m a x as laid embedment e and self weight embedment e w versus normalized values of unloading seabed stiffness k r k s for different lay tension values it can be seen that e w e m a x and e are all nearly reversely proportional to k s it can be also clearly seen that the increase in the lay tension results in a lower embedment in order to study the effect of seabed stiffness in a more explicit way it is useful to look at the normalized values of the embedment first we normalize the embedment with its as laid value e e fig 14 a it is clearly seen that higher loading stiffness k s leads to a deeper maximum embedment e m a x relative to an as laid one e fig 14b shows that e m a x e exponentially grows with k s and also has higher values and more rapid growth for a lower lay tension however it is more useful to normalize the embedment with the self weight embedment e e w since e w can straightforwardly be obtained by dividing the self weight by the loading stiffness e w w k s the above relation e e w is equivalent to the static touchdown lay factor bai and bai 2014 dean 2010 palmer 2008 randolph and white 2008 it can be clearly seen that both k s and p 0 affect this value fig 14c shows the plots of the embedments normalized with submerged self weight embedment for different seabed stiffness k s plotting normalized maximum and as laid embedments vs k s fig 14d reveals that while normalized maximum embedment e m a x e w full line grows with growing k s the normalized as laid embedment e e w dashed line first grows from k s 2 kn m 2 to k s 8 kn m 2 and then drops down for example as appears in fig 14c the normalized as laid embedment e e w for k s 4 kn m 2 red line and the one for k s 16 kn m 2 violet line are almost identical while their normalized maximum embedments significantly vary to demonstrate this point let us present the loading unloading scheme for the as laid embedment for k s 4 kn m 2 red line and k s 16 kn m 2 violet line on the same plot fig 15 for the sake of convenience in fig 15 it is useful to present the x coordinate in a normalized form e e w then the loading stiffness for both cases becomes nearly identical k s k s e w 4 2 16 0 5 dashed black line on the other hand the unloading stiffness which in reality is identical in both cases on the scaled axis becomes k r 4 k r e w 32 2 for k s 4 kn m 2 red line and k r 16 k r e w 32 0 5 for k s 16 kn m 2 violet line the maximum values of seabed resistance for both cases can be extracted from fig 20c r s m a x 4 1 4 w and r s m a x 16 1 7 w then after unloading back to submerged self weight w e e w in both cases approaches nearly the same value the reason for this phenomenon is that the as laid embedment among the other factors depends on the seabed loading stiffness and the prior maximum embedment the later though implicitly also depends on the former on one hand while the seabed loading stiffness grows the embedment is expected to drop fig 13b however on the other hand higher seabed stiffness leads to a higher pressure on a seabed near the tdp and thus to a higher maximum normalized embedment which in its turn leads to the increase in the consequent irrecoverable normalized as laid embedment for lower k s values up to 8 kn m 2 e m a x e w grows faster and the later factor is more dominant while for higher k s values over 8 kn m 2 k s itself becomes more dominant this leads towards the conclusion that the static touchdown lay factor which is usually being empirically defined should be a non monotonic function of a loading stiffness 5 2 2 effect of a seabed unloading stiffness in this series we perform a set of five simulations for different seabed unloading stiffness 4 kn m2 8 kn m2 24 kn m2 40 kn m2 and 400 kn m2 the loading seabed stiffness in all the simulations remains constant and is set to 4 kn m2 fig 16 other parameters adopted for this series remain constant as given in table 1 fig 17 a b c d present the configuration bending moments shear forces and axial tension for different seabed unloading stiffness it can be seen that all the curves as in the case with the loading stiffness are almost identical this indicates that the internal forces within the pipeline in fact are practically insensitive to a seabed unloading stiffness as well fig 18 a b c d show that as seabed unloading stiffness rises from 4 kn m2 to 400 kn m2 the maximum values of all the internal forces and the horizontal distance between lop and tdp l l o p t d p fig 8f vary by less than 0 23 fig 18a b c d also indicate that for all those variables with a rise in a loading stiffness its effect on all the monitored maximum values slows down fig 19 a depicts the plot of a seabed vertical resistance for various values of unloading stiffness k r it can be seen that higher unloading stiffness k r leads to higher values of maximum resistance which though becomes more localized near the tdp as k r grows the rate of the resistance growth slows down fig 19b fig 19c shows the maximum seabed resistance normalized with a self weight the amplification factor r m a x w vs k r for various values of lay tension it can be seen that for higher values of a lay tension the maximum seabed resistance becomes lower and tends to approach the pipeline s submerged self weight fig 20a presents the embedment of a pipeline into the seabed for different values of the unloading stiffness k r since for all the cases the loading stiffness k s is identical the self weight embedment for all the cases is identical either it can be seen that when the unloading stiffness k r is equal to the seabed loading stiffness k r k s 4 kn m 2 i e the seabed is purely elastic the as laid embedment of the pipeline is equal to the pipeline submerged self weight embedment dotted black line on the other hand when unloading stiffness is very high e g k r 400 kn m 2 the embedment becomes nearly fully irrecoverable perfectly plastic and as a result the as laid embedment approaches the maximum embedment it is also shown that in the inelastic cases both the maximum embedment and the as laid embedment are deeper than in the elastic case and grow with growing unloading stiffness fig 20b fig 20b presents both maximum full lines and as laid dashed lines embedments vs unloading stiffness k r for different values of lay tension it can be seen that though both the maximum and the as laid embedments grow with growth in unloading stiffness the rate of the growth slows down as the values of k r become higher moreover for higher lay tension both the maximum and the as laid embedment tend to their self weight values it is also useful to take a look at the normalized curves e e w fig 20c and d it can be seen that the highest ratio of the maximum embedment to the self weight one e m a x e w is for the elastic seabed k r k s 4 kn m 2 while the lowest e m a x e w 1 is for the one close to perfectly plastic k r 400 kn m 2 by increasing lay tension from p 0 1 106 n to p 0 3 106 n e m a x e w rises by nearly 30 fig 20d fig 20e shows the embedment normalized with the as laid embedment e m a x e vs unloading seabed stiffness k r for different values of lay tension it can be seen that the embedment ratio for maximal values decays exponentially as the values of k r become higher fig 20f moreover while for lower values of k r lower tension leads to much higher embedment for higher k r the gaps in the results for different lay tension decay and all the embedments approach their as laid values the obtained results also indicate that apart from the as laid embedment on all the other monitored variables the effect of unloading stiffness is lower than the effect of the loading one 6 conclusions feasible numerical method for an analysis of a pipeline configuration in installation on an inelastic seabed capturing irreversible embedment is presented the method considers the entire pipeline as a single segment and is available for both s lay and j lay techniques the numerical solution is proceeded sequentially in an incremental way following the actual pipe lay process thus also allowing for the efficient contact detection the configuration at equilibrium is assessed by consistent minimization of a total potential energy of the system thus extending the technique presented earlier in trapper 2019 available only for conservative path independent systems to non conservative and path dependent cases which include the inelastic seabed all the advantages of a former technique such as generality and simplicity in the mathematical formulation and the derivations have been preserved moreover for non conservative cases such as inelastic seabed the presented technique of contact detection becomes even more essential only elastic flexural deformations of the pipeline are considered the proposed model is limited to a static planar 2d case with a horizontal flat frictionless seabed nevertheless soil softening due to cyclic loading induced by the environment can be considered in a simplified manner by reducing the soil stiffness through the coefficient dependent on the number of loading cycles e g yuan et al 2012 the parameter analysis presented in this paper has revealed that the accepted static touchdown lay factor which is widely used in a design should be a non monotonic function of a loading stiffness i e grow up to some loading stiffness value and then drop down moreover this factor should also apparently depend on a lay tension and on a seabed stiffness the other outcomes of the parameter analysis can be summarized as follow 1 both seabed loading and unloading stiffnesses though highly affect the pipeline embedment into the seabed do not have a substantial effect on the internal forces within the pipeline 2 by manipulating the lay tension we can control the values of internal forces and the embedment increase in the lay tension leads to lower embedments lower shear forces and lower bending moments though to a higher internal tension with the increase in the lay tension all the embedments tend to their values solely due to their submerged self weight 3 higher seabed stiffness both loading and unloading lead to a higher but a more localized maximal vertical seabed resistance 4 due to static lay effects the inelastic seabed causes deeper maximum and deeper as laid embedments than the elastic one consequently considering a purely elastic seabed as is often being assumed leads to underestimated embedments in order to accurately assess pipeline embedment inelastic seabed behavior of the seabed soil should be considered 5 while with a growth in a loading stiffness maximum embedment drops growth in an unloading stiffness leads to a growth in both maximum and as laid embedments 6 the obtained results also indicate that on most of the monitored variables apart from the as laid embedment the effect of the unloading stiffness is lower than the one of the loading stiffness the proposed technique presents a less time consuming alternative to the available

21677,pipeline embedment into a seabed has a great effect on its integrity during its installation and operation to assess the embedment accurately inelastic behavior of the seabed should be considered this paper presents feasible numerical model for the analysis of a pipeline umbilical or cable configuration in installation on inelastic seabed capturing irreversible embedment the model

minimization of a total potential energy which allows considering non conservative and path dependent systems representative parametric study is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method the effects of seabed loading and unloading stiffnesses for varying lay tension are considered the parameter analysis has revealed that accepted static touchdown lay factor should depend on a seabed loading stiffness in a non monotonic manner the proposed model provides a less time consuming alternative to the available special purpose commercial software that imposes the use of cumbersome graphical user interface for model definition and result processing keywords finite difference method consistent energy minimization nonlinear analysis pipeline seabed interaction plastic seabed moving boundary conditions 1 introduction a design of submarine pipelines is highly affected by an interaction mechanism between the pipeline and the seabed soil randolph and white 2008 pipeline seabed interaction mechanism defines the amount of a vertical penetration of a pipeline into the seabed pipeline s horizontal displacements sideways and its axial movement as a function of an interaction contact forces between the pipeline and the seabed the slope of the interaction curves defines a seabed stiffness which in general changes with a penetration depth the observations show that while the seabed stiffness has no major direct effect on the internal forces and the global stress states within the pipeline trapper 2019 wriggers 2006 it does have a crucial effect on the pipeline embedment into the seabed dean 2010 mccarron 2011 randolph and gourvenec 2011 in fact accurately assessing pipeline embedment into the seabed during its installation and operation especially in soft submarine soils is very important since it affects lateral and axial seabed resistance pipeline on bottom lateral stability against hydrodynamic forces pipeline on bottom lateral stability against laying vessel movements sideways stability against lateral global buckling walking assessments and thermal insulation aubeny and biscontin 2009 chee et al 2019 dean 2010 mccarron 2011 palmer 2008 randolph and gourvenec 2011 randolph and white 2008 shiri 2014 consequently pipeline embedment into the seabed should be thoroughly addressed the most straightforward but also the roughest way to estimate the pipeline embedment is by dividing its submerged self weight by a seabed stiffness i e self weight embedment however the observations indicate that in reality the pipeline embedment typically appears to be deeper than the one predicted solely by the self weight bai and bai 2014 carneiro et al 2010 guo et al 2014 westgate et al 2010a 2010b 2009 the main reason for this phenomenon appears to be driven by the lay effects during the laying process pipeline becomes severely bent at the vicinity of the touch down point tdp forming there a sag bend and thus causing there extra stress concentrations as a result near the tdp the pipeline induces additional pressure on a seabed which exceeds the pipeline s submerged self weight and thus leads to a deeper embedment bai and bai 2014 dean 2010 palmer 2008 randolph and white 2008 however it was further observed that beyond the touch down zone where the front of a stress concentration zone has already moved on and the above static lay effects are no longer active the as laid embedment does not fully recover itself to pipeline s submerged self weight embedment either the reason for the later is as follows submarine soil usually exhibits inelastic irreversible behavior which leads to irrecoverable plastic embedment this indicates that though the seabed is frequently assumed as elastic in order to accurately predict pipeline embedment inelastic behavior of the seabed soil should be considered yuan et al 2014 2012 moreover cyclic loading induced by the environment causes further changes in the soil properties further contributing to the increased embedment dutta et al 2018 kim et al 2017 yu et al 2015 2013 yuan et al 2012 in order to save on the calculations in the design it is a common practice to account for those static lay effects in the assessment of an as laid embedment by simply multiplying the submerged self weight by some static touchdown lay factor bai and bai 2014 dean 2010 palmer 2008 randolph and white 2008 however this static touchdown lay factor should apparently depend on many various factors and details of lay process such as lay tension pipeline cross section geometry pipeline and seabed stiffness etc so the above empirical definition is too general and oversimplifying hu et al 2011 thus leading to wide uncertainty randolph and white 2008 the as laid embedment obtained this way in most cases will apparently deviate from the actual one on a soft seabed for example it overpredicts the embedment yu et al 2017 yuan et al 2012 in order to perform a more efficient design apparently more accurate tools for the analysis of a pipeline embedment into inelastic seabed are required in the recent years pipeline seabed interaction have been extensively studied both experimentally and numerically and a few relations which link between the vertical penetration and the vertical resistance force which also account for a more realistic seabed behavior rather than linear elastic have been proposed aubeny et al 2005 bruton et al 2008 randolph and white 2008 verley and m lund 1995 the proposed relations have been later implemented in some commercial fem software which is able to treat the problem in 3d such as offpipe orcaflex riflex etc e g gong et al 2014 jiwa et al 2017 however the use of this software usually imposes dealing with a cumbersome graphical user interface gui for a model definition and subsequently for a data processing through the design process where usually multiple simulations have to be carried out it becomes burdensome and very time consuming some packages allow creating fe models using scripted pre processors which enable batch running of parametric models and rapid iteration of model inputs e g abaqus orcaflex however it requires certain programming expertise in python environment consequently the above penetration resistance relations have been also adopted in some simpler 2d models whose aim is to provide a less time consuming alternative which avoids the use of cumbersome gui inherent to the above 3d software considering that the dominant first order effects which define a general pipe lay configuration are usually static and occur in plane lenci and callegari 2005 in the recent decades there was a variety of such models suggested both analytical e g lenci and callegari 2005 yuan et al 2014 2012 and numerical e g wang et al 2015 l z wang et al 2010 zan et al 2016 those models are usually based on a division of the pipeline into a number of segments within each one idealizing its particular structural behavior for example the suspended part is usually modeled as a cable disregarding the bending stiffness and the laid on part as a small deformation beam e g zan et al 2016 however in some proposed models the number of such segments is even higher e g l z wang et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 as a result relatively restricting assumptions regarding the continuity of internal forces between the segments have to be adopted which unfortunately do not contribute to the accuracy and limit the method s range of applicability trapper 2019 for example those models cannot automatically adapt any new loads or any geometric constraints and analyze variations in laying angle and lay tension independently as such those models are very specific to the particular laying technique s lay or j lay in fact though these laying techniques differ in the typical laying angles fig 1 typical lay tensions typical lay rates typical pipe diameters and typical water depths in which they are employed both cases can be described by the same governing equations and consequently can be analyzed with the same computational tools in order to overcome those issues trapper 2019 has presented a simple feasible numerical model for a pipe lay configuration analysis which considered the entire pipeline as a single segment undergoing large deformations considering a bending stiffness in a suspended part allowed analyzing variations in laying angle and lay tension independently of each other and made the model available for analyzing both s lay and j lay techniques the configuration at equilibrium was defined by direct minimization of a total potential energy and it was shown how the use of those energy principles may simplify the mathematical formulation of a problem however direct minimization of a total potential energy was valid only for conservative and path independent systems i e for elastic seabed only inelastic seabed behavior was out of the scope in the present paper we want to take the advantages of both the mathematical formulation and the numerical techniques used in trapper 2019 and extend them to non conservative path dependent cases i e inelastic irrecoverable seabed where particularly the proposed technique of a contact detection becomes essential the proposed model is subjected to the assumptions and the limitations as follows we consider only static planar 2d case as such all the out of plane phenomena and dynamic effects are out of the scope nevertheless soil softening due to cyclic loading induced by the environment can be considered in a simplified manner by reducing the soil stiffness through the coefficient dependent on the number of loading cycles e g yuan et al 2012 the pipeline is assumed to undergo only elastic flexural deformations axial and shear deformations are not considered at last in this paper we consider exclusively horizontal flat frictionless seabed and still water 2 methodology since we assume a seabed to be flat and leave out possible environmental loading variations structural analysis of a static configuration of a pipeline in installation becomes a stationary problem in this problem only suspended portion of a pipeline and some laid on portion beyond the tdp where the internal forces and the embedment still vary with a distance from the tdp should be analyzed however not the length of the suspended portion nor the length of the laid on one are known in advance in fact pipe lay is a consecutive process where the pipeline is gradually being released from the laying vessel and consecutively approaches the seabed i e it is predefined in advance what next material point of the pipeline will come into a contact with a seabed following this scenario will not only allow us to track the length of the pipeline in our computational domain at any instant but also to track the lengths of both the laid on and the suspended portions trapper 2019 trapper and mishal 2020 moreover setting the solution to proceed this way will also allow us to circumvent the cumbersome techniques proposed by the theory of constrained optimization which apply special algorithms to identify the active set of the equality constraints for material points to which these contact conditions should be applied nocedal and wright 2006 consequently in this paper to define a pipe lay configuration at equilibrium the solution will be carried out sequentially following the real pipe lay process e g as is also employed in the simla software sævik et al 2004 fig 2 first we set some initial configuration of a pipeline of some initial length l 0 such that it will have no more than one point in a contact with a seabed for this purpose it usually makes sense to provide a free hanging catenary shape e g kang et al 2015 trapper 2020 which will provide both the initial length of the suspended part and its configuration in terms of node angles given water depth lay tension and boundary condition at the fixed point fp dashed line in fig 2 trapper 2019 this initial configuration serves as initial estimate for numerical solution onwards for each loading step j the length of the pipeline is being increased by δ l such that l j l j 1 δ l and a new sequential equilibrium configuration is being iteratively obtained by newton raphson technique at each loading step as initial estimate serves the configuration from the previous converged length increment j 1 fig 2 at each instant the current total length of the pipe is known since it is being prescribed and the updated length of the laid on part is then being detected by testing if the next material point potential to come into contact falls beyond the water depth i e z h w the process should quit when the steady state configuration is achieved where the effect of laid end fig 2 point fp boundary conditions on the as laid embedment and the internal forces right beyond the sagbend becomes negligible while trapper 2019 have considered only an elastic seabed i e conservative path independent problem following the real pipe lay process was an efficient but not a unique way to solve the problem in contrast in the present case where the seabed deformation is irrecoverable in order to account for a plastic deformation at each material point of pipeline seabed contact domain the time history of the embedment must be considered and thus the above technique becomes essential 3 mathematical formulation the model is set up in a cartesian frame xyz with x axis oriented to the right z axis oriented downwards and y axis perpendicular to the xz plane the origin is placed at top left corner of the xz domain fig 3 we consider a pipeline of length l constrained to deform in xz plane partially suspended and partially laid on a seabed with a stiffness per unit length k s b fig 3 the pipeline is subjected to an immersed gravitational load w and lay tension p 0 applied at lift off point lop by the laying facility which propagates in x direction the pipeline configuration is described by function θ s which determines the local inclination of the pipeline centerline from x direction where s is the arc length along the pipeline centerline 0 s l the above configuration is subjected to the following boundary conditions the pipeline is restricted to move in x direction and rotate around z axis at point fp 1 x 0 0 2 θ 0 2 π and restricted to move in z direction while being rotated at fixed angle ϕ 0 around z axis at lop 3 z l 0 4 θ l 2 π ϕ 0 then the pipeline position is defined as follows 5 x s 0 s cos θ s d s 6 z s s l sin θ s d s where 1 and 3 are automatically adapted setting up model in the other frame may significantly complicate the formulation and require the definition of additional variables and constraints 3 1 consistent minimization of total potential energy in this paper we derive equations which characterize the pipeline configuration at equilibrium by minimization of a total potential energy of the system e g reddy 2015 trapper 2019 while a more widespread way in engineering to obtain the governing equations is by considering force equilibrium of a differential element of the body e g lenci and callegari 2005 l z wang et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 2012 zan et al 2016 the energy minimization approach is typically more convenient since it naturally considers all the applied loads including the point ones and changes in material or geometrical properties along the pipeline without dividing it into segments thus considering each segment separately as such it typically leads towards more straightforward mathematical expressions audoly and pomeau 2010 and consequently numerical implementation the limitation of the direct application of the above principle is that in general it is valid only for conservative systems where after the loading removal both the pipeline and the seabed return to their initial undisturbed state i e inelastic seabed deformation inelastic pipeline deformation and hydrodynamic loads are out of the scope however as we set the solution to follow the actual pipe lay process the solution is being proceeded sequentially in an incremental way as described in the previous section at each increment the length of the pipeline is being increased and a new sequential energy minimization assessment is being performed to define a new pipeline equilibrium based on a deviation from a configuration from the previous converged increment at the beginning of each increment by adding a new piece of a pipeline on one hand we supply a new amount of energy to the system and by the end of the increment on the other hand some amount of energy is dissipated in an irrecoverable deformation of the inelastic seabed since the length increment is supposed to be small it is reasonable to assume that the energy throughout the proceeding increment does not change and to update its value by calculation of the dissipated amount through the increment after the increment completion this way for each subsequent length increment we can define a new constant pseudo conservative total energy by subtracting the dissipated energy over the past increments and adding a new segment to the pipeline in order to account for the energy dissipation we shall introduce a new variable e r which is the residual embedment of the pipeline into the seabed this variable is cumulative throughout the whole course of the solution and is defined at each material point of the pipeline seabed contact domain hence let us introduce the total potential energy of the system at some instant as shown in fig 3 as follows 7 u t o t 0 l 1 2 e i d θ s d s 2 d s 0 l u s b s e s e r s d s 0 l w z s d s p 0 x l where e is the young s modulus of the pipeline material i is the moment of inertia of the pipeline cross section given by i π 4 d 2 4 d 2 t 4 u s b s e e r is the energy accumulated in deformed seabed per unit length of the pipeline in contact e s is the total pipeline embedment which is given by 8 e s e z s 0 z s h w z s h w h w z s and e r s as was already mentioned is the residual embedment which stays on once the load is completely removed and is responsible for energy dissipation considering the pipeline being filled with water in a process of the installation the submerged gravity per unit length of the pipeline is given by w ρ b g a where a π d 2 2 d 2 t 2 is the area of pipe s cross section g is an acceleration of gravity and ρ b is a submerged buoyant density of the pipe obtained by subtracting water density ρ w from the density of the pipeline s material ρ s as follows ρ b ρ s ρ w the first term in eq 7 stands for the strain energy accumulated in a deformed pipeline which due to the adopted assumptions in this paper is provided purely by bending the second term stands for the energy accumulated in the deformation of a seabed the third term stands for the gravitational energy of the pipeline and the last one stands for the potential energy associated with the lay tension p 0 3 2 seabed response the relationship between the seabed vertical resistance and the embedment in the recent years has been extensively investigated so far there are several empirical relations have been proposed typically these relations depend on a pipeline diameter pipe roughness shear strength of a seabed soil and have a form of a power law e g aubeny et al 2005 bruton et al 2008 carneiro 2014 carneiro et al 2015b 2015a 2010 randolph and white 2008 thomaz et al 2019 verley and m lund 1995 westgate et al 2012a 2010a 2010b 2009 2012b however as was shown in yuan et al 2014 2012 by assuming the shear strength to grow proportionally with a depth of a penetration the nonlinearity in those relations weakens and the resulting relation can be well linearly fitted by defining the secant loading stiffness k s l z wang et al 2010 l wang et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 2012 the unloading rebound stiffness k r which is active during the unloading and the reloading phase can be also linearly approximated in similar way yuan et al 2014 as follows in this work we shall adopt both linear loading and unloading stiffness fig 4 since there is only a fraction of the pipeline that is in contact with a seabed while the other one is being suspended and the contact domain contains loading and unloading regions the seabed stiffness function k s b s as appears in fig 4b is given piecewise as follows 9 k s b s k s b z s 0 e s e r s k r e r s e s e m a x s k s e m a x s e s where e m a x is the absolute maximum embedment that occurs at any loading stage and given by 10 e m a x s e z m a x s 0 z m a x s h w z m a x s h w h w z m a x s where z m a x is the absolute maximum pipeline displacement along the pipeline in z direction throughout the whole progress of the solution the relation presented in fig 4 supposes linear relation between e r and e m a x as follows 11 e r s 1 k s k r e m a x s the seabed vertical resistance per unit length is given by 12 r s s 0 e s e r s k r e s e r s e r s e s e m a x k s e s e m a x s e s s where seabed resistance at as laid part is r s w and the seabed energy per unit

is defined all the embedments as shown in fig 4b the self weight embedment the maximum embedment the residual embedment and the as laid embedment can be respectively obtained as follows 14 e w s w k s 15 e m a x s r s m a x s k s 16 e r s 1 k s k r r s m a x s k s 17 e s w k r 1 k s 1 k r r s m a x s 3 3 back calculation of internal forces as soon as θ s is defined bending moments shear forces and tension can be back calculated by means of the following relations 18 m s e i d θ s d s 19 s s d m s d s 20 d t s d s w sin θ s 4 numerical implementation 4 1 finite difference discretization for the given problem we adopt the finite difference method we discretize pipeline with n subintervals of size δ s l n and n 1 nodes fig 5 node positions of the pipeline are obtained by writing eqs 5 and 6 as

parameter analysis the validation of the proposed method with abaqus dassault systems 2016 for the case with elastic seabed was presented in trapper 2019 in what follows we present the finite difference grid convergence analysis for inelastic seabed and then parameter analysis all the computations within the proposed method are performed with matlab in all the simulations the basic selection of parameters is as presented in table 1 the pipeline dimensions and materials were selected following lenci and callegari 2005 other parameters were picked up within ranges proposed by bai and bai 2014 guo et al 2014 randolph and gourvenec 2011 the quantities considered in the following subsections are illustrated in fig 6 for a more convenient representation of the results we shall introduce two additional abscissas both are opposite to the global x orientation x l o p determined from lop and x t d p determined from tdp fig 6 5 1 convergence analysis first we analyze the convergence of the proposed method through the basic set of parameters as presented in table 1 the loading stiffness k s is set to 4 kn m2 while the unloading stiffness is set to k r 6 k s for the sake of comparison in all the simulations a pipeline of a total length of 836 m was selected the effects of finite difference grid density on the embedment bending moments shear forces and tension are tested the plots of embedment bending moments shear forces and tension at the entire tested pipeline domain for different grid densities are shown in fig 7 a b c d respectively fig 7 shows that the highest errors in all the considered quantities appear at their maximum values consequently we shall test the convergence of maximum solution values fig 8 shows the convergence of maximum values of those variables vs number of subintervals it can be seen that all the tested variables with a grid refinement asymptotically converge from the below to definite values while maximum errors for bending moments and shear forces take place at lop for tension they occur about 50 m away towards tdp fig 6 in order to quantify the convergence for all those tested variables we adopt the solution with the finest grid δ s 0 5 m to serve as a reference solution and compare to it the solutions with other grids the maximum errors of the solution for various grids relatively to reference solution δ s 0 5 m are summarized in table 2 it can be seen that all the force variables have errors from 11 to 7 for δ s 8 m and 0 7 to 0 5 for δ s 1 m on the other hand the errors for the maximum embedment are much smaller from about 0 3 for δ s 8 m to 0 005 for δ s 1 m 5 2 parameter analysis further we bring the parameter analysis the basic selection of the parameters is as appears in table 1 at each series we modify values of only one specific parameter the aim of this study is to show a general feasibility of the suggested method and indicate on the general trends rather than supply specific design values consequently since the parameter analysis presented in this paper is by no means comprehensive the conclusions brought up in the following subsections are referred exclusively to the selected parameter ranges in this paper we shall concentrate on a response of the inelastic seabed and particularly we shall consider the effects of seabed loading and unloading stiffnesses 5 2 1 effect of a seabed loading stiffness in this series we perform a set of nine simulations for different seabed stiffness k s 2 kn m2 3 kn m2 4 kn m2 6 kn m2 8 kn m2 12 kn m2 16 kn m2 20 kn m2 and 32 kn m2 the ranges are as used in yuan et al 2014 2012 the unloading rebound seabed stiffness k r in all the simulations remains constant and is set to 32 kn m2 fig 9 other parameters used in this series also remain constant and as given in table 1 fig 10 a b c d show the configuration bending moments shear forces and axial tension for different seabed loading stiffness it can be seen that all the curves are almost identical this indicates that as in a case with an elastic seabed trapper 2019 for a plastic seabed the internal forces within the pipeline are practically insensitive to a seabed loading stiffness fig 11 a b c d show that as a seabed stiffness rises from 2 kn m2 to 32 kn m2 the maximum values of all the above mentioned internal forces vary by less than 0 03 horizontal distance between lop and tdp l l o p t d p fig 11f though grows by 0 12 for p 0 1 106 n and by 0 096 for p 0 3 106 n fig 11a b c d e also show that with a rise in a loading stiffness its effect on all the monitored maximum values slows down fig 12 a depicts a plot of seabed vertical resistance for different seabed loading stiffness k s it can be seen that near the tdp the seabed resistance is maximal while beyond that zone it drops to pipeline s submerged self weight it can be also seen that the growth in the seabed loading stiffness leads to the growth in the maximum seabed resistance while as softer the seabed the effect of sagbend becomes less substantial and the vertical resistance along the whole laid on part approaches the self weight fig 12b however the zone where the resistance exceeds the self weight becomes longer fig 12a fig 12c presents an amplification factor for maximum seabed vertical resistance relative to pipeline submerged self weight e m a x e w it can be seen that for softer seabed this ratio is low whilst for stiffer seabed it becomes higher however the above ratio strongly depends on a magnitude of lay tension force for low tension it can double the submerged self weight the amplification factor can be reduced by increasing the lay tension fig 13 a shows the plots of the pipeline embedment full lines and submerged self weight embedment dotted lines for different seabed loading stiffness k s maximum embedment e m a x as laid embedment e and self weight embedment e w all exponentially drop with growing seabed loading stiffness fig 13b it can be seen that for lower seabed loading stiffness as laid embedment e approaches e m a x while for its higher values it approaches the self weight one e w fig 13b can be alternatively represented by scaling the x coordinate as k r k s where k r is still constant for varying k s fig 13c shows the plots of maximum embedment e m a x as laid embedment e and self weight embedment e w versus normalized values of unloading seabed stiffness k r k s for different lay tension values it can be seen that e w e m a x and e are all nearly reversely proportional to k s it can be also clearly seen that the increase in the lay tension results in a lower embedment in order to study the effect of seabed stiffness in a more explicit way it is useful to look at the normalized values of the embedment first we normalize the embedment with its as laid value e e fig 14 a it is clearly seen that higher loading stiffness k s leads to a deeper maximum embedment e m a x relative to an as laid one e fig 14b shows that e m a x e exponentially grows with k s and also has higher values and more rapid growth for a lower lay tension however it is more useful to normalize the embedment with the self weight embedment e e w since e w can straightforwardly be obtained by dividing the self weight by the loading stiffness e w w k s the above relation e e w is equivalent to the static touchdown lay factor bai and bai 2014 dean 2010 palmer 2008 randolph and white 2008 it can be clearly seen that both k s and p 0 affect this value fig 14c shows the plots of the embedments normalized with submerged self weight embedment for different seabed stiffness k s plotting normalized maximum and as laid embedments vs k s fig 14d reveals that while normalized maximum embedment e m a x e w full line grows with growing k s the normalized as laid embedment e e w dashed line first grows from k s 2 kn m 2 to k s 8 kn m 2 and then drops down for example as appears in fig 14c the normalized as laid embedment e e w for k s 4 kn m 2 red line and the one for k s 16 kn m 2 violet line are almost identical while their normalized maximum embedments significantly vary to demonstrate this point let us present the loading unloading scheme for the as laid embedment for k s 4 kn m 2 red line and k s 16 kn m 2 violet line on the same plot fig 15 for the sake of convenience in fig 15 it is useful to present the x coordinate in a normalized form e e w then the loading stiffness for both cases becomes nearly identical k s k s e w 4 2 16 0 5 dashed black line on the other hand the unloading stiffness which in reality is identical in both cases on the scaled axis becomes k r 4 k r e w 32 2 for k s 4 kn m 2 red line and k r 16 k r e w 32 0 5 for k s 16 kn m 2 violet line the maximum values of seabed resistance for both cases can be extracted from fig 20c r s m a x 4 1 4 w and r s m a x 16 1 7 w then after unloading back to submerged self weight w e e w in both cases approaches nearly the same value the reason for this phenomenon is that the as laid embedment among the other factors depends on the seabed loading stiffness and the prior maximum embedment the later though implicitly also depends on the former on one hand while the seabed loading stiffness grows the embedment is expected to drop fig 13b however on the other hand higher seabed stiffness leads to a higher pressure on a seabed near the tdp and thus to a higher maximum normalized embedment which in its turn leads to the increase in the consequent irrecoverable normalized as laid embedment for lower k s values up to 8 kn m 2 e m a x e w grows faster and the later factor is more dominant while for higher k s values over 8 kn m 2 k s itself becomes more dominant this leads towards the conclusion that the static touchdown lay factor which is usually being empirically defined should be a non monotonic function of a loading stiffness 5 2 2 effect of a seabed unloading stiffness in this series we perform a set of five simulations for different seabed unloading stiffness 4 kn m2 8 kn m2 24 kn m2 40 kn m2 and 400 kn m2 the loading seabed stiffness in all the simulations remains constant and is set to 4 kn m2 fig 16 other parameters adopted for this series remain constant as given in table 1 fig 17 a b c d present the configuration bending moments shear forces and axial tension for different seabed unloading stiffness it can be seen that all the curves as in the case with the loading stiffness are almost identical this indicates that the internal forces within the pipeline in fact are practically insensitive to a seabed unloading stiffness as well fig 18 a b c d show that as seabed unloading stiffness rises from 4 kn m2 to 400 kn m2 the maximum values of all the internal forces and the horizontal distance between lop and tdp l l o p t d p fig 8f vary by less than 0 23 fig 18a b c d also indicate that for all those variables with a rise in a loading stiffness its effect on all the monitored maximum values slows down fig 19 a depicts the plot of a seabed vertical resistance for various values of unloading stiffness k r it can be seen that higher unloading stiffness k r leads to higher values of maximum resistance which though becomes more localized near the tdp as k r grows the rate of the resistance growth slows down fig 19b fig 19c shows the maximum seabed resistance normalized with a self weight the amplification factor r m a x w vs k r for various values of lay tension it can be seen that for higher values of a lay tension the maximum seabed resistance becomes lower and tends to approach the pipeline s submerged self weight fig 20a presents the embedment of a pipeline into the seabed for different values of the unloading stiffness k r since for all the cases the loading stiffness k s is identical the self weight embedment for all the cases is identical either it can be seen that when the unloading stiffness k r is equal to the seabed loading stiffness k r k s 4 kn m 2 i e the seabed is purely elastic the as laid embedment of the pipeline is equal to the pipeline submerged self weight embedment dotted black line on the other hand when unloading stiffness is very high e g k r 400 kn m 2 the embedment becomes nearly fully irrecoverable perfectly plastic and as a result the as laid embedment approaches the maximum embedment it is also shown that in the inelastic cases both the maximum embedment and the as laid embedment are deeper than in the elastic case and grow with growing unloading stiffness fig 20b fig 20b presents both maximum full lines and as laid dashed lines embedments vs unloading stiffness k r for different values of lay tension it can be seen that though both the maximum and the as laid embedments grow with growth in unloading stiffness the rate of the growth slows down as the values of k r become higher moreover for higher lay tension both the maximum and the as laid embedment tend to their self weight values it is also useful to take a look at the normalized curves e e w fig 20c and d it can be seen that the highest ratio of the maximum embedment to the self weight one e m a x e w is for the elastic seabed k r k s 4 kn m 2 while the lowest e m a x e w 1 is for the one close to perfectly plastic k r 400 kn m 2 by increasing lay tension from p 0 1 106 n to p 0 3 106 n e m a x e w rises by nearly 30 fig 20d fig 20e shows the embedment normalized with the as laid embedment e m a x e vs unloading seabed stiffness k r for different values of lay tension it can be seen that the embedment ratio for maximal values decays exponentially as the values of k r become higher fig 20f moreover while for lower values of k r lower tension leads to much higher embedment for higher k r the gaps in the results for different lay tension decay and all the embedments approach their as laid values the obtained results also indicate that apart from the as laid embedment on all the other monitored variables the effect of unloading stiffness is lower than the effect of the loading one 6 conclusions feasible numerical method for an analysis of a pipeline configuration in installation on an inelastic seabed capturing irreversible embedment is presented the method considers the entire pipeline as a single segment and is available for both s lay and j lay techniques the numerical solution is proceeded sequentially in an incremental way following the actual pipe lay process thus also allowing for the efficient contact detection the configuration at equilibrium is assessed by consistent minimization of a total potential energy of the system thus extending the technique presented earlier in trapper 2019 available only for conservative path independent systems to non conservative and path dependent cases which include the inelastic seabed all the advantages of a former technique such as generality and simplicity in the mathematical formulation and the derivations have been preserved moreover for non conservative cases such as inelastic seabed the presented technique of contact detection becomes even more essential only elastic flexural deformations of the pipeline are considered the proposed model is limited to a static planar 2d case with a horizontal flat frictionless seabed nevertheless soil softening due to cyclic loading induced by the environment can be considered in a simplified manner by reducing the soil stiffness through the coefficient dependent on the number of loading cycles e g yuan et al 2012 the parameter analysis presented in this paper has revealed that the accepted static touchdown lay factor which is widely used in a design should be a non monotonic function of a loading stiffness i e grow up to some loading stiffness value and then drop down moreover this factor should also apparently depend on a lay tension and on a seabed stiffness the other outcomes of the parameter analysis can be summarized as follow 1 both seabed loading and unloading stiffnesses though highly affect the pipeline embedment into the seabed do not have a substantial effect on the internal forces within the pipeline 2 by manipulating the lay tension we can control the values of internal forces and the embedment increase in the lay tension leads to lower embedments lower shear forces and lower bending moments though to a higher internal tension with the increase in the lay tension all the embedments tend to their values solely due to their submerged self weight 3 higher seabed stiffness both loading and unloading lead to a higher but a more localized maximal vertical seabed resistance 4 due to static lay effects the inelastic seabed causes deeper maximum and deeper as laid embedments than the elastic one consequently considering a purely elastic seabed as is often being assumed leads to underestimated embedments in order to accurately assess pipeline embedment inelastic seabed behavior of the seabed soil should be considered 5 while with a growth in a loading stiffness maximum embedment drops growth in an unloading stiffness leads to a growth in both maximum and as laid embedments 6 the obtained results also indicate that on most of the monitored variables apart from the as laid embedment the effect of the unloading stiffness is lower than the one of the loading stiffness the proposed technique presents a less time consuming alternative to the available

21678,the ship manoeuvrability in actual seas with both wind and waves especially in adverse weather conditions for a full scale tanker with different maximum available power of the engine is studied it is directly evaluated based on the result of a free running model test frmt under a course keeping manoeuvre in long crested and short crested irregular waves of beaufort scale force bf 7 10 the frmt combines rudder effectiveness and speed correction considering the operational limit of an engine and a wind load simulator both of which were previously proposed by the authors therefore not only the effect of waves but also effect of wind rudder effectiveness of the full scale ship and the engine limit for continuous operation are considered in the frmt to validate the reliability of the direct evaluation method in frmt and the measured data in irregular waves of large amplitude the time averaged manoeuvring motion of the frmt at bf 9 is compared with ship manoeuvring motion under steady equilibrium conditions estimated using numerical simulation based on a modular mathematical model the wave drift forces and moment in the simulation are determined on the basis of the results of the captive model test in regular waves which is carried out using the same tanker model before the frmt so that we can eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible the comparison shows the frmt results acceptably agree with the simulation results although a discrepancy is observed in the rudder angle in beam seas for the tanker with a low engine output further frmt data themselves show that full scale rudder effectiveness operational limit of an engine and the engine with lower power cause the ship speed to decrease and the drift angle and the rudder angle to increase in head bow or beam seas because of the difference in the propeller rotational speed in each model control condition in addition it was clarified that operational limit of an engine also affects the significant single amplitudes of the fluctuating components of them and the oscillatory ship motion next the authors assess the manoeuvring limit in adverse weather by comparing the frmt data of the time averaged values of the longitudinal ship speed as well as the drift and rudder angles in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 with their thresholds the assessment clarifies that the tanker becomes unmanoeuvrable at bf 9 10 and in head bow or beam seas owing to a lack of sufficient advancing speed however the limit is not attributable to the drift or rudder angle although the lower power engine worsens the course keeping ability owing to the decrease in the ship speed and the increase in the drift and rudder angles furthermore the tanker is manoeuvrable in any wind and waves directions at bf 8 which is defined as adverse weather conditions for this subject ship in the interim guideline imo 2013 it indicates that the tanker has sufficient margin of the engine power to keep manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions in summary these findings reflect the possibility that frmt can replace numerical simulation

water thus far however estimation of ship manoeuvring motion in waves is important in terms of safety because ships in actual seas are affected by waves in particular it has become necessary to estimate ship manoeuvrability in large wave height in recent years because of the implementation of the interim guidelines for determining the minimum propulsion power required to maintain manoeuvrability in adverse weather imo 2013 in numerical simulations of ships manoeuvring in waves ignoring oscillatory wave forces and moments can effectively simplify the simulation model nonaka 1990 a simulation method considering wave drift forces in a mathematical model for calm water such as the manoeuvring modelling group mmg model of a modular mathematical type ogawa et al 1977 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 enables us to approximately estimate the slowly varying ship manoeuvring motion in waves hirano et al 1980 yasukawa 2006 on the basis of such a method shigunov 2015 estimated steady equilibrium conditions in adverse weather in the horizontal plane for a full scale ship and assessed the ship and disturbance conditions in which the ship reached the manoeuvring limit owing to the advancing speed rudder angle or engine power however he compared only wave drift forces and a moment at zero advancing speed used in the calculation with model test data and the estimated ship motions were not validated umeda et al 2016 calculated the propeller rotational speed and the manoeuvring motion for a bulk carrier model whose ship speed became zero under course keeping manoeuvre in wind and irregular waves in head or bow seas although they compared the simulation results with the free running model test frmt data and found the estimated propeller rotational speed to be in good agreement in head seas the differences in oblique seas where wave drift sway force and yaw moment are significant were considerable yasukawa et al 2017 also evaluated the course keeping and course changing abilities in irregular waves and steady wind for a full scale tanker with two different engine outputs via numerical simulation that was proposed previously yasukawa et al 2015 they approximated the wave drift sway force and yaw moment to those at zero ship speed calculated by a 3d panel method kashiwagi et al 2003 through comparison with frmt data yasukawa et al 2015 clarified that the simulation model could approximately estimate turning motion in irregular waves of 6 0 m significant wave height in full scale however there is no guarantee that the simulation model can reasonably estimate the full scale ship performance in adverse weather because full scale ship motion in adverse weather is susceptible to wave drift forces that become more dominant compared to hull resistance propeller thrust and rudder force owing to a large decrease in the ship speed and reduced rudder effectiveness thus the approximation of a wave drift sway force and yaw moment needs to be verified carefully in adverse weather and at the full scale although the above mentioned simulation data are helpful to provide insights into full scale ship manoeuvring limits in adverse weather conditions these researches suggest numerical simulations for them are still under development although frmt is time consuming and expensive compared to numerical simulation it can directly provide crucial information about manoeuvring on the basis of the measured ship motion because it is a type of physical simulator however it cannot directly determine the full scale ship performance for the following reasons the first reason for this is the scale effect on manoeuvring motion in free running ship models the root cause is the difference of reynolds numbers that is the dissimilarity in longitudinal resistance in calm water larger non dimensional propeller thrust and the rotational speed are required for the ship models to achieve the same froude number compared with the full scale ships because of the dissimilarity the difference of the propeller loading condition leads larger non dimensional inflow velocity to a rudder to the ship models as the result the non dimensional normal force of a rudder of ship models become larger than that of the full scale ships and thus their manoeuvring motions become dissimilar the second reason is that frmt is usually carried out with simplified propulsion conditions such as constant propeller rotational speed constant propeller torque or power viviani et al 2013 thus detailed engine responses of the full scale ship such as involuntary decrease in the engine rotational speed to avoid overloading conditions are not considered in frmt given the situations frmt has been mainly performed only to validate a numerical simulation method at the model scale thus far while full scale ship manoeuvrability eventually needs to be estimated on the basis of the simulation method studies have reported the effects of the engine characteristics on propulsion performance through model tests nakamura and naito 1977 kitagawa et al 2015 however they are not applicable to frmt with steering as they do not consider the scale effect on rudder effectiveness given the above mentioned background the objective of the present study is to enable frmt to directly evaluate full scale ship manoeuvring motion especially under adverse weather conditions by addressing the above mentioned shortcomings of frmt to this end the authors have proposed the following frmt methods tsukada et al 2013 2014 developed a duct fan auxiliary thruster that can enable a free running model to control propeller rotational speed independent of the ship speed ueno and tsukada 2015 and ueno et al 2017 proposed an frmt method using the duct fan auxiliary thruster namely a rudder effectiveness and speed correction method to ensure that the manoeuvring motions of models are similar to those of full scale ships rudder effectiveness and speed correction controls both duct fan auxiliary thruster and propeller rotational speed of a ship model depending on the time varying ship speed they clarified that propeller rotational speed in the correction method is neither at the model self propulsion point nor at the full scale self propulsion point these studies on the rudder effectiveness and speed correction did not consider the engine responses of the full scale ship i e the full scale ship was assumed to be running with the designated propeller rotational speed at full scale self propulsion point suzuki et al 2019 proposed a rudder effectiveness and speed correction method with consideration of the engine limit for continuous operation as the engine response in a full scale ship has a significant impact on manoeuvring motions they validated the method by comparisons of frmt and numerical simulation using the mmg based model kose et al 1981 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in addition they demonstrated the impact of the operational limit of an engine on a vlcc under turning circular motion in calm water and course keeping manoeuvre in regular waves in adverse weather both wind and waves affect ship manoeuvrability thus the influence of wind also needs to be considered in frmt generating the intended wind field by wind blowers is one possible approach however wind blowers cannot generate the intended uniform wind field in a wide space where the distance between a ship model and a wind blower varies yoshimura and nagashima 1985 fujiwara et al 2008 although the above mentioned study by umeda et al 2016 deals with frmt using a wind blower it considers only the case in which the distance between the ship model and the wind blower is nearly constant to realize frmt considering wind loads tsukada et al 2017 2018 developed a wind load simulator that does not generate environmental wind but exerts intended forces equivalent to wind loads on a ship model by six duct fans with the same type of the auxiliary thruster they verified via frmt that the wind load simulator can exert the intended force and moment in both calm water and regular waves this paper addresses a specific method in view of the final objective i e direct evaluation of full scale ship manoeuvrability in wind and waves using free running ship models as well as its applications first the authors describe the aspects of the frmt method for direct evaluation which is a combination of the rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine and the wind load simulator and outlines are provided for each of them second the authors describe the practical conditions of the captive model test and frmt using the direct evaluation method demonstrated in this paper and the subject tanker kvlcc1 although the captive model test is directly unnecessary for model control in frmt it is carried out to clarify the wave drift forces on the tanker exactly before the frmt the measured wave drift forces are used for ship manoeuvring simulation in waves which is described in section 4 so that we can eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible the purpose of frmt is to validate the direct evaluation method to evaluate the full scale ship manoeuvring limit of the tanker in adverse weather conditions and to investigate the effect of the engine output on the limit the frmt is the course keeping manoeuvre in irregular waves with simulated uniform wind the model control conditions include model self propulsion point and the rudder effectiveness and speed correction with and without consideration of operational limit of an engine for continuous operation moreover three different ranges of the operational limit i e maximum available engine power are assumed in the case with consideration of the limit third the authors describe the mmg based numerical simulation model kose et al 1981 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 used in this study to estimate the equilibrium conditions in wind and waves in the horizontal plane for the full scale ship and the ship model the basic objectives of the numerical simulation are theoretical confirmation of the direct evaluation method in frmt and verification as to whether the frmt results are reasonable even in irregular waves of large amplitude which have not been investigated in the previous studies suzuki et al 2019 tsukada et al 2017 2018 instead of comparison with full scale trials in actual seas finally the authors present the results of the captive model test frmt and the numerical simulation together moreover the authors assess the manoeuvring limit in adverse weather conditions depending on whether the mean ship responses in frmt exceed the thresholds on the ship speed drift angle and helm angle the reasonable agreement of the time averaged manoeuvring motions in long crested and short crested irregular waves as well as uniform wind of beaufort scale force bf 9 between the frmt and the simulation clarifies the reliability of the direct evaluation method in frmt with the measured ship responses assessment of the manoeuvring limit of the tanker shows how the weather conditions and the engine output affect the limit these results reflect the possibility that frmt can replace numerical simulation as a direct evaluation method of full scale ship manoeuvring motion and limits in adverse weather 2 outline of free running model test to evaluate full scale ship manoeuvring motion in wind and waves in this

origins of χ and χ a correspond with the ship heading and clockwise is defined as the positive direction the scaled waves generated in accordance with froude s law of similarity by the wave generator are assumed as usual to ensure similarity of the wave loads acting on ships in any type of waves such as regular waves long crested and short crested irregular waves without any correction furthermore rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine suzuki et al 2019 and a wind load simulator tsukada et al 2017 2018 can ensure the similarity of manoeuvring motion and effects of the engine limit and wind loads thus frmt using both the correction method and the wind load simulator in waves allows direct measurement of ship motions corresponding to those of the full scale ship in wind and waves note that the method of suzuki et al 2019 does not consider the engine response fluctuation with high frequency corresponding with that in oscillatory ship motion ueno and tsukada 2016 and ueno et al 2019 proposed a method to estimate the full scale ship engine torque including the high frequency response on the basis of frmt data using rudder effectiveness and speed correction consideration of the high frequency engine response in frmt can be accomplished by real time control using their methods however it has been ignored because slowly varying ship manoeuvring motion does not change significantly even if the high frequency fluctuation exceeds the engine limit for a second as long as the average engine response does not exceed it furthermore the approach of suzuki et al 2019 allows the consideration of other engine limits such as limits on the amount of fuel injection tsujimoto et al 2013 or overload limit man b w diesel 2006 as long as the engine torque fluctuation with high frequency is ignored however these are ignored and only the limit for continuous operation is considered as engine limit in this study for simplification the following sections discuss the determination of the control variables for rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine and the wind load simulator they are the outlines of the works of ueno and tsukada 2015 ueno et al 2017 suzuki et al 2019 and tsukada et al 2017 2018 2 1 rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine in rudder effectiveness and speed correction the similarity in the manoeuvring motion is approximated by similarities in both the apparent longitudinal force on a ship and the effective inflow velocity to a rudder in the longitudinal direction u r at arbitrary ship speed in the longitudinal direction u as shown in eq 3 ueno and tsukada 2015 and ueno et al 2017 3 1 t s t s r s 1 t m t m t a r m f o r u u s u m u r s u r m f o r u u s u m where 1 t is the thrust deduction coefficient t is the propeller thrust t a is the thrust of a duct fan auxiliary thruster tsukada et al 2013 2014 and r is the hull resistance in calm water the subscripts m and s denote variables at the model scale and full scale respectively rudder effectiveness and speed correction controls propeller rotational speed of a ship model n m and t a in accordance with the instantaneous longitudinal speed of the ship model u m to be measured in frmt so that it can satisfy eq 3 arbitrary mathematical models are available to formulate t r and u r here t and r are calculated by eqs 4 and 5 4 t ρ n 2 d p 4 k t ρ n 2 d p 4 c k t 0 c k t 1 j c k t 2 j 2 5 r ρ s w u 2 c t ρ s w u 2 1 k c f 0 c w δ c f where d p is the propeller diameter k t is the thrust coefficient s w is the wetted surface area of a ship c t is the total resistance coefficient 1 k is the form factor c f0 is the frictional resistance coefficient of a flat plate c w is the wave making resistance and δc f is the roughness allowance c kt0 c kt1 and c kt2 are the coefficients for the k t j curve the propeller advance ratio j can be calculated as 6 j 1 w p u n d p where w p is the wake fraction at the propeller position further u r is calculated using the mathematical model proposed by kose et al 1981 7 u r ε 1 w p u η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j 2 1 2 1 η where ε is the ratio of the wake coefficient at the rudder position to that at the propeller position η is the ratio of d p to the rudder height h r and κ is a coefficient related to the speed increase ratio of the propeller slipstream at the rudder position eqs 3 5 and 7 can be solved for n m and t a at arbitrary u when propeller rotational speed of the full scale ship n s with u as a parameter is given since n s can be an arbitrary value a constant or a function of time or of any other quantity and it represents the operational condition for a full scale ship the low frequency variation in n s with u owing to the engine limit for continuous operation can be considered in frmt through this relation suzuki et al 2019 further the relation can be determined by calculating n s at which the full scale ship brake power p b corresponds with the limit p b lim at arbitrary u suzuki et al 2019 assuming a low cycle diesel engine that is usually installed in a large commercial ship p b lim is estimated by the following equations man b w diesel 2006 tsujimoto et al 2013 8 p b l i m m i n p b m e p p b t s p b m e

the engine rotational speed is assumed to be equal to the propeller rotational speed n the variables with the subscript mcr are those at the maximum continuous rating mcr 2 2 wind load simulator wind load simulators control longitudinal and lateral forces and the yaw moment equivalent to the wind loads using eq 9 tsukada et al 2017 2018 9 x a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 a f c x a χ a y a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 a l c y a χ a n a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 a l l o a c n a χ a where ρ a is the density of air further a f a l and l oa are the longitudinal and lateral projected areas of the ship structure above water and the length overall respectively these are known values several reliable tools such as model test data empirical formulas and computational fluid dynamics cfd can be used to determine the wind load coefficients c xa c ya and c na they are necessary to be given as functions of χ a in advance of frmt u a and χ a are calculated using eq 2 true wind direction and the speed u t are also needed to be designated in advance of frmt in contrast resultant ship speed v drift angle β and yaw angle ψ are from instantaneous measured values in frmt χ is defined as the difference between true wind direction and ψ in frmt the instantaneous c xa c ya and c na are interpolated using the calculated χ a from those given in advance of the frmt therefore the wind load simulator can generate time varying wind loads considering the changes in u a and χ a owing to instantaneous manoeuvring motions v χ and β the wind load simulator consists of six duct fans on a ship model with the same type of the auxiliary thruster and the intended wind loads estimated by eq 9 are assigned to each duct fan according to the longitudinal positions relative to a ship model in addition it can simulate the heel moment by setting the duct fans for lateral force at the designated height 3 model test program the test site for both the captive model test and frmt was the actual sea model basin tanizawa et al 2010 at the national maritime research institute in japan where 382 units of segmental flap type wave generators surround the water surface of the basin they can generate various types of waves such as regular long crested and short crested irregular waves and other waves including concentrating and transient waves in addition they absorb incoming waves while generating waves 3 1 subject ship the subject ship was the kvlcc1 tanker its profile is shown in fig 2 and its specifications are listed in table 1 as a full scale version of this ship has not been built and the profile of the superstructure has not been designed the authors employed values estimated by kitamura s regression formulas 2017 using only length overall l oa breadth b and ship type for the longitudinal and lateral projected areas of the ship structure above water a f and a l in addition wind load coefficients c xa c ya and c na about the midship shown in fig 3 were estimated by fujiwara s formulas 2005 with the parameters in kitamura s regression formulas 2017 as inputs in this study the tanker was assumed to be equipped with one of three engines with the different maximum output depending on the navigational speed in calm water respectively as listed table 2 the brake power at the design speed in calm water was estimated in accordance with the procedures of the international towing tank conference ittc performance committee 1978 using the coefficients listed in table 3 the regression models of wave making resistance c w and torque coefficient k q were given by eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 c w c w 0 c w 1 f n c w 2 f n 2 c w 3 f n 3 c w 4 f n 4 11 k q c k q 0 c k q 1 j c k q 2 j 2 where f n is the froude number the roughness allowance δc f the full scale characteristics for the thrust coefficient k t and k q and the wake coefficient at the propeller position for the full scale ship 1 w p s were also calculated in accordance with the procedures of the ittc performance committee 1978 the frictional resistance coefficient of a flat plate c f0 was calculated according to the method of saunders et al 1957 the transmission efficiency η t and the relative rotative efficiency η r were assumed to be 0 98 and 1 0 respectively because the authors had no practical data to determine them all other unexplained coefficients in table 3 except for ε and κ were obtained from the captive model test results suzuki et al 2015 and 1 w p m was represented by those at model self propulsion point according to former literatures ittc 1978 nakatake and yamazaki 1977 the viscous effect on thrust deduction coefficient 1 t is negligible although 1 t depends on the propeller loading condition in a precise sense the authors neglected the variation it is because the maximum of the auxiliary thrust in the frmt was no more than 1 n and the difference of the auxiliary thrust caused by the variation in 1 t would be smaller for these reasons 1 t for the full scale was assumed to be equal to that for the model scale mcr in table 2 was estimated by considering 15 of the sea margin and engine margin respectively to the brake power at the design speed in calm water propeller rotational speed to achieve each maximum power of the engines corresponding with mcr 80 of mcr and 60 of mcr respectively in calm water listed table 2 were determined by considering 5 engine rotational speed margins on the respective propeller rotational speed estimated by calculation in the longitudinal equilibrium condition the authors assumed that the full scale ship would be equipped with a low cycle diesel engine the engine limits for the continuous operation defined by eq 8 with the maximum engine outputs listed table 2 are shown with the lines in fig 4 when the maximum power of an engine was either 80 or 60 of mcr the coefficients with the subscript mcr in eq 8 were replaced with those at 80 and 60 of mcr respectively in this study the authors supposed that brake power at the navigational conditions in calm water was simply reduced to 80 or 60 of the brake power at the design speed in calm water when a ship was equipped with a low power engine whose maximum output was 80 or 60 of mcr respectively the propeller rotational speed to obtain each brake power in calm water listed table 2 were also estimated by the same longitudinal equilibrium calculation further the navigational speed whose maximum output corresponded with 80 or 60 of mcr was also the result of the longitudinal equilibrium calculation although a propeller would be redesigned depending on the different design navigational speed in practice the propeller open characteristics were assumed to be the same in this study the authors assumed the ship was navigated with any constant propeller rotational speed at 78 24 rpm 72 37 rpm and 65 67 rpm as listed table 2 respectively as long as the brake power did not exceed each limit shown in fig 4 in this case the relations between n s and f n for kvlcc1 are given as fig 5 using the method described in section 2 1 suzuki et al 2019 hereinafter these conditions are referred to as with operational limit of mcr with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6mcr respectively furthermore propeller rotational speed fixed at 78 24 rpm which corresponds with the condition ignoring any operational limits of an engine at the design speed i e full scale self propulsion point is also shown in fig 5 and it is referred to as without operational limit 3 2 methods and conditions in captive model test the model in the captive model test was with the rudder but without the propeller the conceptual diagram of the equipment to measure the wave drift forces and the moment is shown in fig 6 the three component load cell located at the centre of gravity of a model measured surge and sway forces and the yaw moment acting on the model heave roll and pitch motions were free but surge sway and yaw motions were guided by spring mechanisms using servomotors the spring coefficients for surge sway and yaw motions were set to 0 510 n mm 1 43 n mm and 4 92 nm deg respectively the natural periods on surge sway and yaw motions for the mechanisms were sufficiently large in comparison with the wave encounter periods in the test according to appendix a oscillatory ship motion in surge and sway in long waves can be affected by the springs however the influence of the springs on the wave drift forces which used in the manoeuvring simulation would be small because wave drift forces are relatively small under the wave conditions in which the influence of the springs appears on the ship motion the wave was regular and the ratio of the wave height to the ship length 2ζ a l was 1 50 the ratio of the wavelength to the ship length λ l ranged from 0 3 to 3 0 the designated wave directions relative to a ship model χ d were from 0 to 180 at intervals of every 30 the towing speed was 0 m s and at the design speed of 0 76 m s the wave drift forces and moment were regarded as the differences of the time averaged values of the forces and the moment between in waves and in calm water at the same towing speed and drift angle conditions the intended drift angle at the design speed was 0 and the authors refer to this condition as straight moving condition although the intention was not ensured owing to unknown wave drift forces and moment the deviations were less than 1 0 throughout the test 3 3 methods and conditions in free running model test the general procedures of frmt in the basin can be found in the work of ueno et al 2017 the measured items and each instrument are summarized in table 4 fig 7 shows the condition of frmt using the duct fan auxiliary thruster the wind load simulator the duct fans for lateral wind forces were set at a height of 0 189 m from the water surface which is equal to the ratio of the wind heel moment to the lateral force estimated by fujiwara s formulas 2005 resultant ship speed v drift angle β and yaw angle ψ for the calculations of u a and χ a were measured by image processing using a ccd camera on the sub carriage tracking a ship model automatically ueno et al 2017 the authors confirmed that the operations of eqs 1 2 and 9 for one time step were within 0 05 s which corresponded with the sampling interval in the frmt the practical controls of a duct fan auxiliary thruster and wind load simulator to generate the intended forces are described by tsukada et al 2013 ueno et al 2017 and tsukada et al 2017 2018 note that duct fans for longitudinal force need to generate the sum of the longitudinal wind force and auxiliary thrust t a when using the wind load simulator and rudder effectiveness and speed correction simultaneously all of the frmt were under course keeping manoeuvre by autopilot in waves and simulated wind the waves were long crested or short crested irregular waves the frequency spectrum types of which were those specified by the international ship structure congress issc 1964 the directional distribution function for short crested irregular waves was the square of cosine the true wind was assumed to be steady and the true wind direction relative to a ship was assumed to correspond with that of the main wave direction although this assumption may not always result in the worst case for ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather both of the directions were represented by χ this assumption followed the most of theoretical studies on ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather yasukawa et al 2017 kadomatsu et al 1990 the simplified assessment in the interim guidelines imo 2013 also introduces this assumption although it defines only head sea condition the other reason was that manoeuvring limit was evaluated on the basis of the time averaged values and it would not be critically affected by fluctuating component of wind the authors therefore leave the investigation of the combination of wind and waves direction leading the worst case for ship manoeuvarability to a future work the significant wave height h 1 3 the mean wave period t 01 and the true wind speed u t were the equivalent values at bf 9 in the case of long crested irregular waves and those of short crested irregular waves ranged from bf 7 10 as shown in table 5 u t was approximated by the median in each bf and t 01 was calculated by eq 12 derived from a frequency spectrum for fully developed wind waves price and bishop 1974 12 t 01 3 86 h 1 3 the measured values of h 1 3 and t 01 at the centre of the basin are listed in table 5 comparisons of the measured frequency spectrums s w ω in long crested irregular waves at bf 9 and short crested irregular waves at bf 7 and 10 with the intended values are shown in fig 8 as representative examples where ω is the wave circular frequency the comparisons of the directional distribution functions d w χ in the case of short crested irregular waves are also shown in fig 8 table 5 and fig 8 clarify that the wave generators in the basin can generate intended wave fields with high accuracy the designated directions of the wind and waves relative to a ship model χ d were kept constant in each run and ranged from the head χ d 0 to quartering χ d 150 at intervals of every 30 the rudder angle δ for the autopilot was determined by eq 13 13 δ k p χ χ d k d r the proportional gain k p and the differential gain k d were set to 2 0 and 0 0 respectively the authors theoretically and numerically confirmed in appendix b that the subject ship with the gains are directionally stable in calm water further the authors numerically confirmed that the subject ship with the gains are stable in wind and waves for u v r and χ χ d under the equilibrium conditions see appendix b the reason why the subject ship can be stable even without the differential control would be that the degree of directionally unstable characteristics without steering in calm water yoshimura et al 2008 is not so inferior koyama et al 1978 in addition the propeller load the rudder angle and thus the rudder effectiveness in wind and waves are much larger than those in calm water further the numerical calculations of yasukawa and sakuno 2020 show that directionally unstable ship in calm water has the possibility to become stable in wind and waves under the equilibrium conditions even without steering although the numerical determination of the directional stability in the disturbance shown in appendix b was limited to some sea state and full scale conditions the fact that all of the fmrt results in section 5 and the corresponding time simulations converged to certain equilibrium conditions implies that they would also be stable since the major interest of this study was on the equilibrium conditions in wind and waves the authors investigated whether the control parameters of autopilot including those for d control have major effect on the equilibrium conditions or not on the basis of numerical simulation the results are shown in appendix c and it clarifies that the gains would not affect time averaged values in frmt note that in contrast the fluctuating components are influenced by the gains full scale ship conditions considered in frmt were those represented by the n s f n lines with the labels w o operational limit with operational limit of mcr with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6mcr as shown in fig 5 fig 9 shows the control parameters corresponding to each n s f n line for rudder effectiveness and speed correction i e propeller rotational speed of the ship model n m and the auxiliary thrust factor f ta which is the ratio of the auxiliary thrust t a to the skin friction correction sfc in addition to the ordinary frmt condition running at model self propulsion point with no correction they are the results for the calculation of eq 3 using the relations shown in fig 5 as the inputs and the coefficients listed in table 3 the values of the ratio of the wake coefficient at the rudder position to that at the propeller position ε and the coefficient related to the speed increase ratio of the propeller slipstream at the rudder position κ were obtained from the work of yoshimura et al 2008 the test results in long crested and short crested irregular waves at bf 9 for the ship model with no correction w o operational limit with operational limit of mcr and with operational limit of 0 8mcr were used for confirmation of the direct evaluation method in frmt by comparison with numerical simulation it was essential because the previous studies of rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine suzuki et al 2019 and the wind load simulator tsukada et al 2017 2018 had not been validated in irregular waves of large amplitude the test results in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 for the ship model with operational limit of mcr with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6mcr were used for evaluating the full scale ship manoeuvring limit in adverse weather conditions several runs were repeated for each set of conditions by changing the initial ship speed and the case that was the closest to a steady state condition was selected for analysis to fairly assess the effects of the weather conditions and operational limit of an engine on ship motion the ship model was run in the same wave train as much as possible by taking full advantage of the high repeatability and controllability of the actual sea model basin ueno et al 2013 on the other hand the ship model with operational limit of 0 8mcr was run in an additional wave train to clarify whether the measuring time is sufficiently long enough for evaluating irregular phenomena the time period for analysis of time averaged values and fluctuating components was 105 4 s on average although the finite time depends on the test conditions such as ship speed the sampling interval was set to 0 05 s 4 numerical simulation model comparison of frmt data using the direct evaluation method with full scale ship trials in actual seas is the most direct and certain way to enhance the reliability of the frmt method however as the authors do not have suitable full scale trial data the method was validated by comparisons with the numerical simulation result at full and model scales in this study the comparison with full scale trial data is a topic for future work note again that this numerical simulation estimated the steady equilibrium conditions with three degrees of freedom dof surge sway and yaw in wind and waves and it thus neglected the oscillatory ship motion with wave encounter frequency 4 1 mathematical model the equations of motion for surge sway and yaw about the centre of gravity are given by

interaction coefficients between a ship hull and the rudder dot above a variable represents the time derivative the total resistance coefficient c t and the thrust coefficient k t in eq 14 were calculated from eqs 5 and 4 respectively the rudder normal force f n can be represented as 15 f n 0 5 ρ a r f α u r 2 sin α r where a r is the movable rudder area and f α is the gradient of the rudder lift the effective inflow velocity to a rudder u r and the effective inflow angle to a rudder α r can be written as 16 u r u r 2 v r 2 α r δ tan 1 v r u r for u r 0 the effective inflow velocity to a rudder in the longitudinal direction u r was calculated using eq 7 and the lateral component v r was calculated using the following equation 17 v r v p r γ r v r l r where γ r is the flow straightening coefficient and l r is the hydrodynamic lever representing the yaw rate effect on the lateral inflow velocity to a rudder further v pr is the component of the lateral inflow velocity to a rudder induced by the propeller revolution in straight running since it was clarified the ratio of v pr to u r varies almost linearly with propeller slip ratio s kose et al 1981 fujii and tuda 1961 okada 1959 the ratio was given by the following equation kose et al 1981 18 v p r u r v p r 0 v p r 1 s where s is defined by eq 19 using the propeller advance ratio j and the propeller pitch p 19 s 1 j p d p when v r u r is small the second equation in eq 16 can be represented as eq 20 by substituting eq 17 20 α r δ v p r u r γ r v r l r u r thus the ratio of v pr to u r has the similar meaning with a rudder balancing angle for straight run the advantage using v pr is that the variation of the balancing rudder angle with propeller slip ratio can be automatically considered further since the propeller slip ratio s is dissimilar between the model and the full scale ship this assumption enables to consider the scale effect in the balancing angle since direct measurement of v r in captive model tests is difficult especially in oblique moving and or steady turning v r to determine γ r l r and v pr was obtained form mmg based analysis yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 using the captive mode test result of suzuki et al 2015 in this study instead of the direct flow measurement please note that yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 neglect v pr but the analysis procedure for v r is the same v pr corresponds with v r analysed in straight moving condition v r 0 in the analysis v pr is defined as a product of the tangent of the balancing angle δ fn0 and u r experimentally analysed in the straight run thus v pr in this study reflects all phenomena inducing the balancing angle such as not only tangential induced velocities but also an upwash at the propeller s disk and non uniformities of the wake over the propeller s disk according matsumoto and suemitsu 1980 the main reason why ships in calm water requires a rudder balancing angle for the straight run would be the unbalance of the rudder areas above and below the propeller axis and thus the resulting lateral inflow velocity to the rudder the variables in the numerical simulations are listed in tables 3 and 6 the hydrodynamic derivatives in table 6 are considered to have no scale effect further 1 t r a h and x h were obtained from the captive model test results suzuki et al 2015 and were represented by those at model self propulsion point γ r and l r were taken from the work of yoshimura et al 2008 the hydrodynamic derivatives for the ship hull were obtained from the test data of yoshimura et al 2008 and the 1 t r a h and x h values listed in table 6 since v pr depends on the position of the rudder with respect to the slipstream v pr0 and v pr1 were from the captive model test result of suzuki et al 2015 using the same tanker model kvlcc1 the auxiliary thrust t a and propeller rotational speed for the ship model n m were given by the values shown in fig 9 by contrast for full scale ships t a is zero and the propeller rotational speed n s was given by the value shown in fig 5 x a y a and n a are the wind forces and the moment in eq 14 the effects of waves were only considered as the averaged values of the wave drift forces and the moment in irregular waves x w d y w d and n w d hirano et al 1980 yasukawa 2006 the numerical simulation was a time domain simulation which solved the equations of motion eq 14 with the equation for the rudder control eq 13 for u v r and δ in each time step using runge kutta gill method the initial wind and waves direction relative to a ship χ and initial r were set to the designated angle χ d and zero respectively in accordance with the frmt and thus initial δ was zero further initial u was made correspond with the approach speed in each test case of frmt and initial v was zero the numerical simulation was continued until the translational and angular accelerations reached zeros and the condition was considered as the steady equilibrium condition the differences in the c f0 δc f k t and k q curves and 1 w p between a full scale ship and the model as shown in table 3 are the root cause for the scale effects in manoeuvring motion in this simulation the coefficients not only directly affect the non similarity in u r as shown in eq 7 but also lead to non similarity in propeller rotational speed at the same froude number i e the differences in the propeller advance ratio j and slip ratio s these differences make v pr non similar and lead to further non similarity in u r as shown in eqs 18 and 7 respectively as a result the rudder normal force f n becomes non similar 4 2 wind loads and wave drift forces wind loads x a y a and n a were calculated from eq 9 using the wind load coefficients shown in fig 3 and eq 2 as with a wind load simulator x w d y w d and n w d were expressed as the following equations by applying the short term production technique with wave drift forces and moment in regular waves x wd y wd and n wd and they denote the liner superpositions of x wd y wd and n wd maruo 1960 21 x w d 2 0 2 π 0 x w d ω χ v ζ a 2 s w ω d w χ d ω d χ y w d 2 0 2 π 0 y w d ω χ v ζ a 2 s w ω d w χ d ω d χ n w d 2 0 2 π 0 n w d ω χ v ζ a 2 s w ω d w χ d ω d χ where ζ a is the amplitude of regular waves the directional distribution function d w χ was 1 in long crested irregular waves some estimation methods such as kashiwagi et al 2003 may be available for x wd y wd and n wd however according to the purpose of the manoeuvring simulation in this study the captive model test results were used for them as mentioned above so that we can eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible the non dimensional forms of wave drift forces in regular and irregular waves were defined as eq 22 and the wave drift force coefficients were assumed to be independent of the wave height 22 x w d y w d x w d y w d 8 ρ g h 1 3 2 b 2 l n w d n w d 8 ρ g h 1 3 2 b l practical values for wave drift forces in regular and irregular waves are presented in the next section under the assumption of quasi steady treatment x w d y w d and n w d at each time step in the manoeuvring simulation were given by interpolation using the instantaneous values of the longitudinal ship speed u mean wave period t 01 and main wave direction χ 5 results and discussion 5 1 wave drift forces and the moment the wave drift force coefficients measured in regular waves c xwd c ywd and c nwd are shown in fig 10 this figure shows that c xwd at the design speed in head waves has a peak around λ l 1 0 and it is more significant than that at zero speed as with the abundant test data in longitudinal added resistance in head waves for blunt ships for example takahashi 1987 the peak shifts to short wavelength as the wave direction changes from head to beam waves c xwd at the design speed acts in the stern direction even in quartering or following waves of χ 120 150 and 180 the absolute value of c ywd becomes larger in short wavelength and in beam waves regardless of the ship speed the qualitative variation in c ywd with the wavelength is nearly the same between zero speed and the design speed the absolute value of c ywd at the design speed becomes slightly larger in bow waves and smaller in quartering waves than that at zero speed the absolute value of c nwd at zero speed tends to be larger in short wavelength but it is not as clear as c ywd compared with c ywd c nwd seems to be susceptible to the ship speed because the qualitative variation in c nwd with wavelength is different between zero speed and the design speed c nwd at the design speed under λ l 1 5 tends to shift to negative values compared to that at zero speed ueno et al 2001a 2000 reported that wave drift forces depend on drift angle of a ship β in order to quantify the effects for the subject ship kvlcc1 the authors compared the wave drift force coefficients at λ l 0 4 measured under straight moving condition without drift angle which is shown in fig 10 with the test data of suzuki et al 2019 fig 11 shows the towing conditions represented by ship speed v and drift angle β in suzuki et al 2019 as shown in fig 11 the test of suzuki et al 2019 was carried out under the conditions giving drift angle intentionally to a ship which is referred to as oblique moving condition in this paper the comparisons of wave drift forces are also shown in fig 11 this figure shows that the longitudinal force c xwd and the yaw moment c nwd under the oblique moving condition with drift angle are not significantly different from those in the straight moving condition without drift angle or zero forward speed in contrast there is an apparent difference in the lateral force c ywd in bow and beam waves the absolute value of c ywd under the oblique moving condition with drift angle is smaller than that under the straight moving condition without drift angle and zero forward speed in addition the absolute value of c ywd in bow and beam waves becomes small as drift angle increases note that the numerical simulation for manoeuvring motion in this study did not consider such an effect of the drift angle on wave drift forces since those in numerical simulation were approximated with those measured under the straight moving condition without drift angle therefore this may affect the estimation accuracy of the manoeuvring motion figs 12 and 13 show the time averaged values of the wave drift force coefficients in long crested and short crested irregular waves c x w d c y w d and c n w d calculated using eq 22 and the test data in regular waves shown in fig 10 respectively the characteristics of c y w d and c n w d in long crested and short crested irregular waves are similar to those in regular waves specifically the absolute value of c y w d increases in short waves and beam waves and the effect of ship speed on c n w d is more remarkable than that on c y w d 5 2 validation of the direct evaluation method in free running model test in long crested and short crested irregular waves the frmt data in the time averaged values for the ship speed ratio v v 0 the drift angle β and the rudder angle δ in long crested and short crested irregular waves at bf 9 are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively with wind and waves direction χ as the abscissa the tilde above a variable denotes the time averaged value fig 16 shows comparisons of the time averaged values of the measured control variables in the frmt that is propeller rotational speed auxiliary thrust and simulated wind loads with the intended values under the ship motion corresponding with the frmt conditions in figs 15 and 16 the two points are plotted for each χ for with operational limit of 0 8mcr in short crested irregular waves although they have a nearly identical value at each χ one of them at each χ is the test result for which the encounter waves were intentionally changed from the other these agreements of data in different encounter wave trains confirm that the measurement time for averaging is sufficiently long to represent the statistical mean of the ship motion in the irregular waves fig 16 confirms that the control of the ship model in the frmt worked as intended in all the cases in long crested and short crested irregular waves the frmt data in figs 14 and 15 show that the operational limit of an engine and the low power engine cause v v 0 to decrease and those in β and δ to increase in head bow or beam seas fig 16 suggests that these were caused by the difference in propeller rotational speed in each model control condition fig 17 shows significant single amplitudes of the fluctuating component in the speed ratioδv v 0 drift angle δβ rudder angle δδ in long crested and short crested irregular waves and uniform wind of bf 9 by frmt the significant single amplitude was defined in this study as the mean value of the largest one third response for local maximum relative to the time averaged value in the overall measured data shown in figs 14 and 15 since the proportional control of the autopilot included wave induced oscillation in yaw the fluctuating component in rudder angle δδ and that in yaw angle δψ satisfy the relation that δδ 2δψ fig 17 indicates that the difference in the encounter wave trains gives the unignorable difference to the significant single amplitude compared to the time averaged value shown in fig 15 this suggests that a longer measurement time or more repeated measurements in different encounter wave trains is preferable to get more statistically reliable data for fluctuating components even so fig 17 shows approximate tendencies in δv v 0 δβ and δδ regardless of the difference in the encounter wave trains fig 17 also shows that the model control conditions affect not only the time averaged values in ship motions but also the fluctuating components although the obvious trends in δv v 0 and δδ depending on the model ship control conditions could not be observed operational limit of an engine and the engine with lower power cause δβ to increase in head bow or beam seas as with the time averaged value β the numerical simulation results of v v 0 β and δ for both full and model scales are also shown in figs 14 and 15 owing to rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine the estimated ship motions for each engine limit condition at the model scale are similar to those at the full scale suzuki et al 2019 figs 14 and 15 clarify that the numerical simulation results describe the similar variations in v v 0 β and δ depending on the operational limit of an engine and the wave direction χ with those demonstrated using the frmt furthermore these simulation results approximately agree with the frmt data quantitatively which supports the validity of the direct evaluation method in frmt and the measured ship motions in the frmt comparing them in detail δ in long crested irregular beam waves for the model control condition referred to as with operational limit of 0 8mcr were overestimated in the simulation compared to frmt model control in frmt should not cause the difference as it was successful as shown in fig 16 to clarify the cause the authors compared the respective force components in the numerical simulation for the ship model with operational limit of 0 8mcr in long crested irregular waves the comparisons are shown in fig 18 this figure shows that forces induced by waves are dominant in the longitudinal and lateral direction compared to wind and the influence of external disturbances is smaller in the yaw direction compared to the hydrodynamic moment and the moment induced by steering these suggest that the rudder was steered to counteract the wave drift sway force that is the smaller the wave drift sway force is the smaller the estimated rudder angle becomes considering that the drift angle toward the leeside decreases the wave drift sway force in short regular waves compared with that in the straight moving condition see fig 11 the deviation of δ in the numerical simulation from frmt is presumed to be mainly caused by ignoring the effect of the drift angle on the wave drift forces in the numerical simulation actually the numerical simulation under course keeping manoeuvre in short regular waves using the wave drift forces measured with the drift angle corresponding with the frmt result shows quantitatively good agreement in δ even for a low engine output suzuki et al 2019 note that it is necessary to confirm whether the effect of the drift angle on the wave drift forces in irregular waves would be the same as those in short regular waves the reason that the deviation of δ was not observed in the other model control condition would be the smaller drift angle and that the accuracy in wave drift forces is less influential compared with the rudder forces by contrast the reason that the same difference as that in long crested irregular waves was not observed in short crested irregular waves cannot be identified thus far although the elementary waves from various directions could be related thus it is also necessary to investigate the quantitative impact on ship manoeuvring simulation in waves induced by the effect of drift angle on wave drift forces this is another topic for future work as such the effect of the drift angle on wave drift forces is automatically and explicitly reflected on the ship motion in frmt the frmt result would be closer to the full scale ship manoeuvrability compared to the simulation result 5 3 application of the direct evaluation method in free running model test for full scale ship manoeuvring limit in adverse weather conditions fig 19 shows the frmt data in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 using the tanker with the engine limit for continuous operation defined by mcr which corresponds to the model control condition referred to as with operational limit of mcr the radial coordinates represent either one of the time averaged values in the longitudinal ship speed converted to full scale u s with froude s law of similarity or the absolute values in the drift angle β or the rudder angle δ while the circumferential coordinate represents the time averaged value in the wind and waves direction χ the frmt data in the significant single amplitudes of fluctuating components in oscillatory ship motion in full scale represented by heave δζ roll δϕ and pitch motions δθ are shown in fig 20 fig 20 shows that u s decreases and β and δ increase when bf increases owing to larger external disturbance fig 20 shows the tendencies that δζ δϕ and δθ increase as bf increases although δϕ in quartering seas is not always consistent owing to the relation between the encounter period of waves and the natural period of roll for the model figs 21 24 show the frmt data corresponding to figs 19 and 20 for the tanker with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6 mcr respectively the data with operational limit of 0 8mcr at bf 9 are the mean values of the test results in the different wave trains these figures show that the variations in these ship responses depending on bf are nearly similar regardless of the engine conditions but their magnitudes in both the time averaged values and the significant values of the fluctuating components are affected by operational limit of an engine as mentioned in section 5 2 specifically the low power engine cause u s to decrease and β and δ to increase in head bow or beam seas it means that the lower power engine worsens the course keeping ability in adverse weather conditions thresholds for the ship manoeuvring limit in u s β and δ are also shown in figs 19 21 and 23 the threshold in u s was defined as the larger of minimum navigational speed or minimum course keeping speed according to the interim guideline imo 2013 the minimum navigational speed is fixed at 2 06 m s 4 0 knots imo 2013 the minimum course keeping speed depends on the specifications of a ship such as windage area and lateral projected area of a rudder imo 2013 and that calculated for kvlcc1 was 3 00 m s therefore threshold in u s was set to 3 00 m s although the guideline requires only the assessment in head seas the authors applied the value to all wind and waves directions the thresholds in β and δ were set to 20 by following the proposal of takahashi and asai 1982 takahashi and asai 1982 set the limit of the mean value in rudder angle to 20 on the basis of free running model test results by considering the margin for fluctuating component in rudder angle due to wind and waves to the maximum steerable angle for ordinary ships 35 as shigunov 2018 proposed another possible limit for rudder angle is the maximum steerable angle in this case rudder angle should be compared by taking the fluctuating component as well as the mean value into account because rudder angle cannot exceed the limit even for a second the criterion for rudder angle would open question and the authors suppose that further investigation to determine the optimal criterion would be the future work the reason for setting the rudder angle limit on the mean value in this study is that it would be safer assessment than that with maximum steerable angle including the fluctuating component when u s was smaller than 3 00 m s or β or δ was larger than 20 the authors treated the ship as unmanoeuvrable in the weather conditions in addition to the thresholds in u s β and δ the maximum roll angle or the occurrence of propeller racing for example can be indices of the criteria in terms of seakeeping ability although the frmt enables their evaluation using oscillatory ship motions as shown figs 20 22 and 24 they were not considered in this study for simplification fig 19 shows that the tanker with operational limit of mcr becomes unmanoeuvrable at bf 10 in head seas or bow seas up to χ 45 because of a lack of sufficient advancing speed in addition figs 21 and 23 show that the unmanoeuvrable range expands to beam seas of χ 80 and bf 9 when the tanker is equipped with an engine with lower power it is also shown that the tanker does not become unmanoeuvrable owing to limits in drift or rudder angles even in the extremely rough weather conditions at bf 10 by contrast shigunov 2015 2018 reported the numerical simulation results in which the rudder angle in course keeping manoeuvre reaches the rudder angle limit in beam seas although the weather conditions or the ship type are not described the subject tanker kvlcc1 would also reach the rudder angle limit or drift angle limit in short waves as well as large waves as wave drift forces especially the lateral component become large in short waves as shown in figs 12 and 13 further using an engine with lower power than that supposed in this study can also be the cause of the rudder angle limit or drift angle limit although bf 8 is defined as adverse weather conditions for this subject ship in the interim guideline imo 2013 the tanker with the engine limits supposed in this study was manoeuvrable in any wind and waves directions at bf 8 thus the tanker with the original engine with operational limit of mcr has sufficient margin of the engine power to keep manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions note that these results are limited under the assumption that wind and main waves direction are the same thus additional tests changing the combination of wind and waves direction would be required as a future work in order to investigate whether the worst case for ship manoeuvrability can be approximately evaluated under this assumption 6 conclusions the ship manoeuvarability in actual seas with both wind and waves especially in adverse weather conditions for a full scale tanker with different maximum available power of the engine were studied they were directly evaluated based on the result of frmt combining rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine and a wind load simulator both of which were previously proposed by the authors therefore not only the effect of waves but also effect of wind rudder effectiveness of the full scale ship and the engine limit for continuous operation were considered in the frmt before the frmt the authors first carried out a captive model test to measure the wave drift forces and the moment in regular waves at zero speed and the design speed under straight moving conditions for the tanker model the measured wave drift forces were used for numerical simulation of ship manoeuvring motion in waves although the captive model test results were directly unnecessary for the model control in the frmt method they enabled us to eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible furthermore the author confirmed that the wave drift sway force is affected by the hull drift angle in short regular waves via comparisons of the test data with the drift angle of suzuki et al 2019 as ueno et al 2001a 2000 clarified second the authors carried out frmt under the course keeping manoeuvre in long crested and short crested irregular waves with uniform wind at bf 7 10 using the same tanker model applied the direct evaluation method the model control conditions included model self propulsion point and rudder effectiveness and speed correction with and without consideration of operational limit of an engine for continuous operation moreover three different ranges of the engine limit i e maximum available engine power were assumed in the case with consideration of the limit the result confirmed that the model control worked as intended the frmt data in the time averaged values showed that full scale rudder effectiveness operational limit of an engine and the engine with lower power cause the ship speed to decrease and the drift angle and the rudder angle to increase in head bow or beam seas because of the difference in the propeller rotational speed in each model control condition in addition it was clarified that operational limit of an engine also affects the significant single amplitudes of the fluctuating components of them and the oscillatory ship motion the time averaged manoeuvring motion of the frmt at bf 9 were compared with that under steady equilibrium conditions estimated using numerical simulation of the mmg based model in the horizontal plane and the measured wave drift forces and the moment in regular waves it was intended to validate the reliability of the direct evaluation method in frmt and the measured data in irregular waves of the large amplitude which had not been investigated in the previous studies suzuki et al 2019 tsukada et al 2017 2018 instead of comparison with full scale trials the frmt results acceptably agreed with the simulation results although a discrepancy was observed in the rudder angle in beam seas for the tanker with a low engine output according to the measured wave drift forces and investigation of the force components in the simulation the quantitative discrepancy was presumed to be caused by ignoring the effect of the drift angle on the wave drift forces in the numerical simulation as this effect is automatically and explicitly reflected in the ship motion in frmt the frmt result will be closer to the full scale ship manoeuvrability compared to the simulation result it indicates that the direct evaluation method in frmt can be applied to the evaluation for the other types of full scale ships although all investigations were conducted with respect to the tanker kvlcc1 finally the authors evaluated the manoeuvring limit under the course keeping conditions in adverse weather on the basis of the comparison of the frmt data in the time averaged ship speed drift angle and rudder angle in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 with their thresholds the evaluation clarified that the tanker became unmanoeuvrable at bf 9 10 and in head bow or beam seas up to χ 80 owing to a lack of sufficient advancing speed and the unmanoeuvrable range was extended as the maximum output of the engine decreased by contrast the drift or rudder angle did not cause the manoeuvring limit although the lower power engine worsened the course keeping ability in adverse weather conditions furthermore the tanker with the engine limits supposed in this study was manoeuvrable in any wind and waves directions at bf 8 which is defined as adverse weather conditions for this subject ship in the interim guideline imo 2013 it indicates that the tanker has sufficient margin of the engine power to keep manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions note that these results are limited under the assumption that wind and main waves direction are the same further these frmt result are based on the proportional control for autopilot thus the experimental investigation for the optimal control to maintain the ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather including the fluctuating components of ship motion would be the future work in summary this study reflects the possibility that frmt can replace numerical simulation as a direct evaluation method of full scale ship manoeuvring motion and limits in adverse weather comparison of these frmt data with full scale ship trials in actual seas could be a topic for future work as it is the most direct and certain way to enhance the reliability of the frmt method in addition development of an estimation tool for full scale ship manoeuvring motion in adverse weather conditions especially in terms of the effect of drift angle on wave drift forces by utilizing the frmt method could be another topic for future work credit authorship contribution statement ryosuke suzuki methodology software validation

ohtsubo kazuhisa in nmri for giving valuable comments on the analysis of directional stability appendix a estimation of oscillatory ship motion in regular waves in order to investigate influence of the spring mechanisms on the captive model test results the authors compared the oscillatory ship motion in surge sway and yaw between the measured results and estimated results without and with the springs the estimation of sway and yaw motions was performed on the basis of the stf salvesen tcuk faltinsen method salvesen et al 1970 which is one of the strip methods past studies validated the stf method can reasonably estimate oscillatory ship motion with 5 dof sway heave roll pitch and yaw under periodic steady state in regular waves for example ueno et al 2001b except for conditions in high speed or law encounter frequency of waves since the stf method does not include surge motion it was estimated using eq a 1 which considers only fluid klyrov force as the wave exciting force a 1 m ξ k 11 ξ x f k where k 11 is the spring coefficient in surge the fluid klyrov longitudinal force x f k was calculated by the integration of pressure of incident waves over the wetted surface area of a ship in calm water and the upright condition further this equation neglects added mass and damping forces the comparison of oscillatory ship motion in surge sway and yaw between the measured and estimated results is shown in fig a1 the left side of fig a1 is the results under resting conditions and the right side is those with forward speed the spring coefficients of the estimation with the springs in each direction were made correspond with those of the captive model test this figure shows that the influence of the springs appears in long wavelength of χ d 150 and 180 for surge motion and in long wavelength of χ d 60 150 for sway motion according to the estimation in contrast yaw motion is not significantly affected by the springs further fig a1 shows that the estimation results approximately agree with the measured results although some measured motions are closer to the estimation without the springs than that with the springs the author avoid further companions in this study it is because the difference is related to the estimation accuracy of the calculation methods since the wave drift forces are small under the wave conditions in which the ship motion is affected by the springs as shown in fig 10 the influence of the springs on the measured wave drift forces would be small fig a1 comparison of ship oscillation in regular waves between measured one by captive model test and estimated one by stf method left zero forward speed right straight moving condition at design speed fig a1 appendix b directional stability analysis for the subject ship applying the autopilot this appendix describes directional stability analysis in order to investigate whether the equilibrium conditions in wind and waves were stable before the analysis in disturbance the authors numerically determined the directional stability in calm water for the subject ship applying the autopilot with references to yasukawa and sakuno 2020 ohiwa and umeda 2016 and umeda et al 2016 as shown in eq 14 the equations of motion in calm water are given by the eq b 1 b 1 m m x u m v r m x g r 2 r x h x p x r m m y v m x g r m u r y h y r i z z j z z r n h n r x g y h y r where subscripts h p and r are the hydrodynamic forces the force acting on a hull due to the propeller and the forces due to rudder respectively the unknown valuables are longitudinal and lateral ship speeds u and v and rudder angle δ δ applying the autopilot is given by the eq b 2 according to eq 13 b 2 δ k p ψ χ k d r where ψ χ is the difference of yaw angle between the actual heading and the designated one thus the unknown valuables are converted to u v r and ψ χ and equations eq b 1 can be solved for them by adding the relation that b 3 ψ χ r the matrix of eqs b 1 and b 3 are represented as b 4 x m 1 f where b 5 m m m x 0 0 0 0 m m y m x g 0 0 0 i z z j z z 0 0 0 0 1 x u v r ψ χ f r x h x p x r t a m v r m x g r 2 y h y r m u r n h n r x g y h y r r when m 1 f is defined as b 6 m 1 f x y n r the jacobi matrix is represented as b 7 j x u x v x r x ψ χ y u y v y r x ψ χ n u n v n r n ψ χ r u r v r r r ψ χ when all real parts of the eigenvalues of the jacobi matrix are negative the ship is stable for u v r and ψ χ since x y and n are nonlinear it is difficult to obtain the analytical solution of their partial differentiations in the jacobi matrix therefore they were numerically calculated by assuming that x y and n are locally linear around the equilibrium conditions the calculation can be described as eq b 8 by taking x u as the example b 8 x u x u u e ε u v v e r r e ψ χ ψ χ e x u u e ε u v v e r r e ψ χ ψ χ e 2 ε u where u e v e r e and ψ χe are the values at the equilibrium conditions the equilibrium conditions in calm water satisfy that u e v e r e ψ χe design speed 0 0 0 the value of ε u was set to be sufficiently small comparing with u e the variation in the largest values of real parts of the eigenvalues for eq b 7 for the subject ship with proportional gain k p are shown in fig b1 the calculations were model scale and the full scale condition was with operational limit of mcr fig b1 shows that the subject ship with k p about 0 65 or over can be directionally stable in calm water even without differential control although the differential control with k d 2 86s can make the ship stable regardless of k p in order to validate the directional stability analysis using the eigenvalues the authors secondly theoretically determined the directionally stable condition in calm water for the subject ship applying the autopilot by using the second order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 fossen 1944 showed based on the first order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 that p controller will not stabilize an open loop unstable ship in contrast nomoto 1959 pointed out that large t 1 and or t 2 deteriorates the directional stability in the control system and large t 3 yields the better stability since the stabilization effect of t 3 is considerable the first order approximation k t model which is valid for representing ship manoeuvrability itself would not be suitable to discuss the stability problems of autopilot further nomoto 1966 pointed out that considering that the actual course keeping operation is a succession of initial stages of faint turning motions it is not surprising to see that t 3 contributes considerably to the course keeping quality as the matter of fact koyama et al 1978 clarified using the second order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 that even if in cases of unstable ships if the degree is not so inferior and then the absolute of t 1 is rather larger than t 3 there is the region where phase lag is smaller than π if the gain is adjusted so as that the cut off frequency exists with in this region of frequency the system will become stabile only by proportional control thus the authors theoretically determined the directionally stable condition using the second order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 which is theoretically stricter than the first order model rudder normal force defined by eq 15 can be approximated with eq b 9 by assuming that δ v and r are sufficiently small b 9 f n 0 5 ρ a r f α u r 2 δ γ r u β r l r u r in this equation the term of v pr u r was omitted by assuming that it was included in δ since u r is a known value when the propeller rotational speed and the longitudinal ship speed u are given eq b 9 can be considered as a linear equation for δ β and r therefore the equation of motion eq 14 in calm water for sway and yaw directions can also be linearized for δ β and r as eq b 10 by substituting eq b 9 b 10 m m x v m x g r y β β y r m u r y δ δ i z z j z z r n β x g y β β n r x g y r r n δ x g y δ δ where y δ and n δ are defined as b 11 y

0 5 ρ a r f α u r x r a h x h γ r u n r n r 0 5 ρ a r f α u r x r a h x h γ r l r thus y β n β y r and n r can be regarded as the hydrodynamic derivatives considering the effect of directional stabilization on y β n β y r and n r due to the existence of a rudder with the zero rudder angle yumuro 1978 the second order linear nomoto s model in yaw for eq b 10 is represented as eq b 13 by transforming the simultaneous differential equations shown by eq b 10 to an equation without using v and v and by approximating that β v u in eq b 10 b 13 t 1 t 2 r t 1 t 2 r r k δ k t 3 δ where t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the time constants of steering quality and k is the static yaw rate gain further t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k and kt 3 are defined as b 14 t 1 t 2 m m y i z z j z z y β n r x g y r y r m m x u n β

when k d 0s eq b 15 is represented as b 16 t 1 t 2 d ψ χ d t t 1 t 2 ψ χ k t 3 k p 1 ψ χ k k p ψ χ 0 the characteristic equation for eq b 16 is given as b 17 a 3 λ 3 a 2 λ 2 a 1 λ a 0 0 where λ is the root of the characteristic equation and a 3 a 2 a 1 and a 0 are defined as b 18 a 3 t 1 t 2 a 2 t 1 t 2 a 1 k t 3 k p 1 a 0 k k p the hurwitz s stable conditions for the third order characteristic equation hurwitz 1895 are i the signs of a 3 a 2 a 1 and a 0 are the same ii a 2 a 1 a 3 a 0 0 here k p is defined as to be positive further the signs of t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k and kt 3 for directionally unstable ships are negative thus the condition to satisfy the condition i can be simplified as b 19 a 1 k t 3 k p 1 0 thus the following condition for k p is obtained b 20 k p 1 k t 3 eq b 21 can be obtained by substituting eq b 18 for the condition ii b 21 t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k k p t 1 t 2 thus the other conditions for k p are given as b 22 k p t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k for t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k 0 b 23 k p t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k for t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k 0 since the sign of t 1 t2 for directionally unstable ships is negative eq b 23 requires the condition that k p 0 this condition contradicts with the definition that k p is positive thus the case of eq b 23 cannot exist eq b 24 can be obtained by approximating β in the second equation of eq b 10 with v u and then by solving it for v b 24 v u n β x g y β i z z j z z r n r x g y r r n δ x g y δ δ further eq b 24 can be transformed to the following equation by substituting eqs b 2 and b 3 b 25 v u n β x g y β i z z j z z ψ χ n r x g y r n δ x g y δ k d ψ χ n δ x g y δ k p ψ χ since eq b 25 means that v can be represented as a function of ψ χ and the derivatives v also converges when ψ χ converges as the result when k p satisfies the conditions of eqs b 20 and b 22 the directional unstable ships with p law can be stable for v r and ψ χ in calm water the conditions of k p corresponding to eqs b 20 and b 22 for the subject ship is calculated as eq b 26 by using the coefficients listed tables 3 and 6 b 26 k p 0 376 f r o m e q b 20 k p 0 660 f r o m e q b 22 thus k p 0 660 please note that this result is the average for γ r and γ r since t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k and kt 3 depend on γ r and γ r depends on the sign of v rl r this criterion agrees with that numerically determined using the eigenvalues as shown in fig b1 the slight difference would be caused that the equation of motion in surge direction is neglected in the analysis using the second order linear nomotio s model thus the validity of the directional stability analysis using the eigenvalues was confirmed further it is theoretically clarified that the subject ship with the p law of kp 2 0 is stable in calm water the reason why the directionally unstable subject ship can be stable in calm water using the p law with the small gain such as 0 660 would be that the degrees of directional instability is not strong as represented that c l 0 069 c l which defined by eq b 27 means the stability lever considering the directional stabilization due to existence of a rudder at the zero angle yumuro 1978 b 27 c l n r x g y r y r m m x u l n β x g y β y β this theoretical consideration supports the validity of the above mentioned conclusion of koyama et al 1978 based on the second order model that if the gain is adjusted so as that the cut off frequency exists with in this region of frequency the system will become stabile only by proportional control since the frmt and the numerical simulation were carried out in wind and waves the authors lastly numerically determined the directional stability in the disturbance for the subject ship with p law of k p 2 0 according to the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues the eigenvalues can be calculated using the similar procedures to those in calm water by changing f in eq b 5 to eq b 28 b 28 f r x h x p x r t a m v r m x g r 2 x w d x a y h y r m u r y w d y a n h n r n w d n a x g y h y r y a r note that the averaged values of the wave drift forces and the moment in irregular waves x w d y w d and n w d and the wind forces and the moment x a y a and n a depend on ship motion such as u v and ψ χ thus the partial differentiations of x y and n in eq b 7 as the components of the jacobi matrix include the influence of the disturbance the largest value of real part of the calculated eigenvalues in the disturbance is shown in fig b2 the waves were short crested irregular waves and the sea state was bf 9 further the calculations were model scale and the full scale condition was with operational limit of mcr fig b2 shows that the largest value of real part of the eigenvalues is negative regardless of the direction of wind and waves and thus the subject ship model with k p k d 2 0 0 0 is stable under the equilibrium condition in the sea state and the full scale conditions although the numerical determination of the directional stability in the disturbance was carried out only for this sea state and the full scale conditions the fact that all of the fmrt results in section 5 and the corresponding time simulations converged to certain equilibrium conditions implies that they would also be stable fig b1 variation in the largest values of real parts of the eigenvalues with proportional gain in calm water model scale full scale ship condition

numerical simulation in order to investigate the influence of gains for rudder control on manoeuvring motion the authors carried out numerical simulation shown in section 4 with the different gains the simulation was in model scale the waves were short crested irregular waves the sea state was bf 9 and the full scale condition was with operational limit of mcr the proportional and differential gains k p k d were set to 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 and 2 0 2 86s 30 0s in full scale respectively thus the simulation result of k p k d 2 0 0 0 corresponds with the green long dashed line in fig 15 the estimated ship speed ratio v v 0 the drift angle β and the rudder angle δ in steady equilibrium conditions are shown in fig c1 note that the model scale simulation results in fig c1 are shown using not lines but marks and therefore the meaning of the marks is different from those in figs 14 and 15 indicating the full scale simulation result fig c1 shows that k p affects the direction of wind and waves relative to a ship under the equilibrium condition χ for each designated angle χ d but the relations between χ and v v 0 β or δ are almost the same the differential control does not affect the estimation of χ for each χ d as long as k p are the same but the time history to achieve the equilibrium condition depends on k d as shown in fig c2 the numerical simulation neglects oscillatory ship motion and thus the time averaged values in frmt are not always the case judging from the reasonable agreements of the frmt data with the numerical simulation as shown in fig 15 the response of the time averaged manoeuvring motions versus χ in frmt and the manoeuvring limit in adverse weather obtained as a consequence of them would not also be affect by the gains in contrast to the time averaged values note that the fluctuating components in yaw motion and rudder angle are affected by the gains fig c1 comparison of ship speed drift angle and rudder angle in steady equilibrium conditions

21678,the ship manoeuvrability in actual seas with both wind and waves especially in adverse weather conditions for a full scale tanker with different maximum available power of the engine is studied it is directly evaluated based on the result of a free running model test frmt under a course keeping manoeuvre in long crested and short crested irregular waves of beaufort scale force bf 7 10 the frmt combines rudder effectiveness and speed correction considering the operational limit of an engine and a wind load simulator both of which were previously proposed by the authors therefore not only the effect of waves but also effect of wind rudder effectiveness of the full scale ship and the engine limit for continuous operation are considered in the frmt to validate the reliability of the direct evaluation method in frmt and the measured data in irregular waves of large amplitude the time averaged manoeuvring motion of the frmt at bf 9 is compared with ship manoeuvring motion under steady equilibrium conditions estimated using numerical simulation based on a modular mathematical model the wave drift forces and moment in the simulation are determined on the basis of the results of the captive model test in regular waves which is carried out using the same tanker model before the frmt so that we can eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible the comparison shows the frmt results acceptably agree with the simulation results although a discrepancy is observed in the rudder angle in beam seas for the tanker with a low engine output further frmt data themselves show that full scale rudder effectiveness operational limit of an engine and the engine with lower power cause the ship speed to decrease and the drift angle and the rudder angle to increase in head bow or beam seas because of the difference in the propeller rotational speed in each model control condition in addition it was clarified that operational limit of an engine also affects the significant single amplitudes of the fluctuating components of them and the oscillatory ship motion next the authors assess the manoeuvring limit in adverse weather by comparing the frmt data of the time averaged values of the longitudinal ship speed as well as the drift and rudder angles in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 with their thresholds the assessment clarifies that the tanker becomes unmanoeuvrable at bf 9 10 and in head bow or beam seas owing to a lack of sufficient advancing speed however the limit is not attributable to the drift or rudder angle although the lower power engine worsens the course keeping ability owing to the decrease in the ship speed and the increase in the drift and rudder angles furthermore the tanker is manoeuvrable in any wind and waves directions at bf 8 which is defined as adverse weather conditions for this subject ship in the interim guideline imo 2013 it indicates that the tanker has sufficient margin of the engine power to keep manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions in summary these findings reflect the possibility that frmt can replace numerical simulation

water thus far however estimation of ship manoeuvring motion in waves is important in terms of safety because ships in actual seas are affected by waves in particular it has become necessary to estimate ship manoeuvrability in large wave height in recent years because of the implementation of the interim guidelines for determining the minimum propulsion power required to maintain manoeuvrability in adverse weather imo 2013 in numerical simulations of ships manoeuvring in waves ignoring oscillatory wave forces and moments can effectively simplify the simulation model nonaka 1990 a simulation method considering wave drift forces in a mathematical model for calm water such as the manoeuvring modelling group mmg model of a modular mathematical type ogawa et al 1977 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 enables us to approximately estimate the slowly varying ship manoeuvring motion in waves hirano et al 1980 yasukawa 2006 on the basis of such a method shigunov 2015 estimated steady equilibrium conditions in adverse weather in the horizontal plane for a full scale ship and assessed the ship and disturbance conditions in which the ship reached the manoeuvring limit owing to the advancing speed rudder angle or engine power however he compared only wave drift forces and a moment at zero advancing speed used in the calculation with model test data and the estimated ship motions were not validated umeda et al 2016 calculated the propeller rotational speed and the manoeuvring motion for a bulk carrier model whose ship speed became zero under course keeping manoeuvre in wind and irregular waves in head or bow seas although they compared the simulation results with the free running model test frmt data and found the estimated propeller rotational speed to be in good agreement in head seas the differences in oblique seas where wave drift sway force and yaw moment are significant were considerable yasukawa et al 2017 also evaluated the course keeping and course changing abilities in irregular waves and steady wind for a full scale tanker with two different engine outputs via numerical simulation that was proposed previously yasukawa et al 2015 they approximated the wave drift sway force and yaw moment to those at zero ship speed calculated by a 3d panel method kashiwagi et al 2003 through comparison with frmt data yasukawa et al 2015 clarified that the simulation model could approximately estimate turning motion in irregular waves of 6 0 m significant wave height in full scale however there is no guarantee that the simulation model can reasonably estimate the full scale ship performance in adverse weather because full scale ship motion in adverse weather is susceptible to wave drift forces that become more dominant compared to hull resistance propeller thrust and rudder force owing to a large decrease in the ship speed and reduced rudder effectiveness thus the approximation of a wave drift sway force and yaw moment needs to be verified carefully in adverse weather and at the full scale although the above mentioned simulation data are helpful to provide insights into full scale ship manoeuvring limits in adverse weather conditions these researches suggest numerical simulations for them are still under development although frmt is time consuming and expensive compared to numerical simulation it can directly provide crucial information about manoeuvring on the basis of the measured ship motion because it is a type of physical simulator however it cannot directly determine the full scale ship performance for the following reasons the first reason for this is the scale effect on manoeuvring motion in free running ship models the root cause is the difference of reynolds numbers that is the dissimilarity in longitudinal resistance in calm water larger non dimensional propeller thrust and the rotational speed are required for the ship models to achieve the same froude number compared with the full scale ships because of the dissimilarity the difference of the propeller loading condition leads larger non dimensional inflow velocity to a rudder to the ship models as the result the non dimensional normal force of a rudder of ship models become larger than that of the full scale ships and thus their manoeuvring motions become dissimilar the second reason is that frmt is usually carried out with simplified propulsion conditions such as constant propeller rotational speed constant propeller torque or power viviani et al 2013 thus detailed engine responses of the full scale ship such as involuntary decrease in the engine rotational speed to avoid overloading conditions are not considered in frmt given the situations frmt has been mainly performed only to validate a numerical simulation method at the model scale thus far while full scale ship manoeuvrability eventually needs to be estimated on the basis of the simulation method studies have reported the effects of the engine characteristics on propulsion performance through model tests nakamura and naito 1977 kitagawa et al 2015 however they are not applicable to frmt with steering as they do not consider the scale effect on rudder effectiveness given the above mentioned background the objective of the present study is to enable frmt to directly evaluate full scale ship manoeuvring motion especially under adverse weather conditions by addressing the above mentioned shortcomings of frmt to this end the authors have proposed the following frmt methods tsukada et al 2013 2014 developed a duct fan auxiliary thruster that can enable a free running model to control propeller rotational speed independent of the ship speed ueno and tsukada 2015 and ueno et al 2017 proposed an frmt method using the duct fan auxiliary thruster namely a rudder effectiveness and speed correction method to ensure that the manoeuvring motions of models are similar to those of full scale ships rudder effectiveness and speed correction controls both duct fan auxiliary thruster and propeller rotational speed of a ship model depending on the time varying ship speed they clarified that propeller rotational speed in the correction method is neither at the model self propulsion point nor at the full scale self propulsion point these studies on the rudder effectiveness and speed correction did not consider the engine responses of the full scale ship i e the full scale ship was assumed to be running with the designated propeller rotational speed at full scale self propulsion point suzuki et al 2019 proposed a rudder effectiveness and speed correction method with consideration of the engine limit for continuous operation as the engine response in a full scale ship has a significant impact on manoeuvring motions they validated the method by comparisons of frmt and numerical simulation using the mmg based model kose et al 1981 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in addition they demonstrated the impact of the operational limit of an engine on a vlcc under turning circular motion in calm water and course keeping manoeuvre in regular waves in adverse weather both wind and waves affect ship manoeuvrability thus the influence of wind also needs to be considered in frmt generating the intended wind field by wind blowers is one possible approach however wind blowers cannot generate the intended uniform wind field in a wide space where the distance between a ship model and a wind blower varies yoshimura and nagashima 1985 fujiwara et al 2008 although the above mentioned study by umeda et al 2016 deals with frmt using a wind blower it considers only the case in which the distance between the ship model and the wind blower is nearly constant to realize frmt considering wind loads tsukada et al 2017 2018 developed a wind load simulator that does not generate environmental wind but exerts intended forces equivalent to wind loads on a ship model by six duct fans with the same type of the auxiliary thruster they verified via frmt that the wind load simulator can exert the intended force and moment in both calm water and regular waves this paper addresses a specific method in view of the final objective i e direct evaluation of full scale ship manoeuvrability in wind and waves using free running ship models as well as its applications first the authors describe the aspects of the frmt method for direct evaluation which is a combination of the rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine and the wind load simulator and outlines are provided for each of them second the authors describe the practical conditions of the captive model test and frmt using the direct evaluation method demonstrated in this paper and the subject tanker kvlcc1 although the captive model test is directly unnecessary for model control in frmt it is carried out to clarify the wave drift forces on the tanker exactly before the frmt the measured wave drift forces are used for ship manoeuvring simulation in waves which is described in section 4 so that we can eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible the purpose of frmt is to validate the direct evaluation method to evaluate the full scale ship manoeuvring limit of the tanker in adverse weather conditions and to investigate the effect of the engine output on the limit the frmt is the course keeping manoeuvre in irregular waves with simulated uniform wind the model control conditions include model self propulsion point and the rudder effectiveness and speed correction with and without consideration of operational limit of an engine for continuous operation moreover three different ranges of the operational limit i e maximum available engine power are assumed in the case with consideration of the limit third the authors describe the mmg based numerical simulation model kose et al 1981 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 used in this study to estimate the equilibrium conditions in wind and waves in the horizontal plane for the full scale ship and the ship model the basic objectives of the numerical simulation are theoretical confirmation of the direct evaluation method in frmt and verification as to whether the frmt results are reasonable even in irregular waves of large amplitude which have not been investigated in the previous studies suzuki et al 2019 tsukada et al 2017 2018 instead of comparison with full scale trials in actual seas finally the authors present the results of the captive model test frmt and the numerical simulation together moreover the authors assess the manoeuvring limit in adverse weather conditions depending on whether the mean ship responses in frmt exceed the thresholds on the ship speed drift angle and helm angle the reasonable agreement of the time averaged manoeuvring motions in long crested and short crested irregular waves as well as uniform wind of beaufort scale force bf 9 between the frmt and the simulation clarifies the reliability of the direct evaluation method in frmt with the measured ship responses assessment of the manoeuvring limit of the tanker shows how the weather conditions and the engine output affect the limit these results reflect the possibility that frmt can replace numerical simulation as a direct evaluation method of full scale ship manoeuvring motion and limits in adverse weather 2 outline of free running model test to evaluate full scale ship manoeuvring motion in wind and waves in this paper the prime symbol on a variable indicates the non dimensional value length mass force moment time translational speed and angular speed are divided by l ρl 3 ρgl 3 ρgl 4 l v 0 v 0 and v 0 l respectively in accordance with froude s law of similarity l is the length between perpendiculars g is the gravitational acceleration ρ is the density of a fluid and v 0 is the design ship speed fig 1 shows the coordinate system used in this paper where o xyz is a ship fixed frame whose origin corresponds to the midship u and v are the longitudinal and lateral ship speeds respectively and r is the yaw angular velocity the resultant ship speed v and drift angle β are defined by eq 1 using u and v 1 v u 2 v 2 β tan 1 v u for u 0 tan 1 v u 180 for u 0 v 0 tan 1 v u 180 for u 0 v 0 x y and n are the longitudinal and lateral forces and yaw moment respectively on a ship about the midship δ and f n are the rudder angle and the normal force respectively χ denotes the wave and true wind direction relative to a ship in this paper 0 χ 22 5 22 5 χ 67 5 67 5 χ 112 5 112 5 χ 157 5 and 157 5 χ 180 are defined as head waves seas bow waves beam waves quartering waves and following waves respectively u

origins of χ and χ a correspond with the ship heading and clockwise is defined as the positive direction the scaled waves generated in accordance with froude s law of similarity by the wave generator are assumed as usual to ensure similarity of the wave loads acting on ships in any type of waves such as regular waves long crested and short crested irregular waves without any correction furthermore rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine suzuki et al 2019 and a wind load simulator tsukada et al 2017 2018 can ensure the similarity of manoeuvring motion and effects of the engine limit and wind loads thus frmt using both the correction method and the wind load simulator in waves allows direct measurement of ship motions corresponding to those of the full scale ship in wind and waves note that the method of suzuki et al 2019 does not consider the engine response fluctuation with high frequency corresponding with that in oscillatory ship motion ueno and tsukada 2016 and ueno et al 2019 proposed a method to estimate the full scale ship engine torque including the high frequency response on the basis of frmt data using rudder effectiveness and speed correction consideration of the high frequency engine response in frmt can be accomplished by real time control using their methods however it has been ignored because slowly varying ship manoeuvring motion does not change significantly even if the high frequency fluctuation exceeds the engine limit for a second as long as the average engine response does not exceed it furthermore the approach of suzuki et al 2019 allows the consideration of other engine limits such as limits on the amount of fuel injection tsujimoto et al 2013 or overload limit man b w diesel 2006 as long as the engine torque fluctuation with high frequency is ignored however these are ignored and only the limit for continuous operation is considered as engine limit in this study for simplification the following sections discuss the determination of the control variables for rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine and the wind load simulator they are the outlines of the works of ueno and tsukada 2015 ueno et al 2017 suzuki et al 2019 and tsukada et al 2017 2018 2 1 rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine in rudder effectiveness and speed correction the similarity in the manoeuvring motion is approximated by similarities in both the apparent longitudinal force on a ship and the effective inflow velocity to a rudder in the longitudinal direction u r at arbitrary ship speed in the longitudinal direction u as shown in eq 3 ueno and tsukada 2015 and ueno

auxiliary thruster tsukada et al 2013 2014 and r is the hull resistance in calm water the subscripts m and s denote variables at the model scale and full scale respectively rudder effectiveness and speed correction controls propeller rotational speed of a ship model n m and t a in accordance with the instantaneous longitudinal speed of the ship model u m to be measured in frmt so that it can satisfy eq 3 arbitrary mathematical models are available to formulate t r and u r here t and r are calculated by eqs 4 and 5 4 t ρ n 2 d p 4 k t ρ n 2 d p 4 c k t 0 c k t 1 j c k t 2 j 2 5 r ρ s w u 2

curve the propeller advance ratio j can be calculated as 6 j 1 w p u n d p where w p is the wake fraction at the propeller position further u r is calculated using the mathematical model proposed by kose et al 1981 7 u r ε 1 w p u η 1 κ 1 8 k t π j 2 1 2 1 η where ε is the ratio of the wake coefficient at the rudder position to that at the propeller position η is the ratio of d p to the rudder height h r and κ is a coefficient related to the speed increase ratio of the propeller slipstream at the rudder position eqs 3 5 and 7 can be solved for n m and t a at arbitrary u when propeller rotational speed of the full scale ship n s with u as a parameter is given since n s can be an arbitrary value a constant or a function of time or of any other quantity and it represents the operational condition for a full scale ship the low frequency variation in n s with u owing to the engine limit for continuous operation can be considered in frmt through this relation suzuki et al 2019 further the relation can be determined by calculating n s at which the full scale ship brake power p b corresponds with the limit p b lim at arbitrary u suzuki et al 2019 assuming a low cycle

the engine rotational speed is assumed to be equal to the propeller rotational speed n the variables with the subscript mcr are those at the maximum continuous rating mcr 2 2 wind load simulator wind load simulators control longitudinal and lateral forces and the yaw moment equivalent to the wind loads using eq 9 tsukada et al 2017 2018 9 x a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 a f c x a χ a y a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 a l c y a χ a n a 0 5 ρ a u a 2 a l l o a c n a χ a where ρ a is the density of air further a f a l and l oa are the longitudinal and lateral projected areas of the ship structure above water and the length overall respectively these are known values several reliable tools such as model test data empirical formulas and computational fluid dynamics cfd can be used to determine the wind load coefficients c xa c ya and c na they are necessary to be given as functions of χ a in advance of frmt u a and χ a are calculated using eq 2 true wind direction and the speed u t are also needed to be designated in advance of frmt in contrast resultant ship speed v drift angle β and yaw angle ψ are from instantaneous measured values in frmt χ is defined as the difference between true wind direction and ψ in frmt the instantaneous c xa c ya and c na are interpolated using the calculated χ a from those given in advance of the frmt therefore the wind load simulator can generate time varying wind loads considering the changes in u a and χ a owing to instantaneous manoeuvring motions v χ and β the wind load simulator consists of six duct fans on a ship model with the same type of the auxiliary thruster and the intended wind loads estimated by eq 9 are assigned to each duct fan according to the longitudinal positions relative to a ship model in addition it can simulate the heel moment by setting the duct fans for lateral force at the designated height 3 model test program the test site for both the captive model test and frmt was the actual sea model basin tanizawa et al 2010 at the national maritime research institute in japan where 382 units of segmental flap type wave generators surround the water surface of the basin they can generate various types of waves such as regular long crested and short crested irregular waves and other waves including concentrating and transient waves in addition they absorb incoming waves while generating waves 3 1 subject ship the subject ship was the kvlcc1 tanker its profile is shown in fig 2 and its specifications are listed in table 1 as a full scale version of this ship has not been built and the profile of the superstructure has not been designed the authors employed values estimated by kitamura s regression formulas 2017 using only length overall l oa breadth b and ship type for the longitudinal and lateral projected areas of the ship structure above water a f and a l in addition wind load coefficients c xa c ya and c na about the midship shown in fig 3 were estimated by fujiwara s formulas 2005 with the parameters in kitamura s regression formulas 2017 as inputs in this study the tanker was assumed to be equipped with one of three engines with the different maximum output depending on the navigational speed in calm water respectively as listed table 2 the brake power at the design speed in calm water was estimated in accordance with the procedures of the international towing tank conference ittc performance committee 1978 using the coefficients listed in table 3 the regression models of wave making resistance c w and torque coefficient k q were given by eqs 10 and 11 respectively 10 c w c w 0 c w 1 f n c w 2 f n 2 c w 3 f n 3 c w 4 f n 4 11 k q c k q 0 c k q 1 j c k q 2 j 2 where f n is the froude number the roughness allowance δc f the full scale characteristics for the thrust coefficient k t and k q and the wake coefficient at the propeller position for the full scale ship 1 w p s were also calculated in accordance with the procedures of the ittc performance committee 1978 the frictional resistance coefficient of a flat plate c f0 was calculated according to the method of saunders et al 1957 the transmission efficiency η t and the relative rotative efficiency η r were assumed to be 0 98 and 1 0 respectively because the authors had no practical data to determine them all other unexplained coefficients in table 3 except for ε and κ were obtained from the captive model test results suzuki et al 2015 and 1 w p m was represented by those at model self propulsion point according to former literatures ittc 1978 nakatake and yamazaki 1977 the viscous effect on thrust deduction coefficient 1 t is negligible although 1 t depends on the propeller loading condition in a precise sense the authors neglected the variation it is because the maximum of the auxiliary thrust in the frmt was no more than 1 n and the difference of the auxiliary thrust caused by the variation in 1 t would be smaller for these reasons 1 t for the full scale was assumed to be equal to that for the model scale mcr in table 2 was estimated by considering 15 of the sea margin and engine margin respectively to the brake power at the design speed in calm water propeller rotational speed to achieve each maximum power of the engines corresponding with mcr 80 of mcr and 60 of mcr respectively in calm water listed table 2 were determined by considering 5 engine rotational speed margins on the respective propeller rotational speed estimated by calculation in the longitudinal equilibrium condition the authors assumed that the full scale ship would be equipped with a low cycle diesel engine the engine limits for the continuous operation defined by eq 8 with the maximum engine outputs listed table 2 are shown with the lines in fig 4 when the maximum power of an engine was either 80 or 60 of mcr the coefficients with the subscript mcr in eq 8 were replaced with those at 80 and 60 of mcr respectively in this study the authors supposed that brake power at the navigational conditions in calm water was simply reduced to 80 or 60 of the brake power at the design speed in calm water when a ship was equipped with a low power engine whose maximum output was 80 or 60 of mcr respectively the propeller rotational speed to obtain each brake power in calm water listed table 2 were also estimated by the same longitudinal equilibrium calculation further the navigational speed whose maximum output corresponded with 80 or 60 of mcr was also the result of the longitudinal equilibrium calculation although a propeller would be redesigned depending on the different design navigational speed in practice the propeller open characteristics were assumed to be the same in this study the authors assumed the ship was navigated with any constant propeller rotational speed at 78 24 rpm 72 37 rpm and 65 67 rpm as listed table 2 respectively as long as the brake power did not exceed each limit shown in fig 4 in this case the relations between n s and f n for kvlcc1 are given as fig 5 using the method described in section 2 1 suzuki et al 2019 hereinafter these conditions are referred to as with operational limit of mcr with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6mcr respectively furthermore propeller rotational speed fixed at 78 24 rpm which corresponds with the condition ignoring any operational limits of an engine at the design speed i e full scale self propulsion point is also shown in fig 5 and it is referred to as without operational limit 3 2 methods and conditions in captive model test the model in the captive model test was with the rudder but without the propeller the conceptual diagram of the equipment to measure the wave drift forces and the moment is shown in fig 6 the three component load cell located at the centre of gravity of a model measured surge and sway forces and the yaw moment acting on the model heave roll and pitch motions were free but surge sway and yaw motions were guided by spring mechanisms using servomotors the spring coefficients for surge sway and yaw motions were set to 0 510 n mm 1 43 n mm and 4 92 nm deg respectively the natural periods on surge sway and yaw motions for the mechanisms were sufficiently large in comparison with the wave encounter periods in the test according to appendix a oscillatory ship motion in surge and sway in long waves can be affected by the springs however the influence of the springs on the wave drift forces which used in the manoeuvring simulation would be small because wave drift forces are relatively small under the wave conditions in which the influence of the springs appears on the ship motion the wave was regular and the ratio of the wave height to the ship length 2ζ a l was 1 50 the ratio of the wavelength to the ship length λ l ranged from 0 3 to 3 0 the designated wave directions relative to a ship model χ d were from 0 to 180 at intervals of every 30 the towing speed was 0 m s and at the design speed of 0 76 m s the wave drift forces and moment were regarded as the differences of the time averaged values of the forces and the moment between in waves and in calm water at the same towing speed and drift angle conditions the intended drift angle at the design speed was 0 and the authors refer to this condition as straight moving condition although the intention was not ensured owing to unknown wave drift forces and moment the deviations were less than 1 0 throughout the test 3 3 methods and conditions in free running model test the general procedures of frmt in the basin can be found in the work of ueno et al 2017 the measured items and each instrument are summarized in table 4 fig 7 shows the condition of frmt using the duct fan auxiliary thruster the wind load simulator the duct fans for lateral wind forces were set at a height of 0 189 m from the water surface which is equal to the ratio of the wind heel moment to the lateral force estimated by fujiwara s formulas 2005 resultant ship speed v drift angle β and yaw angle ψ for the calculations of u a and χ a were measured by image processing using a ccd camera on the sub carriage tracking a ship model automatically ueno et al 2017 the authors confirmed that the operations of eqs 1 2 and 9 for one time step were within 0 05 s which corresponded with the sampling interval in the frmt the practical controls of a duct fan auxiliary thruster and wind load simulator to generate the intended forces are described by tsukada et al 2013 ueno et al 2017 and tsukada et al 2017 2018 note that duct fans for longitudinal force need to generate the sum of the longitudinal wind force and auxiliary thrust t a when using the wind load simulator and rudder effectiveness and speed correction simultaneously all of the frmt were under course keeping manoeuvre by autopilot in waves and simulated wind the waves were long crested or short crested irregular waves the frequency spectrum types of which were those specified by the international ship structure congress issc 1964 the directional distribution function for short crested irregular waves was the square of cosine the true wind was assumed to be steady and the true wind direction relative to a ship was assumed to correspond with that of the main wave direction although this assumption may not always result in the worst case for ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather both of the directions were represented by χ this assumption followed the most of theoretical studies on ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather yasukawa et al 2017 kadomatsu et al 1990 the simplified assessment in the interim guidelines imo 2013 also introduces this assumption although it defines only head sea condition the other reason was that manoeuvring limit was evaluated on the basis of the time averaged values and it would not be critically affected by fluctuating component of wind the authors therefore leave the investigation of the combination of wind and waves direction leading the worst case for ship manoeuvarability to a future work the significant wave height h 1 3 the mean wave period t 01 and the true wind speed u t were the equivalent values at bf 9 in the case of long crested irregular waves and those of short crested irregular waves ranged from bf 7 10 as shown in table 5 u t was approximated by the median in each bf and t 01 was calculated by eq 12 derived from a frequency spectrum for fully developed wind waves price and bishop 1974 12 t 01 3 86 h 1 3 the measured values of h 1 3 and t 01 at the centre of the basin are listed in table 5 comparisons of the measured frequency spectrums s w ω in long crested irregular waves at bf 9 and short crested irregular waves at bf 7 and 10 with the intended values are shown in fig 8 as representative examples where ω is the wave circular frequency the comparisons of the directional distribution functions d w χ in the case of short crested irregular waves are also shown in fig 8 table 5 and fig 8 clarify that the wave generators in the basin can generate intended wave fields with high accuracy the designated directions of the wind and waves relative to a ship model χ d were kept constant in each run and ranged from the head χ d 0 to quartering χ d 150 at intervals of every 30 the rudder angle δ for the autopilot was determined by eq 13 13 δ k p χ χ d k d r the proportional gain k p and the differential gain k d were set to 2 0 and 0 0 respectively the authors theoretically and numerically confirmed in appendix b that the subject ship with the gains are directionally stable in calm water further the authors numerically confirmed that the subject ship with the gains are stable in wind and waves for u v r and χ χ d under the equilibrium conditions see appendix b the reason why the subject ship can be stable even without the differential control would be that the degree of directionally unstable characteristics without steering in calm water yoshimura et al 2008 is not so inferior koyama et al 1978 in addition the propeller load the rudder angle and thus the rudder effectiveness in wind and waves are much larger than those in calm water further the numerical calculations of yasukawa and sakuno 2020 show that directionally unstable ship in calm water has the possibility to become stable in wind and waves under the equilibrium conditions even without steering although the numerical determination of the directional stability in the disturbance shown in appendix b was limited to some sea state and full scale conditions the fact that all of the fmrt results in section 5 and the corresponding time simulations converged to certain equilibrium conditions implies that they would also be stable since the major interest of this study was on the equilibrium conditions in wind and waves the authors investigated whether the control parameters of autopilot including those for d control have major effect on the equilibrium conditions or not on the basis of numerical simulation the results are shown in appendix c and it clarifies that the gains would not affect time averaged values in frmt note that in contrast the fluctuating components are influenced by the gains full scale ship conditions considered in frmt were those represented by the n s f n lines with the labels w o operational limit with operational limit of mcr with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6mcr as shown in fig 5 fig 9 shows the control parameters corresponding to each n s f n line for rudder effectiveness and speed correction i e propeller rotational speed of the ship model n m and the auxiliary thrust factor f ta which is the ratio of the auxiliary thrust t a to the skin friction correction sfc in addition to the ordinary frmt condition running at model self propulsion point with no correction they are the results for the calculation of eq 3 using the relations shown in fig 5 as the inputs and the coefficients listed in table 3 the values of the ratio of the wake coefficient at the rudder position to that at the propeller position ε and the coefficient related to the speed increase ratio of the propeller slipstream at the rudder position κ were obtained from the work of yoshimura et al 2008 the test results in long crested and short crested irregular waves at bf 9 for the ship model with no correction w o operational limit with operational limit of mcr and with operational limit of 0 8mcr were used for confirmation of the direct evaluation method in frmt by comparison with numerical simulation it was essential because the previous studies of rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine suzuki et al 2019 and the wind load simulator tsukada et al 2017 2018 had not been validated in irregular waves of large amplitude the test results in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 for the ship model with operational limit of mcr with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6mcr were used for evaluating the full scale ship manoeuvring limit in adverse weather conditions several runs were repeated for each set of conditions by changing the initial ship speed and the case that was the closest to a steady state condition was selected for analysis to fairly assess the effects of the weather conditions and operational limit of an engine on ship motion the ship model was run in the same wave train as much as possible by taking full advantage of the high repeatability and controllability of the actual sea model basin ueno et al 2013 on the other hand the ship model with operational limit of 0 8mcr was run in an additional wave train to clarify whether the measuring time is sufficiently long enough for evaluating irregular phenomena the time period for analysis of time averaged values and fluctuating components was 105 4 s on average although the finite time depends on the test conditions such as ship speed the sampling interval was set to 0 05 s 4 numerical simulation model comparison of frmt data using the direct evaluation method with full scale ship trials in actual seas is the most direct and certain way to enhance the reliability of the frmt method however as the authors do not have suitable full scale trial data the method was validated by comparisons with the numerical simulation result at full and model scales in this study the comparison with full scale trial data is a topic for future work note again that this numerical simulation estimated the steady equilibrium conditions with three degrees of freedom dof surge sway and yaw in wind and waves and it thus neglected the oscillatory ship motion with wave encounter frequency 4 1 mathematical model the equations of motion for surge sway and yaw about the centre of gravity are given by

interaction coefficients between a ship hull and the rudder dot above a variable represents the time derivative the total resistance coefficient c t and the thrust coefficient k t in eq 14 were calculated from eqs 5 and 4 respectively the rudder normal force f n can be represented as 15 f n 0 5 ρ a r f α u r 2 sin α r where a r is the movable rudder area and f α is the gradient of the rudder lift the effective inflow velocity to a rudder u r and the effective inflow angle to a rudder α r can be written as 16 u r u r 2 v r 2 α r δ tan 1 v r u r for u r 0 the effective inflow velocity to a rudder in the longitudinal direction u r was calculated using eq 7 and the lateral component v r was calculated using the following equation 17 v r v p r γ r v r l r where γ r is the flow straightening coefficient and l r is the hydrodynamic lever representing the yaw rate effect on the lateral inflow velocity to a rudder further v pr is the component of the lateral inflow velocity to a rudder induced by the propeller revolution in straight running since it was clarified the ratio of v pr to u r varies almost linearly with propeller slip ratio s kose et al 1981 fujii and tuda 1961 okada 1959 the ratio was given by the following equation kose et al 1981 18 v p r u r v p r 0 v p r 1 s where s is defined by eq 19 using the propeller advance ratio j and the propeller pitch p 19 s 1 j p d p when v r u r is small the second equation in eq 16 can be represented as eq 20 by substituting eq 17 20 α r δ v p r u r γ r v r l r u r thus the ratio of v pr to u r has the similar meaning with a rudder balancing angle for straight run the advantage using v pr is that the variation of the balancing rudder angle with propeller slip ratio can be automatically considered further since the propeller slip ratio s is dissimilar between the model and the full scale ship this assumption enables to consider the scale effect in the balancing angle since direct measurement of v r in captive model tests is difficult especially in oblique moving and or steady turning v r to determine γ r l r and v pr was obtained form mmg based analysis yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 using the captive mode test result of suzuki et al 2015 in this study instead of the direct flow measurement please note that yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 neglect v pr but the analysis procedure for v r is the same v pr corresponds with v r analysed in straight moving condition v r 0 in the analysis v pr is defined as a product of the tangent of the balancing angle δ fn0 and u r experimentally analysed in the straight run thus v pr in this study reflects all phenomena inducing the balancing angle such as not only tangential induced velocities but also an upwash at the propeller s disk and non uniformities of the wake over the propeller s disk according matsumoto and suemitsu 1980 the main reason why ships in calm water requires a rudder balancing angle for the straight run would be the unbalance of the rudder areas above and below the propeller axis and thus the resulting lateral inflow velocity to the rudder the variables in the numerical simulations are listed in tables 3 and 6 the hydrodynamic derivatives in table 6 are considered to have no scale effect further 1 t r a h and x h were obtained from the captive model test results suzuki et al 2015 and were represented by those at model self propulsion point γ r and l r were taken from the work of yoshimura et al 2008 the hydrodynamic derivatives for the ship hull were obtained from the test data of yoshimura et al 2008 and the 1 t r a h and x h values listed in table 6 since v pr depends on the position of the rudder with respect to the slipstream v pr0 and v pr1 were from the captive model test result of suzuki et al 2015 using the same tanker model kvlcc1 the auxiliary thrust t a and propeller rotational speed for the ship model n m were given by the values shown in fig 9 by contrast for full scale ships t a is zero and the propeller rotational speed n s was given by the value shown in fig 5 x a y a and n a are the wind forces and the moment in eq 14 the effects of waves were only considered as the averaged values of the wave drift forces and the moment in irregular waves x w d y w d and n w d hirano et al 1980 yasukawa 2006 the numerical simulation was a time domain simulation which solved the equations of motion eq 14 with the equation for the rudder control eq 13 for u v r and δ in each time step using runge kutta gill method the initial wind and waves direction relative to a ship χ and initial r were set to the designated angle χ d and zero respectively in accordance with the frmt and thus initial δ was zero further initial u was made correspond with the approach speed in each test case of frmt and initial v was zero the numerical simulation was continued until the translational and angular accelerations reached zeros and the condition was considered as the steady equilibrium condition the differences in the c f0 δc f k t and k q curves and 1 w p between a full scale ship and the model as shown in table 3 are the root cause for the scale effects in manoeuvring motion in this simulation the coefficients not only directly affect the non similarity in u r as shown in eq 7 but also lead to non similarity in propeller rotational speed at the same froude number i e the differences in the propeller advance ratio j and slip ratio s these differences make v pr non similar and lead to further non similarity in u r as shown in eqs 18 and 7 respectively as a result the rudder normal force f n becomes non similar 4 2 wind loads and wave drift forces wind loads x a y a and n a were calculated from eq 9 using the wind load coefficients shown in fig 3 and eq 2 as with a wind load simulator x w d y w d and n w d were expressed as the following equations by applying the short term production technique with wave drift forces and moment in regular waves x wd y wd and n wd and they denote the liner superpositions of x wd y wd and n wd maruo 1960 21 x w d 2 0 2 π 0 x w d ω χ v ζ a 2 s w ω d w χ d ω d χ y w d 2 0 2 π 0 y w d ω χ v ζ a 2 s w ω d w χ d ω d χ n w d 2 0 2 π 0 n w d ω χ v ζ a 2 s w ω d w χ d ω d χ where ζ a is the amplitude of regular waves the directional distribution function d w χ was 1 in long crested irregular waves some estimation methods such as kashiwagi et al 2003 may be available for x wd y wd and n wd however according to the purpose of the manoeuvring simulation in this study the captive model test results were used for them as mentioned above so that we can eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible the non dimensional forms of wave drift forces in regular and irregular waves were defined as eq 22 and the wave drift force coefficients were assumed to be independent of the wave height 22 x w d y w d x w d y w d 8 ρ g h 1 3 2 b 2 l n w d n w d 8 ρ g h 1 3 2 b l practical values for wave drift forces in regular and irregular waves are presented in the next section under the assumption of quasi steady treatment x w d y w d and n w d at each time step in the manoeuvring simulation were given by interpolation using the instantaneous values of the longitudinal ship speed u mean wave period t 01 and main wave direction χ 5 results and discussion 5 1 wave drift forces and the moment the wave drift force coefficients measured in regular waves c xwd c ywd and c nwd are shown in fig 10 this figure shows that c xwd at the design speed in head waves has a peak around λ l 1 0 and it is more significant than that at zero speed as with the abundant test data in longitudinal added resistance in head waves for blunt ships for example takahashi 1987 the peak shifts to short wavelength as the wave direction changes from head to beam waves c xwd at the design speed acts in the stern direction even in quartering or following waves of χ 120 150 and 180 the absolute value of c ywd becomes larger in short wavelength and in beam waves regardless of the ship speed the qualitative variation in c ywd with the wavelength is nearly the same between zero speed and the design speed the absolute value of c ywd at the design speed becomes slightly larger in bow waves and smaller in quartering waves than that at zero speed the absolute value of c nwd at zero speed tends to be larger in short wavelength but it is not as clear as c ywd compared with c ywd c nwd seems to be susceptible to the ship speed because the qualitative variation in c nwd with wavelength is different between zero speed and the design speed c nwd at the design speed under λ l 1 5 tends to shift to negative values compared to that at zero speed ueno et al 2001a 2000 reported that wave drift forces depend on drift angle of a ship β in order to quantify the effects for the subject ship kvlcc1 the authors compared the wave drift force coefficients at λ l 0 4 measured under straight moving condition without drift angle which is shown in fig 10 with the test data of suzuki et al 2019 fig 11 shows the towing conditions represented by ship speed v and drift angle β in suzuki et al 2019 as shown in fig 11 the test of suzuki et al 2019 was carried out under the conditions giving drift angle intentionally to a ship which is referred to as oblique moving condition in this paper the comparisons of wave drift forces are also shown in fig 11 this figure shows that the longitudinal force c xwd and the yaw moment c nwd under the oblique moving condition with drift angle are not significantly different from those in the straight moving condition without drift angle or zero forward speed in contrast there is an apparent difference in the lateral force c ywd in bow and beam waves the absolute value of c ywd under the oblique moving condition with drift angle is smaller than that under the straight moving condition without drift angle and zero forward speed in addition the absolute value of c ywd in bow and beam waves becomes small as drift angle increases note that the numerical simulation for manoeuvring motion in this study did not consider such an effect of the drift angle on wave drift forces since those in numerical simulation were approximated with those measured under the straight moving condition without drift angle therefore this may affect the estimation accuracy of the manoeuvring motion figs 12 and 13 show the time averaged values of the wave drift force coefficients in long crested and short crested irregular waves c x w d c y w d and c n w d calculated using eq 22 and the test data in regular waves shown in fig 10 respectively the characteristics of c y w d and c n w d in long crested and short crested irregular waves are similar to those in regular waves specifically the absolute value of c y w d increases in short waves and beam waves and the effect of ship speed on c n w d is more remarkable than that on c y w d 5 2 validation of the direct evaluation method in free running model test in long crested and short crested irregular waves the frmt data in the time averaged values for the ship speed ratio v v 0 the drift angle β and the rudder angle δ in long crested and short crested irregular waves at bf 9 are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively with wind and waves direction χ as the abscissa the tilde above a variable denotes the time averaged value fig 16 shows comparisons of the time averaged values of the measured control variables in the frmt that is propeller rotational speed auxiliary thrust and simulated wind loads with the intended values under the ship motion corresponding with the frmt conditions in figs 15 and 16 the two points are plotted for each χ for with operational limit of 0 8mcr in short crested irregular waves although they have a nearly identical value at each χ one of them at each χ is the test result for which the encounter waves were intentionally changed from the other these agreements of data in different encounter wave trains confirm that the measurement time for averaging is sufficiently long to represent the statistical mean of the ship motion in the irregular waves fig 16 confirms that the control of the ship model in the frmt worked as intended in all the cases in long crested and short crested irregular waves the frmt data in figs 14 and 15 show that the operational limit of an engine and the low power engine cause v v 0 to decrease and those in β and δ to increase in head bow or beam seas fig 16 suggests that these were caused by the difference in propeller rotational speed in each model control condition fig 17 shows significant single amplitudes of the fluctuating component in the speed ratioδv v 0 drift angle δβ rudder angle δδ in long crested and short crested irregular waves and uniform wind of bf 9 by frmt the significant single amplitude was defined in this study as the mean value of the largest one third response for local maximum relative to the time averaged value in the overall measured data shown in figs 14 and 15 since the proportional control of the autopilot included wave induced oscillation in yaw the fluctuating component in rudder angle δδ and that in yaw angle δψ satisfy the relation that δδ 2δψ fig 17 indicates that the difference in the encounter wave trains gives the unignorable difference to the significant single amplitude compared to the time averaged value shown in fig 15 this suggests that a longer measurement time or more repeated measurements in different encounter wave trains is preferable to get more statistically reliable data for fluctuating components even so fig 17 shows approximate tendencies in δv v 0 δβ and δδ regardless of the difference in the encounter wave trains fig 17 also shows that the model control conditions affect not only the time averaged values in ship motions but also the fluctuating components although the obvious trends in δv v 0 and δδ depending on the model ship control conditions could not be observed operational limit of an engine and the engine with lower power cause δβ to increase in head bow or beam seas as with the time averaged value β the numerical simulation results of v v 0 β and δ for both full and model scales are also shown in figs 14 and 15 owing to rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine the estimated ship motions for each engine limit condition at the model scale are similar to those at the full scale suzuki et al 2019 figs 14 and 15 clarify that the numerical simulation results describe the similar variations in v v 0 β and δ depending on the operational limit of an engine and the wave direction χ with those demonstrated using the frmt furthermore these simulation results approximately agree with the frmt data quantitatively which supports the validity of the direct evaluation method in frmt and the measured ship motions in the frmt comparing them in detail δ in long crested irregular beam waves for the model control condition referred to as with operational limit of 0 8mcr were overestimated in the simulation compared to frmt model control in frmt should not cause the difference as it was successful as shown in fig 16 to clarify the cause the authors compared the respective force components in the numerical simulation for the ship model with operational limit of 0 8mcr in long crested irregular waves the comparisons are shown in fig 18 this figure shows that forces induced by waves are dominant in the longitudinal and lateral direction compared to wind and the influence of external disturbances is smaller in the yaw direction compared to the hydrodynamic moment and the moment induced by steering these suggest that the rudder was steered to counteract the wave drift sway force that is the smaller the wave drift sway force is the smaller the estimated rudder angle becomes considering that the drift angle toward the leeside decreases the wave drift sway force in short regular waves compared with that in the straight moving condition see fig 11 the deviation of δ in the numerical simulation from frmt is presumed to be mainly caused by ignoring the effect of the drift angle on the wave drift forces in the numerical simulation actually the numerical simulation under course keeping manoeuvre in short regular waves using the wave drift forces measured with the drift angle corresponding with the frmt result shows quantitatively good agreement in δ even for a low engine output suzuki et al 2019 note that it is necessary to confirm whether the effect of the drift angle on the wave drift forces in irregular waves would be the same as those in short regular waves the reason that the deviation of δ was not observed in the other model control condition would be the smaller drift angle and that the accuracy in wave drift forces is less influential compared with the rudder forces by contrast the reason that the same difference as that in long crested irregular waves was not observed in short crested irregular waves cannot be identified thus far although the elementary waves from various directions could be related thus it is also necessary to investigate the quantitative impact on ship manoeuvring simulation in waves induced by the effect of drift angle on wave drift forces this is another topic for future work as such the effect of the drift angle on wave drift forces is automatically and explicitly reflected on the ship motion in frmt the frmt result would be closer to the full scale ship manoeuvrability compared to the simulation result 5 3 application of the direct evaluation method in free running model test for full scale ship manoeuvring limit in adverse weather conditions fig 19 shows the frmt data in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 using the tanker with the engine limit for continuous operation defined by mcr which corresponds to the model control condition referred to as with operational limit of mcr the radial coordinates represent either one of the time averaged values in the longitudinal ship speed converted to full scale u s with froude s law of similarity or the absolute values in the drift angle β or the rudder angle δ while the circumferential coordinate represents the time averaged value in the wind and waves direction χ the frmt data in the significant single amplitudes of fluctuating components in oscillatory ship motion in full scale represented by heave δζ roll δϕ and pitch motions δθ are shown in fig 20 fig 20 shows that u s decreases and β and δ increase when bf increases owing to larger external disturbance fig 20 shows the tendencies that δζ δϕ and δθ increase as bf increases although δϕ in quartering seas is not always consistent owing to the relation between the encounter period of waves and the natural period of roll for the model figs 21 24 show the frmt data corresponding to figs 19 and 20 for the tanker with operational limit of 0 8mcr and with operational limit of 0 6 mcr respectively the data with operational limit of 0 8mcr at bf 9 are the mean values of the test results in the different wave trains these figures show that the variations in these ship responses depending on bf are nearly similar regardless of the engine conditions but their magnitudes in both the time averaged values and the significant values of the fluctuating components are affected by operational limit of an engine as mentioned in section 5 2 specifically the low power engine cause u s to decrease and β and δ to increase in head bow or beam seas it means that the lower power engine worsens the course keeping ability in adverse weather conditions thresholds for the ship manoeuvring limit in u s β and δ are also shown in figs 19 21 and 23 the threshold in u s was defined as the larger of minimum navigational speed or minimum course keeping speed according to the interim guideline imo 2013 the minimum navigational speed is fixed at 2 06 m s 4 0 knots imo 2013 the minimum course keeping speed depends on the specifications of a ship such as windage area and lateral projected area of a rudder imo 2013 and that calculated for kvlcc1 was 3 00 m s therefore threshold in u s was set to 3 00 m s although the guideline requires only the assessment in head seas the authors applied the value to all wind and waves directions the thresholds in β and δ were set to 20 by following the proposal of takahashi and asai 1982 takahashi and asai 1982 set the limit of the mean value in rudder angle to 20 on the basis of free running model test results by considering the margin for fluctuating component in rudder angle due to wind and waves to the maximum steerable angle for ordinary ships 35 as shigunov 2018 proposed another possible limit for rudder angle is the maximum steerable angle in this case rudder angle should be compared by taking the fluctuating component as well as the mean value into account because rudder angle cannot exceed the limit even for a second the criterion for rudder angle would open question and the authors suppose that further investigation to determine the optimal criterion would be the future work the reason for setting the rudder angle limit on the mean value in this study is that it would be safer assessment than that with maximum steerable angle including the fluctuating component when u s was smaller than 3 00 m s or β or δ was larger than 20 the authors treated the ship as unmanoeuvrable in the weather conditions in addition to the thresholds in u s β and δ the maximum roll angle or the occurrence of propeller racing for example can be indices of the criteria in terms of seakeeping ability although the frmt enables their evaluation using oscillatory ship motions as shown figs 20 22 and 24 they were not considered in this study for simplification fig 19 shows that the tanker with operational limit of mcr becomes unmanoeuvrable at bf 10 in head seas or bow seas up to χ 45 because of a lack of sufficient advancing speed in addition figs 21 and 23 show that the unmanoeuvrable range expands to beam seas of χ 80 and bf 9 when the tanker is equipped with an engine with lower power it is also shown that the tanker does not become unmanoeuvrable owing to limits in drift or rudder angles even in the extremely rough weather conditions at bf 10 by contrast shigunov 2015 2018 reported the numerical simulation results in which the rudder angle in course keeping manoeuvre reaches the rudder angle limit in beam seas although the weather conditions or the ship type are not described the subject tanker kvlcc1 would also reach the rudder angle limit or drift angle limit in short waves as well as large waves as wave drift forces especially the lateral component become large in short waves as shown in figs 12 and 13 further using an engine with lower power than that supposed in this study can also be the cause of the rudder angle limit or drift angle limit although bf 8 is defined as adverse weather conditions for this subject ship in the interim guideline imo 2013 the tanker with the engine limits supposed in this study was manoeuvrable in any wind and waves directions at bf 8 thus the tanker with the original engine with operational limit of mcr has sufficient margin of the engine power to keep manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions note that these results are limited under the assumption that wind and main waves direction are the same thus additional tests changing the combination of wind and waves direction would be required as a future work in order to investigate whether the worst case for ship manoeuvrability can be approximately evaluated under this assumption 6 conclusions the ship manoeuvarability in actual seas with both wind and waves especially in adverse weather conditions for a full scale tanker with different maximum available power of the engine were studied they were directly evaluated based on the result of frmt combining rudder effectiveness and speed correction with consideration of operational limit of an engine and a wind load simulator both of which were previously proposed by the authors therefore not only the effect of waves but also effect of wind rudder effectiveness of the full scale ship and the engine limit for continuous operation were considered in the frmt before the frmt the authors first carried out a captive model test to measure the wave drift forces and the moment in regular waves at zero speed and the design speed under straight moving conditions for the tanker model the measured wave drift forces were used for numerical simulation of ship manoeuvring motion in waves although the captive model test results were directly unnecessary for the model control in the frmt method they enabled us to eliminate the estimation errors in the manoeuvring motion caused by the imprecision in the wave drift forces as much as possible furthermore the author confirmed that the wave drift sway force is affected by the hull drift angle in short regular waves via comparisons of the test data with the drift angle of suzuki et al 2019 as ueno et al 2001a 2000 clarified second the authors carried out frmt under the course keeping manoeuvre in long crested and short crested irregular waves with uniform wind at bf 7 10 using the same tanker model applied the direct evaluation method the model control conditions included model self propulsion point and rudder effectiveness and speed correction with and without consideration of operational limit of an engine for continuous operation moreover three different ranges of the engine limit i e maximum available engine power were assumed in the case with consideration of the limit the result confirmed that the model control worked as intended the frmt data in the time averaged values showed that full scale rudder effectiveness operational limit of an engine and the engine with lower power cause the ship speed to decrease and the drift angle and the rudder angle to increase in head bow or beam seas because of the difference in the propeller rotational speed in each model control condition in addition it was clarified that operational limit of an engine also affects the significant single amplitudes of the fluctuating components of them and the oscillatory ship motion the time averaged manoeuvring motion of the frmt at bf 9 were compared with that under steady equilibrium conditions estimated using numerical simulation of the mmg based model in the horizontal plane and the measured wave drift forces and the moment in regular waves it was intended to validate the reliability of the direct evaluation method in frmt and the measured data in irregular waves of the large amplitude which had not been investigated in the previous studies suzuki et al 2019 tsukada et al 2017 2018 instead of comparison with full scale trials the frmt results acceptably agreed with the simulation results although a discrepancy was observed in the rudder angle in beam seas for the tanker with a low engine output according to the measured wave drift forces and investigation of the force components in the simulation the quantitative discrepancy was presumed to be caused by ignoring the effect of the drift angle on the wave drift forces in the numerical simulation as this effect is automatically and explicitly reflected in the ship motion in frmt the frmt result will be closer to the full scale ship manoeuvrability compared to the simulation result it indicates that the direct evaluation method in frmt can be applied to the evaluation for the other types of full scale ships although all investigations were conducted with respect to the tanker kvlcc1 finally the authors evaluated the manoeuvring limit under the course keeping conditions in adverse weather on the basis of the comparison of the frmt data in the time averaged ship speed drift angle and rudder angle in short crested irregular waves at bf 7 10 with their thresholds the evaluation clarified that the tanker became unmanoeuvrable at bf 9 10 and in head bow or beam seas up to χ 80 owing to a lack of sufficient advancing speed and the unmanoeuvrable range was extended as the maximum output of the engine decreased by contrast the drift or rudder angle did not cause the manoeuvring limit although the lower power engine worsened the course keeping ability in adverse weather conditions furthermore the tanker with the engine limits supposed in this study was manoeuvrable in any wind and waves directions at bf 8 which is defined as adverse weather conditions for this subject ship in the interim guideline imo 2013 it indicates that the tanker has sufficient margin of the engine power to keep manoeuvrability in adverse weather conditions note that these results are limited under the assumption that wind and main waves direction are the same further these frmt result are based on the proportional control for autopilot thus the experimental investigation for the optimal control to maintain the ship manoeuvrability in adverse weather including the fluctuating components of ship motion would be the future work in summary this study reflects the possibility that frmt can replace numerical simulation as a direct evaluation method of full scale ship manoeuvring motion and limits in adverse weather comparison of these frmt data with full scale ship trials in actual seas could be a topic for future work as it is the most direct and certain way to enhance the reliability of the frmt method in addition development of an estimation tool for full scale ship manoeuvring motion in adverse weather conditions especially in terms of the effect of drift angle on wave drift forces by utilizing the frmt method could be another topic for future work credit authorship contribution statement ryosuke suzuki methodology software validation

ohtsubo kazuhisa in nmri for giving valuable comments on the analysis of directional stability appendix a estimation of oscillatory ship motion in regular waves in order to investigate influence of the spring mechanisms on the captive model test results the authors compared the oscillatory ship motion in surge sway and yaw between the measured results and estimated results without and with the springs the estimation of sway and yaw motions was performed on the basis of the stf salvesen tcuk faltinsen method salvesen et al 1970 which is one of the strip methods past studies validated the stf method can reasonably estimate oscillatory ship motion with 5 dof sway heave roll pitch and yaw under periodic steady state in regular waves for example ueno et al 2001b except for conditions in high speed or law encounter frequency of waves since the stf method does not include surge motion it was estimated using eq a 1 which considers only fluid klyrov force as the wave exciting force a 1 m ξ k 11 ξ x f k where k 11 is the spring coefficient in surge the fluid klyrov longitudinal force x f k was calculated by the integration of pressure of incident waves over the wetted surface area of a ship in calm water and the upright condition further this equation neglects added mass and damping forces the comparison of oscillatory ship motion in surge sway and yaw between the measured and estimated results is shown in fig a1 the left side of fig a1 is the results under resting conditions and the right side is those with forward speed the spring coefficients of the estimation with the springs in each direction were made correspond with those of the captive model test this figure shows that the influence of the springs appears in long wavelength of χ d 150 and 180 for surge motion and in long wavelength of χ d 60 150 for sway motion according to the estimation in contrast yaw motion is not significantly affected by the springs further fig a1 shows that the estimation results approximately agree with the measured results although some measured motions are closer to the estimation without the springs than that with the springs the author avoid further companions in this study it is because the difference is related to the estimation accuracy of the calculation methods since the wave drift forces are small under the wave conditions in which the ship motion is affected by the springs as shown in fig 10 the influence of the springs on the measured wave drift forces would be small fig a1 comparison of ship oscillation in regular waves between measured one by captive model test and estimated one by stf method left zero forward speed right straight moving condition at design speed fig a1 appendix b directional stability analysis for the subject ship applying the autopilot this appendix describes directional stability analysis in order to investigate whether the equilibrium conditions in wind and waves were stable before the analysis in disturbance the authors numerically determined the directional stability in calm water for the subject ship applying the autopilot with references to yasukawa and sakuno 2020 ohiwa and umeda 2016 and umeda et al 2016 as shown in eq 14 the equations of motion in calm water are given by the eq b 1 b 1 m m x u m v r m x g r 2 r x h x p x r m m y v m x g r m u r y h y r i z z j z z r n h n r x g y h y r where subscripts h p and r are the hydrodynamic forces the force acting on a hull due to the propeller and the forces due to rudder respectively the unknown valuables are longitudinal and lateral ship speeds u and v and rudder angle δ δ applying the autopilot is given by the eq b 2 according to eq 13 b 2 δ k p ψ χ k d r where ψ χ is the difference of yaw angle between the actual heading and the designated one thus the unknown valuables are converted to u v r and ψ χ and equations eq b 1 can be solved for them by adding the relation that b 3 ψ χ r the matrix of eqs b 1 and b 3 are represented as b 4 x m 1 f where b 5 m m m x 0 0 0 0 m m y m x g 0 0 0 i z z j z z 0 0 0 0 1 x u v r ψ χ f r x h x p x r t a m v r m x g r 2 y h y r m u r n h n r x g y h y r r when m 1 f is defined as b 6 m 1 f x y n r the jacobi matrix is represented as b 7 j x u x v x r x ψ χ y u y v y r x ψ χ n u n v n r n ψ χ r u r v r r r ψ χ when all real parts of the eigenvalues of the jacobi matrix are negative the ship is stable for u v r and ψ χ since x y and n are nonlinear it is difficult to obtain the analytical solution of their partial differentiations in the jacobi matrix therefore they were numerically calculated by assuming that x y and n are locally linear around the equilibrium conditions the calculation can be described as eq b 8 by taking x u as the example b 8 x u x u u e ε u v v e r r e ψ χ ψ χ e x u u e ε u v v e r r e ψ χ ψ χ e 2 ε u where u e v e r e and ψ χe are the values at the equilibrium conditions the equilibrium conditions in calm water satisfy that u e v e r e ψ χe design speed 0 0 0 the value of ε u was set to be sufficiently small comparing with u e the variation in the largest values of real parts of the eigenvalues for eq b 7 for the subject ship with proportional gain k p are shown in fig b1 the calculations were model scale and the full scale condition was with operational limit of mcr fig b1 shows that the subject ship with k p about 0 65 or over can be directionally stable in calm water even without differential control although the differential control with k d 2 86s can make the ship stable regardless of k p in order to validate the directional stability analysis using the eigenvalues the authors secondly theoretically determined the directionally stable condition in calm water for the subject ship applying the autopilot by using the second order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 fossen 1944 showed based on the first order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 that p controller will not stabilize an open loop unstable ship in contrast nomoto 1959 pointed out that large t 1 and or t 2 deteriorates the directional stability in the control system and large t 3 yields the better stability since the stabilization effect of t 3 is considerable the first order approximation k t model which is valid for representing ship manoeuvrability itself would not be suitable to discuss the stability problems of autopilot further nomoto 1966 pointed out that considering that the actual course keeping operation is a succession of initial stages of faint turning motions it is not surprising to see that t 3 contributes considerably to the course keeping quality as the matter of fact koyama et al 1978 clarified using the second order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 that even if in cases of unstable ships if the degree is not so inferior and then the absolute of t 1 is rather larger than t 3 there is the region where phase lag is smaller than π if the gain is adjusted so as that the cut off frequency exists with in this region of frequency the system will become stabile only by proportional control thus the authors theoretically determined the directionally stable condition using the second order linear nomoto s model nomoto et al 1957 which is theoretically stricter than the first order model rudder normal force defined by eq 15 can be approximated with eq b 9 by assuming that δ v and r are sufficiently small b 9 f n 0 5 ρ a r f α u r 2 δ γ r u β r l r u r in this equation the term of v pr u r was omitted by assuming that it was included in δ since u r is a known value when the propeller rotational speed and the longitudinal ship speed u are given eq b 9 can be considered as a linear equation for δ β and r therefore the equation of motion eq 14 in calm water for sway and yaw directions can also be linearized for δ β and r as eq b 10 by substituting eq b 9 b 10 m m x v m x g r y β β y r m u r y δ δ i z z j z z r n β x g y β β n r x g y r r n δ x g y δ δ where y δ and n δ are defined as b 11 y

0 5 ρ a r f α u r x r a h x h γ r u n r n r 0 5 ρ a r f α u r x r a h x h γ r l r thus y β n β y r and n r can be regarded as the hydrodynamic derivatives considering the effect of directional stabilization on y β n β y r and n r due to the existence of a rudder with the zero rudder angle yumuro 1978 the second order linear nomoto s model in yaw for eq b 10 is represented as eq b 13 by transforming the simultaneous differential equations shown by eq b 10 to an equation without using v and v and by approximating that β v u in eq b 10 b 13 t 1 t 2 r t 1 t 2 r r k δ k t 3 δ where t 1 t 2 and t 3 are the time constants of steering quality and k is the static yaw rate gain further t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k and kt 3 are defined as b 14 t 1 t 2 m m y i z z j z z y β n r x g y r y r m m x u n β

when k d 0s eq b 15 is represented as b 16 t 1 t 2 d ψ χ d t t 1 t 2 ψ χ k t 3 k p 1 ψ χ k k p ψ χ 0 the characteristic equation for eq b 16 is given as b 17 a 3 λ 3 a 2 λ 2 a 1 λ a 0 0 where λ is the root of the characteristic equation and a 3 a 2 a 1 and a 0 are defined as b 18 a 3 t 1 t 2 a 2 t 1 t 2 a 1 k t 3 k p 1 a 0 k k p the hurwitz s stable conditions for the third order characteristic equation hurwitz 1895 are i the signs of a 3 a 2 a 1 and a 0 are the same ii a 2 a 1 a 3 a 0 0 here k p is defined as to be positive further the signs of t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k and kt 3 for directionally unstable ships are negative thus the condition to satisfy the condition i can be simplified as b 19 a 1 k t 3 k p 1 0 thus the following condition for k p is obtained b 20 k p 1 k t 3 eq b 21 can be obtained by substituting eq b 18 for the condition ii b 21 t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k k p t 1 t 2 thus the other conditions for k p are given as b 22 k p t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k for t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k 0 b 23 k p t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k for t 1 t 2 k t 3 t 1 t 2 k 0 since the sign of t 1 t2 for directionally unstable ships is negative eq b 23 requires the condition that k p 0 this condition contradicts with the definition that k p is positive thus the case of eq b 23 cannot exist eq b 24 can be obtained by approximating β in the second equation of eq b 10 with v u and then by solving it for v b 24 v u n β x g y β i z z j z z r n r x g y r r n δ x g y δ δ further eq b 24 can be transformed to the following equation by substituting eqs b 2 and b 3 b 25 v u n β x g y β i z z j z z ψ χ n r x g y r n δ x g y δ k d ψ χ n δ x g y δ k p ψ χ since eq b 25 means that v can be represented as a function of ψ χ and the derivatives v also converges when ψ χ converges as the result when k p satisfies the conditions of eqs b 20 and b 22 the directional unstable ships with p law can be stable for v r and ψ χ in calm water the conditions of k p corresponding to eqs b 20 and b 22 for the subject ship is calculated as eq b 26 by using the coefficients listed tables 3 and 6 b 26 k p 0 376 f r o m e q b 20 k p 0 660 f r o m e q b 22 thus k p 0 660 please note that this result is the average for γ r and γ r since t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 k and kt 3 depend on γ r and γ r depends on the sign of v rl r this criterion agrees with that numerically determined using the eigenvalues as shown in fig b1 the slight difference would be caused that the equation of motion in surge direction is neglected in the analysis using the second order linear nomotio s model thus the validity of the directional stability analysis using the eigenvalues was confirmed further it is theoretically clarified that the subject ship with the p law of kp 2 0 is stable in calm water the reason why the directionally unstable subject ship can be stable in calm water using the p law with the small gain such as 0 660 would be that the degrees of directional instability is not strong as represented that c l 0 069 c l which defined by eq b 27 means the stability lever considering the directional stabilization due to existence of a rudder at the zero angle yumuro 1978 b 27 c l n r x g y r y r m m x u l n β x g y β y β this theoretical consideration supports the validity of the above mentioned conclusion of koyama et al 1978 based on the second order model that if the gain is adjusted so as that the cut off frequency exists with in this region of frequency the system will become stabile only by proportional control since the frmt and the numerical simulation were carried out in wind and waves the authors lastly numerically determined the directional stability in the disturbance for the subject ship with p law of k p 2 0 according to the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues the eigenvalues can be calculated using the similar procedures to those in calm water by changing f in eq b 5 to eq b 28 b 28 f r x h x p x r t a m v r m x g r 2 x w d x a y h y r m u r y w d y a n h n r n w d n a x g y h y r y a r note that the averaged values of the wave drift forces and the moment in irregular waves x w d y w d and n w d and the wind forces and the moment x a y a and n a depend on ship motion such as u v and ψ χ thus the partial differentiations of x y and n in eq b 7 as the components of the jacobi matrix include the influence of the disturbance the largest value of real part of the calculated eigenvalues in the disturbance is shown in fig b2 the waves were short crested irregular waves and the sea state was bf 9 further the calculations were model scale and the full scale condition was with operational limit of mcr fig b2 shows that the largest value of real part of the eigenvalues is negative regardless of the direction of wind and waves and thus the subject ship model with k p k d 2 0 0 0 is stable under the equilibrium condition in the sea state and the full scale conditions although the numerical determination of the directional stability in the disturbance was carried out only for this sea state and the full scale conditions the fact that all of the fmrt results in section 5 and the corresponding time simulations converged to certain equilibrium conditions implies that they would also be stable fig b1 variation in the largest values of real parts of the eigenvalues with proportional gain in calm water model scale full scale ship condition

numerical simulation in order to investigate the influence of gains for rudder control on manoeuvring motion the authors carried out numerical simulation shown in section 4 with the different gains the simulation was in model scale the waves were short crested irregular waves the sea state was bf 9 and the full scale condition was with operational limit of mcr the proportional and differential gains k p k d were set to 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 and 2 0 2 86s 30 0s in full scale respectively thus the simulation result of k p k d 2 0 0 0 corresponds with the green long dashed line in fig 15 the estimated ship speed ratio v v 0 the drift angle β and the rudder angle δ in steady equilibrium conditions are shown in fig c1 note that the model scale simulation results in fig c1 are shown using not lines but marks and therefore the meaning of the marks is different from those in figs 14 and 15 indicating the full scale simulation result fig c1 shows that k p affects the direction of wind and waves relative to a ship under the equilibrium condition χ for each designated angle χ d but the relations between χ and v v 0 β or δ are almost the same the differential control does not affect the estimation of χ for each χ d as long as k p are the same but the time history to achieve the equilibrium condition depends on k d as shown in fig c2 the numerical simulation neglects oscillatory ship motion and thus the time averaged values in frmt are not always the case judging from the reasonable agreements of the frmt data with the numerical simulation as shown in fig 15 the response of the time averaged manoeuvring motions versus χ in frmt and the manoeuvring limit in adverse weather obtained as a consequence of them would not also be affect by the gains in contrast to the time averaged values note that the fluctuating components in yaw motion and rudder angle are affected by the gains fig c1 comparison of ship speed drift angle and rudder angle in steady equilibrium conditions

21679,this paper investigates large amplitude sloshing in a prismatic tank with or without a baffle by a cartesian grid based three dimensional 3d multiphase flow model in this model an improved ghost cell method with a unified reconstruction scheme is developed to enforce boundary conditions on the slope walls of the tank arbitrary shape tanks and internal structures can be treated on the cartesian grid instead of the body fitted grid a 3d gradient augmented level set gals method is presented to capture highly nonlinear free surfaces to validate the accuracy of the present ghost cell method uniform flows around a sphere are simulated an approximate second order accuracy in space is achieved then nonlinear sloshing induced by rolling excitations in the 3d prismatic tank is simulated satisfactory convergences of grid sizes and time steps are obtained also good agreements are achieved between the present results and the experimental data for five filling water depths in addition highly nonlinear sloshing phenomena are captured such as plunging waves and wave beating furthermore the variation of the excitation frequency with the pressure amplitude and the effects of the baffle height on the impulsive pressure and the wave elevation are studied keywords nonlinear sloshing cartesian grid gradient augmented level set ghost cell method prismatic tank 1 introduction liquid sloshing is a classical hydrodynamic phenomenon commonly encountered in the field of ocean engineering sloshing has attracted increasingly attentions especially with the increasing demand for liquefied natural gas lng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg when the lng ship sails on the sea the liquid in the partially filled tank can be subjected to strongly nonlinear sloshing due to the multi degree motion of the ship the rising sloshing wave hits the tank wall generating a high impulsive load on the tank in turn the sloshing induced impulsive load can affect the ship motions when the frequency of the external excitation is close to the natural frequency of the tank the impulsive load is so large that it can affect the stability of the carriers and damage the containment structures even capsize the carrier therefore studying the sloshing phenomenon and predicting the impact load are of great significance to the structural design of the tank and the safe operation of the liquid carrier in the past experimental researches kim et al 2015 akyildiz and ünal 2005 and analytic approaches faltinsen et al 2000 faltinsen and timokha 2001 are the common techniques for the liquid sloshing study however most analytic approaches are limited to simple cases such as small amplitude sloshing in a rectangular tank to study complicated sloshing phenomena experiments have always been a reliable and useful tool but it is time consuming and cost expensive in recent years the computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques by solving navier stokes n s equations have become increasingly popular due to the rapid development of computer technologies and numerical algorithms the cfd techniques can be divided into grid less and grid based methods the grid less methods atluri and zhu 2015 have great advantages in large deformation problems such as breaking waves and structural failures also many grid less methods have been proposed to simulate nonlinear sloshing flows cao et al 2014 daneshvar et al 2017 abbas et al 2018 however the enormous computational costs and algorithm complexities of the grid less methods limit their wide applications alternatively the grid based methods yang 2016 peng et al 2019 have also been successfully applied to various sloshing cases such as lng sloshing of a realistic ship bai et al 2015 3d liquid sloshing with baffles xue et al 2012 and violent sloshing with breaking waves liu et al 2017 in the grid based methods additional treatments are needed to track the fluid solid interface and capture the fluid gas interface even though many studies above have been carried out for the idealized situations the simulation of violent sloshing in the realistic lng tank is a challenging task on the one hand the sloshing flow is a complicated and violent phenomenon especially when the exciting frequency is close to the natural frequency of the liquid fluid part of the liquid air interface may break up into discontinuous droplets and small air bubbles might be trapped in the liquid fluid on the other hand most aforementioned studies focused on the sloshing in the rectangular tank however in the practical engineering the lng tank is usually non rectangular such as prismatic moreover to suppress sloshing with large deformation baffles may be placed in the liquid tank for the successful simulation of large amplitude sloshing accurately tracking capturing the free surface is critical in addition since sloshing flows evolve inside an enclosed tank the mass conservation of the sloshing fluid is the fundamental task for the simulation and it directly affects the predicted impact pressure on the wall to capture the highly nonlinear free surface the interface capturing method jafari and ashgriz 2008 where the interface is implicitly represented in an eulerian way is an appealing choice the ls method sussman et al 1994 is one of the most widely used interface capturing schemes in the ls method a signed distance function is used to evolve the fluid air interface with a local fluid velocity the ls method has advantages in the geometrical representation of the interface and 3d implementation however most ls methods suffer from the mass non conservation problem zhao et al 2018 to improve the mass conservation some variations of the ls method have been developed sussman and puckett 2000 proposed a coupled level set volume of fluid clsvof method which inherits the good conservation property of the vof method and geometric representation of the ls method enright et al 2002 proposed a hybrid particle ls method the ls function was reconstructed by lagrangian marker particles in the local regions to improve the mass conservation property cecil et al 2004 combined the essentially non oscillatory eno scheme with the radial basis function rbf to obtain a high order reconstruction scheme in the present study a gradient augmented level set gals method which was proposed by nave et al 2010 is used in the gals method the ls distance function and its gradient information are evolved in a fully coupled way therefore the sub grid structure can be represented and the mass conservation can be better maintained lee et al 2014 developed an incompressible two phase flow model based on the gals method shi et al 2019 developed a cartesian grid based multiphase flow model to simulate water impact of a complex body in most sloshing simulations mentioned above the tank is treated as the rectangular shape therefore the boundary conditions can be easily enforced because the computational grid is coincided with the tank boundaries however in the practical engineering the liquid tank can be in various shapes such as the prism and the ellipsoid to treat the sloping boundaries the body fitted grid technique li et al 2005 is commonly used for example jiang et al 2015 simulated the sloshing of two partially filled prismatic tanks based on the openfoam zhao and chen 2015 simulated 3d sloshing flows in a partially filled lng tank by the overset grid method however it is not a trivial task for the body fitted grid method to handle multiple degree of freedom excitations or internal structures to treat these problems the non boundary fitted method hou 2012 where the governing equations are solved on a background cartesian grid provides an appealing alternative in the non boundary fitted method the body boundary does not coincide with the background grid lines to treat the sloping boundaries of the irregular shape tank kim et al 2004 introduced a concept of the buffer zone to enforce the free surface boundary condition near the tank ceiling to represent the existence of the baffles liu and lin 2009 introduced a body force to the momentum equations by the direct forcing immersed boundary method lee et al 2011 enforced the no slip boundary condition on the body surface by a quadratic polynomial interpolation scheme the interpolation stencils are divided into 13 cases based on the positional relationship between the body surface and the grid lines however the buffer zone can reduce the accuracy on the sloping boundaries and classification procedures in lee et al 2011 s approximation method are complicated so far literatures on the numerical simulation of sloshing in a 3d complex tank are rare therefore this paper presents a 3d cartesian grid based multiphase flow model to simulate large amplitude sloshing in a prismatic tank the present model has advantages in handling complex shape tanks with internal structures and capturing highly nonlinear free surfaces the main contributions are as follows first to treat arbitrary complex sloshing structures a ghost cell method with a unified reconstruction scheme is developed based on a two dimensional radial basis function ghost cell method xin et al 2018 the irregular boundaries of the tank are represented by wedge shaped bodies also the boundary conditions on the irregular boundaries are enforced by placing ghost cells inside the solid but adjacent the fluid therefore the effects of arbitrary sloshing structures on the flow field can be easily considered without introducing additional complexities second a 3d gals two phase flow method with pretreated reinitialization xin et al 2020 is presented to capture highly nonlinear free surfaces with good mass conservation therefore by combining the ghost cell method and the 3d gals two phase flow method a 3d cartesian grid based multiphase flow model is presented for wave structure interaction third nonlinear sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank with or without a baffle is simulated also the effects of the filling water depth the excitation frequency and the baffle height on the impulsive pressure and the wave elevation are analyzed when the sloshing is so violent that the slope and ceiling walls are exposed to impulsive pressures local strongly nonlinear phenomena can occur such as turbulence and air entrapment however the focuses are put on the global fluid motion and the impact load on the tank walls in this study the turbulent flow and air compressibility are ignored to avoid numerical instability because these local phenomena are very difficult to quantitatively analysis in the following section the present mathematical model is given the details of the numerical model are presented in section 3 including the basic n s solver the numerical implementation of the ghost cell and the gals method for interface capturing in section 4 a test case is simulated to validate the present ghost cell method section 5 presents the numerical results and discussions on the sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank finally conclusions and future work are given in section 6 2 mathematical model 2 1 incompressible n s equations the motion of the two phase flow

y and z directions ρ is the density t is the time p is the pressure μ is the dynamics viscosity coefficient and f a is the external body force for the simulation of the general two phase flows the external body force f a is the gravitational acceleration for sloshing flows f a is used to consider the effects of the moving tank on the flow field the external body force includes the gravitational acceleration and the inertia forces caused by the acceleration of the moving tank it is given in bai et al 2015 3 f a g d v d t d ω d t r r ω ω r r 2 ω d r r d t where v and ω are the translational and rotational velocity vectors in a moving non inertial frame respectively r and r are the coordinate vectors of the rotational origin and the grid nodes the five terms of the right hand side are the gravitational acceleration in the moving frame the translational force the angular acceleration the centrifugal and coriolis accelerations respectively 2 2 gals equations for interface capturing the gals equations nave et al 2010 for interface capturing include a ls equation in the classical ls method and a gradient equation the gradient equation can be derived by applying the gradient operator to the ls equation therefore the gals equations are expressed as 4 φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ 4 b 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 1 x 3 y 3 x 3 y 3 1 x 4 y 4 x 4 y 4 5 φ where φ is the ls function as in the classical ls method if a point is inside of the denser fluid one has φ 0 otherwise φ 0 ψ is the gradient vector φ 0 x is the ls value at the initial time x is the coordinate vector on the background cartesian grid φ is the gradient vector with φ ψ ψ and u are the gradient and velocity deformation matrices respectively to simulate the two phase flow the density and viscosity at each grid cell are defined by the ls function with the following equations 6 ρ h ε φ ρ w 1 h ε φ ρ a 7 μ h ε φ μ w 1 h ε φ μ a where subscripts w and a represent the water and the air respectively in this study a smoothed heaviside function h ε φ frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 is introduced to achieve the smoothing transition of the discontinuous fluid properties density and viscosity 3 numerical solver 3 1 numerical solution of n s equations in the present study the basic solver is developed in shi et al 2019 the governing equations are discretized by a finite difference method on a staggered cartesian grid the decoupling of the pressure and the velocity is realized by a fractional step method bevan et al 2016 also the convective fluxes are discretized by a roe s flux difference splitting method with a higher order total variation diminishing monotonic upstream centered scheme for conservation laws tvd muscl scheme leer 1997 this scheme is suitable for complicated turbulent viscous flows though the turbulent model is not involved in this study the viscous fluxes are discretized by a central difference scheme which can obtain second order accuracy in addition the momentum equations are advanced in time by a tvd second order runge kutta tvd rk2 scheme combined with a second order crank nicolson scheme which has good numerical stability the velocity dirichlet and the pressure neumann boundary conditions are enforced by the present ghost cell method after the momentum equations are solved also a preconditioned bi conjugate gradient stabilized bicgstab method van der vorst 2003 is coupled with a diagonal storage format to solve the large sparse positive definite matrix coming from the poisson equations for pressure 3 2 numerical implementation of the gals equations the gals equations are re expressed in the characteristic form 8 d φ d t 0 and d ψ d t u ψ we use a generalized cir courant isaacson reese method courant et al 1952 to solve eq 8 the procedure is outlined in two steps first the characteristic curve equation x τ τ u x τ τ is solved by backward integration from time t δ t to t with the shu osher rk3 method second the ls function φ and its gradient vector ψ are updated by solving eq 8 the gradient equation is solved by an explicit trapezoidal scheme forward integration along the characteristic curve note that the variables φ and ψ at arbitrary positions are interpolated by the hermite cubic polynomial scheme to maintain high accuracy in addition first and second derivatives are analytically calculated by differentiating this hermite interpolation scheme thus the interpolation errors are avoided more details are given in xin et al 2020 3 3 solid boundary treatment by a ghost cell method the ghost cell method is used in the present study to enforce the no slip boundary conditions on the immersed boundary the existence of the stationary or moving body is represented by placing a finite number of ghost cells inside the immersed body in this study we employ a unified eight point reconstruction scheme to evaluate the ghost cell values the basic idea is that the nearest stencil points belong to the ghost cells are replaced by the corresponding boundary points to keep the eight point scheme nam 2015 employed a similar strategy in his 2d ghost cell method for compressible flows therefore there is no need to perform the classification procedure on the ghost cells the first key step is to describe the immersed boundary and identify the phase state of the grid cells xin et al 2018 the next step is to interpolate the ghost cell values by introducing a concept of mirroring points the interpolation procedure consists of the following sub steps marking the mirroring points interpolating the mirroring point values and satisfying the mirroring conditions 3 3 1 marking the mirroring points for each ghost cell there is one mirroring point mp to be determined by mirroring the ghost cell to the fluid domain along the outward normal of the body surface when the line from the ghost cell node to the mirroring point intercepts the body surface a boundary projecting point bp is formed and locates in the middle between the ghost cell node gc and the mirroring point mp to ensure numerical stability the boundary point need to be uniquely identified we first search all the surface elements to identify one element center ec closest to the considered ghost cell the subscripts such as ec gc and bp represent the positions of corresponding grid nodes as shown in fig 1 for the sake of simplicity 2d interpolation stencils are shown in fig 1 the same as fig 2 then the boundary point and the mirroring point are calculated as 9 x b p x g c δ l n e c 10 x m p x g c 2 δ l n e c δ l x e c x g c n e c x e c x g c n x e c y e c y g c n y e c z e c z g c n z e c where δ l is the distance from the boundary point bp to the ghost cell gc x y z are the coordinate components in the x y and z directions respectively n n x n y n z is the outward normal vector along the body surface n x n y n z are the components of the normal vector along x y and z directions respectively 3 3 2 interpolating mirroring point values a unified eight point tri linear reconstruction scheme is developed to interpolate the fluid variables of the mirroring points the tri linear reconstruction scheme is expressed as 11 ϕ x y z a 1 a 2 x a 3 y a 4 z a 5 x y a 6 x z a 7 y z a 8 x y z where ϕ x y z is the flow variable the velocity component in one direction or the pressure at a mirroring point a t is the unknown coefficient vector with a t a 1 a 2 a 8 a t is calculated based on the eight nearest points enclosing the considered mirroring point 12 a b 1 ϕ where vector ϕ t ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 8 contains variable values at stencil points 1 8 and b is the 8 8 coefficient matrix of the tri linear interpolation scheme with the coordinates at nodes 1 8 the matrix b is expressed as 13 b 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 z 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 x 2 y 2 x 2 z 2 y 2 z 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 1 x 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 x 8 z 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 z 8 when the mirroring point is enclosed by eight fluid cell nodes the coefficient matrix b is obtained from the coordinates of the eight fluid cell fc nodes 1 8 as shown in fig 2 a the vector ϕ are the fluid variable values the velocity component or the pressure at eight fluid cell fc nodes 1 8 after the weighting coefficient vector a is solved using eq 12 the flow variable of the mirroring point can be calculated by eq 11 however there are situations when one or more stencil points are the ghost cells nodes themselves the ghost cells nodes are used as the stencil points to calculate the considered mirroring points which can lead to the ill posed and computational divergence problems therefore detailed treatments are required to avoid the ghost cell stencil points to avoid classifying various interpolation stencils first we identify the role of the eight nearest points enclosing the mirroring point for each nearest point if it lies in the fluid it is categorized as the stencil point if this nearest point is the ghost cell node then the corresponding boundary point bp is used as the stencil point instead of the ghost cell node 2 in fig 2 b to calculate the velocity component in the x y or z directions the dirichlet boundary condition u b p v is enforced where u b p is the velocity of the boundary point bp hence the velocity component in one direction such as x direction at the boundary point bp is expressed 14 u b a 1 a 2 x b p a 3 y b p a 4 z b p a 5 x b p y b p a 6 x b p z b p a 7 y b p z b p a 8 x b p y b p z b p where u b v b w b are the velocity of the rigid body in the x y and z directions respectively the second row in eq 13 for the node 2 is replaced by eq 14 then the coefficient vector for the x component of the velocity at the mirroring point is solved by 15 a 1 a 2 a 8 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 z 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x b p y b p z b p x b p y b p x b p z b p y b p z b p x b p y b p z b p 1 x 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 x 8 z 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 z 8 1 ϕ 1 u b ϕ 8 the velocity components in the y and z directions are solved in a similar way for the pressure variable the neumann boundary condition is enforced the pressure at the boundary point bp is expressed 16 p b p a 1 a 2 x b p a 3 y b p a 4 z b p a 5 x b p y b p a 6 x b p z b p a 7 y b p z b p a 8 x b p y b p z b p differentiating the pressure along the x y and z directions we obtain 17 p b p x a 2 a 5 y b p a 6 z b p a 8 y b p z b p 18 p b p y a 3 a 5 x b p a 7 z b p a 8 x b p z b p 19 p b p z a 4 a 6 x b p a 7 y b p a 8 x b p y b p as we know the pressure gradient vector on the mirroring point can be expressed 20 p b p n p b p x n x p b p y n y p b p z n z therefore substituting eqs 17 19 into eq 20 we can obtain 21 a b p a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 x b p y b p a 6 x b p z b p a 7 y b p z b p a 8 c b p where a b p n d v b d t and c b p x b p y b p x b p z b p y b p z b p then the second row in eq 15 for the node 2 is replaced by eq 21 the coefficient vector for the pressure at the mirroring point is solved by 22 a 1 a 2 a 8 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 z 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 0 1 1 1 x b p y b p x b p z b p y b p z b p c b p 1 x 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 x 8 z 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 z 8 1 ϕ 1 a b p ϕ 8 the treatment above aims at the situation that one nearest point enclosing the mirroring point if the other nearest points are also identified as the ghost cell nodes as shown in fig 2 c we just repeat the above procedure for the second or more boundary points consequently a unified eight point interpolation scheme is ensured moreover the interpolation procedure for the mirroring points is consistent and the accuracy is not compromised when any of eight nearest points is classified as the ghost cell node 3 3 3 obtaining ghost cell values after the fluid variables at the mirroring points are evaluated the ghost cell value ϕ g c can be determined from the mirroring point values by satisfying a mirroring condition 23 ϕ g c ξ 1 ϕ m p ξ 2 for the velocity variable the dirichlet boundary condition is enforced by assuming a linear variation along the normal of the immersed boundary we can obtain ξ 1 1 and ξ 2 2 ϕ b p where ϕ b p is the velocity component of the boundary point in one direction for the pressure variable the neumann boundary condition is enforced we can obtain with s b and ξ 2 δ d g m n d v b d t δ d g m is the distance from the ghost cell node to the mirroring point then the fluid variables at the ghost cells are calculated according to eq 23 the ghost cell values are calculated in a robust and consistent manner boundary conditions are implicitly enforced when the governing equations are solved on the entire computation domain by a standard seven point central difference scheme consequently the treatment for the complex body is simplified because the numerical discretization is not affected by the geometrical complexity of the immersed body note that the coordinate positions of the velocity component in three directions and the pressure are not coincidence because the computation is conducted on the staggered cartesian grid therefore the ghost cell interpolation procedures in section 3 3 are required to perform four times for the three velocity components and the pressure 3 4 time step restrictions to ensure reasonable convergence to solution and solution quality the time step is restricted by the cfl courant friedreichs lewy condition the restriction conditions are given as 24 t ω c f l min t c o n v t v i s c t g r a v t c o n v u max δ x v max δ y w max δ z 1 t v i s c max μ ρ w μ ρ a 1 δ x 2 1 δ y 2 1 δ z 2 1 t g r a v min δ x δ y δ z max g 10 6 where t c o n v t v i s c and t g r a v are the convective viscous and gravity restrictions respectively ω c f l is the time relaxation coefficient δ x δ y and δ z are the grid sizes in the cartesian grid along x y and z directions respectively 4 test case of flows around a sphere the present gals two phase flow method xin et al 2020 is validated by linear and nonlinear sloshing in a 3d rectangular tank good grid convergence is achieved in this section the incompressible viscous flows around a sphere are simulated to validate the accuracy of the present ghost cell method for 3d boundary flows the reynolds number re u d υ is an important parameter in the incompressible viscous flows where d is the diameter of the sphere with d 1 m and u is the uniform flow velocity several reynolds numbers are chosen as re 50 100 and 200 in the present study the computational domain is set as 8d 16d 8d 8d 8d 8d in the x y and z directions respectively the non uniform grid is applied with a refined domain of 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d the sphere is located on the origin of the coordinate system at the inflow boundary a uniform flow is applied free flow and radiative boundary conditions are applied at the outflow boundary and free stream boundaries respectively for pressure variable the pressure is set to zero at the outflow boundary and the neumann boundary condition is applied at other boundaries to investigate grid convergence three grid resolutions are used with 16 8 8 32 16 16 and 64 32 32 grid in the refined domain the minimum grid sizes in the x direction near the sphere for three grid resolutions are 0 1 d 0 05 d and 0 025 d respectively the computations are conducted on a dell 7920 workstation with 1 7 ghz cpu the cpu time on the coarsest grid of δ x 0 1 d is within 1 days however the finest grid of δ x 0 025 d are time consuming with an approximate cpu time of 24 days quantitative analysis on the force coefficient is first conducted the drag coefficient is defined as c d 2 f x ρ u a s where f x is the hydrodynamic load on the sphere in the flow direction a s is the area of the cross section a s π r 2 for the sphere table 1 shows the comparison of drag coefficients at three reynolds numbers from present results experimental data clift et al 1978 and numerical results by zhang 2013 s body fitted grid method for all reynolds numbers the drag coefficients c d on the coarse grid δ x 0 1 d are overestimated about 10 compared with the experimental data however as the grid in the refined domain is refined to δ x 0 05 d the drag coefficients c d rapidly approach the reference results when the grid of δ x 0 025 d is used good agreement is achieved specifically the maximum error with respect to the experimental data is 1 88 at the reynolds number of re 200 and the minimum error is 0 06 at re 100 moreover the present drag coefficients on the finest grid are closer to the experimental data than those of zhang s body fitted grid method for re 100 and 200 it indicates that the accuracy of the present method is comparable to the body fitted method fig 3 shows the relationship between the relative error of drag coefficient ε d and the grid size in the x direction for three reynolds numbers where the error ε d is calculated with ε d c d p r e c d exp c d exp according to the present drag coefficients c d p r e and the experimental data c d exp the dashed line in fig 3 represents the second order slope the relative errors of drag coefficients ε d show approximately second order convergence rate for three reynolds numbers indicating the second order spatial accuracy of the present method in addition as the reynolds number increases the relative errors on three grid systems grow especially the drag coefficients on the coarse grid obviously deviate the experimental results it shows that the flow on the higher reynolds number requires refiner grid resolution further the hydrodynamic characteristics at different reynolds numbers are investigated figs 4 6 show the streamlines and vortex contours at the reynolds numbers of re 50 100 and 200 the flow is separated behind the sphere forming two oppositely rotating symmetrical vortices for all reynolds numbers with the increase of the reynolds number the separation area grows also a pair of thinner symmetrical vortices is attached on the sphere and extends to far downstream leading to a smaller drag coefficient 5 large amplitude sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank based on the proposed numerical model we developed an in house 3d multiphase flow solver in fortran 90 language fig 7 gives the flow chart of the present numerical algorithm the time integration process of the n s equations is shown in the box formed by the dashed dotted line with the present solver numerical studies on liquid sloshing are conducted and the influences of the filling level and the baffle height on the impulsive load are investigated we hope to give insight into the hydrodynamic characteristics of sloshing offering theoretical guidance for the structural design of the lng tank 5 1 sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank without a baffle to investigate sloshing characteristics in a complex tank large amplitude sloshing induced by rolling excitations in a 3d prismatic tank is simulated the accuracy of the present multiphase flow model is validated moreover parametric studies on the filling water depth and the excitation frequency are investigated based on mikelis et al 1984 s experimental work the principal dimension of the 3d rectangular tank is l 0 741 m in length w 0 399 m in width and h 0 405 m in height the geometrical model is shown in fig 8 the rotational axis y1y2 of the tank is at the center of the x axis and above the tank bottom 0 194 m the rolling motion of the tank are described as θ y θ 0 sin ω t θ y is the rolling angle θ 0 is the rolling amplitude with θ 0 0 1 rad ω is the rolling frequency with ω 2 π t t is the rolling period five filling levels are considered the computational parameters are shown in table 2 where h is the filling level and the tank rotates around the diagonal line of x y plane for case 4 seven pressure sensors denoted by r1 r7 are placed at the center of the right wall with a distance from the tank bottom 0 075 m 0 1135 m 0 205 m 0 2965 m 0 341 m 0 390 m and 0 405 m respectively and the pressure sensor r7 is 0 02 away from the right wall also a wave gauge is placed at a distance of 0 1356 m from the left wall the computation is conducted on a domain of 0 m 0 741 m 0 m 0 399 m 0 m 0 405 m the velocity no slip boundary conditions are applied on all boundaries the pressure at the top wall is set to zero for reference to keep consistent with the experimental setting also the pressure neumann boundary conditions are applied on the other walls to consider the existence of the slope walls four wedges are placed on the four corners of the tank an improved ghost cell method is applied to enforce the boundary conditions on the four wedges first the case of the filling level h h 0 9 is simulated to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the present multiphase flow method to investigate the convergence of the grid sizes three different uniform grids including 80 50 60 100 60 80 and 120 80 100 in the x y and z directions respectively are used to discretize the computational domain the time relaxation coefficient is set to ω c f l 0 3 the time histories of the pressure at the point r3 and wave elevation results by the present method on three grids are compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 9 the pressures and wave amplitudes on three grids agree well with the experimental data minor discrepancies are observed on the peak pressures probably because the two phase interface is treated by the smoothed heaviside function leading to a diffused and smooth interface however the peak pressures gradually approach to the experimental data as the grid refines in fig 9 a also the wave crests are truncated at the position of the wave elevation η 0 4 m because the waves climb up to the tank ceiling to investigate the convergence of the time step three different time relaxation coefficients are considered as ω c f l 0 1 ω c f l 0 3 and ω c f l 0 6 the grid size is 100 60 80 in the x y and z directions respectively fig 10 shows the pressure and wave elevation results against time by the present method with three relaxation coefficients and the experimental data again good agreements are obtained between the present method at all coefficients and the experimental data the present calculation is demonstrated to be insensitive to the grid sizes and time intervals confirming the reliability of the present method thus the time coefficient ω c f l 0 3 and the grid of 100 60 80 are adopted in the following computations to achieve a balance between the result smoothness and computational cost the present wave elevation and pressure at three measuring points are compared with the experimental data for cases 1 5 in figs 11 15 the pressure in figs 11 15 is the total pressure including the hydrostatic pressure and the dynamic pressure when the filling level is h h 0 3 the pressure at the slope bottom r1 agrees well with the experimental data the pressure pulse values at r2 and r4 of the vertical wall are slightly higher than the experimental data as shown in fig 11 for the free surface elevation the troughs agree with the experimental data but the crests are a little higher for h h 0 46 the pressures at r1 r2 r3 and the wave troughs show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data as shown in fig 12 however the wave crests are a little higher approximately 8 as the filling level increases to h h 0 61 in fig 13 the variation trend of the pressure is consistent with that of the experiment the peak pressures at r2 and r3 are slightly lower than the experimental data the amplitude of the pressure pulse at point r4 changes wildly and exhibits strong instability due to the instantaneous impact when the filling level is h h 0 75 the present pressures and the free surface elevation show overall agreements with the experimental data as shown in fig 14 specifically the pressure trough at r2 is a little higher approximately 12 than the experimental data and the amplitude of the pressure pulse at the point r5 of the chamfered wall is slightly lower as the filling level increases to the maximum h h 0 9 the present pressures at r1 r3 and the wave elevation agree well with the experimental data however the amplitude of the pressure pulse at point r6 is lower than the experiment as shown fig 15 the obvious deviations between the present results and the experimental data at the point above the water surface in figs 11 15 may be caused by the turbulence and air entrapment effects air compressibility cannot be considered and turbulent model is not used in the present study however the turbulence and air compressibility may occur in the violent sloshing situations the deviations are reasonable and acceptable considering the complexity nonlinearity and instantaneity of the 3d violent sloshing then the hydrodynamics characteristics of the impulsive pressures are analyzed for the filling level h h 0 3 the sloshing wave periodically hits the tank walls above the static water generating the pressure pulse as observed in fig 11 meanwhile in each period two successive pressure peaks occur which is caused by the highly nonlinear wave impact the first peak happens when the climbing wave washes up to the tank wall the second peak appears when the falling water hits the wall because the movement of the water lags behind the tank when the filling level increases to h h 0 46 or 0 61 the nonlinearity of the sloshing flow decreases the single pressure peak occurs in each period as shown in figs 12 and 13 for h h 0 61 the pressure curve at r2 approximately exhibits the harmonic oscillation with an amplitude of 2100 pa this point r2 is below the static water surface and both the static and dynamic pressures play a role in contrast the pressures at r3 and r4 exhibit a pulse characteristic and the pulse amplitudes of both are slightly over 2000 pa also the pressures at r3 and r4 are dominated by the dynamic pressure in addition the pulse pressure at r3 lasts a longer time than that at r4 as shown in fig 13 because the point r3 is located right under r4 when the filling level increases to the maximum h h 0 9 the nonlinearity of the sloshing flow further decreases the pressure curves at r1 and r3 are approximately sinusoidal and the pressure at the chamfered wall r2 shows the pulse characteristics as shown in fig 15 on the other hand the curve of the wave elevation is gradually closer to the sinusoidal variation as the filling level increases from h h 0 3 to h h 0 9 as observed in figs 11 15 the pressure and wave elevation amplitudes increase first then decrease as the filling level rises from h h 0 3 to h h 0 9 for h h 0 3 the amplitudes of the pressure pulses at r1 and r2 are approximately 2000 pa but the amplitude at r4 is below 700 pa as shown in fig 11 the chamfered and vertical walls experience huge impulsive pressures indicating that the local structure at the tank bottom need to be strengthened as the filling level increases to h h 0 61 the pressure amplitudes at r2 r3 and r4 on the right wall are very large and reach approximately 2000 pa it indicates that the structural strength of the entire vertical wall need be reinforced for h h 0 9 the pressure amplitudes at r1 r3 and r6 decrease remarkably approximately 1000 pa the entire tank walls including the chamfered walls experience the safer loads compared with h h 0 61 the liquid carrier is in an ideal sailing condition when the liquid tank is fully loaded this situation should be avoided when the filling level of the tank is approximate half of the tank height at this situation the liquid carrier is in a dangerous sailing condition and the structural strength of the tank wall should be reinforced further the hydrodynamic characteristics of this sloshing are reproduced figs 16 20 show the 3d wave surface on the sloshing tank at two moments for five filling levels respectively for h h 0 3 the water moves to the one side as the tank rotates the velocity of the upper fluid is larger than that of the lower fluid generating a rising wave when the tank rotates to the maximum rolling angles the rising wave hits the tank as shown in fig 16 a afterwards the tank drives the water to move towards the opposite direction generating another rising wave as shown in fig 16 b for h h 0 46 and 0 61 the sloshing wave hits the chamfered wall at the top with the movement of the tank generating a steep wave when the steep wave climbs up to its highest position on the chamfered wall then it falls down under the effects of gravity generating a plunging wave meanwhile the plunging wave is superimposed with the wave at front forming wrinkle wave pattern as shown in figs 17 and 18 when the filling level increases to h h 0 75 and 0 9 the lower fluid keeps stable under the viscosity and inertia effects the upper fluid moves in a form of the small amplitude wave under the constraints of the chamfered wall and the tank top in addition the free surface for h h 0 75 shows obvious asymmetry with respect to the x z plane due to the rotation around the diagonal line of x y plane as shown in fig 19 the peak load on the tank wall is a critical factor for the structural design of the liquid tank therefore we further studied the influence of the excitation frequencies on the pressure amplitudes at local positions fig 21 shows the variation of the pressure amplitudes with the excitation frequencies f e at r2 for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 the pressure amplitudes for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 are about 2580 and 2490 pa respectively also the natural frequencies the excitation frequencies corresponding to the peak pressures are 5 1 and 5 5 rad s for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 respectively the natural frequency for h h 0 61 is larger than that for h h 0 46 because the natural frequency increases with the rising of the water depth in addition as the excitation frequency increases to the natural frequency the pressure amplitude significantly increases and reaches the peak pressure when the excitation frequency continues to increase and is away from the natural frequency the pressure amplitude decreases rapidly also the declining speed of the pressure amplitude is larger than the increasing speed when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the sloshing tank even a small change in natural frequency can make a large difference in the pressure amplitude therefore changing the natural frequency of the liquid tank can be an effective way to reduce the pressure amplitude the natural frequency can be changed by modifying the principal dimension in the structural design stage or the fluid depth in the operation stage 5 2 sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank with different baffle heights in this section the sloshing with different baffle heights in the prismatic tank is studied the dangerous condition of h h 0 61 is chosen as a typical example fig 22 shows the time history of the pressure and the wave elevation at five baffle heights h b h 0 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 where ε is the ratio of the baffle height to the water depth and h b is the baffle height no baffle exists for h b h 0 0 as the baffle height increases the impulsive pressure and the wave elevation drops significantly specifically when the baffle heights is h b h 0 25 no obvious reduction is observed on the pressure and the wave amplitude is slightly smaller than that of h b h 0 0 the reason is probably that the rolling movement occurs on the upper fluid but the bottom fluid keeps relatively stable therefore the baffle is high enough to block the violent movement of the upper fluid as the baffle height increases to h b h 0 5 obvious reductions on the pressure peak and the wave amplitude are observed the amplitudes are reduced approximately 40 for the pressure amplitude at the point r2 and 35 for the wave amplitude the pressure crest becomes sharper and the pressure and wave curves gradually approach to the sinusoidal patterns it shows that the fluid movement at the central region are blocked by the baffle leading to the reduction of nonlinearity for h b h 0 75 the pressure amplitudes are about 500 pa at the points r2 and r3 much less than the 2000 pa for h b h 0 0 also the wave amplitude is about 0 06 m much less than the 0 2 m for h b h 0 0 in addition the pressure pulse at the point r4 is not observed when the baffle height increases to the maximum h b h 1 0 the pressure curve at the point r2 exhibits the sinusoidal variation with an amplitude of about 500 pa also the wave elevation almost keeps horizontal the interaction mechanism between the baffle and the fluid is also investigated figs 23 25 show pressure contours at two typical moments of one period for the baffle height h b h 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 in fig 23 the water above the baffle is driven to the opposite direction as the tank moves to the right side when the tank moves to the far left the flow rises to the right chamfered wall also a large impulsive pressure occurs on the corner of the chamfered wall indicating that the structural strength of the chamfered wall needs to be reinforced as the baffle height increases to h b h 0 5 the flow field is less violent and the free surface does not touch the chamfered wall during the rolling movement of the tank therefore high impulsive pressure on the chamfered wall is not observed the reason is that the baffle blocks the sloshing fluid moving from the high pressure area to the low pressure area as shown in fig 24 the pressure field in the tank is discontinuous on both sides of the baffle when the baffle moves to the far left the baffle blocks the fluid moving from the right high pressure area to the left low one and vice versa for h b h 0 75 the flow field is more stable and the free surface remains nearly horizontal the results show that the blocking effects of the baffle can effectively reduce the impulsive pressure 6 conclusions and outlook in this study a cartesian grid based 3d multi phase flow model is presented to simulate strongly nonlinear sloshing in a prismatic tank with or without a baffle this model is capable of handling complex shape tanks and capturing large deformation of the free surface such as the plunging wave a ghost cell method with a unified scheme is developed to treat the slope boundaries and the baffle also the nonlinear free surface is captured by a 3d gals two phase flow method the present numerical method is compared with experimental data good agreements are achieved also main conclusions are drawn first the accuracy of the present 3d ghost cell method is validated by simulating flows around a sphere at low reynolds numbers the present results gradually approach to the experimental and numerical results as the grid refines also the grid convergence shows that the present ghost cell method can obtain approximately second order accuracy in space in addition as the reynolds number increases the relative errors on three grids grow then we investigated large amplitude sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank under rolling excitations in the case of the filling level h h 0 9 the sensitivity analyses of grid sizes and time steps are conducted confirming the good grid and time convergences of the present model afterwards the cases of five filling water depths are simulated reasonable agreements on the pressure and the wave elevation are obtained between the present results and the experimental data confirming the accuracy of the present model again some discrepancies are observed on the pulse pressures due to the turbulence and air entrapment effects for h h 0 3 highly nonlinear phenomena two successive pressure peaks occur as the filling level increases the nonlinearity decreases and the two pressure peaks turn into a single peak for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 the sinusoidal variation of the pressure is observed as the filling level increases to h h 0 9 dangerous situations occur when the tank is partially filled the bottom chamfered wall experiences huge impulsive pressures for h h 0 3 when the filling water is approximate half of the tank height such as h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 large impact pressures occur on the entire vertical wall then we investigated the relationship between the pressure amplitude and the excitation frequency also the natural frequencies of the sloshing system for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 are identified as approximately 5 1 and 5 5 rad s respectively in addition we investigated the effects of baffle height on the pressure and the wave elevation for h h 0 61 installing a baffle inside the tank can effectively reduce the sloshing movement and the impulsive pressure the most apparent effects are achieved when the baffle height is between h b h 0 5 and h b h 0 75 in the future we intend to incorporate the turbulent model into our multiphase flow model to more complicated sloshing flows such as multi degree of freedom motion and wave breaking phenomena credit authorship contribution statement jianjian xin methodology formal analysis writing original draft zhenlei chen

liquid sloshing is a classical hydrodynamic phenomenon commonly encountered in the field of ocean engineering sloshing has attracted increasingly attentions especially with the increasing demand for liquefied natural gas lng and liquefied petroleum gas lpg when the lng ship sails on the sea the liquid in the partially filled tank can be subjected to strongly nonlinear sloshing due to the multi degree motion of the ship the rising sloshing wave hits the tank wall generating a high impulsive load on the tank in turn the sloshing induced impulsive load can affect the ship motions when the frequency of the external excitation is close to the natural frequency of the tank the impulsive load is so large that it can affect the stability of the carriers and damage the containment structures even capsize the carrier therefore studying the sloshing phenomenon and predicting the impact load are of great significance to the structural design of the tank and the safe operation of the liquid carrier in the past experimental researches kim et al 2015 akyildiz and ünal 2005 and analytic approaches faltinsen et al 2000 faltinsen and timokha 2001 are the common techniques for the liquid sloshing study however most analytic approaches are limited to simple cases such as small amplitude sloshing in a rectangular tank to study complicated sloshing phenomena experiments have always been a reliable and useful tool but it is time consuming and cost expensive in recent years the computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques by solving navier stokes n s equations have become increasingly popular due to the rapid development of computer technologies and numerical algorithms the cfd techniques can be divided into grid less and grid based methods the grid less methods atluri and zhu 2015 have great advantages in large deformation problems such as breaking waves and structural failures also many grid less methods have been proposed to simulate nonlinear sloshing flows cao et al 2014 daneshvar et al 2017 abbas et al 2018 however the enormous computational costs and algorithm complexities of the grid less methods limit their wide applications alternatively the grid based methods yang 2016 peng et al 2019 have also been successfully applied to various sloshing cases such as lng sloshing of a realistic ship bai et al 2015 3d liquid sloshing with baffles xue et al 2012 and violent sloshing with breaking waves liu et al 2017 in the grid based methods additional treatments are needed to track the fluid solid interface and capture the fluid gas interface even though many studies above have been carried out for the idealized situations the simulation of violent sloshing in the realistic lng tank is a challenging task on the one hand the sloshing flow is a complicated and violent phenomenon especially when the exciting frequency is close to the natural frequency of the liquid fluid part of the liquid air interface may break up into discontinuous droplets and small air bubbles might be trapped in the liquid fluid on the other hand most aforementioned studies focused on the sloshing in the rectangular tank however in the practical engineering the lng tank is usually non rectangular such as prismatic moreover to suppress sloshing with large deformation baffles may be placed in the liquid tank for the successful simulation of large amplitude sloshing accurately tracking capturing the free surface is critical in addition since sloshing flows evolve inside an enclosed tank the mass conservation of the sloshing fluid is the fundamental task for the simulation and it directly affects the predicted impact pressure on the wall to capture the highly nonlinear free surface the interface capturing method jafari and ashgriz 2008 where the interface is implicitly represented in an eulerian way is an appealing choice the ls method sussman et al 1994 is one of the most widely used interface capturing schemes in the ls method a signed distance function is used to evolve the fluid air interface with a local fluid velocity the ls method has advantages in the geometrical representation of the interface and 3d implementation however most ls methods suffer from the mass non conservation problem zhao et al 2018 to improve the mass conservation some variations of the ls method have been developed sussman and puckett 2000 proposed a coupled level set volume of fluid clsvof method which inherits the good conservation property of the vof method and geometric representation of the ls method enright et al 2002 proposed a hybrid particle ls method the ls function was reconstructed by lagrangian marker particles in the local regions to improve the mass conservation property cecil et al 2004 combined the essentially non oscillatory eno scheme with the radial basis function rbf to obtain a high order reconstruction scheme in the present study a gradient augmented level set gals method which was proposed by nave et al 2010 is used in the gals method the ls distance function and its gradient information are evolved in a fully coupled way therefore the sub grid structure can be represented and the mass conservation can be better maintained lee et al 2014 developed an incompressible two phase flow model based on the gals method shi et al 2019 developed a cartesian grid based multiphase flow model to simulate water impact of a complex body in most sloshing simulations mentioned above the tank is treated as the rectangular shape therefore the boundary conditions can be easily enforced because the computational grid is coincided with the tank boundaries however in the practical engineering the liquid tank can be in various shapes such as the prism and the ellipsoid to treat the sloping boundaries the body fitted grid technique li et al 2005 is commonly used for example jiang et al 2015 simulated the sloshing of two partially filled prismatic tanks based on the openfoam zhao and chen 2015 simulated 3d sloshing flows in a partially filled lng tank by the overset grid method however it is not a trivial task for the body fitted grid method to handle multiple degree of freedom excitations or internal structures to treat these problems the non boundary fitted method hou 2012 where the governing equations are solved on a background cartesian grid provides an appealing alternative in the non boundary fitted method the body boundary does not coincide with the background grid lines to treat the sloping boundaries of the irregular shape tank kim et al 2004 introduced a concept of the buffer zone to enforce the free surface boundary condition near the tank ceiling to represent the existence of the baffles liu and lin 2009 introduced a body force to the momentum equations by the direct forcing immersed boundary method lee et al 2011 enforced the no slip boundary condition on the body surface by a quadratic polynomial interpolation scheme the interpolation stencils are divided into 13 cases based on the positional relationship between the body surface and the grid lines however the buffer zone can reduce the accuracy on the sloping boundaries and classification procedures in lee et al 2011 s approximation method are complicated so far literatures on the numerical simulation of sloshing in a 3d complex tank are rare therefore this paper presents a 3d cartesian grid based multiphase flow model to simulate large amplitude sloshing in a prismatic tank the present model has advantages in handling complex shape tanks with internal structures and capturing highly nonlinear free surfaces the main contributions are as follows first to treat arbitrary complex sloshing structures a ghost cell method with a unified reconstruction scheme is developed based on a two dimensional radial basis function ghost cell method xin et al 2018 the irregular boundaries of the tank are represented by wedge shaped bodies also the boundary conditions on the irregular boundaries are enforced by placing ghost cells inside the solid but adjacent the fluid therefore the effects of arbitrary sloshing structures on the flow field can be easily considered without introducing additional complexities second a 3d gals two phase flow method with pretreated reinitialization xin et al 2020 is presented to capture highly nonlinear free surfaces with good mass conservation therefore by combining the ghost cell method and the 3d gals two phase flow method a 3d cartesian grid based multiphase flow model is presented for wave structure interaction third nonlinear sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank with or without a baffle is simulated also the effects of the filling water depth the excitation frequency and the baffle height on the impulsive pressure and the wave elevation are analyzed when the sloshing is so violent that the slope and ceiling walls are exposed to impulsive pressures local strongly nonlinear phenomena can occur such as turbulence and air entrapment however the focuses are put on the global fluid motion and the impact load on the tank walls in this study the turbulent flow and air compressibility are ignored to avoid numerical instability because these local phenomena are very difficult to quantitatively analysis in the following section the present mathematical model is given the details of the numerical model are presented in section 3 including the basic n s solver the numerical implementation of the ghost cell and the gals method for interface capturing in section 4 a test case is simulated to validate the present ghost cell method section 5 presents the numerical results and discussions on the sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank finally conclusions and future work are given in section 6 2 mathematical model 2 1 incompressible n s equations the motion of the two phase flow is governed by the incompressible n s equations the vector form is expressed as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p 1 ρ μ u u t f a where u is the velocity vector with the components of the velocity u v w in the x y and z directions ρ is the density t is the time p is the pressure μ is the dynamics viscosity coefficient and f a is the external body force for the simulation of the general two phase flows the external body force f a is the gravitational acceleration for sloshing flows f a is used to consider the effects of the moving tank on the flow field the external body force includes the gravitational acceleration and the inertia forces caused by the acceleration of the moving tank it is given in bai et al 2015 3 f a g d v d t d ω d t r r ω ω r r 2 ω d r r d t where v and ω are the translational and rotational velocity vectors in a moving non inertial frame respectively r and r are the coordinate vectors of the rotational origin and the grid nodes the five terms of the right hand side are the gravitational acceleration in the moving frame the translational force the angular acceleration the centrifugal and coriolis accelerations respectively 2 2 gals equations for interface capturing the gals equations nave et al 2010 for interface capturing include a ls equation in the classical ls method and a gradient equation the gradient equation can be derived by applying the gradient operator to the ls equation therefore the gals equations are expressed as 4 φ 1 φ 2 φ 3 φ 4 b 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 y 1 1 x 2 y 2 x 2 y 2 1 x 3 y 3 x 3 y 3 1 x 4 y 4 x 4 y 4 5 φ where φ is the ls function as in the classical ls method if a point is inside of the denser fluid one has φ 0 otherwise φ 0 ψ is the gradient vector φ 0 x is the ls value at the initial time x is the coordinate vector on the background cartesian grid φ is the gradient vector with φ ψ ψ and u are the gradient and velocity deformation matrices respectively to simulate the two phase flow the density and viscosity at each grid cell are defined by the ls function with the following equations 6 ρ h ε φ ρ w 1 h ε φ ρ a 7 μ h ε φ μ w 1 h ε φ μ a where subscripts w and a represent the water and the air respectively in this study a smoothed heaviside function h ε φ frantzis and grigoriadis 2019 is introduced to achieve the smoothing transition of the discontinuous fluid properties density and viscosity 3 numerical solver 3 1 numerical solution of n s equations in the present study the basic solver is developed in shi et al 2019 the governing equations are discretized by a finite difference method on a staggered cartesian grid the decoupling of the pressure and the velocity is realized by a fractional step method bevan et al 2016 also the convective fluxes are discretized by a roe s flux difference splitting method with a higher order total variation diminishing monotonic upstream centered scheme for conservation laws tvd muscl scheme leer 1997 this scheme is suitable for complicated turbulent viscous flows though the turbulent model is not involved in this study the viscous fluxes are discretized by a central difference scheme which can obtain second order accuracy in addition the momentum equations are advanced in time by a tvd second order runge kutta tvd rk2 scheme combined with a second order crank nicolson scheme which has good numerical stability the velocity dirichlet and the pressure neumann boundary conditions are enforced by the present ghost cell method after the momentum equations are solved also a preconditioned bi conjugate gradient stabilized bicgstab method van der vorst 2003 is coupled with a diagonal storage format to solve the large sparse positive definite matrix coming from the poisson equations for pressure 3 2 numerical implementation of the gals equations the gals equations are re expressed in the characteristic form 8 d φ d t 0 and d ψ d t u ψ we use a generalized cir courant isaacson reese method courant et al 1952 to solve eq 8 the procedure is outlined in two steps first the characteristic curve equation x τ τ u x τ τ is solved by backward integration from time t δ t to t with the shu osher rk3 method second the ls function φ and its gradient vector ψ are updated by solving eq 8 the gradient equation is solved by an explicit trapezoidal scheme forward integration along the characteristic curve note that the variables φ and ψ at arbitrary positions are interpolated by the hermite cubic polynomial scheme to maintain high accuracy in addition first and second derivatives are analytically calculated by differentiating this hermite interpolation scheme thus the interpolation errors are avoided more details are given in xin et al 2020 3 3 solid boundary treatment by a ghost cell method the ghost cell method is used in the present study to enforce the no slip boundary conditions on the immersed boundary the existence of the stationary or moving body is represented by placing a finite number of ghost cells inside the immersed body in this study we employ a unified eight point reconstruction scheme to evaluate the ghost cell values the basic idea is that the nearest stencil points belong to the ghost cells are replaced by the corresponding boundary points to keep the eight point scheme nam 2015 employed a similar strategy in his 2d ghost cell method for compressible flows therefore there is no need to perform the classification procedure on the ghost cells the first key step is to describe the immersed boundary and identify the phase state of the grid cells xin et al 2018 the next step is to interpolate the ghost cell values by introducing a concept of mirroring points the interpolation procedure consists of the following sub steps marking the mirroring points interpolating the mirroring point values and satisfying the mirroring conditions 3 3 1 marking the mirroring points for each ghost cell there is one mirroring point mp to be determined by mirroring the ghost cell to the fluid domain along the outward normal of the body surface when the line from the ghost cell node to the mirroring point intercepts the body surface a boundary projecting point bp is formed and locates in the middle between the ghost cell node gc and the mirroring point mp to ensure numerical stability the boundary point need to be uniquely identified we first search all the surface elements to identify one element center ec closest to the considered ghost cell the subscripts such as ec gc and bp represent the positions of corresponding grid nodes as shown in fig 1 for the sake of simplicity 2d interpolation stencils are shown in fig 1 the same as fig 2 then the boundary point and the mirroring point are calculated as 9 x b p x g c δ l n e c 10 x m p x g c 2 δ l n e c δ l x e c x g c n e c x e c x g c n x e c y e c y g c n y e c z e c z g c n z e c where δ l is the distance from the boundary point bp to the ghost cell gc x y z are the coordinate components in the x y and z directions respectively n n x n y n z is the outward normal vector along the body surface n x n y n z are the components of the normal vector along x y and z directions respectively 3 3 2 interpolating mirroring point values a unified eight point tri linear reconstruction scheme is developed to interpolate the fluid variables of the mirroring points the tri linear reconstruction scheme is expressed as 11 ϕ x y z a 1 a 2 x a 3 y a 4 z a 5 x y a 6 x z a 7 y z a 8 x y z where ϕ x y z is the flow variable the velocity component in one direction or the pressure at a mirroring point a t is the unknown coefficient vector with a t a 1 a 2 a 8 a t is calculated based on the eight nearest points enclosing the considered mirroring point 12 a b 1 ϕ where vector ϕ t ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 8 contains variable values at stencil points 1 8 and b is the 8 8 coefficient matrix of the tri linear interpolation scheme with the coordinates at nodes 1 8 the matrix b is expressed as 13 b 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 z 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x 2 y 2 z 2 x 2 y 2 x 2 z 2 y 2 z 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 1 x 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 x 8 z 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 z 8 when the mirroring point is enclosed by eight fluid cell nodes the coefficient matrix b is obtained from the coordinates of the eight fluid cell fc nodes 1 8 as shown in fig 2 a the vector ϕ are the fluid variable values the velocity component or the pressure at eight fluid cell fc nodes 1 8 after the weighting coefficient vector a is solved using eq 12 the flow variable of the mirroring point can be calculated by eq 11 however there are situations when one or more stencil points are the ghost cells nodes themselves the ghost cells nodes are used as the stencil points to calculate the considered mirroring points which can lead to the ill posed and computational divergence problems therefore detailed treatments are required to avoid the ghost cell stencil points to avoid classifying various interpolation stencils first we identify the role of the eight nearest points enclosing the mirroring point for each nearest point if it lies in the fluid it is categorized as the stencil point if this nearest point is the ghost cell node then the corresponding boundary point bp is used as the stencil point instead of the ghost cell node 2 in fig 2 b to calculate the velocity component in the x y or z directions the dirichlet boundary condition u b p v is enforced where u b p is the velocity of the boundary point bp hence the velocity component in one direction such as x direction at the boundary point bp is expressed 14 u b a 1 a 2 x b p a 3 y b p a 4 z b p a 5 x b p y b p a 6 x b p z b p a 7 y b p z b p a 8 x b p y b p z b p where u b v b w b are the velocity of the rigid body in the x y and z directions respectively the second row in eq 13 for the node 2 is replaced by eq 14 then the coefficient vector for the x component of the velocity at the mirroring point is solved by 15 a 1 a 2 a 8 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 z 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 1 x b p y b p z b p x b p y b p x b p z b p y b p z b p x b p y b p z b p 1 x 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 x 8 z 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 z 8 1 ϕ 1 u b ϕ 8 the velocity components in the y and z directions are solved in a similar way for the pressure variable the neumann boundary condition is enforced the pressure at the boundary point bp is expressed 16 p b p a 1 a 2 x b p a 3 y b p a 4 z b p a 5 x b p y b p a 6 x b p z b p a 7 y b p z b p a 8 x b p y b p z b p differentiating the pressure along the x y and z directions we obtain 17 p b p x a 2 a 5 y b p a 6 z b p a 8 y b p z b p 18 p b p y a 3 a 5 x b p a 7 z b p a 8 x b p z b p 19 p b p z a 4 a 6 x b p a 7 y b p a 8 x b p y b p as we know the pressure gradient vector on the mirroring point can be expressed 20 p b p n p b p x n x p b p y n y p b p z n z therefore substituting eqs 17 19 into eq 20 we can obtain 21 a b p a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 x b p y b p a 6 x b p z b p a 7 y b p z b p a 8 c b p where a b p n d v b d t and c b p x b p y b p x b p z b p y b p z b p then the second row in eq 15 for the node 2 is replaced by eq 21 the coefficient vector for the pressure at the mirroring point is solved by 22 a 1 a 2 a 8 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 x 1 z 1 y 1 z 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 0 1 1 1 x b p y b p x b p z b p y b p z b p c b p 1 x 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 x 8 z 8 y 8 z 8 x 8 y 8 z 8 1 ϕ 1 a b p ϕ 8 the treatment above aims at the situation that one nearest point enclosing the mirroring point if the other nearest points are also identified as the ghost cell nodes as shown in fig 2 c we just repeat the above procedure for the second or more boundary points consequently a unified eight point interpolation scheme is ensured moreover the interpolation procedure for the mirroring points is consistent and the accuracy is not compromised when any of eight nearest points is classified as the ghost cell node 3 3 3 obtaining ghost cell values after the fluid variables at the mirroring points are evaluated the ghost cell value ϕ g c can be determined from the mirroring point values by satisfying a mirroring condition 23 ϕ g c ξ 1 ϕ m p ξ 2 for the velocity variable the dirichlet boundary condition is enforced by assuming a linear variation along the normal of the immersed boundary we can obtain ξ 1 1 and ξ 2 2 ϕ b p where ϕ b p is the velocity component of the boundary point in one direction for the pressure variable the neumann boundary condition is enforced we can obtain with s b and ξ 2 δ d g m n d v b d t δ d g m is the distance from the ghost cell node to the mirroring point then the fluid variables at the ghost cells are calculated according to eq 23 the ghost cell values are calculated in a robust and consistent manner boundary conditions are implicitly enforced when the governing equations are solved on the entire computation domain by a standard seven point central difference scheme consequently the treatment for the complex body is simplified because the numerical discretization is not affected by the geometrical complexity of the immersed body note that the coordinate positions of the velocity component in three directions and the pressure are not coincidence because the computation is conducted on the staggered cartesian grid therefore the ghost cell interpolation procedures in section 3 3 are required to perform four times for the three velocity components and the pressure 3 4 time step restrictions to ensure reasonable convergence to solution and solution quality the time step is restricted by the cfl courant friedreichs lewy condition the restriction conditions are given as 24 t ω c f l min t c o n v t v i s c t g r a v t c o n v u max δ x v max δ y w max δ z 1 t v i s c max μ ρ w μ ρ a 1 δ x 2 1 δ y 2 1 δ z 2 1 t g r a v min δ x δ y δ z max g 10 6 where t c o n v t v i s c and t g r a v are the convective viscous and gravity restrictions respectively ω c f l is the time relaxation coefficient δ x δ y and δ z are the grid sizes in the cartesian grid along x y and z directions respectively 4 test case of flows around a sphere the present gals two phase flow method xin et al 2020 is validated by linear and nonlinear sloshing in a 3d rectangular tank good grid convergence is achieved in this section the incompressible viscous flows around a sphere are simulated to validate the accuracy of the present ghost cell method for 3d boundary flows the reynolds number re u d υ is an important parameter in the incompressible viscous flows where d is the diameter of the sphere with d 1 m and u is the uniform flow velocity several reynolds numbers are chosen as re 50 100 and 200 in the present study the computational domain is set as 8d 16d 8d 8d 8d 8d in the x y and z directions respectively the non uniform grid is applied with a refined domain of 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d 0 8d the sphere is located on the origin of the coordinate system at the inflow boundary a uniform flow is applied free flow and radiative boundary conditions are applied at the outflow boundary and free stream boundaries respectively for pressure variable the pressure is set to zero at the outflow boundary and the neumann boundary condition is applied at other boundaries to investigate grid convergence three grid resolutions are used with 16 8 8 32 16 16 and 64 32 32 grid in the refined domain the minimum grid sizes in the x direction near the sphere for three grid resolutions are 0 1 d 0 05 d and 0 025 d respectively the computations are conducted on a dell 7920 workstation with 1 7 ghz cpu the cpu time on the coarsest grid of δ x 0 1 d is within 1 days however the finest grid of δ x 0 025 d are time consuming with an approximate cpu time of 24 days quantitative analysis on the force coefficient is first conducted the drag coefficient is defined as c d 2 f x ρ u a s where f x is the hydrodynamic load on the sphere in the flow direction a s is the area of the cross section a s π r 2 for the sphere table 1 shows the comparison of drag coefficients at three reynolds numbers from present results experimental data clift et al 1978 and numerical results by zhang 2013 s body fitted grid method for all reynolds numbers the drag coefficients c d on the coarse grid δ x 0 1 d are overestimated about 10 compared with the experimental data however as the grid in the refined domain is refined to δ x 0 05 d the drag coefficients c d rapidly approach the reference results when the grid of δ x 0 025 d is used good agreement is achieved specifically the maximum error with respect to the experimental data is 1 88 at the reynolds number of re 200 and the minimum error is 0 06 at re 100 moreover the present drag coefficients on the finest grid are closer to the experimental data than those of zhang s body fitted grid method for re 100 and 200 it indicates that the accuracy of the present method is comparable to the body fitted method fig 3 shows the relationship between the relative error of drag coefficient ε d and the grid size in the x direction for three reynolds numbers where the error ε d is calculated with ε d c d p r e c d exp c d exp according to the present drag coefficients c d p r e and the experimental data c d exp the dashed line in fig 3 represents the second order slope the relative errors of drag coefficients ε d show approximately second order convergence rate for three reynolds numbers indicating the second order spatial accuracy of the present method in addition as the reynolds number increases the relative errors on three grid systems grow especially the drag coefficients on the coarse grid obviously deviate the experimental results it shows that the flow on the higher reynolds number requires refiner grid resolution further the hydrodynamic characteristics at different reynolds numbers are investigated figs 4 6 show the streamlines and vortex contours at the reynolds numbers of re 50 100 and 200 the flow is separated behind the sphere forming two oppositely rotating symmetrical vortices for all reynolds numbers with the increase of the reynolds number the separation area grows also a pair of thinner symmetrical vortices is attached on the sphere and extends to far downstream leading to a smaller drag coefficient 5 large amplitude sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank based on the proposed numerical model we developed an in house 3d multiphase flow solver in fortran 90 language fig 7 gives the flow chart of the present numerical algorithm the time integration process of the n s equations is shown in the box formed by the dashed dotted line with the present solver numerical studies on liquid sloshing are conducted and the influences of the filling level and the baffle height on the impulsive load are investigated we hope to give insight into the hydrodynamic characteristics of sloshing offering theoretical guidance for the structural design of the lng tank 5 1 sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank without a baffle to investigate sloshing characteristics in a complex tank large amplitude sloshing induced by rolling excitations in a 3d prismatic tank is simulated the accuracy of the present multiphase flow model is validated moreover parametric studies on the filling water depth and the excitation frequency are investigated based on mikelis et al 1984 s experimental work the principal dimension of the 3d rectangular tank is l 0 741 m in length w 0 399 m in width and h 0 405 m in height the geometrical model is shown in fig 8 the rotational axis y1y2 of the tank is at the center of the x axis and above the tank bottom 0 194 m the rolling motion of the tank are described as θ y θ 0 sin ω t θ y is the rolling angle θ 0 is the rolling amplitude with θ 0 0 1 rad ω is the rolling frequency with ω 2 π t t is the rolling period five filling levels are considered the computational parameters are shown in table 2 where h is the filling level and the tank rotates around the diagonal line of x y plane for case 4 seven pressure sensors denoted by r1 r7 are placed at the center of the right wall with a distance from the tank bottom 0 075 m 0 1135 m 0 205 m 0 2965 m 0 341 m 0 390 m and 0 405 m respectively and the pressure sensor r7 is 0 02 away from the right wall also a wave gauge is placed at a distance of 0 1356 m from the left wall the computation is conducted on a domain of 0 m 0 741 m 0 m 0 399 m 0 m 0 405 m the velocity no slip boundary conditions are applied on all boundaries the pressure at the top wall is set to zero for reference to keep consistent with the experimental setting also the pressure neumann boundary conditions are applied on the other walls to consider the existence of the slope walls four wedges are placed on the four corners of the tank an improved ghost cell method is applied to enforce the boundary conditions on the four wedges first the case of the filling level h h 0 9 is simulated to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the present multiphase flow method to investigate the convergence of the grid sizes three different uniform grids including 80 50 60 100 60 80 and 120 80 100 in the x y and z directions respectively are used to discretize the computational domain the time relaxation coefficient is set to ω c f l 0 3 the time histories of the pressure at the point r3 and wave elevation results by the present method on three grids are compared with the experimental data as shown in fig 9 the pressures and wave amplitudes on three grids agree well with the experimental data minor discrepancies are observed on the peak pressures probably because the two phase interface is treated by the smoothed heaviside function leading to a diffused and smooth interface however the peak pressures gradually approach to the experimental data as the grid refines in fig 9 a also the wave crests are truncated at the position of the wave elevation η 0 4 m because the waves climb up to the tank ceiling to investigate the convergence of the time step three different time relaxation coefficients are considered as ω c f l 0 1 ω c f l 0 3 and ω c f l 0 6 the grid size is 100 60 80 in the x y and z directions respectively fig 10 shows the pressure and wave elevation results against time by the present method with three relaxation coefficients and the experimental data again good agreements are obtained between the present method at all coefficients and the experimental data the present calculation is demonstrated to be insensitive to the grid sizes and time intervals confirming the reliability of the present method thus the time coefficient ω c f l 0 3 and the grid of 100 60 80 are adopted in the following computations to achieve a balance between the result smoothness and computational cost the present wave elevation and pressure at three measuring points are compared with the experimental data for cases 1 5 in figs 11 15 the pressure in figs 11 15 is the total pressure including the hydrostatic pressure and the dynamic pressure when the filling level is h h 0 3 the pressure at the slope bottom r1 agrees well with the experimental data the pressure pulse values at r2 and r4 of the vertical wall are slightly higher than the experimental data as shown in fig 11 for the free surface elevation the troughs agree with the experimental data but the crests are a little higher for h h 0 46 the pressures at r1 r2 r3 and the wave troughs show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data as shown in fig 12 however the wave crests are a little higher approximately 8 as the filling level increases to h h 0 61 in fig 13 the variation trend of the pressure is consistent with that of the experiment the peak pressures at r2 and r3 are slightly lower than the experimental data the amplitude of the pressure pulse at point r4 changes wildly and exhibits strong instability due to the instantaneous impact when the filling level is h h 0 75 the present pressures and the free surface elevation show overall agreements with the experimental data as shown in fig 14 specifically the pressure trough at r2 is a little higher approximately 12 than the experimental data and the amplitude of the pressure pulse at the point r5 of the chamfered wall is slightly lower as the filling level increases to the maximum h h 0 9 the present pressures at r1 r3 and the wave elevation agree well with the experimental data however the amplitude of the pressure pulse at point r6 is lower than the experiment as shown fig 15 the obvious deviations between the present results and the experimental data at the point above the water surface in figs 11 15 may be caused by the turbulence and air entrapment effects air compressibility cannot be considered and turbulent model is not used in the present study however the turbulence and air compressibility may occur in the violent sloshing situations the deviations are reasonable and acceptable considering the complexity nonlinearity and instantaneity of the 3d violent sloshing then the hydrodynamics characteristics of the impulsive pressures are analyzed for the filling level h h 0 3 the sloshing wave periodically hits the tank walls above the static water generating the pressure pulse as observed in fig 11 meanwhile in each period two successive pressure peaks occur which is caused by the highly nonlinear wave impact the first peak happens when the climbing wave washes up to the tank wall the second peak appears when the falling water hits the wall because the movement of the water lags behind the tank when the filling level increases to h h 0 46 or 0 61 the nonlinearity of the sloshing flow decreases the single pressure peak occurs in each period as shown in figs 12 and 13 for h h 0 61 the pressure curve at r2 approximately exhibits the harmonic oscillation with an amplitude of 2100 pa this point r2 is below the static water surface and both the static and dynamic pressures play a role in contrast the pressures at r3 and r4 exhibit a pulse characteristic and the pulse amplitudes of both are slightly over 2000 pa also the pressures at r3 and r4 are dominated by the dynamic pressure in addition the pulse pressure at r3 lasts a longer time than that at r4 as shown in fig 13 because the point r3 is located right under r4 when the filling level increases to the maximum h h 0 9 the nonlinearity of the sloshing flow further decreases the pressure curves at r1 and r3 are approximately sinusoidal and the pressure at the chamfered wall r2 shows the pulse characteristics as shown in fig 15 on the other hand the curve of the wave elevation is gradually closer to the sinusoidal variation as the filling level increases from h h 0 3 to h h 0 9 as observed in figs 11 15 the pressure and wave elevation amplitudes increase first then decrease as the filling level rises from h h 0 3 to h h 0 9 for h h 0 3 the amplitudes of the pressure pulses at r1 and r2 are approximately 2000 pa but the amplitude at r4 is below 700 pa as shown in fig 11 the chamfered and vertical walls experience huge impulsive pressures indicating that the local structure at the tank bottom need to be strengthened as the filling level increases to h h 0 61 the pressure amplitudes at r2 r3 and r4 on the right wall are very large and reach approximately 2000 pa it indicates that the structural strength of the entire vertical wall need be reinforced for h h 0 9 the pressure amplitudes at r1 r3 and r6 decrease remarkably approximately 1000 pa the entire tank walls including the chamfered walls experience the safer loads compared with h h 0 61 the liquid carrier is in an ideal sailing condition when the liquid tank is fully loaded this situation should be avoided when the filling level of the tank is approximate half of the tank height at this situation the liquid carrier is in a dangerous sailing condition and the structural strength of the tank wall should be reinforced further the hydrodynamic characteristics of this sloshing are reproduced figs 16 20 show the 3d wave surface on the sloshing tank at two moments for five filling levels respectively for h h 0 3 the water moves to the one side as the tank rotates the velocity of the upper fluid is larger than that of the lower fluid generating a rising wave when the tank rotates to the maximum rolling angles the rising wave hits the tank as shown in fig 16 a afterwards the tank drives the water to move towards the opposite direction generating another rising wave as shown in fig 16 b for h h 0 46 and 0 61 the sloshing wave hits the chamfered wall at the top with the movement of the tank generating a steep wave when the steep wave climbs up to its highest position on the chamfered wall then it falls down under the effects of gravity generating a plunging wave meanwhile the plunging wave is superimposed with the wave at front forming wrinkle wave pattern as shown in figs 17 and 18 when the filling level increases to h h 0 75 and 0 9 the lower fluid keeps stable under the viscosity and inertia effects the upper fluid moves in a form of the small amplitude wave under the constraints of the chamfered wall and the tank top in addition the free surface for h h 0 75 shows obvious asymmetry with respect to the x z plane due to the rotation around the diagonal line of x y plane as shown in fig 19 the peak load on the tank wall is a critical factor for the structural design of the liquid tank therefore we further studied the influence of the excitation frequencies on the pressure amplitudes at local positions fig 21 shows the variation of the pressure amplitudes with the excitation frequencies f e at r2 for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 the pressure amplitudes for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 are about 2580 and 2490 pa respectively also the natural frequencies the excitation frequencies corresponding to the peak pressures are 5 1 and 5 5 rad s for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 respectively the natural frequency for h h 0 61 is larger than that for h h 0 46 because the natural frequency increases with the rising of the water depth in addition as the excitation frequency increases to the natural frequency the pressure amplitude significantly increases and reaches the peak pressure when the excitation frequency continues to increase and is away from the natural frequency the pressure amplitude decreases rapidly also the declining speed of the pressure amplitude is larger than the increasing speed when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of the sloshing tank even a small change in natural frequency can make a large difference in the pressure amplitude therefore changing the natural frequency of the liquid tank can be an effective way to reduce the pressure amplitude the natural frequency can be changed by modifying the principal dimension in the structural design stage or the fluid depth in the operation stage 5 2 sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank with different baffle heights in this section the sloshing with different baffle heights in the prismatic tank is studied the dangerous condition of h h 0 61 is chosen as a typical example fig 22 shows the time history of the pressure and the wave elevation at five baffle heights h b h 0 0 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 where ε is the ratio of the baffle height to the water depth and h b is the baffle height no baffle exists for h b h 0 0 as the baffle height increases the impulsive pressure and the wave elevation drops significantly specifically when the baffle heights is h b h 0 25 no obvious reduction is observed on the pressure and the wave amplitude is slightly smaller than that of h b h 0 0 the reason is probably that the rolling movement occurs on the upper fluid but the bottom fluid keeps relatively stable therefore the baffle is high enough to block the violent movement of the upper fluid as the baffle height increases to h b h 0 5 obvious reductions on the pressure peak and the wave amplitude are observed the amplitudes are reduced approximately 40 for the pressure amplitude at the point r2 and 35 for the wave amplitude the pressure crest becomes sharper and the pressure and wave curves gradually approach to the sinusoidal patterns it shows that the fluid movement at the central region are blocked by the baffle leading to the reduction of nonlinearity for h b h 0 75 the pressure amplitudes are about 500 pa at the points r2 and r3 much less than the 2000 pa for h b h 0 0 also the wave amplitude is about 0 06 m much less than the 0 2 m for h b h 0 0 in addition the pressure pulse at the point r4 is not observed when the baffle height increases to the maximum h b h 1 0 the pressure curve at the point r2 exhibits the sinusoidal variation with an amplitude of about 500 pa also the wave elevation almost keeps horizontal the interaction mechanism between the baffle and the fluid is also investigated figs 23 25 show pressure contours at two typical moments of one period for the baffle height h b h 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 in fig 23 the water above the baffle is driven to the opposite direction as the tank moves to the right side when the tank moves to the far left the flow rises to the right chamfered wall also a large impulsive pressure occurs on the corner of the chamfered wall indicating that the structural strength of the chamfered wall needs to be reinforced as the baffle height increases to h b h 0 5 the flow field is less violent and the free surface does not touch the chamfered wall during the rolling movement of the tank therefore high impulsive pressure on the chamfered wall is not observed the reason is that the baffle blocks the sloshing fluid moving from the high pressure area to the low pressure area as shown in fig 24 the pressure field in the tank is discontinuous on both sides of the baffle when the baffle moves to the far left the baffle blocks the fluid moving from the right high pressure area to the left low one and vice versa for h b h 0 75 the flow field is more stable and the free surface remains nearly horizontal the results show that the blocking effects of the baffle can effectively reduce the impulsive pressure 6 conclusions and outlook in this study a cartesian grid based 3d multi phase flow model is presented to simulate strongly nonlinear sloshing in a prismatic tank with or without a baffle this model is capable of handling complex shape tanks and capturing large deformation of the free surface such as the plunging wave a ghost cell method with a unified scheme is developed to treat the slope boundaries and the baffle also the nonlinear free surface is captured by a 3d gals two phase flow method the present numerical method is compared with experimental data good agreements are achieved also main conclusions are drawn first the accuracy of the present 3d ghost cell method is validated by simulating flows around a sphere at low reynolds numbers the present results gradually approach to the experimental and numerical results as the grid refines also the grid convergence shows that the present ghost cell method can obtain approximately second order accuracy in space in addition as the reynolds number increases the relative errors on three grids grow then we investigated large amplitude sloshing in a 3d prismatic tank under rolling excitations in the case of the filling level h h 0 9 the sensitivity analyses of grid sizes and time steps are conducted confirming the good grid and time convergences of the present model afterwards the cases of five filling water depths are simulated reasonable agreements on the pressure and the wave elevation are obtained between the present results and the experimental data confirming the accuracy of the present model again some discrepancies are observed on the pulse pressures due to the turbulence and air entrapment effects for h h 0 3 highly nonlinear phenomena two successive pressure peaks occur as the filling level increases the nonlinearity decreases and the two pressure peaks turn into a single peak for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 the sinusoidal variation of the pressure is observed as the filling level increases to h h 0 9 dangerous situations occur when the tank is partially filled the bottom chamfered wall experiences huge impulsive pressures for h h 0 3 when the filling water is approximate half of the tank height such as h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 large impact pressures occur on the entire vertical wall then we investigated the relationship between the pressure amplitude and the excitation frequency also the natural frequencies of the sloshing system for h h 0 46 and h h 0 61 are identified as approximately 5 1 and 5 5 rad s respectively in addition we investigated the effects of baffle height on the pressure and the wave elevation for h h 0 61 installing a baffle inside the tank can effectively reduce the sloshing movement and the impulsive pressure the most apparent effects are achieved when the baffle height is between h b h 0 5 and h b h 0 75 in the future we intend to incorporate the turbulent model into our multiphase flow model to more complicated sloshing flows such as multi degree of freedom motion and wave breaking phenomena credit authorship contribution statement jianjian xin methodology formal analysis writing original draft zhenlei chen
