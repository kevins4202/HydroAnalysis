sights on the vast amount of ocean energy resources budnik and chernyi 2016 chong et al 2016 jaeckel 2016 jaeckel et al 2017 liu et al 2014 merey 2016 shudong et al 2020a 2020b exploitation of marine energy resources requires underwater production systems the underwater production system is primarily comprised of three parts the underwater production equipment wan et al 2010 2015 the onboard control module and the auc which is used to connect the ground control module and the underwater production equipment as shown in fig 1 the function of the auc is to supply power transmit data and handle load for submarine equipment mao et al 2016 once installed in place high reliability of the auc is required throughout the development life cycle of marine energy resources as it is unsuitable for replacement due to the impact of the complex environmental load of the ocean wind random irregular waves ocean current sea surface flow submarine flow internal waves etc alexander and ingrid 2018 jin et al 2016 the production platform will produce a complex motion response at this time the auc will be subjected to large tensile loads bending loads and the effect of periodic fatigue loads li et al 2018 the finite method of auc have been investigated by many authors throughout the past few decades the study of weidong ruan presents a reasonable analytical model to study the mechanical behavior of deepwater lazy wave umbilical considering the effect of environmental loads and elastic seabed and provides a reasonable guidelines for engineering application of umbilical installation ruan et al 2014a m a vaz considered that the flexible pipe may be subjected to high axial compression during installation or operation in deep water resulting in the phenomenon of birdcaging based on this phenomenon a nonlinear finite element model composed of a beam and a spring is used to simulate and analyze flexible pipe armor vaz and rizzo 2011a marcos a rabelo also studied the birdcaging phenomenon in view of the phenomenon of birdcaging it is produced on the external protective layer of the umbilical cable the research on the external protective layer of the umbilical cable is carried out the conclusion is that when the pipeline is compressed the outer protective layer of the umbilical cable has plastic deformation while the inner armored layer has elastic deformation and will recover thus the outer protective layer of the umbilical cable has birdcaging phenomenon rabelo et al 2015 william c guttner compared and analyzed the damage of armored umbilical cable by two and three dimensional approaches the two dimensional approach appears as a good solution for design at least in preliminary stages considering its slight conservativeness and its computational efficiency compared to three dimensional approach the three dimensional calculation takes a long time but is more accurate guttner et al 2017 therefore stretch bending and periodic fatigue loading should be carried out and the cross section of the auc and the dynamic response of each unit should be analyzed to guide the design of the cable structure and ensure high reliability in this work a high quality auc finite element analysis model is constructed it is the basis for the dynamic response analysis of the auc as it is a pre processing step for the finite element analysis of both the cable itself and the high quality mesh of the cable models ruan et al 2014b traditionally finite element analysis software is used to automatically divide the mesh of the model vaz and rizzo 2011b the divided model grid is then partially adjusted and excess mesh is removed the technical requirements for this automatic generated method are low and the overall quality of the grid is poor the generated model mesh is basically a tetrahedral or wedge mesh but the auc is a more complicated object comprised of numerous components in addition the end face shapes are circular circular ring fan shaped curved triangle and curved square the model has a very large influence on the calculation accuracy of the dynamic response analysis of the auc and in order to obtain a high quality and precise model grid a hexahedral mesh the parts of the model must be meshed separately in addition different mesh methods should be adopted for the different end face shapes of the auc therefore this paper proposes a high quality mesh method for the auc of deep sea equipment the components of the auc are first divided into five types according to the cross sectional shape circular circular ring sector curved triangle and curved square then different hexahedral mesh methods are used for the five different cross section types to obtain high quality hexahedral meshes for each part which are then assembled together a three dimensional hexahedral mesh model is then obtained and the finite element analysis method is used for comparative experiments thereby providing technical support for the design and reliability

it has a low density high tensile strength high toughness and high resilience and is also characterized by wear resistance oil resistance and water resistance it allows for the compacting of the main body of the auc and can further isolate seawater preventing it from penetrating into the interior of the cable body and causing damage to the components moreover the outer insulating layer 4 is in direct contact with the inner layer 3 which prevents damage to the interior of the cable body due to friction the inner insulating layer 8 is made of an aramid fiber reinforced composite material the secondary wire unit 11 is wrapped and compressed by the inner insulating layer 8 moreover the aramid fiber has excellent insulation and mechanical properties and the secondary wire 11 is fully protected while ensuring the radial size of the auc the gap is filled with a liquid silicone rubber material which is composed of a silicone rubber a crosslinking agent and a catalyst and is self crosslinked and solidified after filling to form a rubber like deformable rubber body characterized by high strength and good toughness it has no shrinkage good sealing performance and high water resistance it can prevent the components from colliding with each other which prevents seawater from infiltrating into and damaging the components 2 2 auc mesh model constructing a high quality finite element analysis model of the auc is the basis for the analysis of the cable as shown in fig 3 high quality mesh is a necessary pre processing step for obtaining the finite element analysis model which has a great influence on the calculation accuracy of the dynamic response analysis of the auc finite element analysis software is traditionally used to automatically divide the mesh of the model excess mesh is then removed from the divided model grid this automatic generated method has low technical requirements and the overall quality of the resulting grid is poor in addition the model grid is basically a tetrahedral or wedge shaped grid as discussed in section 2 1 the auc is a relatively complex object comprised of many components and the standard model grid does not sufficiently reflect the design of the cable in order to obtain a high quality and precise auc model mesh a hexahedral mesh icem cfd software is used to respectively perform the hexahedron on each part of the model mesh additionally different mesh methods are used for the different face shapes of the end of the cable and the generated mesh is a structured hexahedral mesh the hexahedral mesh has advantages due to its high precision it is easier to achieve the boundary fitting of the region and it is suitable for both surface stress concentration and fluid calculation in order to verify its advantages the mesh will be compared with the automatically generated grid analysis results the hexahedral mesh operation flow is shown in fig 4 the main wire the secondary wire the optical fiber unit and the grounding wire unit are all regarded as solid the auc model is then built according to the actual structure of the cable and the components of the model are divided into a circular end face member a circular ring end face member a fan shaped end face member a side with a curved triangular end face member and a curved square side end face member the components of the circular end face include the following outer middle and inner armor layer steel wires a main wire a secondary wire an optical fiber unit and a grounding wire unit the circular ring end face member includes outer and inner insulating layers the scalloped end parts include an inner insulating layer filler the side is a curved triangular end face and includes a filler between the main wire and the inner insulating layer the component with a curved square side end face includes the center filler the icem cfd software is used to divide the grid and the 3d model of the auc is imported into the icem cfd software to divide the software the components of the 3d model are separately stored and are then opened for geometrical topology and geometric creation centerline are created for each component and two endpoints are created for the centerline for the circular end face 2d to 3d blocks are used to scan the path to generate a plurality of blocks and the first plane and the last plane of the block are associated with the circular end faces of the components in addition an o cut is performed on all the blocks and a grid is then generated and saved as shown in fig 5 the circular ring end face directly creates a 3d block creation an o cut is performed on the 3d block and the middle block is deleted the outer square of the block is associated with the outer circle of the ring and the inner square of the block is associated with the inner circle of the ring this operation is conducted separately on the end faces and then a mesh is generated and saved as shown in fig 6 the fan shaped end face also uses 2d to 3d blocks path scanning is performed to generate a plurality of blocks and the first and last planes of the block are individually correlated with the first and last planes of the sector end face respectively a y cut is performed on the plurality of blocks and all the edges of the block are associated with each other on the edge of the component the points on the block after the y cut are then adjusted to a certain position and a mesh is generated and saved as shown in fig 7 the curved triangular end face uses a 2d to 3d block the path scan is performed to generate a plurality of blocks and the first plane of the first block and the last plane of the last block are respectively associated with the end face of the end of the component a y cut is performed for the plurality of blocks and all the edges of the block are associated with each other on the edge of the component and then a grid is generated and saved as shown in fig 8 the curved square end face is directly created by the 3d block all the edges of the block are associated with each other one by one an o cut is performed on the 3d block and the distribution of the block points is adjusted to generate a mesh which is then saved as shown in fig 9 all generated meshes are input into the icem cfd software to create a complete auc grid as shown in fig 10 the each part of the model mesh size is consistent the global mesh setup are set and the global element scale factor is set to 1 and the global element seed size is set to 0 0005 therefore the element size of the hexahedral mesh is 0 0005m the automatically generated mesh is simultaneously generated the mesh program in ansys workbench software is used to realize the automatically generated mesh division the global mesh parameters are set then the local mesh is set and finally the mesh is previewed and generated the global grid parameters must first be set the basic parameters defaults are set and the relevance parameter in the defaults area is set to 100 this parameter is used to control the overall quality of the mesh the maximum value is 100 and the larger the value the better and more detailed the mesh quality the other basic parameters adopt the default value for the mesh size setting sizing the relevance center in the sizing area is set to fine refinement the three dimensional model of the auc is 0 1 m long which is considered the minimum size the element size is set to 0 0005 m the smoothing is set to low which conforms to the structure calculation and the other grid size settings are the default values the expansion setting is also set to the default values for the advanced parameter settings of the grid advanced the topology checking in the advanced area is set to yes and the global grid parameter settings are complete the local grid settings take the default settings and the generated grid is displayed in fig 11 the automatic mesh is the same size as the hexahedral mesh 3 finite element analysis of auc 3 1 theoretical analysis model for tensile stiffness of auc because the auc has a very complicated structure and the material has a high degree of nonlinearity it is necessary to limit the conditions before the theoretical analysis of the tensile stiffness of the cable hruska 1951 1952 1953 sævik 2011 feret and bournazel 1987 1 the auc is tightly structured and there is no gap between the components of the cable when the force is not applied 2 all parts of the auc are evenly arranged 3 the elongation and twist angle of each layer are consistent when the auc is stretched its stress unit is mainly its three layer armor layer therefore the armor layer is analyzed theoretically and the single armored steel wire wound on the cable core is analyzed as shown in fig 12 when a single armored steel wire is pulled it will be strained and the strain is divided into axial strain and radial strain the analysis is divided into the following two cases considering only the axial strain of the auc the axial deformation of the cable is δ l the axial angle between the armored steel wire and the cable core is α i the amount of deformation in the direction of the armored wire is δ l c o s α i the length of the armored cable before deformation is l 0 l cos α i the axial strain of the armored steel wire and the axial strain of the auc are as follows lu 2013 1 ε il δ l cos α i l 0 δ l l cos 2 α i considering only the radial strain of the auc the radial contraction of the cable is δ r the axial angle between the armored steel wire and the cable core is α i therefore the radial contraction amount of the armored steel wire is δ r s i n α i the length of the armored cable before deformation is r 0 r s i n α i where r is the radius of the armored steel wire around the core thus the axial strain of the armored steel wire and the axial strain relationship of the auc are as follows lu 2013 2 ε il δ r sin α i r 0 δ r r sin 2 α i when the auc is stretched axial deformation and radial shrinkage occur equations 1 and 2 are the axial strain of the armored steel wire therefore the two equations are combined to obtain the axial deformation of the single auc and the deformation relationship of the entire auc lu 2013 3 ε i δ l l cos 2 α i δ r r sin 2 α i the tensile behavior of the auc can be expressed as sævik 2011 4 f i 1 m e a ε i cos α i δ l l i 1 m e a cos 3 α i δ r i 1 m e a sin 2 α i cos α i r i in the formula ea is the cross sectional tensile stiffness of the auc m is the number of armored layers and i is the sequence number 3 2 material selection and contact settings during the use of the auc most of the load is borne by the armored layer and the core of the cable is subjected to a small part of the load in the finite element analysis of the hexahedral mesh and automatically generated meshing the parameters of the materials as defined in the finite element analysis are presented in table 2 the armor layer and optical fiber material are defined as structural steel the outer insulating layer material is defined as thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer tpu material the inner insulating layer is defined as aramid fiber all filler materials are defined as silicone rubber material the main wire the secondary wire and the grounding wire unit are defined as copper material the contact type bonded is defined by ansys workbench as for the contact between armor wires it is also arranged as bonded and the chosen contact behavior is symmetric all the contact surfaces are set as the target surfaces bonded is used to define bonded contact bonded contact means that objects that are in contact with each other cannot be separated but move uniformly and conform to the reality symmetric is used to define symmetric contact which means that all faces are set contact surfaces or target surfaces target surfaces do not penetrate each other ensure that the units do not penetrate each other the stability of finite element calculation is guaranteed as shown in fig 13 3 3 loading constraints and loads the auc is primarily subjected to the load of the underwater production system during transfer to a lower level the lifting of the underwater production system the dynamic force exerted by the ocean wave and the ocean current on the sheathed umbilical cable and the pressure of the seawater to simulate the actual working conditions for both hexahedral mesh and automatically generated mesh finite element analyses it is preferred to first determine the applied constraints and then determine the applied load because the auc is a multi part spiral hinge the structure is complicated in this paper tensile analysis of the auc is carried out the working conditions of the cable laying down and recovering underwater production equipment are simulated the degree of freedom of the component surface is completely constrained on one end while the component that bears the weight of the umbilical cable is the outer three layer armor layer therefore the other end face of the three layer armor layer is coupled so that the degree of freedom of the node is coupled and a tensile force is applied to the face see fig 14 the corresponding strain is extracted by finite element analysis and the tensile force of the auc is calculated the theoretical results are compared and verified and the results of hexahedral mesh and automatically generated mesh finite element analyses are compared to verify the advantages of the hexahedral mesh 3 4 analysis result to study the auc under different axial tensile forces the variation of each structure and the results of finite element analysis using different grids are compared to verify the accuracy of the hexahedral mesh finite element method in this paper the changes of stress and strain in the automatically partitioned grid and hexahedron grid are analyzed by ansys with tensile force of the auc of f 50000 n 100000 n 150000 n and 200000 n respectively figs 15 17 are all under a tensile force of 50000 n and the strain and stress diagram of the overall models of the outer armor the middle armor the inner armor the outer insulating layer and the auc are obtained by automatically generated mesh analysis figs 18 20 are all under a tensile of 50000 n and the strain and stress diagram of the overall models of the outer armor the middle armor the inner armor the outer insulating layer and the auc are obtained by hexahedron mesh analysis the maximum strain and stress values of the sheathed umbilical cable are obtained from the tensile force simulation results of f 50000 n 100000 n 150000 n and 200000 n figs 15 17 display the automatically generated mesh model automatically generated by the auc the armored layer steel wire is the member mainly subjected to the tensile load therefore the maximum strain and stress occur in the armored layer steel wire figs 18 20 display the sheathed umbilical cable hexahedral mesh model from which it can be seen that the armored layer steel wire is the member mainly subjected to tensile load and is where the maximum stress occurs but the maximum strain occurs in the outer insulating layers comparing figs 15 17 with figs 18 20 it is evident that the initial setting parameters of the two are the same but the grid type is different and the analysis results of strain size stress size and outer insulation strain size are also different when the armored layer steel wire is subjected to tensile load it undergoes certain strain and stress and the friction of the inner layer of the armored layer and the outer layer of the insulation layer will cause axial deformation of the outer layer of the insulation layer at the same time when the armored layer is subjected to tensile load it will undergo slight radial deformation which will squeeze the core and extrude the outer layer of the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer material the maximum strain of the hexahedral mesh is about twice that of the automatically generated mesh and the maximum stress of the automatically generated mesh is about twice that of the hexahedral mesh this is because the automatically generated mesh distribution is uneven while the hexahedral mesh is evenly distributed and the materials of the components of the auc are inconsistent resulting in excessive stress in some parts according to the simulation the average strain of each of the components of the auc is calculated under different tensile conditions and the calculated tensile force and actual tensile force are obtained the calculated tensile force is shown in table 3 and the absolute value of the calculated tensile force is then subtracted from the actual tensile force and an error diagram is drawn as shown in fig 21 4 conclusion in summary when the auc is under load the main load bearing component is the armored layer of the cable the results of the calculation and analysis of the auc hexahedral mesh are more accurate than those of automatically generated mesh while the division and generation of the hexahedral mesh of the auc are complicated and the calculation times are long the correctness and accuracy of the hexahedral mesh are verified in this paper a new type of three dimensional auc model is proposed the auc is divided into the hexahedral mesh and the hexahedral mesh model is generated the hexahedral mesh model and the automatically generated grid of the cable were developed and then compared via tensile finite element analysis data verification was carried out to prove the correctness and accuracy of the hexahedral mesh of the sheathed cable this research provides a basis for the future analysis or coupling analysis of the auc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

are created for the centerline for the circular end face 2d to 3d blocks are used to scan the path to generate a plurality of blocks and the first plane and the last plane of the block are associated with the circular end faces of the components in addition an o cut is performed on all the blocks and a grid is then generated and saved as shown in fig 5 the circular ring end face directly creates a 3d block creation an o cut is performed on the 3d block and the middle block is deleted the outer square of the block is associated with the outer circle of the ring and the inner square of the block is associated with the inner circle of the ring this operation is conducted separately on the end faces and then a mesh is generated and saved as shown in fig 6 the fan shaped end face also uses 2d to 3d blocks path scanning is performed to generate a plurality of blocks and the first and last planes of the block are individually correlated with the first and last planes of the sector end face respectively a y cut is performed on the plurality of blocks and all the edges of the block are associated with each other on the edge of the component the points on the block after the y cut are then adjusted to a certain position and a mesh is generated and saved as shown in fig 7 the curved triangular end face uses a 2d to 3d block the path scan is performed to generate a plurality of blocks and the first plane of the first block and the last plane of the last block are respectively associated with the end face of the end of the component a y cut is performed for the plurality of blocks and all the edges of the block are associated with each other on the edge of the component and then a grid is generated and saved as shown in fig 8 the curved square end face is directly created by the 3d block all the edges of the block are associated with each other one by one an o cut is performed on the 3d block and the distribution of the block points is adjusted to generate a mesh which is then saved as shown in fig 9 all generated meshes are input into the icem cfd software to create a complete auc grid as shown in fig 10 the each part of the model mesh size is consistent the global mesh setup are set and the global element scale factor is set to 1 and the global element seed size is set to 0 0005 therefore the element size of the hexahedral mesh is 0 0005m the automatically generated mesh is simultaneously generated the mesh program in ansys workbench software is used to realize the automatically generated mesh division the global mesh parameters are set then the local mesh is set and finally the mesh is previewed and generated the global grid parameters must first be set the basic parameters defaults are set and the relevance parameter in the defaults area is set to 100 this parameter is used to control the overall quality of the mesh the maximum value is 100 and the larger the value the better and more detailed the mesh quality the other basic parameters adopt the default value for the mesh size setting sizing the relevance center in the sizing area is set to fine refinement the three dimensional model of the auc is 0 1 m long which is considered the minimum size the element size is set to 0 0005 m the smoothing is set to low which conforms to the structure calculation and the other grid size settings are the default values the expansion setting is also set to the default values for the advanced parameter settings of the grid advanced the topology checking in the advanced area is set to yes and the global grid parameter settings are complete the local grid settings take the default settings and the generated grid is displayed in fig 11 the automatic mesh is the same size as the hexahedral mesh 3 finite element analysis of auc 3 1 theoretical analysis model for tensile stiffness of auc because the auc has a very complicated structure and the material has a high degree of nonlinearity it is necessary to limit the conditions before the theoretical analysis of the tensile stiffness of the cable hruska 1951 1952 1953 sævik 2011 feret and bournazel 1987 1 the auc is tightly structured and there is no gap between the components of the cable when the force is not applied 2 all parts of the auc are evenly arranged 3 the elongation and twist angle of each layer are consistent when the auc is stretched its stress unit is mainly its three layer armor layer therefore the armor layer is analyzed theoretically and the single armored steel wire wound on the cable core is analyzed as shown in fig 12 when a single armored steel wire is pulled it will be strained and the strain is divided into axial strain and radial strain the analysis is divided into the following two cases considering only the axial strain of the auc the axial deformation of the cable is δ l the axial angle between the armored steel wire and the cable core is α i the amount of deformation in the direction of the armored wire is δ l c o s α i the length of the armored cable before deformation is l 0 l cos α i the axial strain of the armored steel wire and the axial strain of the auc are as follows lu 2013 1 ε il δ l cos α i l 0 δ l l cos 2 α i considering only the radial strain of the auc the radial contraction of the cable is δ r the axial angle between the armored steel wire and the cable core is α i therefore the radial contraction amount of the armored steel wire is δ r s i n α i the length of the armored cable before deformation is r 0 r s i n α i where r is the radius of the armored steel wire around the core thus the axial strain of the armored steel wire and the axial strain relationship of the auc are as follows lu 2013 2 ε il δ r sin α i r 0 δ r r sin 2 α i when the auc is stretched axial deformation and radial shrinkage occur equations 1 and 2 are the axial strain of the armored steel wire therefore the two equations are combined to obtain the axial deformation of the single auc and the deformation relationship of the entire auc lu 2013 3 ε i δ l l cos 2 α i δ r r sin 2 α i the tensile behavior of the auc can be expressed as sævik 2011 4 f i 1 m e a ε i cos α i δ l l i 1 m e a cos 3 α i δ r i 1 m e a sin 2 α i cos α i r i in the formula ea is the cross sectional tensile stiffness of the auc m is the number of armored layers and i is the sequence number 3 2 material selection and contact settings during the use of the auc most of the load is borne by the armored layer and the core of the cable is subjected to a small part of the load in the finite element analysis of the hexahedral mesh and automatically generated meshing the parameters of the materials as defined in the finite element analysis are presented in table 2 the armor layer and optical fiber material are defined as structural steel the outer insulating layer material is defined as thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer tpu material the inner insulating layer is defined as aramid fiber all filler materials are defined as silicone rubber material the main wire the secondary wire and the grounding wire unit are defined as copper material the contact type bonded is defined by ansys workbench as for the contact between armor wires it is also arranged as bonded and the chosen contact behavior is symmetric all the contact surfaces are set as the target surfaces bonded is used to define bonded contact bonded contact means that objects that are in contact with each other cannot be separated but move uniformly and conform to the reality symmetric is used to define symmetric contact which means that all faces are set contact surfaces or target surfaces target surfaces do not penetrate each other ensure that the units do not penetrate each other the stability of finite element calculation is guaranteed as shown in fig 13 3 3 loading constraints and loads the auc is primarily subjected to the load of the underwater production system during transfer to a lower level the lifting of the underwater production system the dynamic force exerted by the ocean wave and the ocean current on the sheathed umbilical cable and the pressure of the seawater to simulate the actual working conditions for both hexahedral mesh and automatically generated mesh finite element analyses it is preferred to first determine the applied constraints and then determine the applied load because the auc is a multi part spiral hinge the structure is complicated in this paper tensile analysis of the auc is carried out the working conditions of the cable laying down and recovering underwater production equipment are simulated the degree of freedom of the component surface is completely constrained on one end while the component that bears the weight of the umbilical cable is the outer three layer armor layer therefore the other end face of the three layer armor layer is coupled so that the degree of freedom of the node is coupled and a tensile force is applied to the face see fig 14 the corresponding strain is extracted by finite element analysis and the tensile force of the auc is calculated the theoretical results are compared and verified and the results of hexahedral mesh and automatically generated mesh finite element analyses are compared to verify the advantages of the hexahedral mesh 3 4 analysis result to study the auc under different axial tensile forces the variation of each structure and the results of finite element analysis using different grids are compared to verify the accuracy of the hexahedral mesh finite element method in this paper the changes of stress and strain in the automatically partitioned grid and hexahedron grid are analyzed by ansys with tensile force of the auc of f 50000 n 100000 n 150000 n and 200000 n respectively figs 15 17 are all under a tensile force of 50000 n and the strain and stress diagram of the overall models of the outer armor the middle armor the inner armor the outer insulating layer and the auc are obtained by automatically generated mesh analysis figs 18 20 are all under a tensile of 50000 n and the strain and stress diagram of the overall models of the outer armor the middle armor the inner armor the outer insulating layer and the auc are obtained by hexahedron mesh analysis the maximum strain and stress values of the sheathed umbilical cable are obtained from the tensile force simulation results of f 50000 n 100000 n 150000 n and 200000 n figs 15 17 display the automatically generated mesh model automatically generated by the auc the armored layer steel wire is the member mainly subjected to the tensile load therefore the maximum strain and stress occur in the armored layer steel wire figs 18 20 display the sheathed umbilical cable hexahedral mesh model from which it can be seen that the armored layer steel wire is the member mainly subjected to tensile load and is where the maximum stress occurs but the maximum strain occurs in the outer insulating layers comparing figs 15 17 with figs 18 20 it is evident that the initial setting parameters of the two are the same but the grid type is different and the analysis results of strain size stress size and outer insulation strain size are also different when the armored layer steel wire is subjected to tensile load it undergoes certain strain and stress and the friction of the inner layer of the armored layer and the outer layer of the insulation layer will cause axial deformation of the outer layer of the insulation layer at the same time when the armored layer is subjected to tensile load it will undergo slight radial deformation which will squeeze the core and extrude the outer layer of the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer material the maximum strain of the hexahedral mesh is about twice that of the automatically generated mesh and the maximum stress of the automatically generated mesh is about twice that of the hexahedral mesh this is because the automatically generated mesh distribution is uneven while the hexahedral mesh is evenly distributed and the materials of the components of the auc are inconsistent resulting in excessive stress in some parts according to the simulation the average strain of each of the components of the auc is calculated under different tensile conditions and the calculated tensile force and actual tensile force are obtained the calculated tensile force is shown in table 3 and the absolute value of the calculated tensile force is then subtracted from the actual tensile force and an error diagram is drawn as shown in fig 21 4 conclusion in summary when the auc is under load the main load bearing component is the armored layer of the cable the results of the calculation and analysis of the auc hexahedral mesh are more accurate than those of automatically generated mesh while the division and generation of the hexahedral mesh of the auc are complicated and the calculation times are long the correctness and accuracy of the hexahedral mesh are verified in this paper a new type of three dimensional auc model is proposed the auc is divided into the hexahedral mesh and the hexahedral mesh model is generated the hexahedral mesh model and the automatically generated grid of the cable were developed and then compared via tensile finite element analysis data verification was carried out to prove the correctness and accuracy of the hexahedral mesh of the sheathed cable this research provides a basis for the future analysis or coupling analysis of the auc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

21086,the hydrodynamics of the flow between and in the wake of contra rotating propellers is investigated experimentally via particle image velocimetry piv at different advanced coefficients results show that the flow dynamics is deeply influenced by the interplay between the two systems of helical vorticity that develop in the wake the forward and aft propellers slipstream structure is analyzed in terms of blade loading and relative phase angle the onset of tip vortex break up reconnection and pairing processes occurring within the wake is discussed with a focus on instability mechanisms flow field measurements between propellers highlight that the distribution of the tangential component is balanced more effectively by the aft propeller at specific loading conditions keywords contra rotating propellers particle image velocimetry helical vortexes 1 introduction in the last decades the demand for more efficient marine transportation has been among the most relevant driving forces in the field of naval research the goal of lower fuel consumption whose cost accounts for the largest share of the overall ship operations has been pursued via a range of different approaches with this regard contra rotating propellers crp represent a viable non conventional option for marine propulsion optimization and from an efficiency point of view they can be deemed an energy saving device esd the rationale underlying the crp design approach is rooted in the observation that the rotational flow induced by a single propeller does not contribute to thrust generation but rather is associated to an energy loss by means of a downstream counter rotating propeller partial recovery of this energy loss is expected thus increasing the total propulsive efficiency comparison between single twin screw and contra rotating propeller propulsion in azimuthal pod configuration has been carried out by kim et al 2002 for ultra large container vessel and min et al 2009 for very large container vessel respectively showing that crp design leads to substantial performance improvement nevertheless and despite its benefits crp implementation is not widespread due to the complex mechanical layout and non standardized design process many design parameters play a key role in the resulting crp system efficiency aft and forward propellers rotational speeds axial distance and diameter ratio are the most relevant also wake features such as the overlap between the aft and forward slipstreams are of marked interest although their correlation to the mentioned design parameters is yet to be fully understood while some authors provide an overview of the impact of relevant design characteristics see min et al 2009 on the overall system performance there have been attempts at developing procedures for the effective design of crp systems min et al 2009 sasaki et al 1998 grassi et al 2010 chang and go 2011 recently specific parameters have been the subject of analysis as in xiong et al 2016 where rans simulations are carried out in order to investigate the effect of the propellers axial separation on the propulsion system performance in particular the same authors xiong et al 2016 find that while the influence of axial distance is more relevant for the aft propeller rather than the forward one the global thrust decreases for growing axial separation to the authors knowledge most of the works on the subject approach the analysis of a crp system based on the sole observation of global quantities such as thrust and torque only recently analysis of the wake hydrodynamics has been systematically carried out zhang et al 2019 paik et al 2015 but the current knowledge on the subject is still limited over the last decades much attention has been put into the analysis of the vortex sheet developing in the wake of single propellers due to the blade lift distribution and in particular towards a better comprehension of the helical vortex destabilization mechanisms taking place within the near and far wake since the theoretical work outlined in widnall 1972 on single helical vortex several works have tackled this issue experimentally quaranta et al 2019 nemes et al 2015 for double helix configurations as well as theoretically and through simulations chapelier et al 2019 quaranta et al 2019 okulov and sørensen while much insight has been gained towards a better comprehension of mechanisms underlying the instability of helical vortexes from single propellers there is little knowledge as to how these phenomena develop and shape in crp systems a better understanding of helical vortexes behaviour is of much interest due to the often undesirable features associated to these structures in terms of radiated noise and structural vibrations induced on the mechanical parts in this experimental work we aim at shedding light onto the hydrodynamics that characterize contra rotating propeller propulsion systems by means of an advanced particle image velocimetry piv phase locked acquisition scheme the flow field between the propellers and in their wake is studied at three different values of the propeller advance coefficient j u 0 n d where u 0 n and d are respectively the free stream speed the propellers rotation speed and the forward propeller diameter the interactions between the forward and aft propellers are analyzed by focusing both onto the region between the propellers i e the intra propellers region and on the wake where the slipstreams associated to the forward and aft propellers contribute simultaneously to the flow perturbations in particular the intra propellers area which is thought to play a key role in the overall behaviour of the crp system is investigated via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry thus allowing the measurement of the full velocity vector field as well as relevant derived quantities within the wake the strong interplay occurring between the trailing vorticity systems stemming from the forward and aft propellers is analyzed and discussed in particular we focus on the mechanism underlying the destabilization of helical vortexes and their mutual interactions in crp propulsion which was only recently tackled by simulations zhang et al 2019 the results presented in this study contribute to a better understanding of the complex and challenging hydrodynamics which are characteristic of crp systems 2 set up and methods measurements are carried out at the italian navy cavitation tunnel ceimm the facility features a test section of size 0 6 m 0 6 m 2 6 m and perspex windows to allow optical access the contraction ratio is 6 1 and the operating speed range is 2 12 m s maximum free stream turbulence intensity in the test section is 2 and mean velocity uniformity is within 1 and 3 for the axial and radial components respectively the forward and aft propellers have three blades and a diameter of d and 0 9 d respectively and their inter distance l 5 m m is kept fixed throughout the experimental campaign propellers are mounted on two mechanically distinct dynamometers both equipped with an encoder with 0 2 resolution the one per rotation pulse signal coming from the aft propeller dynamometer encoder is fed to a pulse sequence generator and is used as the master trigger signal for the piv acquisition cameras two cmos high speed cameras sa1 1 photron fastcam 12 bit dynamic range 1024 1024 pixels image resolution 24 μm pixel size are arranged in stereoscopic configuration whereas a standard cross correlation ccd camera pco pixelfly qe 14 bit dynamic range 1392 1024 pixels image resolution is positioned on the opposite side of the cavitation tunnel the high speed system records an area of 0 7 d 0 5 d between the two propellers whereas the field of view of the latter system covers an area of approximately 0 7 d 0 4 d in the wake inter propeller and wake acquisitions overlap on an area which spans 0 1 d so that the overall measurement area covers 1 3 d in the axial direction the experimental set up cameras arrangement and acquisition regions and frame of reference are depicted in fig 1 the origin of the frame of reference is located onto the forward propeller s hub frontal surface and the acquired region spans an area from x d 0 2 to x d 1 5 approximately laser lighting is provided by a nd yag double cavity unit 200 mj per pulse at 12 5 hz for an estimated laser sheet thickness of 1 5 mm measurements are carried out at an advance coefficient ratio of 0 7 1 0 and 1 3 the working fluid is water seeded with 10 μ m silver coated hollow glass spheres the overall acquisition frequency is set to 3 hz the full velocity field u v w with respect to the frame of reference x y z is calculated with the commercial software insight 4g by tsi inc images are background subtracted and fed to the cross correlation algorithm the algorithm implements an iterative multi pass multi grid image deformation scheme with window offset for the inter propeller acquisitions the piv interrogation window size is set to 64 64 pixels for the first pass and 24 24 pixels for the second and final passes the resulting vector grid spacing is 12 pixels based on a sub window overlap of 50 which corresponds to approximately 0 05 d in the validation step spurious vectors are dropped according to a local median test carried out on a 9 point square kernel in the final step the three dimensional vector field is reconstructed from the left and right vector fields by following the general method implemented by soloff et al 1997 where third and first order polynomials obtained from calibration are used for in plane and out of plane components respectively stereo calibration is carried out with a four plane calibration target with size 300 mm 300mm inter marker distance 10 mm and a distance between planes in the z direction equal to 1 mm employing a two plane target allows 3 d calibration to be performed without the need to traverse the target adrian and westerweel 2011 for the wake measurements the piv interrogation window was set to 64 64 pixels and 32 32 pixels for the second and final passes resulting in a grid resolution of 16 pixels approximately 0 015 d the validation steps were the same as for the inter propeller acquisitions a mixed on line off line phase lock strategy is devised so that the separate contributions from the forward and aft propellers are conveniently analyzed during the acquisitions the cameras are synchronized to the aft propeller angular position ϕ whereas phase locking for the forward propeller angular position θ was carried out off line using the forward propeller encoder signal recorded during the acquisitions hence each piv frame can be directly associated to the corresponding forward propeller angle the acquired data is then sorted and phase averaged to obtain the mean velocity field u v w u v w for each forward and aft angular position pairs θ ϕ and higher statistics in this regard a similar approach to that presented in stella et al 2000 is carried out in this work where a trade off between statistical data convergence and resolution must be set the chosen strategy for the general θ angle is based on a gaussian window weighting with a standard deviation of 1 and 60 window overlap the resulting accuracy for the phase averaged velocity fields is 1 with a confidence interval of 95 based on a t student distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 wake region in fig 2 a sample instantaneous velocity field is shown at θ 80 and ϕ 50 after subraction of the free stream velocity u 0 it is well known and it has been shown by several authors cotroni et al 2000 di felice et al 2004 that the propeller blade generates a system of strong vortex structures at the blade tip due to the pressure difference between the suction and pressure sides and a sheet of vortexes which are shed downstream in the shear wake of the trailing edge as these systems undergo the main flow motion and blade rotational motion they arrange in helix like vortex sheet surfaces these highly coherent structures are typical in single propeller configurations and in presence of a rotor hub and undergo destabilization within the near and the far wake on the other hand in the operating conditions of counter rotating propellers two systems of helical vortex filaments give rise to complex interactions within the wake visible in fig 2 in the form of a region of close interplay between two recirculating regions in the range x d 1 2 to x d 1 5 3 1 1 slipstream structure a systematic analysis of the wake structure in terms of slipstream evolution is carried out by inspecting the mean axial component at different θ ϕ pairs the extent of overlap of the forward and aft slipstream tubes has been reported to be a relevant factor in crp design chang and go 2011 figs 3 5 show the mean axial velocity field obtained at forward propeller angle θ 0 40 80 and aft propeller angle ϕ 0 40 80 respectively dependence on advance ratio j is reported along the columns results are phase averaged according to the scheme presented in the previous section some flow features bear resemblances to single propeller wake in particular with respect to the variation of the advance coefficient j see di felice et al 2004 as j increases one can observe the relevant reduction of the normalized axial perturbation induced by the propeller the weakening of the tip vortex related velocity gradients and the increased distance between tip vortices the viscous wake due to the roll up of the boundary layers from the pressure suction surfaces of the propeller blades is linked to a local velocity deficit which is noticeable at ϕ 40 middle row at x d 1 and at ϕ 80 bottom row at x d 1 4 with a tendency of these regions to shift downstream for increasing j interestingly the contribution to this region of the viscous wake comes predominantly from the aft propeller whereas the forward propeller viscous wake is hardly detectable even for θ 80 see fig 5 this occurrence hints at the aft propeller working at a different loading condition with respect to the nominal one as suggested in zhang et al 2019 it is found that the aft propeller contributes to a strong flow acceleration in the wake which in turn displays a dependence on ϕ and θ angles in general for decreasing loading conditions i e at larger j the slipstream variations along the radial direction y are less marked while in zhang et al 2019 this occurrence is attributed to the instability of the tip vortex it appears that the wake structure modifications are in fact strictly related to the relative position between the two propellers to this end the data are conveniently organized so that a pseudo three dimensional representation of the results is made available this is carried out by considering for a fixed aft angle ϕ the whole span of the forward angle θ i e 0 120 also the three blade symmetry is exploited to obtain a full 360 data representation for each j and ϕ pairs with ϕ 0 40 80 fig 6 shows the iso surface maps of the average axial velocity for nine j ϕ pairs along with the normalized axial velocity field at the x d 1 cross plane the value of the iso surfaces displayed is different for every j and was chosen at 95 of the maximum axial velocity the choice of this value is arbitrary and serves the only purpose of qualifying from a qualitative standpoint the type of interaction occurring between the two propellers inspection of the axial velocity iso surfaces helps understand the role played by each propeller in the determination of the resulting slipstream and how it depends on their relative position in the first row of fig 6 corresponding to the aft phase angle ϕ 0 a three fold region is identified which points to a local region of axial flow increase this pattern is associated to the surge of the local axial mean flow due to the tip vortex filaments the iso surfaces topology indicates that these regions stem from the forward propeller since the aft propeller angular position is frozen in the current representation as the advance coefficient j increases the contribution of the aft propeller relative to the forward one is more evident as witnessed by the extent of the iso surface regions close to the aft propeller blades in fact the impact of each propeller onto the axial velocity distribution appears more balanced at aft angle ϕ 40 the iso surfaces display a more complex scenario as reported in the center column of figs 3 5 the interplay between the propellers appears relevant especially in the axial range 0 9 x d 1 2 the case j 0 7 and ϕ 40 shows how at this relative angle the contribution from the aft propeller is such as to approximately balance the forward one s this observation is confirmed by the presence of the three regions noticeable at x d 1 0 which are not seen in the case at ϕ 0 and whose topology is associated to the aft propeller for j 1 0 the corresponding regions vanish due to the lower relative axial velocity as confirmed by the inspection of the middle column of figs 3 5 whereas at j 1 3 this effect is most pronounced analysis of results for the ϕ 80 case indicates that the flow accelerating effects deriving from the interaction between the forward and aft propellers on the axial component of the velocity is remarkable the helix like regions associated to the forward propeller are still recognizable especially when compared to the ϕ 0 case for all the advance coefficients however these regions feature a broader and localized central area which is due to the concurring effect of the aft propeller nevertheless the extent of these features depends on the blade loading as the latter decreases the contribution from the aft propeller is weaker and the flow patterns discussed before tend to shift downstream in order to provide a global picture of the wake structure independent from the propellers relative angle the contribution to the axial flow is integrated over the whole ϕ and θ ranges i e 0 to 120 assuming three blade symmetry the result is shown in fig 7 at different loading conditions it appears that the slipstream contraction strongly depends on the loading conditions for j 0 7 the shape of the contraction is similar to that of single propeller operation with a more uniform distribution of the axial component starting around x d 1 15 for lower j the slipstream exhibits a stronger contraction and does not show any leveling across the measurement region namely down to x d 1 5 while the strength of the slipstream tube contraction for decreasing j is commonly exhibited by single propeller wake di felice et al 2004 the case under consideration shows that the mentioned phenomenon is altered by the concurring overlap of the aft and forward propellers potential wakes in this respect the region of highest flow acceleration is reported to change dramatically with blade loading while for j 0 7 the flow is mostly accelerated at about x d 1 5 for higher j this location is shifted upstream at approximately x d 1 25 further observations upon fig 7 reveal a strong resemblance of the wake contraction pattern for j 0 7 these findings match those of fig 6 in particular the case ϕ 80 where it appears that for j 1 0 and j 1 3 the forward and aft propeller interaction is highest in the region 1 2 x d 1 3 it is worth noticing that this scenario is most prominent at aft phase angle ϕ 80 the mean axial profiles obtained from fig 7 at specific downstream locations are given in fig 8 for different loading conditions analysis of the case at j 0 7 reveals a velocity deficit outside the propeller disk i e for y d 0 5 which indicates the presence of a viscous wake this occurrence is seen for all the reported x d locations with u u 0 0 85 we also notice a localized deficit at x d 0 96 for j 1 0 and j 1 3 close to the blade tip region y d 0 5 which is explained in lee et al 2004 by taking into account the centrifugal effect undergone by the viscous wake at the tip in the near wake on the other hand the axial velocity deficit shown in fig 8 for j 1 0 and j 1 3 for x d 1 13 and y d 0 5 may be better understood if one considers the interactions taking place between the two helical vortex systems as discussed in the next section a hint at the hydrodynamic performance of the crp system is provided by the aft to forward thrust and torque coefficient ratios k t a f t k t f o r k q a f t k q f o r shown in fig 9 for a range of advance coefficient 0 7 j 1 7 the coefficients were calculated according to the formulas k t t ρ n 2 d 4 and k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where t and q are respectively the measured thrust and torque interestingly at lower j the thrust balance is shifted towards the forward propeller whereas at approximately j 1 2 the load balance gradually shifts towards the aft propeller with a steep increase from j 1 6 the trend displayed by k q a f t k q f o r ratio shows an opposite behaviour with a slight balance shift towards the aft propeller below j 1 2 the trend reverses with k q a f t k q f o r below unity from j 1 2 to j 1 4 where it increases again these observations match the findings shown in fig 6 where contribution of the aft propeller relative to the forward is more evident at increasing j 3 1 2 vorticity evolution the role played by the vortex structures is better explained by investigating the normal vorticity field ω depicted in figs 10 12 for θ 0 θ 40 and θ 80 respectively as mentioned before two mechanisms underlie the resulting vorticity field and its evolution within the wake the formation of tip vortexes and the shedding of the trailing vorticity due to boundary layers developing over the blade surfaces in a crp system the forward and aft propellers simultaneously act to alter the phenomena of helix vortex filaments instability and roll up at first sight the analysis of the vorticity fields reveals some features that are common to single propeller operations for increasing j i e decreasing blade loading the tip vortex intensity is seen to decrease as also reported by several authors see cotroni et al 2000 di mascio et al 2014 tip vortexes intensity tends to weaken as they are convected dowstream with this effect particularly evident for the forward propeller vortexes the two layers of opposite sign ω associated to the trailing vorticity can be observed especially for j 0 7 also experiments on single propeller wake di felice et al 2004 show how at increasing j the difference of hydrodynamic pitch between the blade wake and the tip vortexes leads to an inter blade interaction with the wake of the actual blade losing connection with its corresponding vortex and starting to interact with the tip vortex released by the previous blade in the crp case under investigation it appears that this phenomenon is also present as seen on fig 10 for ϕ 40 middle row and fig 11 for ϕ 80 bottom row the driving mechanism is nonetheless different as the interaction takes place between forward and aft propellers this implies that in addition to inter blade interaction a concurring factor due to inter propeller interplay is added to the scenario the extent of the latter appears to be related to the relative phase angle between the contra rotating propellers in this respect observation of figs 10 and 12 shows that this mechanism is mostly observed for phase angle pairs θ ϕ where the difference θ ϕ 40 holds the extent of the overlap region between the forward and aft propeller slipstream is better outlined by integrating the ω field over all ϕ θ phases as shown in fig 13 the overlap region swept by the vorticity field indicates that the interaction between the two vortex systems reduces considerably for increasing j the nature of the interconnections between the two systems of helical vortexes is conveniently analyzed by inspecting the measured normal vorticity ω over a complete forward propeller phase angle cycle furthermore this approach makes it possible to separately investigate the effects of the two propellers to this aim we report in fig 14 the normal vorticity ω non dimensionalized by d and u 0 shown in θ 10 steps at constant ϕ 0 for j 1 3 and j 0 7 and for x d 0 8 for j 1 3 see left two columns of fig 14 the path followed by the tip vortex from the forward propeller over the cycle is clearly noticeable this vortex after crossing the blade tip region appears to be substantially undisturbed by the co existing aft propeller helical vortex which appears frozen as per the phase locking process the path followed by the vortex clearly outlines the characteristic contraction at approximately x d 1 4 as shown for 60 θ 70 this datum matches the values found in literature for single propellers at comparable j cotroni et al 2000 di felice et al 2004 on the other hand at j 0 7 right two columns of fig 14 the helical vortexes evolve exhibiting several unique features the stretching in the axial direction of the trailing vorticity which occurs in proximity of the tip vortex cores for 50 θ 60 the roll up roll over motion which is observed as the vortex cores get close to each other and occurring at 90 θ 110 the apparent upstream displacement of the region of interaction between the vortex cores in the range 10 θ 30 these interactions can be fully appreciated from the inspection along the θ angle sequence at 1 resolution provided as supplementary video material j07 phi0 avi the forward propeller cycle is conveniently described by starting from θ 30 and evolves as following the forward propeller s tip vortex travels downstream and begins to interact with the aft propeller tip vortex along its path up to θ 100 the aft propeller tip vortex slides downwards and upstream in a roll up pairing motion up to θ 120 the related vortex filament instability is seemingly of the long wave type quaranta et al 2019 and is not related to the vortex cores in the range 0 θ 30 the forward angle is zeroed according to three blade symmetry a break up and reconnection event is observed in the measurement plane this is analogous to the vortex filaments pairing described in nemes et al 2015 after which two reconnected filaments are generated we point out that while in nemes et al 2015 this phenomenon is reported to occur in the far wake here the crp configuration markedly anticipates the onset of the vortex pairing supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 108322 the following is are the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 furthermore the newly formed vortex filament whose core is observed in the measurement plane undergoes an upstream motion due to the mutual induction effect with the bottom one which is in turn convected downstream to start a new phase cycle at θ 50 a similar behaviour is reported at the same loading conditions and other ϕ angles as shown in fig 15 for ϕ 40 left and 80 right where the events of vortex tube break up and reconnection are highlighted by red circles and arrows respectively in the former case these events occur more upstream with the vortex cores closer to each other in both cases shown here the pairing process is coupled to vortex core deformation which is triggered by the proximity of the vortex filaments this type of induced instability which is analogous to the short wave type leweke et al 2014 thus appears to develop earlier in the near wake for a crp system additional supplementary video material is provided for the cases above as j07 phi40 avi and j07 phi80 avi respectively supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 108322 the following is are the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 2 multimedia component 3 the case ϕ 80 is further investigated by inspecting the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy k 0 5 u 2 v 2 and mixed reynolds stress u v both non dimensionalized by u 0 2 shown respectively on the left and right hand sides of fig 16 with u u u and v v v since the normal component w is not measured in the wake we recall that the above quantities are calculated in their two dimensional form beside the typical turbulent fluctuations related to the tip vortex and the viscous wake higher levels of k are observed following the vortex pairing process in the range 0 θ 20 the k distribution in fig 16 left shows that a bridge like region arises at θ 90 suggesting that a vortex reconnection mechanism similar to that described in kida and takaoka 1994 for opposite sign vortex tubes takes place in these conditions from the standpoint of the production of turbulent kinetic energy the analysis of the mixed reynolds stresses confirms that the interplay between turbulent fluctuations induced by the forward and aft propellers begins at even lower forward phase angles specifically from θ 60 this observation suggests that conditions characterized by lower k u 0 2 levels such as those found at higher j are less prone to this near wake interplay similarly to fig 6 a pseudo three dimensional representation of the vorticity field is provided in fig 17 for j 0 7 1 0 1 3 and ϕ 0 40 80 we point out that the actual iso surface range is arbitrary and is different for each advance coefficient because of the phase averaged approach the helix like surfaces are associated to the motion of the forward propeller whereas the ring like ones are linked to the aft propeller action two main features can be identified the trajectories of the forward propeller tip vortexes are deeply altered by the pairing and reconnection events this phenomenon is seen as a change in spiral pitch upon intersection with ring like surfaces the locations where these events take place is dependent on the relative angular position between propellers with the first pairing event occurring at x d 0 9 1 1 and 1 3 respectively at ϕ 40 80 and 0 dependence on j is only partial with similar patterns featured at j 1 0 and j 1 3 highest loading conditions namely j 0 7 feature an anticipated and stronger interaction with a relevant distortion of the helical surface 3 2 inter propeller region the analysis of the flow field in the region between the contra rotating propellers conveys much information about the extent of the action by the aft propeller against the swirling motion induced by the forward propeller simulations by zhang et al 2019 although on an instantaneous basis showed the role of forward and aft slipstream overlay in determining the distribution of the tangential component of velocity figs 18 and 19 show the phase averaged tangential velocity component for j 0 7 and ϕ 0 40 80 in transversal planes at x d 0 55 and x d 0 7 respectively these data were obtained based on the stereo piv out of plane component w measured between propellers arranged in a pseudo three dimensional representation as described in the previous sections in the plane x d 0 55 the negative tangential component within the region with radius r 0 5 where r y d 2 z d 2 confirms that at this loading condition the action by the aft propeller generates an excess transversal motion which is independent from the aft angle ϕ at x d 0 7 as depicted in fig 19 the distribution of the tangential velocity is reported to be more balanced for the condition ϕ 0 for ϕ 40 and ϕ 80 regions of local high gradients are detected on w and are thought to be caused by the vicinity of the forward propeller blade tip region where strong pressure gradients exist between the loaded and unloaded surfaces the role of the blade loading is also reported in figs 18 and 19 for j 1 0 and j 1 3 as the loading decreases the following features can be highlighted in the plane x d 0 55 within the region r 0 5 the distribution of w displays increasingly wider regions where the counter balancing effect of the aft propeller leads to a near null tangential component the flow region for which r 0 5 shows a more complex behaviour for j 0 7 and in particular at x d 0 7 the residual regions of positive component of w are confined to relatively small areas due to the high loaded aft propeller as it is clearly shown in fig 19 for ϕ 40 on the other hand at j 1 0 and j 1 3 these regions spread radially and eventually cover the whole disk showing dependence upon the aft propeller angle ϕ as visible in fig 19 this is in contrast with the results obtained in zhang et al 2019 where the tangential component distribution within the wake is shown to be almost independent of j here the blade loading is shown to play a relevant role in the overall w distribution between propellers 4 conclusions in this work we presented the results from an experimental campaign focused on the investigation of the hydrodynamics of contra rotating propellers crp at varying load conditions the measurements were carried out via planar and stereo particle image velocimetry using a mixed hardware software phase locking protocol enabling the analysis of the separate contributions from the forward and aft propellers results show that the flow dynamics featured by a crp system is characterized by complex interactions between the two systems of helical vorticity that develop from the blade tips into the wake these helical vortexes interact in a range of patterns which entail pairing processes associated to vortex filament instability mechanisms the interactions are demonstrated through the measurement of vorticity and of the reynolds stress tensor and are found to be dependent on both the blade loading and the relative phase angle in particular the interplay process is observed to be more intense toward higher loading conditions analysis of the average flow fields confirm that these interaction events also have a profound impact on the slipstream evolution flow field measurements between the propellers indicate that the overlap of the two propellers flow accelerating effect in the wake is strongly dependent on their relative angular positions the findings of the present work confirm that the wake of a contra rotating propeller system is characterized by the onset of helical vortex filaments instability phenomena early in the near wake these events are triggered by the mutual interaction between the forward and aft helical vortex systems which in turn depends on the relative angle between the propellers and is intensified at high loading conditions the study shows the importance of the hydrodynamic analysis of the wake flow for the effective design of crp propulsion systems and represents a first step toward research activities that will address specific aspects such as diameter ratio and distance between propellers and their effect on the wake dynamics and overall propulsive efficiency the data

21086,the hydrodynamics of the flow between and in the wake of contra rotating propellers is investigated experimentally via particle image velocimetry piv at different advanced coefficients results show that the flow dynamics is deeply influenced by the interplay between the two systems of helical vorticity that develop in the wake the forward and aft propellers slipstream structure is analyzed in terms of blade loading and relative phase angle the onset of tip vortex break up reconnection and pairing processes occurring within the wake is discussed with a focus on instability mechanisms flow field measurements between propellers highlight that the distribution of the tangential component is balanced more effectively by the aft propeller at specific loading conditions keywords contra rotating propellers particle image velocimetry helical vortexes 1 introduction in the last decades the demand for more efficient marine transportation has been among the most relevant driving forces in the field of naval research the goal of lower fuel consumption whose cost accounts for the largest share of the overall ship operations has been pursued via a range of different approaches with this regard contra rotating propellers crp represent a viable non conventional option for marine propulsion optimization and from an efficiency point of view they can be deemed an energy saving device esd the rationale underlying the crp design approach is rooted in the observation that the rotational flow induced by a single propeller does not contribute to thrust generation but rather is associated to an energy loss by means of a downstream counter rotating propeller partial recovery of this energy loss is expected thus increasing the total propulsive efficiency comparison between single twin screw and contra rotating propeller propulsion in azimuthal pod configuration has been carried out by kim et al 2002 for ultra large container vessel and min et al 2009 for very large container vessel respectively showing that crp design leads to substantial performance improvement nevertheless and despite its benefits crp implementation is not widespread due to the complex mechanical layout and non standardized design process many design parameters play a key role in the resulting crp system efficiency aft and forward propellers rotational speeds axial distance and diameter ratio are the most relevant also wake features such as the overlap between the aft and forward slipstreams are of marked interest although their correlation to the mentioned design parameters is yet to be fully understood while some authors provide an overview of the impact of relevant design characteristics see min et al 2009 on the overall system performance there have been attempts at developing procedures for the effective design of crp systems min et al 2009 sasaki et al 1998 grassi et al 2010 chang and go 2011 recently specific parameters have been the subject of analysis as in xiong et al 2016 where rans simulations are carried out in order to investigate the effect of the propellers axial separation on the propulsion system performance in particular the same authors xiong et al 2016 find that while the influence of axial distance is more relevant for the aft propeller rather than the forward one the global thrust decreases for growing axial separation to the authors knowledge most of the works on the subject approach the analysis of a crp system based on the sole observation of global quantities such as thrust and torque only recently analysis of the wake hydrodynamics has been systematically carried out zhang et al 2019 paik et al 2015 but the current knowledge on the subject is still limited over the last decades much attention has been put into the analysis of the vortex sheet developing in the wake of single propellers due to the blade lift distribution and in particular towards a better comprehension of the helical vortex destabilization mechanisms taking place within the near and far wake since the theoretical work outlined in widnall 1972 on single helical vortex several works have tackled this issue experimentally quaranta et al 2019 nemes et al 2015 for double helix configurations as well as theoretically and through simulations chapelier et al 2019 quaranta et al 2019 okulov and sørensen while much insight has been gained towards a better comprehension of mechanisms underlying the instability of helical vortexes from single propellers there is little knowledge as to how these phenomena develop and shape in crp systems a better understanding of helical vortexes behaviour is of much interest due to the often undesirable features associated to these structures in terms of radiated noise and structural vibrations induced on the mechanical parts in this experimental work we aim at shedding light onto the hydrodynamics that characterize contra rotating propeller propulsion systems by means of an advanced particle image velocimetry piv phase locked acquisition scheme the flow field between the propellers and in their wake is studied at three different values of the propeller advance coefficient j u 0 n d where u 0 n and d are respectively the free stream speed the propellers rotation speed and the forward propeller diameter the interactions between the forward and aft propellers are analyzed by focusing both onto the region between the propellers i e the intra propellers region and on the wake where the slipstreams associated to the forward and aft propellers contribute simultaneously to the flow perturbations in particular the intra propellers area which is thought to play a key role in the overall behaviour of the crp system is investigated via stereoscopic particle image velocimetry thus allowing the measurement of the full velocity vector field as well as relevant derived quantities within the wake the strong interplay occurring between the trailing vorticity systems stemming from the forward and aft propellers is analyzed and discussed in particular we focus on the mechanism underlying the destabilization of helical vortexes and their mutual interactions in crp propulsion which was only recently tackled by simulations zhang et al 2019 the results presented in this study contribute to a better understanding of the complex and challenging hydrodynamics which are characteristic of crp systems 2 set up and methods measurements are carried out at the italian navy cavitation tunnel ceimm the facility features a test section of size 0 6 m 0 6 m 2 6 m and perspex windows to allow optical access the contraction ratio is 6 1 and the operating speed range is 2 12 m s maximum free stream turbulence intensity in the test section is 2 and mean velocity uniformity is within 1 and 3 for the axial and radial components respectively the forward and aft propellers have three blades and a diameter of d and 0 9 d respectively and their inter distance l 5 m m is kept fixed throughout the experimental campaign propellers are mounted on two mechanically distinct dynamometers both equipped with an encoder with 0 2 resolution the one per rotation pulse signal coming from the aft propeller dynamometer encoder is fed to a pulse sequence generator and is used as the master trigger signal for the piv acquisition cameras two cmos high speed cameras sa1 1 photron fastcam 12 bit dynamic range 1024 1024 pixels image resolution 24 μm pixel size are arranged in stereoscopic configuration whereas a standard cross correlation ccd camera pco pixelfly qe 14 bit dynamic range 1392 1024 pixels image resolution is positioned on the opposite side of the cavitation tunnel the high speed system records an area of 0 7 d 0 5 d between the two propellers whereas the field of view of the latter system covers an area of approximately 0 7 d 0 4 d in the wake inter propeller and wake acquisitions overlap on an area which spans 0 1 d so that the overall measurement area covers 1 3 d in the axial direction the experimental set up cameras arrangement and acquisition regions and frame of reference are depicted in fig 1 the origin of the frame of reference is located onto the forward propeller s hub frontal surface and the acquired region spans an area from x d 0 2 to x d 1 5 approximately laser lighting is provided by a nd yag double cavity unit 200 mj per pulse at 12 5 hz for an estimated laser sheet thickness of 1 5 mm measurements are carried out at an advance coefficient ratio of 0 7 1 0 and 1 3 the working fluid is water seeded with 10 μ m silver coated hollow glass spheres the overall acquisition frequency is set to 3 hz the full velocity field u v w with respect to the frame of reference x y z is calculated with the commercial software insight 4g by tsi inc images are background subtracted and fed to the cross correlation algorithm the algorithm implements an iterative multi pass multi grid image deformation scheme with window offset for the inter propeller acquisitions the piv interrogation window size is set to 64 64 pixels for the first pass and 24 24 pixels for the second and final passes the resulting vector grid spacing is 12 pixels based on a sub window overlap of 50 which corresponds to approximately 0 05 d in the validation step spurious vectors are dropped according to a local median test carried out on a 9 point square kernel in the final step the three dimensional vector field is reconstructed from the left and right vector fields by following the general method implemented by soloff et al 1997 where third and first order polynomials obtained from calibration are used for in plane and out of plane components respectively stereo calibration is carried out with a four plane calibration target with size 300 mm 300mm inter marker distance 10 mm and a distance between planes in the z direction equal to 1 mm employing a two plane target allows 3 d calibration to be performed without the need to traverse the target adrian and westerweel 2011 for the wake measurements the piv interrogation window was set to 64 64 pixels and 32 32 pixels for the second and final passes resulting in a grid resolution of 16 pixels approximately 0 015 d the validation steps were the same as for the inter propeller acquisitions a mixed on line off line phase lock strategy is devised so that the separate contributions from the forward and aft propellers are conveniently analyzed during the acquisitions the cameras are synchronized to the aft propeller angular position ϕ whereas phase locking for the forward propeller angular position θ was carried out off line using the forward propeller encoder signal recorded during the acquisitions hence each piv frame can be directly associated to the corresponding forward propeller angle the acquired data is then sorted and phase averaged to obtain the mean velocity field u v w u v w for each forward and aft angular position pairs θ ϕ and higher statistics in this regard a similar approach to that presented in stella et al 2000 is carried out in this work where a trade off between statistical data convergence and resolution must be set the chosen strategy for the general θ angle is based on a gaussian window weighting with a standard deviation of 1 and 60 window overlap the resulting accuracy for the phase averaged velocity fields is 1 with a confidence interval of 95 based on a t student distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 wake region in fig 2 a sample instantaneous velocity field is shown at θ 80 and ϕ 50 after subraction of the free stream velocity u 0 it is well known and it has been shown by several authors cotroni et al 2000 di felice et al 2004 that the propeller blade generates a system of strong vortex structures at the blade tip due to the pressure difference between the suction and pressure sides and a sheet of vortexes which are shed downstream in the shear wake of the trailing edge as these systems undergo the main flow motion and blade rotational motion they arrange in helix like vortex sheet surfaces these highly coherent structures are typical in single propeller configurations and in presence of a rotor hub and undergo destabilization within the near and the far wake on the other hand in the operating conditions of counter rotating propellers two systems of helical vortex filaments give rise to complex interactions within the wake visible in fig 2 in the form of a region of close interplay between two recirculating regions in the range x d 1 2 to x d 1 5 3 1 1 slipstream structure a systematic analysis of the wake structure in terms of slipstream evolution is carried out by inspecting the mean axial component at different θ ϕ pairs the extent of overlap of the forward and aft slipstream tubes has been reported to be a relevant factor in crp design chang and go 2011 figs 3 5 show the mean axial velocity field obtained at forward propeller angle θ 0 40 80 and aft propeller angle ϕ 0 40 80 respectively dependence on advance ratio j is reported along the columns results are phase averaged according to the scheme presented in the previous section some flow features bear resemblances to single propeller wake in particular with respect to the variation of the advance coefficient j see di felice et al 2004 as j increases one can observe the relevant reduction of the normalized axial perturbation induced by the propeller the weakening of the tip vortex related velocity gradients and the increased distance between tip vortices the viscous wake due to the roll up of the boundary layers from the pressure suction surfaces of the propeller blades is linked to a local velocity deficit which is noticeable at ϕ 40 middle row at x d 1 and at ϕ 80 bottom row at x d 1 4 with a tendency of these regions to shift downstream for increasing j interestingly the contribution to this region of the viscous wake comes predominantly from the aft propeller whereas the forward propeller viscous wake is hardly detectable even for θ 80 see fig 5 this occurrence hints at the aft propeller working at a different loading condition with respect to the nominal one as suggested in zhang et al 2019 it is found that the aft propeller contributes to a strong flow acceleration in the wake which in turn displays a dependence on ϕ and θ angles in general for decreasing loading conditions i e at larger j the slipstream variations along the radial direction y are less marked while in zhang et al 2019 this occurrence is attributed to the instability of the tip vortex it appears that the wake structure modifications are in fact strictly related to the relative position between the two propellers to this end the data are conveniently organized so that a pseudo three dimensional representation of the results is made available this is carried out by considering for a fixed aft angle ϕ the whole span of the forward angle θ i e 0 120 also the three blade symmetry is exploited to obtain a full 360 data representation for each j and ϕ pairs with ϕ 0 40 80 fig 6 shows the iso surface maps of the average axial velocity for nine j ϕ pairs along with the normalized axial velocity field at the x d 1 cross plane the value of the iso surfaces displayed is different for every j and was chosen at 95 of the maximum axial velocity the choice of this value is arbitrary and serves the only purpose of qualifying from a qualitative standpoint the type of interaction occurring between the two propellers inspection of the axial velocity iso surfaces helps understand the role played by each propeller in the determination of the resulting slipstream and how it depends on their relative position in the first row of fig 6 corresponding to the aft phase angle ϕ 0 a three fold region is identified which points to a local region of axial flow increase this pattern is associated to the surge of the local axial mean flow due to the tip vortex filaments the iso surfaces topology indicates that these regions stem from the forward propeller since the aft propeller angular position is frozen in the current representation as the advance coefficient j increases the contribution of the aft propeller relative to the forward one is more evident as witnessed by the extent of the iso surface regions close to the aft propeller blades in fact the impact of each propeller onto the axial velocity distribution appears more balanced at aft angle ϕ 40 the iso surfaces display a more complex scenario as reported in the center column of figs 3 5 the interplay between the propellers appears relevant especially in the axial range 0 9 x d 1 2 the case j 0 7 and ϕ 40 shows how at this relative angle the contribution from the aft propeller is such as to approximately balance the forward one s this observation is confirmed by the presence of the three regions noticeable at x d 1 0 which are not seen in the case at ϕ 0 and whose topology is associated to the aft propeller for j 1 0 the corresponding regions vanish due to the lower relative axial velocity as confirmed by the inspection of the middle column of figs 3 5 whereas at j 1 3 this effect is most pronounced analysis of results for the ϕ 80 case indicates that the flow accelerating effects deriving from the interaction between the forward and aft propellers on the axial component of the velocity is remarkable the helix like regions associated to the forward propeller are still recognizable especially when compared to the ϕ 0 case for all the advance coefficients however these regions feature a broader and localized central area which is due to the concurring effect of the aft propeller nevertheless the extent of these features depends on the blade loading as the latter decreases the contribution from the aft propeller is weaker and the flow patterns discussed before tend to shift downstream in order to provide a global picture of the wake structure independent from the propellers relative angle the contribution to the axial flow is integrated over the whole ϕ and θ ranges i e 0 to 120 assuming three blade symmetry the result is shown in fig 7 at different loading conditions it appears that the slipstream contraction strongly depends on the loading conditions for j 0 7 the shape of the contraction is similar to that of single propeller operation with a more uniform distribution of the axial component starting around x d 1 15 for lower j the slipstream exhibits a stronger contraction and does not show any leveling across the measurement region namely down to x d 1 5 while the strength of the slipstream tube contraction for decreasing j is commonly exhibited by single propeller wake di felice et al 2004 the case under consideration shows that the mentioned phenomenon is altered by the concurring overlap of the aft and forward propellers potential wakes in this respect the region of highest flow acceleration is reported to change dramatically with blade loading while for j 0 7 the flow is mostly accelerated at about x d 1 5 for higher j this location is shifted upstream at approximately x d 1 25 further observations upon fig 7 reveal a strong resemblance of the wake contraction pattern for j 0 7 these findings match those of fig 6 in particular the case ϕ 80 where it appears that for j 1 0 and j 1 3 the forward and aft propeller interaction is highest in the region 1 2 x d 1 3 it is worth noticing that this scenario is most prominent at aft phase angle ϕ 80 the mean axial profiles obtained from fig 7 at specific downstream locations are given in fig 8 for different loading conditions analysis of the case at j 0 7 reveals a velocity deficit outside the propeller disk i e for y d 0 5 which indicates the presence of a viscous wake this occurrence is seen for all the reported x d locations with u u 0 0 85 we also notice a localized deficit at x d 0 96 for j 1 0 and j 1 3 close to the blade tip region y d 0 5 which is explained in lee et al 2004 by taking into account the centrifugal effect undergone by the viscous wake at the tip in the near wake on the other hand the axial velocity deficit shown in fig 8 for j 1 0 and j 1 3 for x d 1 13 and y d 0 5 may be better understood if one considers the interactions taking place between the two helical vortex systems as discussed in the next section a hint at the hydrodynamic performance of the crp system is provided by the aft to forward thrust and torque coefficient ratios k t a f t k t f o r k q a f t k q f o r shown in fig 9 for a range of advance coefficient 0 7 j 1 7 the coefficients were calculated according to the formulas k t t ρ n 2 d 4 and k q q ρ n 2 d 5 where t and q are respectively the measured thrust and torque interestingly at lower j the thrust balance is shifted towards the forward propeller whereas at approximately j 1 2 the load balance gradually shifts towards the aft propeller with a steep increase from j 1 6 the trend displayed by k q a f t k q f o r ratio shows an opposite behaviour with a slight balance shift towards the aft propeller below j 1 2 the trend reverses with k q a f t k q f o r below unity from j 1 2 to j 1 4 where it increases again these observations match the findings shown in fig 6 where contribution of the aft propeller relative to the forward is more evident at increasing j 3 1 2 vorticity evolution the role played by the vortex structures is better explained by investigating the normal vorticity field ω depicted in figs 10 12 for θ 0 θ 40 and θ 80 respectively as mentioned before two mechanisms underlie the resulting vorticity field and its evolution within the wake the formation of tip vortexes and the shedding of the trailing vorticity due to boundary layers developing over the blade surfaces in a crp system the forward and aft propellers simultaneously act to alter the phenomena of helix vortex filaments instability and roll up at first sight the analysis of the vorticity fields reveals some features that are common to single propeller operations for increasing j i e decreasing blade loading the tip vortex intensity is seen to decrease as also reported by several authors see cotroni et al 2000 di mascio et al 2014 tip vortexes intensity tends to weaken as they are convected dowstream with this effect particularly evident for the forward propeller vortexes the two layers of opposite sign ω associated to the trailing vorticity can be observed especially for j 0 7 also experiments on single propeller wake di felice et al 2004 show how at increasing j the difference of hydrodynamic pitch between the blade wake and the tip vortexes leads to an inter blade interaction with the wake of the actual blade losing connection with its corresponding vortex and starting to interact with the tip vortex released by the previous blade in the crp case under investigation it appears that this phenomenon is also present as seen on fig 10 for ϕ 40 middle row and fig 11 for ϕ 80 bottom row the driving mechanism is nonetheless different as the interaction takes place between forward and aft propellers this implies that in addition to inter blade interaction a concurring factor due to inter propeller interplay is added to the scenario the extent of the latter appears to be related to the relative phase angle between the contra rotating propellers in this respect observation of figs 10 and 12 shows that this mechanism is mostly observed for phase angle pairs θ ϕ where the difference θ ϕ 40 holds the extent of the overlap region between the forward and aft propeller slipstream is better outlined by integrating the ω field over all ϕ θ phases as shown in fig 13 the overlap region swept by the vorticity field indicates that the interaction between the two vortex systems reduces considerably for increasing j the nature of the interconnections between the two systems of helical vortexes is conveniently analyzed by inspecting the measured normal vorticity ω over a complete forward propeller phase angle cycle furthermore this approach makes it possible to separately investigate the effects of the two propellers to this aim we report in fig 14 the normal vorticity ω non dimensionalized by d and u 0 shown in θ 10 steps at constant ϕ 0 for j 1 3 and j 0 7 and for x d 0 8 for j 1 3 see left two columns of fig 14 the path followed by the tip vortex from the forward propeller over the cycle is clearly noticeable this vortex after crossing the blade tip region appears to be substantially undisturbed by the co existing aft propeller helical vortex which appears frozen as per the phase locking process the path followed by the vortex clearly outlines the characteristic contraction at approximately x d 1 4 as shown for 60 θ 70 this datum matches the values found in literature for single propellers at comparable j cotroni et al 2000 di felice et al 2004 on the other hand at j 0 7 right two columns of fig 14 the helical vortexes evolve exhibiting several unique features the stretching in the axial direction of the trailing vorticity which occurs in proximity of the tip vortex cores for 50 θ 60 the roll up roll over motion which is observed as the vortex cores get close to each other and occurring at 90 θ 110 the apparent upstream displacement of the region of interaction between the vortex cores in the range 10 θ 30 these interactions can be fully appreciated from the inspection along the θ angle sequence at 1 resolution provided as supplementary video material j07 phi0 avi the forward propeller cycle is conveniently described by starting from θ 30 and evolves as following the forward propeller s tip vortex travels downstream and begins to interact with the aft propeller tip vortex along its path up to θ 100 the aft propeller tip vortex slides downwards and upstream in a roll up pairing motion up to θ 120 the related vortex filament instability is seemingly of the long wave type quaranta et al 2019 and is not related to the vortex cores in the range 0 θ 30 the forward angle is zeroed according to three blade symmetry a break up and reconnection event is observed in the measurement plane this is analogous to the vortex filaments pairing described in nemes et al 2015 after which two reconnected filaments are generated we point out that while in nemes et al 2015 this phenomenon is reported to occur in the far wake here the crp configuration markedly anticipates the onset of the vortex pairing supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 108322 the following is are the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component 1 furthermore the newly formed vortex filament whose core is observed in the measurement plane undergoes an upstream motion due to the mutual induction effect with the bottom one which is in turn convected downstream to start a new phase cycle at θ 50 a similar behaviour is reported at the same loading conditions and other ϕ angles as shown in fig 15 for ϕ 40 left and 80 right where the events of vortex tube break up and reconnection are highlighted by red circles and arrows respectively in the former case these events occur more upstream with the vortex cores closer to each other in both cases shown here the pairing process is coupled to vortex core deformation which is triggered by the proximity of the vortex filaments this type of induced instability which is analogous to the short wave type leweke et al 2014 thus appears to develop earlier in the near wake for a crp system additional supplementary video material is provided for the cases above as j07 phi40 avi and j07 phi80 avi respectively supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2020 108322 the following is are the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 2 multimedia component 3 the case ϕ 80 is further investigated by inspecting the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy k 0 5 u 2 v 2 and mixed reynolds stress u v both non dimensionalized by u 0 2 shown respectively on the left and right hand sides of fig 16 with u u u and v v v since the normal component w is not measured in the wake we recall that the above quantities are calculated in their two dimensional form beside the typical turbulent fluctuations related to the tip vortex and the viscous wake higher levels of k are observed following the vortex pairing process in the range 0 θ 20 the k distribution in fig 16 left shows that a bridge like region arises at θ 90 suggesting that a vortex reconnection mechanism similar to that described in kida and takaoka 1994 for opposite sign vortex tubes takes place in these conditions from the standpoint of the production of turbulent kinetic energy the analysis of the mixed reynolds stresses confirms that the interplay between turbulent fluctuations induced by the forward and aft propellers begins at even lower forward phase angles specifically from θ 60 this observation suggests that conditions characterized by lower k u 0 2 levels such as those found at higher j are less prone to this near wake interplay similarly to fig 6 a pseudo three dimensional representation of the vorticity field is provided in fig 17 for j 0 7 1 0 1 3 and ϕ 0 40 80 we point out that the actual iso surface range is arbitrary and is different for each advance coefficient because of the phase averaged approach the helix like surfaces are associated to the motion of the forward propeller whereas the ring like ones are linked to the aft propeller action two main features can be identified the trajectories of the forward propeller tip vortexes are deeply altered by the pairing and reconnection events this phenomenon is seen as a change in spiral pitch upon intersection with ring like surfaces the locations where these events take place is dependent on the relative angular position between propellers with the first pairing event occurring at x d 0 9 1 1 and 1 3 respectively at ϕ 40 80 and 0 dependence on j is only partial with similar patterns featured at j 1 0 and j 1 3 highest loading conditions namely j 0 7 feature an anticipated and stronger interaction with a relevant distortion of the helical surface 3 2 inter propeller region the analysis of the flow field in the region between the contra rotating propellers conveys much information about the extent of the action by the aft propeller against the swirling motion induced by the forward propeller simulations by zhang et al 2019 although on an instantaneous basis showed the role of forward and aft slipstream overlay in determining the distribution of the tangential component of velocity figs 18 and 19 show the phase averaged tangential velocity component for j 0 7 and ϕ 0 40 80 in transversal planes at x d 0 55 and x d 0 7 respectively these data were obtained based on the stereo piv out of plane component w measured between propellers arranged in a pseudo three dimensional representation as described in the previous sections in the plane x d 0 55 the negative tangential component within the region with radius r 0 5 where r y d 2 z d 2 confirms that at this loading condition the action by the aft propeller generates an excess transversal motion which is independent from the aft angle ϕ at x d 0 7 as depicted in fig 19 the distribution of the tangential velocity is reported to be more balanced for the condition ϕ 0 for ϕ 40 and ϕ 80 regions of local high gradients are detected on w and are thought to be caused by the vicinity of the forward propeller blade tip region where strong pressure gradients exist between the loaded and unloaded surfaces the role of the blade loading is also reported in figs 18 and 19 for j 1 0 and j 1 3 as the loading decreases the following features can be highlighted in the plane x d 0 55 within the region r 0 5 the distribution of w displays increasingly wider regions where the counter balancing effect of the aft propeller leads to a near null tangential component the flow region for which r 0 5 shows a more complex behaviour for j 0 7 and in particular at x d 0 7 the residual regions of positive component of w are confined to relatively small areas due to the high loaded aft propeller as it is clearly shown in fig 19 for ϕ 40 on the other hand at j 1 0 and j 1 3 these regions spread radially and eventually cover the whole disk showing dependence upon the aft propeller angle ϕ as visible in fig 19 this is in contrast with the results obtained in zhang et al 2019 where the tangential component distribution within the wake is shown to be almost independent of j here the blade loading is shown to play a relevant role in the overall w distribution between propellers 4 conclusions in this work we presented the results from an experimental campaign focused on the investigation of the hydrodynamics of contra rotating propellers crp at varying load conditions the measurements were carried out via planar and stereo particle image velocimetry using a mixed hardware software phase locking protocol enabling the analysis of the separate contributions from the forward and aft propellers results show that the flow dynamics featured by a crp system is characterized by complex interactions between the two systems of helical vorticity that develop from the blade tips into the wake these helical vortexes interact in a range of patterns which entail pairing processes associated to vortex filament instability mechanisms the interactions are demonstrated through the measurement of vorticity and of the reynolds stress tensor and are found to be dependent on both the blade loading and the relative phase angle in particular the interplay process is observed to be more intense toward higher loading conditions analysis of the average flow fields confirm that these interaction events also have a profound impact on the slipstream evolution flow field measurements between the propellers indicate that the overlap of the two propellers flow accelerating effect in the wake is strongly dependent on their relative angular positions the findings of the present work confirm that the wake of a contra rotating propeller system is characterized by the onset of helical vortex filaments instability phenomena early in the near wake these events are triggered by the mutual interaction between the forward and aft helical vortex systems which in turn depends on the relative angle between the propellers and is intensified at high loading conditions the study shows the importance of the hydrodynamic analysis of the wake flow for the effective design of crp propulsion systems and represents a first step toward research activities that will address specific aspects such as diameter ratio and distance between propellers and their effect on the wake dynamics and overall propulsive efficiency the data obtained will also benefit the modelling and computations of such systems credit authorship contribution statement alessandro capone formal analysis investigation software visualization writing

21087,the nonlinear pipe soil interaction model and the initial imperfections are predominantly factors that affect the lateral buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines with a high temperature in this study mathematical models taking these two factors into account are proposed to simulate lateral buckling of subsea pipelines analytical solutions are derived from the assumption of rigid plastic pipe soil interaction while numerical results are obtained when considering nonlinear pipe soil interaction the analytical and numerical results have an excellent agreement except for the negligible discrepancy in the pre buckling state the discrepancy is induced by the difference of mobilisation distance in rigid plastic and elastic plastic pipe soil interaction models after the analysis of snap through phenomenon the influence of breakout resistance amplitude and half wavelength of imperfection on the post buckling behaviour is studied finally the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences are discussed as well the results show that the hysteresis cycle between pre buckling and post buckling states may appear under cyclic thermal loading the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle can take place more easily for large breakout resistance small amplitude and large wavelength of imperfection in the post buckling state the maximum stress uplifts with increasing breakout resistance or amplitude of imperfection while it reduces with escalating wavelength of imperfection keywords subsea pipeline lateral buckling initial imperfection nonlinear pipe soil interaction model snap through buckling 1 introduction due to the temperature and pressure induced expansion lateral buckling of unburied subsea pipelines transporting oil and gas is a well known phenomenon this problem may lead to catastrophic consequences such as local buckling fracture fatigue or excessive displacement dnvgl rp f110 2018 the initiation and deformation of lateral buckling are very sensitive to the initial imperfection and nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction i e with breakout soil resistance thus it is necessary to investigate lateral buckling of imperfect subsea pipelines taking nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model into account some researches adopted analytical methods to study lateral buckling for ideal straight subsea pipelines without the consideration of nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model the first analytical study about lateral buckling of ideal pipelines may have been carried out by hobbs 1984 with the assumption of constant soil resistance in this study several buckling mode shapes were proposed and the corresponding analytical solutions were derived more recently a series of analytical studies were carried out to investigate the controlled lateral buckling behaviour with axial interaction between adjacent buckles wang et al 2017b and the buckle initiation techniques through distributed buoyancy section wang et al 2017a 2018a or sleeper wang and tang 2020 wang et al 2018b 2018c moreover coupled axial motion and lateral buckling was investigated by konuk 2018a b more analytical studies were conducted with the consideration of initial imperfections on the basis of hobbs research hobbs 1984 an analytical model taking into account of initial imperfection was studied by taylor and gan 1986b this model has explored the lateral buckling of subsea pipelines with the assumption of constant lateral soil resistance they considered the effect of residual stress induced by the initial imperfection this model can only be used to simulate lateral buckling of stress free straight pipeline however their model can not be applied to initially stress free curved pipeline a simplified analytical model was proposed by croll 1997 for upheaval buckling of pipelines with initial imperfections the lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines with initial imperfections was analytically investigated by karampour et al 2013 for a pipeline with a prop imperfection laid on a plastic soft seabed the effect of seabed resistance on upheaval buckling was investigated by shi et al 2013 through an analytical method the analytical solutions of high order lateral buckling for a pipeline with a single arch symmetric and a two arch anti symmetric initial imperfection were derived hong et al 2015 liu and wang 2018 snap behaviour in the upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines under topographic step imperfection was investigated analytically by wang and van der heijden 2020b based on the finite element method fem four numerical simulation models were proposed by liu et al 2014 to simulate lateral buckling of pipelines with initial imperfections the results of modal analysis were used to introduce initial imperfections xu and lin 2017 used fem to study the influence of seabed undulation and initial stress in the pipe on the critical force for upheaval buckling zhang et al zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 studied upheaval and lateral buckling of subsea pipelines with different initial imperfections unified formulas were derived for critical forces by using fem the effects of the model length of the pipeline on lateral buckling behaviour for imperfect pipelines liu and li 2018 and upheaval buckling behaviour for pipelines laid on a step imperfection chen et al 2020 were studied through fem these analytical and fe studies relied on the constant lateral soil resistance assumption as for the effect of nonlinear pipe soil interaction on pipeline buckling behaviour several studies were performed for the lateral buckling of ideal subsea pipelines with the consideration of a deformation dependent resistance force model an approximate deflection expressed by polynomial series was assumed to solve the nonlinear boundary value problem taylor and gan 1986a in zeng and duan 2014 a quintic polynomial lateral soil resistance was employed to model partial embedment of subsea pipeline in this study the homoclinic orbits were explicitly computed for ideal subsea pipelines however they do not consider thermal loading genuine localised lateral and upheaval buckling for unburied and buried subsea ideal pipelines respectively were considered in wang and van der heijden 2017 wang et al 2018d where bifurcation diagrams of localised solutions were computed through fem a tri linear pipe soil interaction model was employed to investigate the influence of initial out of straightness on the buckling performance of pre deformed pipeline in chee et al 2019 furthermore localised buckling of a subsea pipeline laid in a trench was studied by wang and van der heijden 2020a the study indicated that the pipeline may snap into a localised buckling mode beyond the maxwell temperature a nonlinear soil resistance model allowing for partial pipeline embedment was used in a lateral buckling analysis in zhang and guedes soares 2019 to present the effect of initial imperfection and lateral soil resistance model on the critical force of lateral buckling however they assumed that the wave length of initial imperfection was equal to the length of the buckled pipe section in fact the length of the buckled pipe section increases with the growing temperature difference so that the wave length of initial imperfection cannot be always equal to the length of the buckled pipe section thus this study has released the assumption that the wave length of initial imperfection is equal to the length of the buckled pipe section a nonlinear lateral soil resistance model proposed by chatterjee et al 2012 is introduced in this study which is described in detail in the following section the objective of this paper is that lateral buckling of subsea pipelines is investigated by incorporating initial imperfection and nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model simultaneously into the mathematical model without assuming that the wave length of initial imperfection is equal to the length of the buckled pipe section both initial imperfection and nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model have a great influence on the critical temperature difference and post buckling behaviour first analytical solutions are derived based on the assumption of rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model i e constant lateral soil resistance taking elastic plastic or nonlinear pipe soil interaction model into account numerical solutions are obtained by solving the system of governing equations with the corresponding boundary conditions the analytical solutions are compared with the numerical results to validate the proposed model the discrepancy between which is analysed then the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle is discussed in detail finally the influence of breakout resistance amplitude and half wavelength of imperfection on the post buckling behaviour is carried out the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences are discussed 2 mathematical modelling 2 1 problem description for a pipeline laid on the seabed and subjected to a temperature difference t 0 between the fluid flowing inside the pipe and the environment an axial compressive strain will be accumulated due to the increase of temperature difference and the constraint of axial soil resistance between pipeline and seabed within the range of linear elastic response the axial compressive force p 0 can be written as 1 p 0 e a α t 0 where e is the elastic modulus a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline and α is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion once the axial compressive force p 0 exceeds the critical buckling force the pipe will mobilise laterally i e lateral buckling occurs as shown in fig 1 during the buckling process extra pipe feeds into the buckle to form lateral deformation the axial strain releases partially which leads to the reduction of axial force as shown in fig 2 the axial compressive force after buckling denoted by p x accumulates in the pipe due to the constraint of axial soil resistance along the pipeline when the extra pipe length coming from thermal expansion to form lateral deformation is satisfied the axial feed in will stop the locations where no axial feed in exists are called virtual anchor points the axial compressive force at the virtual anchor point will be equal to the axial compressive force p 0 as shown in fig 2 the length of the pipe between the virtual anchor points denoted by 2 l s is called feed in length see fig 2 based on the profile of axial compressive force shown in fig 2 the distribution of axial compressive force p x is written as 2 p x p f a x 0 x l s where p is the axial compressive force at the centre of the buckle f a μ a w p i p e is the axial soil resistance μ a is the axial friction coefficient between pipe and seabed and w p i p e is the submerged weight per unit length of the pipeline the axial force balance is 3 p 0 p f a l s 2 2 governing equations and boundary conditions the configuration and load distribution of an imperfect pipeline laid on the seabed is illustrated in fig 1 due to the existence of initial imperfection lateral buckling is prone to occur at a pipe segment with initial imperfection since the critical temperature difference reduces thus the centre of the initial imperfection is assumed to coincide with the centre of the buckle symmetric about the centre of this section the assumed profile of the initial imperfection see fig 3 is 4 w 0 x w m 0 2 1 cos λ e x 0 x l 0 where λ e π l 0 w m 0 is the amplitude of imperfection and l 0 is the half wavelength of imperfection linear beam column theory is employed to simulate the buckling behaviour of the pipeline the initial imperfection considered here is the intrinsic curvature induced by fabrication the pipeline is stress free in the initial curved configuration thus the equilibrium equations that govern the lateral deflection are lagrange and averbuch 2012 5 e i d 4 w 1 d x 4 p d 2 w 1 d x 2 f w 1 p d 2 w 0 d x 2 0 x l 0 e i d 4 w 2 d x 4 p d 2 w 2 d x 2 f w 2 l 0 x l 1 where w 1 w 2 are lateral deflections the references for

nonlinear lateral soil resistance determined by nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model as shown in fig 4 the axial force p is the axial force at the centre of the buckled section after buckling here the variation of the axial force is ignored when solving the buckled shapes an error analysis was conducted to show that this assumption is acceptable wang et al 2018a b based on the symmetric conditions at x 0 the slope and shear force are zero the displacement slope and moment are zero at x l 1 so the boundary conditions at x 0 and x l 1 are 6 d w 1 d x 0 0 d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 0 w 2 l 1 0 d w

constant lateral soil resistance as shown in fig 4 is assumed without the consideration of the breakout resistance in this case the nonlinear lateral soil resistance f w is simplified to f μ l w p i p

lateral pipe soil interaction model is considered eq 5 has to be solved numerically as a boundary value problem with the boundary conditions and matching conditions in eq 6 and eq 7 the shooting method implemented in the software mathematica is employed to solve this boundary value problem wolfram research 2016 here the nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model proposed by chatterjee et al 2012 on the basis of a detailed fem which is validated by experimental results is employed this model simulates breakout resistance induced by the initial embedment as a result of partial penetration of the pipeline into the soil once breakout has occurred the lateral resistance drops and approaches a steady residual value the model can be expressed by 12 μ w w μ brk 1 e a 1 w d a 2 μ res μ brk 1 e a 3 w d a 4 where μ is the equivalent friction coefficient μ b r k is the breakout equivalent friction coefficient μ r e s is the residual equivalent friction coefficient and d is the external diameter of the pipeline the quantities f w μ w p i p e f b r k μ b r k w p i p e and f r e s μ r e s w p i p e are therefore respectively the nonlinear lateral soil resistance the breakout resistance and the residual resistance the value of the coefficient a 3 which determines the distance required to mobilise the steady resistance is in chatterjee et al 2012 given in terms of the weight of the pipe w p i p e and the vertical bearing capacity v m a x as 13 a 3 a 5 w p i p e v m a x a 6 where the values of the two further coefficients a 5 and a 6 for different values of the initial embedment v i n i t are given by 14 a 5 8 2 v i n i t d 4 9 a 6 5 8 v i n i t d 4 5 where the initial embedment v i n i t is a vertical penetration of the pipeline into the soil following chatterjee et al 2012 a 1 25 and a 4 1 5 are adopted but a 2 1 is proposed here in order to have a finite linear resistance which is physically realistic furthermore v m a x 5 w p i p e and v i n i t 0 3 d are adopted so that a 3 2 272 and set μ r e s 0 5 when taking μ b r k 0 5 the nonlinear pipe soil interaction model will be degenerated to the elastic plastic pipe soil interaction model as shown in fig 4 in the elastic plastic pipe soil interaction model the parameter a 1 controls the mobilisation distance then based on the obtained analytical and numerical solutions to lateral deflections the geometric shortening u 2 introduced by the lateral deflection can be calculated by 15 u 2 1 2 0 l 0 d w 1 d x 2 d x 1 2 l 0 l 1 d w 2 d x 2 d x to incorporate the effect of temperature difference into the lateral deformation a compatibility condition is used to obtain the relationship between axial and lateral deformation 16 u 1 u 2 where u 1 is the axial thermal expansion within 0 x l s and u 2 is the geometric shortening introduced by the lateral deflection the axial thermal expansion u 1 is calculated by 17 u 1 0 l s δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x is the reduction of axial force leading to 18 u 1 f a l s 2 2 e a thus combining eq 16 and eq 18 the following equation is obtained 19 l s 2 e a u 2 f a combining eq 1 eq 3 and eq 19 one finally obtains 20 t 0 p 2 e a u 2 f a e a α the bending moment is obtained by 21 m e i d 2 w d x 2 where w stands for w 1 or w 2 and the bending stress σ m is 22 σ m m d 2 i the maximum stress σ m is 23 σ m σ p σ m m where the stresses σ p and σ m m induced by axial force p and maximum bending moment m m respectively are 24 σ p p a σ m m m m d 2 i 3 results based on the results obtained by the analytical and numerical models developed in section 2 with the parameters listed in table 1 lateral buckling behaviour for imperfect subsea pipelines is analysed in detail the analytical and numerical models are validated by comparing their results their discrepancy raised by different types of lateral pipe soil interaction model is discussed the snap through phenomenon is analysed in detail two critical temperature differences are defined to illustrate when snap through occurs and hysteresis cycle appears then the influence of breakout resistance coefficient μ b r k amplitude of imperfection w m 0 and the half wavelength of imperfection l 0 on the post buckling behaviour and the critical temperature differences are discussed in detail 3 1 validation and snap through phenomenon as this paper generalises the assumption in zhang and guedes soares 2019 from a fixed length to an arbitrary length of the buckled section the numerical results obtained in this paper are compared with their analytical results first two key formulas for p and p 0 derived by zhang and guedes soares 2019 are given by 25 p π 2 e i l 2 1 w m 0 w m l 2 π 2 f w m 26 p 0 π 2 e i l 2 1 w m 0 w m l 2 π 2 f w m e a 4 π 2 l 2 w m 2 w m 0 2 where l is the length of the buckled pipeline defined in zhang and guedes soares paper w m is the amplitude of the lateral displacement along the buckled pipeline f μ w p i p e is lateral soil resistance per unit length the comparison between the numerical results obtained in this paper and zhang and guedes soares results is shown in fig 5 the results for three cases with different lengths of buckled section obtained by the formulas derived by zhang and guedes soares are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 a the relationships between p and w m obtained in this paper are comparable with their results even though some difference exists one reason leading to this difference is the assumption of constant length of the buckled section in zhang and guedes soares analytical derivation the other reason is that a cosinoidal lateral deflection is assumed in their analytical derivation in fact the length of the buckled section varies with temperature difference as shown in fig 5 c and the lateral deflection is more complex than that of cosinoidal profile when taking non linear pipe soil interaction into account from fig 5 b the discrepancy of the relationships between t 0 and w m becomes larger for larger temperature differences the main reason is that the length of the buckled pipeline becomes much larger than that employed in zhang and guedes soares as shown in fig 5 c the assumption of constant length of the buckled section restricts the deflection of the buckled pipeline under different temperature differences fig 5 b and c show that both solutions are comparable under the circumstances of up to 30 c temperature differences for l 40 m hence as the length of the buckled pipeline becomes larger for higher temperatures it is necessary to move away the constant length hypothesis as shown in fig 6 the numerical results with the elastic plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model are validated by comparing with the analytical results with rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model meantime the snap through phenomenon is analysed for lateral buckling of imperfect pipelines two critical temperature differences are defined to illustrate when snap through occurs then the discrepancy between analytical and numerical results is analysed through the investigation of the effect of the mobilisation distance which is controlled by parameter a 1 as shown in fig 7 the comparison between rigid plastic and elastic plastic pipe soil interaction models with different mobilisation distances is shown in fig 8 the comparison of post buckling behaviour between analytical and numerical results is illustrated in fig 6 for the cases of w m 0 0 3 m and 0 5 m there is subsidiary discrepancy in σ m m and σ m between analytical and numerical results in the context of very small temperature difference except for this discrepancy all the results obtained by analytical and numerical methods retain an excellent agreement along the whole post buckling branch this discrepancy disappears quickly with enlarging temperature difference for the case of w m 0 0 1 m a visible discrepancy appears in the pre buckling branch o b 1 which becomes larger along branch o b 1 with increasing temperature difference the largest error exists around the state b 1 which disappears rapidly along the branch b 1 c 1 there is almost no discrepancy between analytical and numerical results in the post buckling branch c 1 b 2 fig 7 illustrates the influence of the mobilisation distance to show the reason why the discrepancy between analytical and numerical results appears in the pre buckling branch o b 1 in fig 7 the mobilisation distance is smaller for larger values of a 1 which means that the elastic plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model becomes closer to the rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model see fig 8 this leads to that numerical results become closer to analytical results for larger values of a 1 as shown in fig 7 the pre buckling behaviour is affected by the parameter a 1 however the post buckling behaviour is barely influenced by a 1 from fig 7 the conclusion can also be drawn that the assumption of rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model can give an accurate prediction for post buckling behaviour when no breakout resistance exists in the lateral pipe soil interaction model the snap through buckling phenomenon illustrated in fig 6 exists for small amplitude of initial imperfection i e w m 0 0 1 m the snap through buckling phenomenon disappears gradually with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection w m 0 the same characteristics with or without snap through buckling phenomenon is that a peak value of the axial compressive force p exists as shown in fig 6 b the process that the axial compressive force p increases from zero with increasing temperature difference is defined as the pre buckling state such as the branches o b 1 and o d 1 in fig 6 while the process that the axial compressive force p decreases with increasing temperature difference is defined as the post buckling state such as the branches c 1 b 2 and d 1 d 2 a peak p appears at the end of the pre buckling state i e states b 1 and d 1 the temperature difference corresponding to this peak is defined as the upper bound critical temperature difference denoted by t m u the case of w m 0 0 1 m is used to analyse the snap through buckling phenomenon as shown in fig 6 in the pre buckling state i e branch o b 1 the axial compressive force p increases with increasing temperature difference along the path p 0 e a α t 0 as shown in fig 6 b the axial compressive force p is controlled by the increase of temperature difference the discrepancy between the value p and the path p 0 e a α t 0 comes from the axial force release induced by the initiation of lateral deflection in the pre buckling state see branch o b 1 fig 6 a in this pre buckling state both the displacement amplitude w m and the stress induced by maximum bending moment σ m m increase slightly with increasing temperature difference along branch o b 1 see fig 6 a and d this means that the lateral deflection starts to mobilise under increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state even though this deflection is very small from fig 6 e in the pre buckling state the maximum stress σ m increases along the path σ 0 e α t 0 which is slightly larger than σ 0 under the same temperature difference the reason is that the maximum stress σ m is the combination of stress induced by axial force σ p see fig 6 c and stress induced by the maximum bending moment σ m m see fig 6 d when the temperature difference reaches t m u a jump from pre buckling state to post buckling state will take place i e a jump from state b 1 to b 2 during this jump a sudden increase in w m σ m m and σ m is shown in fig 6 a d and e while a sudden decrease in p and σ p occurs see fig 6 b and c after the jump the pipeline buckling behaviour will develop along the post buckling path with increasing temperature difference w m σ m m and σ m increase while p and σ p decrease gradually from the comparison between σ p σ m m and σ m the conclusion is drawn that σ m is controlled by σ p in the pre buckling state while it is controlled by σ m m in the post buckling state the buckled pipeline will evolve along branch c 1 b 2 under decreasing temperature difference when it locates at the post buckling state another jump from post buckling state to pre buckling state will occur i e a jump from state c 1 to c 2 when the temperature difference decreases to temperature difference t m l the temperature difference t m l is defined as the lower bound critical temperature difference in this jump a sudden decrease in w m σ m m and σ m occurs as shown in fig 6 a d and e while a sudden increase in p and σ p takes place see fig 6 b and c then the pipeline will deflect along the pre buckling branch the snap through buckling raises the possibility of hysteresis cycles b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 under cyclic thermal loading this snap through buckling phenomenon and hysteresis cycle will disappear when the amplitude of initial imperfection w m 0 increases to 0 3 m or 0 5 m as shown in fig 6 in this case w m σ m m and σ m increase from zero with increasing temperature difference gradually without jumps for p and σ p they increase first and then decrease with increasing temperature difference a maximum value still exists for p and σ p the temperature difference corresponding to this peak is the upper bound critical temperature difference however both the jump and the corresponding lower bound critical temperature difference disappear 3 2 influence of μ b r k in this section the influence of μ b r k on the post buckling behaviour is analysed on the basis of fig 9 the dots shown in fig 9 represent the states where the peak axial compressive force p locates i e the locations of upper bound critical temperature difference t m u in the pre buckling state all parameters in fig 9 accrete gradually with increasing temperature difference for all the cases the increasing rates of w m σ m m and σ m are larger for smaller μ b r k since larger buckled deflection occurs for smaller breakout resistance the increasing rates of p and σ p are smaller for smaller μ b r k since more axial compressive force reduction takes place for larger buckled deflection from fig 9 in the post buckling state w m is smaller while p σ p σ m m and σ m are larger for larger μ b r k under the same temperature difference the increasing rates of w m σ m m and σ m with temperature difference are almost the same for different μ b r k under the same temperature difference however the influence of μ b r k on p and σ p reduces with increasing temperature difference in fig 9 the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle appear gradually with increasing μ b r k for μ b r k 0 5 there are no snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle all parameters develop gradually with increasing temperature difference for μ b r k 1 0 snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle also don t exist however for this case there is a rapid increase in w m σ m m and σ m and a rapid decrease in p and σ p around t m u with increasing temperature difference which is similar to the snap through phenomenon for the cases of μ b r k 1 5 and 2 0 clear snap through phenomenon and hysteresis cycle exist the lower and upper bound critical temperature differences t m l and t m u increase with increasing μ b r k as shown in fig 9 a detailed parameter analysis about the influence of μ b r k on t m u and t m l is shown in fig 10 both t m u and t m l increase close to linear with increasing μ b r k the increasing rate of t m u is much larger than that of t m l with increasing μ b r k in fig 10 the location where t m l equals to t m u denotes the state where snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear for μ b r k μ b r k e both t m u and t m l exist which represents the situation that both the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle appear for μ b r k μ b r k e t m u exists while t m l disappears which represents the situation that there are no snap through phenomenon and hysteresis cycle 3 3 influence of w m 0 in this section the influence of w m 0 on the post buckling behaviour is analysed on the basis of fig 11 the dots shown in fig 11 represent the states where the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u locates the results for μ b r k 0 5 are also shown in fig 11 d and e for comparison in the pre buckling state w m σ m m and σ m in fig 11 increase in a relative slow speed with increasing temperature difference whose increasing rates are larger for larger w m 0 both p and σ p increase close to linear with increasing temperature difference the increasing rates of p and σ p are smaller for larger w m 0 in the post buckling state w m is slightly larger for larger w m 0 both p and σ p are slightly smaller for larger w m 0 the influence of w m 0 on w m p and σ p gradually reduces with increasing temperature difference as shown in fig 11 a b and c both σ m m and σ m become larger for larger w m 0 whose increasing rates are similar for different w m 0 therefore the buckled pipeline will be more dangerous for larger w m 0 under the same temperature difference from fig 11 the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist only for slightly small w m 0 such as w m 0 0 1 m which will disappear for large w m 0 such as w m 0 0 5 m taking w m 0 0 5 m as an example w m σ m m and σ m increase monotonically with increasing temperature difference both p and σ p first increase and then decrease gradually with increasing temperature difference for w m 0 0 1 m the typical snap through phenomenon occurs as described before and the hysteresis cycle appears the effect of w m 0 on t m u and t m l is shown in fig 12 t m l decreases with increasing w m 0 until it stops at point e whose decreasing rate is close to linear as shown in fig 12 t m u also decreases with increasing w m 0 but its decreasing rate becomes smaller for larger w m 0 t m u equals to t m l at point e where snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear for w m 0 w m 0 e both t m u and t m l exist which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist for w m 0 w m 0 e t m u exists while t m l disappears which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear 3 4 influence of l 0 in this section the influence of l 0 on the post buckling behaviour is shown in fig 13 the dots shown in fig 13 represent the states where the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u locates the results for μ b r k 0 5 are also shown in fig 13 d and e for comparison in fig 13 a w m is very small and increases in a slightly slower speed for larger l 0 with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state in the post buckling state w m is slightly larger for larger l 0 which is barely affected by l 0 from fig 13 b and c both p and σ p increase close to linear with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state whose increasing rates are slightly larger for larger l 0 in the post buckling state both p and σ p are slightly smaller for larger l 0 but this effect is tiny from fig 13 d and e the increasing rates of σ m m and σ m gradually increase with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state which are smaller for larger l 0 in the post buckling state the increasing rates of σ m m and σ m are similar for different l 0 both σ m m and σ m become smaller for larger l 0 under the same temperature difference from fig 13 the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist only for large l 0 such as l 0 30 m or 40 m which will disappear for small l 0 such as l 0 20 m for l 0 30 m or 40 m the typical snap through phenomenon occurs as described before and the hysteresis cycle appears for l 0 20 m w m σ m m and σ m increase monotonically with increasing temperature difference without snap through phenomenon both p and σ p first increase and then decrease gradually with increasing temperature difference the effect of l 0 on t m u and t m l is shown in fig 14 t m u increases with increasing l 0 and its increasing rate also increases with increasing l 0 t m l appears when l 0 increases to l 0 e where snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle appear then t m l decreases slightly first and then increases with increasing l 0 the influence of l 0 on t m u is much larger than t m l for l 0 l 0 e both t m u and t m l exist which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist for l 0 l 0 e t m u exists while t m l disappears which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear 4 conclusions mathematical models are proposed to investigate lateral buckling of imperfect subsea pipelines with nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model the models are validated through the comparison between numerical and analytical results the discrepancy of these results is induced by the difference of mobilisation distance the snap through phenomenon is analysed in detail the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences are defined to demonstrate when snap through phenomenon takes place and hysteresis cycle appears finally the influence of breakout resistance amplitude and half wavelength of initial imperfection on the post buckling behaviour is discussed the critical temperature differences are also analysed from the analysis shown in this study the following conclusions are drawn i the analytical and numerical results obtained by the proposed mathematical models have a pronounced agreement along the post buckling curve except that there is a marginal discrepancy in the pre buckling state this discrepancy is induced by different types of pipe soil interaction models i e rigid plastic pipe soil interaction model used in the analytical results and elastic plastic pipe soil interaction model used in the numerical results the discrepancy becomes smaller when the elastic plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model is closer to rigid plastic ii the pipeline may jump between pre buckling and post buckling states at the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences under increasing and decreasing temperature differences respectively when snap through phenomenon exists the snap through buckling raises the possibility of hysteresis cycles under cyclic thermal loading iii when snap through buckling occurs under increasing temperature difference from pre buckling to post buckling state a sudden increase in the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress and a sudden decrease in axial compressive force take place when the snap through buckling is under the decreasing temperature difference from post buckling to pre buckling state a sudden decrease in the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress and a sudden increase in axial compressive force occur iv in the pre buckling state the maximum stress is controlled by the stress induced by axial compressive force in the post buckling state the maximum stress is controlled by maximum bending stress in the post buckling state the maximum stress increases with increasing breakout resistance or amplitude of imperfection while it decreases with the increasing wavelength of imperfection v both the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences increase with increasing breakout resistance however they decrease with increasing amplitude of imperfection the upper bound critical temperature difference increases with increasing wavelength of imperfection the lower bound critical temperature difference decreases slightly first and then increases with increasing wavelength of imperfection snap through phenomenon and

21087,the nonlinear pipe soil interaction model and the initial imperfections are predominantly factors that affect the lateral buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines with a high temperature in this study mathematical models taking these two factors into account are proposed to simulate lateral buckling of subsea pipelines analytical solutions are derived from the assumption of rigid plastic pipe soil interaction while numerical results are obtained when considering nonlinear pipe soil interaction the analytical and numerical results have an excellent agreement except for the negligible discrepancy in the pre buckling state the discrepancy is induced by the difference of mobilisation distance in rigid plastic and elastic plastic pipe soil interaction models after the analysis of snap through phenomenon the influence of breakout resistance amplitude and half wavelength of imperfection on the post buckling behaviour is studied finally the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences are discussed as well the results show that the hysteresis cycle between pre buckling and post buckling states may appear under cyclic thermal loading the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle can take place more easily for large breakout resistance small amplitude and large wavelength of imperfection in the post buckling state the maximum stress uplifts with increasing breakout resistance or amplitude of imperfection while it reduces with escalating wavelength of imperfection keywords subsea pipeline lateral buckling initial imperfection nonlinear pipe soil interaction model snap through buckling 1 introduction due to the temperature and pressure induced expansion lateral buckling of unburied subsea pipelines transporting oil and gas is a well known phenomenon this problem may lead to catastrophic consequences such as local buckling fracture fatigue or excessive displacement dnvgl rp f110 2018 the initiation and deformation of lateral buckling are very sensitive to the initial imperfection and nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction i e with breakout soil resistance thus it is necessary to investigate lateral buckling of imperfect subsea pipelines taking nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model into account some researches adopted analytical methods to study lateral buckling for ideal straight subsea pipelines without the consideration of nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model the first analytical study about lateral buckling of ideal pipelines may have been carried out by hobbs 1984 with the assumption of constant soil resistance in this study several buckling mode shapes were proposed and the corresponding analytical solutions were derived more recently a series of analytical studies were carried out to investigate the controlled lateral buckling behaviour with axial interaction between adjacent buckles wang et al 2017b and the buckle initiation techniques through distributed buoyancy section wang et al 2017a 2018a or sleeper wang and tang 2020 wang et al 2018b 2018c moreover coupled axial motion and lateral buckling was investigated by konuk 2018a b more analytical studies were conducted with the consideration of initial imperfections on the basis of hobbs research hobbs 1984 an analytical model taking into account of initial imperfection was studied by taylor and gan 1986b this model has explored the lateral buckling of subsea pipelines with the assumption of constant lateral soil resistance they considered the effect of residual stress induced by the initial imperfection this model can only be used to simulate lateral buckling of stress free straight pipeline however their model can not be applied to initially stress free curved pipeline a simplified analytical model was proposed by croll 1997 for upheaval buckling of pipelines with initial imperfections the lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines with initial imperfections was analytically investigated by karampour et al 2013 for a pipeline with a prop imperfection laid on a plastic soft seabed the effect of seabed resistance on upheaval buckling was investigated by shi et al 2013 through an analytical method the analytical solutions of high order lateral buckling for a pipeline with a single arch symmetric and a two arch anti symmetric initial imperfection were derived hong et al 2015 liu and wang 2018 snap behaviour in the upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines under topographic step imperfection was investigated analytically by wang and van der heijden 2020b based on the finite element method fem four numerical simulation models were proposed by liu et al 2014 to simulate lateral buckling of pipelines with initial imperfections the results of modal analysis were used to introduce initial imperfections xu and lin 2017 used fem to study the influence of seabed undulation and initial stress in the pipe on the critical force for upheaval buckling zhang et al zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 studied upheaval and lateral buckling of subsea pipelines with different initial imperfections unified formulas were derived for critical forces by using fem the effects of the model length of the pipeline on lateral buckling behaviour for imperfect pipelines liu and li 2018 and upheaval buckling behaviour for pipelines laid on a step imperfection chen et al 2020 were studied through fem these analytical and fe studies relied on the constant lateral soil resistance assumption as for the effect of nonlinear pipe soil interaction on pipeline buckling behaviour several studies were performed for the lateral buckling of ideal subsea pipelines with the consideration of a deformation dependent resistance force model an approximate deflection expressed by polynomial series was assumed to solve the nonlinear boundary value problem taylor and gan 1986a in zeng and duan 2014 a quintic polynomial lateral soil resistance was employed to model partial embedment of subsea pipeline in this study the homoclinic orbits were explicitly computed for ideal subsea pipelines however they do not consider thermal loading genuine localised lateral and upheaval buckling for unburied and buried subsea ideal pipelines respectively were considered in wang and van der heijden 2017 wang et al 2018d where bifurcation diagrams of localised solutions were computed through fem a tri linear pipe soil interaction model was employed to investigate the influence of initial out of straightness on the buckling performance of pre deformed pipeline in chee et al 2019 furthermore localised buckling of a subsea pipeline laid in a trench was studied by wang and van der heijden 2020a the study indicated that the pipeline may snap into a localised buckling mode beyond the maxwell temperature a nonlinear soil resistance model allowing for partial pipeline embedment was used in a lateral buckling analysis in zhang and guedes soares 2019 to present the effect of initial imperfection and lateral soil resistance model on the critical force of lateral buckling however they assumed that the wave length of initial imperfection was equal to the length of the buckled pipe section in fact the length of the buckled pipe section increases with the growing temperature difference so that the wave length of initial imperfection cannot be always equal to the length of the buckled pipe section thus this study has released the assumption that the wave length of initial imperfection is equal to the length of the buckled pipe section a nonlinear lateral soil resistance model proposed by chatterjee et al 2012 is introduced in this study which is described in detail in the following section the objective of this paper is that lateral buckling of subsea pipelines is investigated by incorporating initial imperfection and nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model simultaneously into the mathematical model without assuming that the wave length of initial imperfection is equal to the length of the buckled pipe section both initial imperfection and nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model have a great influence on the critical temperature difference and post buckling behaviour first analytical solutions are derived based on the assumption of rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model i e constant lateral soil resistance taking elastic plastic or nonlinear pipe soil interaction model into account numerical solutions are obtained by solving the system of governing equations with the corresponding boundary conditions the analytical solutions are compared with the numerical results to validate the proposed model the discrepancy between which is analysed then the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle is discussed in detail finally the influence of breakout resistance amplitude and half wavelength of imperfection on the post buckling behaviour is carried out the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences are discussed 2 mathematical modelling 2 1 problem description for a pipeline laid on the seabed and subjected to a temperature difference t 0 between the fluid flowing inside the pipe and the environment an axial compressive strain will be accumulated due to the increase of temperature difference and the constraint of axial soil resistance between pipeline and seabed within the range of linear elastic response the axial compressive force p 0 can be written as 1 p 0 e a α t 0 where e is the elastic modulus a is the cross sectional area of the pipeline and α is the coefficient of linear thermal expansion once the axial compressive force p 0 exceeds the critical buckling force the pipe will mobilise laterally i e lateral buckling occurs as shown in fig 1 during the buckling process extra pipe feeds into the buckle to form lateral deformation the axial strain releases partially which leads to the reduction of axial force as shown in fig 2 the axial compressive force after buckling denoted by p x accumulates in the pipe due to the constraint of axial soil resistance along the pipeline when the extra pipe length coming from thermal expansion to form lateral deformation is satisfied the axial feed in will stop the locations where no axial feed in exists are called virtual anchor points the axial compressive force at the virtual anchor point will be equal to the axial compressive force p 0 as shown in fig 2 the length of the pipe between the virtual anchor points denoted by 2 l s is called feed in length see fig 2 based on the profile of axial compressive force shown in fig 2 the distribution of axial compressive force p x is written as 2 p x p f a x 0 x l s where p is the axial compressive force at the centre of the buckle f a μ a w p i p e is the axial soil resistance μ a is the axial friction coefficient between pipe and seabed and w p i p e is the submerged weight per unit length of the pipeline the axial force balance is 3 p 0 p f a l s 2 2 governing equations and boundary conditions the configuration and load distribution of an imperfect pipeline laid on the seabed is illustrated in fig 1 due to the existence of initial imperfection lateral buckling is prone to occur at a pipe segment with initial imperfection since the critical temperature difference reduces thus the centre of the initial imperfection is assumed to coincide with the centre of the buckle symmetric about the centre of this section the assumed profile of the initial imperfection see fig 3 is 4 w 0 x w m 0 2 1 cos λ e x 0 x l 0 where λ e π l 0 w m 0 is the amplitude of imperfection and l 0 is the half wavelength of imperfection linear beam column theory is employed to simulate the buckling behaviour of the pipeline the initial imperfection considered here is the intrinsic curvature induced by fabrication the pipeline is stress free in the initial curved configuration thus the equilibrium equations that govern the lateral deflection are lagrange and averbuch 2012 5 e i d 4 w 1 d x 4 p d 2 w 1 d x 2 f w 1 p d 2 w 0 d x 2 0 x l 0 e i d 4 w 2 d x 4 p d 2 w 2 d x 2 f w 2 l 0 x l 1 where w 1 w 2 are lateral deflections the references for measuring the deflections w 1 and w 2 are the initial imperfection and the origin respectively as shown in fig 1 b e i is bending stiffness l 1 is the half length of buckled section and f w is the nonlinear lateral soil resistance determined by nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model as shown in fig 4 the axial force p is the axial force at the centre of the buckled section after buckling here the variation of the axial force is ignored when solving the buckled shapes an error analysis was conducted to show that this assumption is acceptable wang et al 2018a b based on the symmetric conditions at x 0 the slope and shear force are zero the displacement slope and moment are zero at x l 1 so the boundary conditions at x 0 and x l 1 are 6 d w 1 d x 0 0 d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 0 w 2 l 1 0 d w

constant lateral soil resistance as shown in fig 4 is assumed without the consideration of the breakout resistance in this case the nonlinear lateral soil resistance f w is simplified to f μ l w p i p

lateral pipe soil interaction model is considered eq 5 has to be solved numerically as a boundary value problem with the boundary conditions and matching conditions in eq 6 and eq 7 the shooting method implemented in the software mathematica is employed to solve this boundary value problem wolfram research 2016 here the nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model proposed by chatterjee et al 2012 on the basis of a detailed fem which is validated by experimental results is employed this model simulates breakout resistance induced by the initial embedment as a result of partial penetration of the pipeline into the soil once breakout has occurred the lateral resistance drops and approaches a steady residual value the model can be expressed by 12 μ w w μ brk 1 e a 1 w d a 2 μ res μ brk 1 e a 3 w d a 4 where μ is the equivalent friction coefficient μ b r k is the breakout equivalent friction coefficient μ r e s is the residual equivalent friction coefficient and d is the external diameter of the pipeline the quantities f w μ w p i p e f b r k μ b r k w p i p e and f r e s μ r e s w p i p e are therefore respectively the nonlinear lateral soil resistance the breakout resistance and the residual resistance the value of the coefficient a 3 which determines the distance required to mobilise the steady resistance is in chatterjee et al 2012 given in terms of the weight of the pipe w p i p e and the vertical bearing capacity v m a x as 13 a 3 a 5 w p i p e v m a x a 6 where the values of the two further coefficients a 5 and a 6 for different values of the initial embedment v i n i t are given by 14 a 5 8 2 v i n i t d 4 9 a 6 5 8 v i n i t d 4 5 where the initial embedment v i n i t is a vertical penetration of the pipeline into the soil following chatterjee et al 2012 a 1 25 and a 4 1 5 are adopted but a 2 1 is proposed here in order to have a finite linear resistance which is physically realistic furthermore v m a x 5 w p i p e and v i n i t 0 3 d are adopted so that a 3 2 272 and set μ r e s 0 5 when taking μ b r k 0 5 the nonlinear pipe soil interaction model will be degenerated to the elastic plastic pipe soil interaction model as shown in fig 4 in the elastic plastic pipe soil interaction model the parameter a 1 controls the mobilisation distance then based on the obtained analytical and numerical solutions to lateral deflections the geometric shortening u 2 introduced by the lateral deflection can be calculated by 15 u 2 1 2 0 l 0 d w 1 d x 2 d x 1 2 l 0 l 1 d w 2 d x 2 d x to incorporate the effect of temperature difference into the lateral deformation a compatibility condition is used to obtain the relationship between axial and lateral deformation 16 u 1 u 2 where u 1 is the axial thermal expansion within 0 x l s and u 2 is the geometric shortening introduced by the lateral deflection the axial thermal expansion u 1 is calculated by 17 u 1 0 l s δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x is the reduction of axial force leading to 18 u 1 f a l s 2 2 e a thus combining eq 16 and eq 18 the following equation is obtained 19 l s 2 e a u 2 f a combining eq 1 eq 3 and eq 19 one finally obtains 20 t 0 p 2 e a u 2 f a

in section 2 with the parameters listed in table 1 lateral buckling behaviour for imperfect subsea pipelines is analysed in detail the analytical and numerical models are validated by comparing their results their discrepancy raised by different types of lateral pipe soil interaction model is discussed the snap through phenomenon is analysed in detail two critical temperature differences are defined to illustrate when snap through occurs and hysteresis cycle appears then the influence of breakout resistance coefficient μ b r k amplitude of imperfection w m 0 and the half wavelength of imperfection l 0 on the post buckling behaviour and the critical temperature differences are discussed in detail 3 1 validation and snap through phenomenon as this paper generalises the assumption in zhang and guedes soares 2019 from a fixed length to an arbitrary length of the buckled section the numerical results obtained in this paper are compared with their analytical results first two key formulas for p and p 0 derived by zhang and guedes soares 2019 are given by 25 p π 2 e i l 2 1 w m 0 w m l 2 π 2 f w m 26 p 0 π 2 e i l 2 1 w m 0 w m l 2 π 2 f w m e a 4 π 2 l 2 w m 2 w m 0 2 where l is the length of the buckled pipeline defined in zhang and guedes soares paper w m is the amplitude of the lateral displacement along the buckled pipeline f μ w p i p e is lateral soil resistance per unit length the comparison between the numerical results obtained in this paper and zhang and guedes soares results is shown in fig 5 the results for three cases with different lengths of buckled section obtained by the formulas derived by zhang and guedes soares are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 a the relationships between p and w m obtained in this paper are comparable with their results even though some difference exists one reason leading to this difference is the assumption of constant length of the buckled section in zhang and guedes soares analytical derivation the other reason is that a cosinoidal lateral deflection is assumed in their analytical derivation in fact the length of the buckled section varies with temperature difference as shown in fig 5 c and the lateral deflection is more complex than that of cosinoidal profile when taking non linear pipe soil interaction into account from fig 5 b the discrepancy of the relationships between t 0 and w m becomes larger for larger temperature differences the main reason is that the length of the buckled pipeline becomes much larger than that employed in zhang and guedes soares as shown in fig 5 c the assumption of constant length of the buckled section restricts the deflection of the buckled pipeline under different temperature differences fig 5 b and c show that both solutions are comparable under the circumstances of up to 30 c temperature differences for l 40 m hence as the length of the buckled pipeline becomes larger for higher temperatures it is necessary to move away the constant length hypothesis as shown in fig 6 the numerical results with the elastic plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model are validated by comparing with the analytical results with rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model meantime the snap through phenomenon is analysed for lateral buckling of imperfect pipelines two critical temperature differences are defined to illustrate when snap through occurs then the discrepancy between analytical and numerical results is analysed through the investigation of the effect of the mobilisation distance which is controlled by parameter a 1 as shown in fig 7 the comparison between rigid plastic and elastic plastic pipe soil interaction models with different mobilisation distances is shown in fig 8 the comparison of post buckling behaviour between analytical and numerical results is illustrated in fig 6 for the cases of w m 0 0 3 m and 0 5 m there is subsidiary discrepancy in σ m m and σ m between analytical and numerical results in the context of very small temperature difference except for this discrepancy all the results obtained by analytical and numerical methods retain an excellent agreement along the whole post buckling branch this discrepancy disappears quickly with enlarging temperature difference for the case of w m 0 0 1 m a visible discrepancy appears in the pre buckling branch o b 1 which becomes larger along branch o b 1 with increasing temperature difference the largest error exists around the state b 1 which disappears rapidly along the branch b 1 c 1 there is almost no discrepancy between analytical and numerical results in the post buckling branch c 1 b 2 fig 7 illustrates the influence of the mobilisation distance to show the reason why the discrepancy between analytical and numerical results appears in the pre buckling branch o b 1 in fig 7 the mobilisation distance is smaller for larger values of a 1 which means that the elastic plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model becomes closer to the rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model see fig 8 this leads to that numerical results become closer to analytical results for larger values of a 1 as shown in fig 7 the pre buckling behaviour is affected by the parameter a 1 however the post buckling behaviour is barely influenced by a 1 from fig 7 the conclusion can also be drawn that the assumption of rigid plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model can give an accurate prediction for post buckling behaviour when no breakout resistance exists in the lateral pipe soil interaction model the snap through buckling phenomenon illustrated in fig 6 exists for small amplitude of initial imperfection i e w m 0 0 1 m the snap through buckling phenomenon disappears gradually with increasing amplitude of initial imperfection w m 0 the same characteristics with or without snap through buckling phenomenon is that a peak value of the axial compressive force p exists as shown in fig 6 b the process that the axial compressive force p increases from zero with increasing temperature difference is defined as the pre buckling state such as the branches o b 1 and o d 1 in fig 6 while the process that the axial compressive force p decreases with increasing temperature difference is defined as the post buckling state such as the branches c 1 b 2 and d 1 d 2 a peak p appears at the end of the pre buckling state i e states b 1 and d 1 the temperature difference corresponding to this peak is defined as the upper bound critical temperature difference denoted by t m u the case of w m 0 0 1 m is used to analyse the snap through buckling phenomenon as shown in fig 6 in the pre buckling state i e branch o b 1 the axial compressive force p increases with increasing temperature difference along the path p 0 e a α t 0 as shown in fig 6 b the axial compressive force p is controlled by the increase of temperature difference the discrepancy between the value p and the path p 0 e a α t 0 comes from the axial force release induced by the initiation of lateral deflection in the pre buckling state see branch o b 1 fig 6 a in this pre buckling state both the displacement amplitude w m and the stress induced by maximum bending moment σ m m increase slightly with increasing temperature difference along branch o b 1 see fig 6 a and d this means that the lateral deflection starts to mobilise under increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state even though this deflection is very small from fig 6 e in the pre buckling state the maximum stress σ m increases along the path σ 0 e α t 0 which is slightly larger than σ 0 under the same temperature difference the reason is that the maximum stress σ m is the combination of stress induced by axial force σ p see fig 6 c and stress induced by the maximum bending moment σ m m see fig 6 d when the temperature difference reaches t m u a jump from pre buckling state to post buckling state will take place i e a jump from state b 1 to b 2 during this jump a sudden increase in w m σ m m and σ m is shown in fig 6 a d and e while a sudden decrease in p and σ p occurs see fig 6 b and c after the jump the pipeline buckling behaviour will develop along the post buckling path with increasing temperature difference w m σ m m and σ m increase while p and σ p decrease gradually from the comparison between σ p σ m m and σ m the conclusion is drawn that σ m is controlled by σ p in the pre buckling state while it is controlled by σ m m in the post buckling state the buckled pipeline will evolve along branch c 1 b 2 under decreasing temperature difference when it locates at the post buckling state another jump from post buckling state to pre buckling state will occur i e a jump from state c 1 to c 2 when the temperature difference decreases to temperature difference t m l the temperature difference t m l is defined as the lower bound critical temperature difference in this jump a sudden decrease in w m σ m m and σ m occurs as shown in fig 6 a d and e while a sudden increase in p and σ p takes place see fig 6 b and c then the pipeline will deflect along the pre buckling branch the snap through buckling raises the possibility of hysteresis cycles b 1 b 2 c 1 c 2 under cyclic thermal loading this snap through buckling phenomenon and hysteresis cycle will disappear when the amplitude of initial imperfection w m 0 increases to 0 3 m or 0 5 m as shown in fig 6 in this case w m σ m m and σ m increase from zero with increasing temperature difference gradually without jumps for p and σ p they increase first and then decrease with increasing temperature difference a maximum value still exists for p and σ p the temperature difference corresponding to this peak is the upper bound critical temperature difference however both the jump and the corresponding lower bound critical temperature difference disappear 3 2 influence of μ b r k in this section the influence of μ b r k on the post buckling behaviour is analysed on the basis of fig 9 the dots shown in fig 9 represent the states where the peak axial compressive force p locates i e the locations of upper bound critical temperature difference t m u in the pre buckling state all parameters in fig 9 accrete gradually with increasing temperature difference for all the cases the increasing rates of w m σ m m and σ m are larger for smaller μ b r k since larger buckled deflection occurs for smaller breakout resistance the increasing rates of p and σ p are smaller for smaller μ b r k since more axial compressive force reduction takes place for larger buckled deflection from fig 9 in the post buckling state w m is smaller while p σ p σ m m and σ m are larger for larger μ b r k under the same temperature difference the increasing rates of w m σ m m and σ m with temperature difference are almost the same for different μ b r k under the same temperature difference however the influence of μ b r k on p and σ p reduces with increasing temperature difference in fig 9 the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle appear gradually with increasing μ b r k for μ b r k 0 5 there are no snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle all parameters develop gradually with increasing temperature difference for μ b r k 1 0 snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle also don t exist however for this case there is a rapid increase in w m σ m m and σ m and a rapid decrease in p and σ p around t m u with increasing temperature difference which is similar to the snap through phenomenon for the cases of μ b r k 1 5 and 2 0 clear snap through phenomenon and hysteresis cycle exist the lower and upper bound critical temperature differences t m l and t m u increase with increasing μ b r k as shown in fig 9 a detailed parameter analysis about the influence of μ b r k on t m u and t m l is shown in fig 10 both t m u and t m l increase close to linear with increasing μ b r k the increasing rate of t m u is much larger than that of t m l with increasing μ b r k in fig 10 the location where t m l equals to t m u denotes the state where snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear for μ b r k μ b r k e both t m u and t m l exist which represents the situation that both the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle appear for μ b r k μ b r k e t m u exists while t m l disappears which represents the situation that there are no snap through phenomenon and hysteresis cycle 3 3 influence of w m 0 in this section the influence of w m 0 on the post buckling behaviour is analysed on the basis of fig 11 the dots shown in fig 11 represent the states where the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u locates the results for μ b r k 0 5 are also shown in fig 11 d and e for comparison in the pre buckling state w m σ m m and σ m in fig 11 increase in a relative slow speed with increasing temperature difference whose increasing rates are larger for larger w m 0 both p and σ p increase close to linear with increasing temperature difference the increasing rates of p and σ p are smaller for larger w m 0 in the post buckling state w m is slightly larger for larger w m 0 both p and σ p are slightly smaller for larger w m 0 the influence of w m 0 on w m p and σ p gradually reduces with increasing temperature difference as shown in fig 11 a b and c both σ m m and σ m become larger for larger w m 0 whose increasing rates are similar for different w m 0 therefore the buckled pipeline will be more dangerous for larger w m 0 under the same temperature difference from fig 11 the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist only for slightly small w m 0 such as w m 0 0 1 m which will disappear for large w m 0 such as w m 0 0 5 m taking w m 0 0 5 m as an example w m σ m m and σ m increase monotonically with increasing temperature difference both p and σ p first increase and then decrease gradually with increasing temperature difference for w m 0 0 1 m the typical snap through phenomenon occurs as described before and the hysteresis cycle appears the effect of w m 0 on t m u and t m l is shown in fig 12 t m l decreases with increasing w m 0 until it stops at point e whose decreasing rate is close to linear as shown in fig 12 t m u also decreases with increasing w m 0 but its decreasing rate becomes smaller for larger w m 0 t m u equals to t m l at point e where snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear for w m 0 w m 0 e both t m u and t m l exist which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist for w m 0 w m 0 e t m u exists while t m l disappears which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear 3 4 influence of l 0 in this section the influence of l 0 on the post buckling behaviour is shown in fig 13 the dots shown in fig 13 represent the states where the upper bound critical temperature difference t m u locates the results for μ b r k 0 5 are also shown in fig 13 d and e for comparison in fig 13 a w m is very small and increases in a slightly slower speed for larger l 0 with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state in the post buckling state w m is slightly larger for larger l 0 which is barely affected by l 0 from fig 13 b and c both p and σ p increase close to linear with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state whose increasing rates are slightly larger for larger l 0 in the post buckling state both p and σ p are slightly smaller for larger l 0 but this effect is tiny from fig 13 d and e the increasing rates of σ m m and σ m gradually increase with increasing temperature difference in the pre buckling state which are smaller for larger l 0 in the post buckling state the increasing rates of σ m m and σ m are similar for different l 0 both σ m m and σ m become smaller for larger l 0 under the same temperature difference from fig 13 the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist only for large l 0 such as l 0 30 m or 40 m which will disappear for small l 0 such as l 0 20 m for l 0 30 m or 40 m the typical snap through phenomenon occurs as described before and the hysteresis cycle appears for l 0 20 m w m σ m m and σ m increase monotonically with increasing temperature difference without snap through phenomenon both p and σ p first increase and then decrease gradually with increasing temperature difference the effect of l 0 on t m u and t m l is shown in fig 14 t m u increases with increasing l 0 and its increasing rate also increases with increasing l 0 t m l appears when l 0 increases to l 0 e where snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle appear then t m l decreases slightly first and then increases with increasing l 0 the influence of l 0 on t m u is much larger than t m l for l 0 l 0 e both t m u and t m l exist which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle exist for l 0 l 0 e t m u exists while t m l disappears which represents the case that the snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle disappear 4 conclusions mathematical models are proposed to investigate lateral buckling of imperfect subsea pipelines with nonlinear lateral pipe soil interaction model the models are validated through the comparison between numerical and analytical results the discrepancy of these results is induced by the difference of mobilisation distance the snap through phenomenon is analysed in detail the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences are defined to demonstrate when snap through phenomenon takes place and hysteresis cycle appears finally the influence of breakout resistance amplitude and half wavelength of initial imperfection on the post buckling behaviour is discussed the critical temperature differences are also analysed from the analysis shown in this study the following conclusions are drawn i the analytical and numerical results obtained by the proposed mathematical models have a pronounced agreement along the post buckling curve except that there is a marginal discrepancy in the pre buckling state this discrepancy is induced by different types of pipe soil interaction models i e rigid plastic pipe soil interaction model used in the analytical results and elastic plastic pipe soil interaction model used in the numerical results the discrepancy becomes smaller when the elastic plastic lateral pipe soil interaction model is closer to rigid plastic ii the pipeline may jump between pre buckling and post buckling states at the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences under increasing and decreasing temperature differences respectively when snap through phenomenon exists the snap through buckling raises the possibility of hysteresis cycles under cyclic thermal loading iii when snap through buckling occurs under increasing temperature difference from pre buckling to post buckling state a sudden increase in the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress and a sudden decrease in axial compressive force take place when the snap through buckling is under the decreasing temperature difference from post buckling to pre buckling state a sudden decrease in the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress and a sudden increase in axial compressive force occur iv in the pre buckling state the maximum stress is controlled by the stress induced by axial compressive force in the post buckling state the maximum stress is controlled by maximum bending stress in the post buckling state the maximum stress increases with increasing breakout resistance or amplitude of imperfection while it decreases with the increasing wavelength of imperfection v both the upper and lower bound critical temperature differences increase with increasing breakout resistance however they decrease with increasing amplitude of imperfection the upper bound critical temperature difference increases with increasing wavelength of imperfection the lower bound critical temperature difference decreases slightly first and then increases with increasing wavelength of imperfection snap through phenomenon and the hysteresis cycle may exist at large breakout resistance small amplitude of imperfection and large wavelength of imperfection credit authorship contribution statement zhenkui wang formal analysis

21088,air guns can be used for seabed resource exploration shock testing of naval vessels polar ice breaking etc the study of air gun bubble pulsation and near field pressure is of great significance in order to analyze the dynamic behavior and pressure characteristics of air gun bubble in detail and quantitatively this study used the finite volume and volume of fluid methods to establish a compressible three dimensional air gun bubble model in openfoam open field operation and manipulation the characteristics of air gun bubble pulsation and the surrounding flow field pressures produced using various opening areas and forms were investigated the maximum horizontal bubble displacement main primary pulse and bubble pulse were analyzed quantitatively when the air gun opening area was small the bubble expansion time was short and the collapse time was long the bubble surface was mostly smooth during the first bubble pulsation cycle the bubble was nearly spherical when at its maximum volume when collapse was nearly complete an annular jet formed in the annular opening air gun bubble and four jets were formed from the four opening air gun bubble the system with the largest air gun opening area had the largest pressure wave primary pulse keywords air gun bubble finite volume method four opening pressure wave 1 introduction 1 1 air gun applications as an efficient and stable artificial seismic source the air gun is widely used in seabed resource exploration accaino et al 2020 caldwell and dragoset 2000 when an air gun is excited underwater a low frequency high energy pressure wave signal a type of mechanical wave is released alongside pulsation of a bubble it is well known that mechanical waves decay more slowly than light and electromagnetic waves in water low frequency high energy pressure waves can easily penetrate large amounts of seawater and thick seabed structures some pressure wave signals are reflected back to the sea surface when penetrating media with varying densities the reflected wave signals received at the sea surface can be analyzed to detect whether there are resources on the seabed knapp and steeples 1986 lee et al 2014 air guns can also be used as an excitation source for ship shock resistance testing de graaf et al 2014b in order to verify whether a ship s structure and system meet shock resistance requirements it is necessary to conduct an impact test by performing a controlled detonation of explosives nearby compared to traditional explosion sources the air gun is green low cost stable and safe dragoset 2000 although the intensity of the air gun source is not as high as that of a traditional explosive one can make up for this deficiency by properly adjusting the distance between the air gun and the ship or by using a combined air gun source dragoset 1984 johnston 2010 air guns are also useful in polar ice breaking cui et al 2018 as it is formed the bubble releases strong pressure pulse shock wave into the fluid philipp and lauterborn 1998 tomita and shima 1986 it later forms a high speed water jet due to buoyancy or nearby boundaries upon collapse lauterborn and bolle 1975 zhang et al 2017b the shock wave and high speed water jet can cause serious damage to structures near the bubble and are the main causes of propeller erosion peters et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the air gun bubble is so destructive that it can be used in polar ice breaking however due to the variety of air gun bubble pulsation patterns and complex jet formation mechanisms air gun bubble pulsation and the related near field pressure changes require further study 1 2 previous studies experiments are the most direct and effective means of studying bubble pulsation cui et al 2020 langhammer et al 1995 wehner et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 langhammer and landrø 1996 used underwater high speed photography technology to record the pulsations of bubbles generated by a high pressure air gun and measured the near field pressure signal 25 cm from the air gun they found that the bubble surface remained smooth during the first bubble expansion until the collapse and rebound stages at which point the bubble surface and movements became irregular de graaf et al 2014a made a simple four port air gun model fired it in a transparent water tank and observed bubbles that were much clearer than those generated by a real air gun when the four air gun ports were opened via the solenoid valve the gas in the air gun chamber quickly rushed into the water forming four small bubbles four small bubbles merged into a single large one as they expanded previous experiments have indicated that air gun bubbles are typically non spherical because of the effect of the gun body air gun bubble pulsation is often accompanied by bubble coalescence bubble splitting and other complex phenomena and these have significant effects on the near field pressure the interactions between the air gun bubble and the air gun body are complex and thus simple experimental research is not sufficient to explain some bubble pulsation mechanisms the spherical air gun bubble hypothesis is typically used to simulate the far field pressure wavelet emitted by the air gun bubble landrø and sollie 1992 safar 1976 zhang et al 2017a ziolkowski 2010 thus bubble motion can be described by spherical compressible bubble pulsation equations such as the commonly used gilmore equation gilmore 1952 then the above equation is solved via numerical iteration and other methods to obtain the bubble radius and the far field pressure at any moment li et al 2010 2014 wang and liu 2014 this method has high calculation efficiency but ignores the influence of the bubble shape on the far field pressure wavelet the pressure wave is assumed to be spherical and to propagate outwards from the air gun center the wavelength of the pressure wave is much larger than the actual bubble radius so the influence of the change in the bubble shape on the far field pressure wavelet can be ignored ziolkowski 1970 ziolkowski and metselaar 1984 thus the bubble can be treated as a point source however at near field measurement points the flow field pressure changes with the bubble shape such that the pressure exhibits asymmetric characteristics when the bubble appears non spherical thus spherical bubble theory is not suitable for the study of near field air gun bubble characteristics the boundary element method bem is commonly used in the numerical study of the bubble shape and near field air gun pressure cox et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 2019 the bem has several advantages for the study of bubble splitting and coalescence for example li et al 2020a studied non spherical air gun bubbles under the influence of buoyancy and huang et al 2016 investigated interactions between air gun array bubbles using the multi level bem however bubble pulsation under the influence of a gun body belongs to a problem that bubble is very close to wall the grid of the bubble and gun body is prone to cross twisting until recently this difficulty was basically overcome li et al 2020b the finite volume method has a clear advantage over the bem when simulating a bubble that is extremely close to the wall li et al 2019a 2019b the bubble boundary can be determined from the volume fraction of each element without considering the effects of mesh intersections on the bubble jet splitting and coalescence processes 1 3 the goals of this paper air gun bubble pulsation under the influence of the gun body is complex and there are relatively few research papers in this field current practice of employing the air gun for bubble generation and accompanying pressure wave primarily for underwater seismic survey has depended largely on empirical approach hydrodynamics behavior and mechanism behind the air gun bubble pulsation is lack of reasonable theoretical analysis and current refined numerical simulation of air gun bubble is very rare in our previous paper an axisymmetric air gun bubble model was established and bubble pulsation produced by an annular opening air gun was studied zhang et al 2020b but the cases that axisymmetric model can simulate is limited and axisymmetric model is not suitable for four opening air gun bubble simulation as such this work builds a three dimensional air gun bubble model and serves to provide a very systematic analysis of the flow physics arising from the bubble generation via the air gun in this paper we combine the finite volume and volume of fluid methods to implement a three dimensional compressible air gun bubble pulsation model in openfoam then we investigate 3d air gun bubble pulsation and the surrounding fluid pressure produced by four opening air gun with various opening heights and widths the main contents of this paper are as follows first we introduce the application background research status and main goals of this paper second we introduce the basic theory of our numerical model third a simplified air gun experimental model is established based on an experimental electric spark bubble device to verify the validity of the numerical model in the fourth section bubble pulsation of an annular opening and the four opening air gun with various opening heights are simulated the temporal variation of the maximum horizontal bubble displacement and the pressure of the flow field around the bubble are determined in section five the relationship between the pressure pulse and the opening area is discussed finally some basic laws found in the study are summarized 2 numerical model 2 1 basic theory underwater air gun bubble pulsation is analyzed as two phase gas liquid flow the gas is treated as an ideal gas that is insoluble in water this paper uses the finite volume method to solve this problem the entire calculation domain is divided into sparse and dense grid cells to improve the calculation efficiency a dense grid is used near the bubble and a sparse grid is used far away from the bubble to test the convergence of our model our results were compared with results of gilmore which was commonly used to model the motion of spherical bubble in a compressible fluid and good agreements were found zhang et al 2020a each cell of the discrete fluid field carries six unknown variables the water density ρ w gas density ρ g water volume fraction α w gas volume fraction α g flow field pressure p and flow field velocity vector u u x u y u z we need six equations to determine the value of each cell variable at any moment t first the sum of the volume fractions of gas and water in each cell in the flow field is equal to 1 miller et al 2013 that is 1 α w α g 1 second the mass of fluid flowing into each cell is equal to the mass of the fluid flowing out of each cell koch et al 2016 miller et al 2013 the water and gas in the cell can be analyzed via eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 ρ w t ρ w u d v 0 3 ρ g t ρ g u d v 0 since the fluid is not affected by external forces each fluid cell is subject to conservation of momentum in all directions 4 ρ u t ρ u u μ u d v s p d s where ρ is the total density of the fluid cell which satisfies ρ α w ρ w α g ρ g and μ is the viscosity coefficient moukalled et al 2016 finally the density and pressure of air and water are related via the state equations below 5 p b p b ρ w ρ n 6 p p ρ g ρ n where n and b are the constants for the water n 7 and b 3 108 with the discretization process the above integral equations can be transformed into a series of algebraic equation over each discrete element the mass equation and momentum equation of an element can be expressed as follows 7 ρ w t δ t ρ w t v c f s f ρ w t u t f δ t 0 8 ρ g t δ t ρ g t v c f s f ρ g t u t f δ t 0 9 ρ t δ t u t δ t ρ t u t v c f s f ρ t u t f u f t δ t f μ u t f s f δ t f s f p f δ t where the subscript f denotes the bounding surface of the element δ t is the time increasement at time t s is the surface vector of the element and v c is the volume of the element 2 2 non dimensional method in order to make the research have universal significance the calculation results and analysis in this paper are in the form of dimensionless pearson et al 2004 wang 2014 the equivalent initial bubble radius r 0 is chosen as the reference length which can be calculated using the following equation 10 r 0 3 v g 4 π 1 3 where v g is the initial volume of the gas inside the air gun chamber determined by the size of the air gun the non dimensional opening height h and width w of the air gun respectively meet 11 h h r 0 12 w w r 0 where h and w are the opening height and width of the air gun respectively the hydrostatic pressure p is taken as the reference pressure so non dimensional fluid pressure p is equal to p p the non dimensional time t is scaled with r 0 ρ p 0 5 for the four opening air gun the non dimensional air gun opening area s is equal to 4 h w r 0 2 while for the annular opening air gun s is equal to 2 π r g h r 0 2 in which r g is the outer radius of the air gun body in the following discussion we marked all the non dimensional quantities with a superscript 2 3 air gun bubble model typical air guns commonly used in engineering include those with a single annular opening and those with four openings in order to simplify the calculation the air gun model shown in fig 1 is established and the influence of the internal air gun structure is not considered the upper and lower air gun chambers are directly connected by support rod the gun body is simplified as a hollow cylindrical shell the single annular opening and set of four openings are located at the vertical center of the cylindrical shell the four openings are uniformly distributed along the ring of the gun body the opening height is represented by h regardless of whether a single annular opening or a set of four openings is used and the opening width is represented by w in order to reduce the influence of the boundary on the air gun bubble pulsation the flow field length and width are set to be 200 r 0 the maximum bubble diameter is about 12 r 0 so the domain size is about 17 times the maximum bubble radius the model is symmetrical in the vertical and horizontal directions and the pressure measurement point is five times initial bubble radius 5r 0 from the center of the air gun at the initial moment t 0 the densities of water and gas are 998 kg m3 and m gun v gun respectively where v gun is the volume of gas inside the air gun chamber and can be calculated from the geometric dimensions of the model in fig 1 m gun is the mass of gas inside the air gun chamber which can be calculated via the ideal gas state equation the gas pressure inside the air gun chamber is about 68 times hydrostatic pressure p 101 325 pa and the initial velocity of the entire flow field is zero for a cell full of water α w 1 and α g 0 for a cell full of gas α w 0 and α g 1 for a cell at the bubble boundary 0 α w and α g 1 due to the simultaneous presence of gas and liquid the purpose of this paper is to study the influence of the gun body and opening on air gun bubble pulsation buoyancy is an important factor that induces upward jets inside the bubble blake et al 1986 wang et al 1996 in order to eliminate the influence of buoyancy on air gun bubble pulsation buoyancy is not considered in the model presented in this paper 3 numerical validation the low voltage spark bubble shown in fig 2 is used to verify the numerical model developed in this paper the backlight source is a 2000 w tungsten lamp the full frame shooting frequency of the high speed camera is 6242 frames per second and the highest shooting frequency is 650 000 frames per second in order to ensure that the bubble outline is clear each group of experiments is shot using relatively short exposure times the shooting speed is 51 001 frames per second so the time error associated with each picture does not exceed 0 02 ms experiments are conducted at 24 c and an ambient pressure of 0 1 mpa since the length of each side of the square water tank is 0 5 m which is much larger than the maximum radius of the spark bubble the influence of the water tank on bubble pulsation is negligible the wire diameter is less than 0 25 mm which is much smaller than the bubble diameter the influence of the electrode is also negligible its complex structure makes manufacturing a real air gun difficult a simple four opening air gun body model was established by simulating the opening mode of an existing commercial air gun the gun body is made from plexiglass and has a diameter of 6 mm the barrier between the four outlets is made from hard plastic before the experiment we placed the scaled air gun model in the middle of the transparent glass tank and then connected the thin copper wire used as the discharge electrode in the center of the cylindrical gap we also ensured that the primary bubble was sandwiched between the two ends of the cylinder and adjusted the light source and camera such that the light source camera and electrode center would be at the same height during discharge the capacitance in the bubble generation device quickly releases its stored electricity at the electrode ends instantly breaking down the water around the electrode lapping points generating high temperature high pressure plasma and promoting vaporization of the surrounding water to generate the initial bubble fig 3 compares the four opening air gun bubble pulsation numerical and experimental results the numerical model is basically consistent with the experimental model described in fig 2 the initial pressure of the air gun bubble is set to be 120 times hydrostatic pressure p and high pressure gas is assumed to be full of the gap between two cylinders at initial time other conditions of numerical calculation such as diameter of the cylinder are the same as those of experiments after the bubble overflows from the exhaust port four small bubbles are formed with their roots connected via the cylindrical gap as the volume of each small bubble increases the spacing between them decreases and they begin to merge the bubble volume is maximized at about t 3 0 ms but the small bubbles are not completely merged during collapse the bubble gradually evolves into a square and a jet pointing to the gun body is formed near the air gun opening it can be seen from fig 3 that the experimental and numerical results are consistent with regard to morphology and therefore that the numerical model established in this paper is reliable 4 numerical results 4 1 cases of h 0 8 4 1 1 annular opening fig 4 describes the bubble motion produced by an annular opening air gun the non dimensional height h of the annular opening is 0 8 the model size and relevant calculation parameters are as shown in fig 1 initially the gas pressure inside the air gun chamber is far greater than that of surrounding water after the annular air gun opening in the center of the gun body is opened gas moves rapidly from the air gun chamber to the inside of the bubble and the water surrounding the bubble is repelled outwards the internal bubble pressure drops rapidly upon rapid expansion of the bubble volume bubble expansion decelerates when the internal bubble pressure is less than the flow field pressure as the bubble continues to expand the pressure of the outer flow field gradually exceeds that of the flow field near the bubble t 2 0 at about t 6 0 the bubble expansion speed is reduced to zero the bubble volume reaches its maximum and is ready to collapse the bubble surface is smooth and nearly spherical during expansion when the bubble collapses the bubble volume decreases the internal bubble pressure increases and the high pressure flow field area gradually falls back from the far flow field to the vicinity of the bubble center t 11 0 the bubble wall at the annular opening clearly collapses more quickly than other areas becoming concave to form a circular jet that points to the air gun center at about t 11 4 the bubble volume is nearly minimized the internal bubble pressure is maximized and the bubble is ready to rebound 4 1 2 w 0 8 fig 5 depicts the bubble pulsation process of a four opening air gun the non dimensional opening height h and width w of the air gun are both 0 8 when air gun fires under water the highly compressed gas sealed in the air gun chamber is rapidly released into the water and four relatively independent small bubbles are formed near the air gun opening t 0 4 the four small bubbles are arranged tightly around the air gun body such that the combination of forms appears like a piece of garlic with four cloves as they rapidly expand outward the surfaces of the small bubbles gradually approach each other and begin to merge from the root although the bubbles remain divided into four parts their roots are completely merged at t 0 8 as the bubbles expand the four small bubbles finally merge into one large bubble which is nearly spherical as seen in the pressure contours in fig 5 the high flow field pressure gradually transfers from the bubble center to the far field between 0 and 6 0 when t 6 0 the pressure of the flow field around the bubble is much lower than that of the far field the bubble volume is nearly maximized the expansion speed is reduced to zero and the bubble is ready to collapse in the collapse stage the bubble volume gradually shrinks and the bubble shape gradually transitions from spherical to square t 6 0 9 0 however the presence of the gun body and opening causes the bubble surface to become gradually concave towards the four opening areas where it forms four clear water jets during the subsequent collapse as the bubble continues to collapse it moves gradually towards the bubble center and the high pressure area in the flow field gradually moves from the far field to the bubble surface at t 11 4 the bubble collapse speed is reduced to zero and the bubble volume is minimized thus the bubble is ready to start reverse movement 4 1 3 w 0 4 when the non dimensional air gun opening height h is kept constant at 0 8 and the non dimensional opening width w is reduced to 0 4 the horizontal velocity of the bubble ejected from the air gun opening is significantly greater than the vertical velocity the small bubble is longer along the opening direction than in the vertical direction as shown in fig 6 compared to the case where w 0 8 the four small bubbles coalescence later and the bubble surface is not smooth after coalescence as it contains an obvious fusion line the flow field pressure distribution around the bubble is not spherical similar to that caused by four independent pulsation bubbles cui et al 2016 in the collapse stage the peripheral flow field pressure is significantly higher than that around the bubble and the bubble surface is more concave at the opening in addition the bubble jet width becomes much smaller t 11 2 than in the case where w 0 8 4 1 4 bubble radius and fluid pressure fig 7 describes the temporal variations of the non dimensional maximum horizontal displacements of bubbles formed using a constant non dimensional air gun body opening height h of 0 8 and various opening widths w the non dimensional horizontal maximum displacement r of the bubble and the bubble pulsation period decrease with the opening width w decreasing the opening width w reduces the opening area and thus the gas in the air gun chamber is transferred slowly into the bubble this decreases the farthest distance that bubble can reach in the horizontal direction therefore the annular opening air gun produces the maximum horizontal displacement for a given opening height fig 8 shows temporal variation of the non dimensional flow field pressure caused by the air gun given a constant opening height h 0 8 and different opening widths w the flow field pressure measurement point is five times initial bubble radius 5r 0 from the bubble center the annular opening air gun obviously produces a larger primary pulse first peak on the pressure curve longer bubble pulse period and smaller bubble pulse second peak on pressure curve 4 2 cases of h 0 4 4 2 1 annular opening fig 9 shows air gun bubble pulsation when the non dimensional height of the annular opening h is reduced to 0 4 the decreased opening height slows the gas transfer speed from the air gun chamber to the inside of the bubble at the start t 0 4 the bubble moves faster in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction resulting in a flat thin annular shape however rapid expansion gradually causes the bubble to become spherical when t 6 0 the bubble volume approaches its maximum and the gun body passes vertically through the center of the bubble as the bubble collapses it adheres to the surface of the cylindrical gun body and the high pressure around it causes the bubble surface to become concave at the annular opening of the air gun 4 2 2 w 0 8 fig 10 shows bubble motion produced by a four opening air gun with h 0 4 and w 0 8 because the height is larger than the width the horizontal displacement of the small bubbles formed by the initial air gun exhaust is larger than the longitudinal displacement upon expansion the four small bubbles gradually merge into one large bubble the bubble gradually evolves from square to spherical during bubble collapse the external high pressure flow field moves the fluid backward to the bubble center of the air gun and the bubble presses tightly on the air gun body surface in the final stage of bubble collapse the bubble is clearly concave and forms four water jets that point toward the center of the air gun body 4 2 3 w 0 4 in fig 11 the non dimensional air gun opening height h is 0 4 and the width w is reduced to 0 4 after the air gun fires four small nearly conical bubbles form near the air gun opening as the gas inside the air gun chamber continues to exhaust the four small bubbles expand rapidly outwards and gradually approach each other the four small bubbles eventually merge into one large bubble before the bubble volume approaches its maximum t 6 0 at bubble collapse the presence of the air gun body and openings cause the bubble surface to become gradually concave in the four areas that face the openings thus forming four obvious water jets 4 2 4 bubble radius and fluid pressure fig 12 shows the temporal variations of the non dimensional maximum horizontal displacements formed using a constant air gun body opening height h of 0 4 and various opening widths w when w 0 4 the maximum horizontal bubble displacement appears to be clearly asymmetric during bubble expansion and contraction this may be mainly due to the slow exhaust rate dm dt where m is the mass of gas of the air gun with small openings that is substantial time is required for the gas in the air chamber to complete its flow into the bubble and the newly injected gas has horizontal velocity this continuously drives bubble development along the horizontal direction therefore the smallest opening area produces the bubble with the largest horizontal displacement and collapse period as seen from the temporal variation of the pressure wave measured at the point of five times initial bubble radius 5r 0 away from the bubble fig 13 the primary pulse decreases with the opening width w 5 discussion fig 14 depicts the variation of the non dimensional primary and bubble pulses with the air gun opening area the primary pulse increases with the opening area but also varies when the opening area is constant and the opening direction changes one can compare the cases where w 0 8 h 0 4 and w 0 4 h 0 8 the changes in the bubble pulse are complex but the pulse tends to increase with the opening area the complexity appears primarily because many factors affect the bubble pulse including the jet width velocity etc when more energy is consumed during bubble pulsation less energy is used to release the pressure pulse when the bubble volume is minimized 6 conclusions the research of air gun bubble is of great significance to expand its engineering application in order to analyze the dynamic behavior and pressure characteristics of air gun bubble in detail and quantitatively a three dimensional compressible model of air gun bubble is established in openfoam with the combination of the volume of fluid and finite volume methods good agreement is found between numerical and experimental results and the influences of various opening shapes and sizes on air gun bubble pulsation were investigated several rules are found the air gun gas exhaust rate was slow when the air gun opening area was small this hindered bubble expansion shortened the bubble expansion time and lengthened the collapse time the surface of the air gun bubble was mostly smooth during the first expansion and contraction periods when its volume was maximized the bubble was generally spherical during later stages of collapse annular jets were formed inside the annular opening air gun bubble and four jets that pointed to the air gun openings were formed inside the four opening air gun bubble the larger the air gun opening area was the faster the air gun exhausted and the larger the primary pulse was the bubble pulse variation was complex but it also tended to increase with the opening area credit authorship contribution statement s zhang conceptualization methodology data curation writing original draft b c khoo supervision writing

21088,air guns can be used for seabed resource exploration shock testing of naval vessels polar ice breaking etc the study of air gun bubble pulsation and near field pressure is of great significance in order to analyze the dynamic behavior and pressure characteristics of air gun bubble in detail and quantitatively this study used the finite volume and volume of fluid methods to establish a compressible three dimensional air gun bubble model in openfoam open field operation and manipulation the characteristics of air gun bubble pulsation and the surrounding flow field pressures produced using various opening areas and forms were investigated the maximum horizontal bubble displacement main primary pulse and bubble pulse were analyzed quantitatively when the air gun opening area was small the bubble expansion time was short and the collapse time was long the bubble surface was mostly smooth during the first bubble pulsation cycle the bubble was nearly spherical when at its maximum volume when collapse was nearly complete an annular jet formed in the annular opening air gun bubble and four jets were formed from the four opening air gun bubble the system with the largest air gun opening area had the largest pressure wave primary pulse keywords air gun bubble finite volume method four opening pressure wave 1 introduction 1 1 air gun applications as an efficient and stable artificial seismic source the air gun is widely used in seabed resource exploration accaino et al 2020 caldwell and dragoset 2000 when an air gun is excited underwater a low frequency high energy pressure wave signal a type of mechanical wave is released alongside pulsation of a bubble it is well known that mechanical waves decay more slowly than light and electromagnetic waves in water low frequency high energy pressure waves can easily penetrate large amounts of seawater and thick seabed structures some pressure wave signals are reflected back to the sea surface when penetrating media with varying densities the reflected wave signals received at the sea surface can be analyzed to detect whether there are resources on the seabed knapp and steeples 1986 lee et al 2014 air guns can also be used as an excitation source for ship shock resistance testing de graaf et al 2014b in order to verify whether a ship s structure and system meet shock resistance requirements it is necessary to conduct an impact test by performing a controlled detonation of explosives nearby compared to traditional explosion sources the air gun is green low cost stable and safe dragoset 2000 although the intensity of the air gun source is not as high as that of a traditional explosive one can make up for this deficiency by properly adjusting the distance between the air gun and the ship or by using a combined air gun source dragoset 1984 johnston 2010 air guns are also useful in polar ice breaking cui et al 2018 as it is formed the bubble releases strong pressure pulse shock wave into the fluid philipp and lauterborn 1998 tomita and shima 1986 it later forms a high speed water jet due to buoyancy or nearby boundaries upon collapse lauterborn and bolle 1975 zhang et al 2017b the shock wave and high speed water jet can cause serious damage to structures near the bubble and are the main causes of propeller erosion peters et al 2018 wang et al 2018 the air gun bubble is so destructive that it can be used in polar ice breaking however due to the variety of air gun bubble pulsation patterns and complex jet formation mechanisms air gun bubble pulsation and the related near field pressure changes require further study 1 2 previous studies experiments are the most direct and effective means of studying bubble pulsation cui et al 2020 langhammer et al 1995 wehner et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 langhammer and landrø 1996 used underwater high speed photography technology to record the pulsations of bubbles generated by a high pressure air gun and measured the near field pressure signal 25 cm from the air gun they found that the bubble surface remained smooth during the first bubble expansion until the collapse and rebound stages at which point the bubble surface and movements became irregular de graaf et al 2014a made a simple four port air gun model fired it in a transparent water tank and observed bubbles that were much clearer than those generated by a real air gun when the four air gun ports were opened via the solenoid valve the gas in the air gun chamber quickly rushed into the water forming four small bubbles four small bubbles merged into a single large one as they expanded previous experiments have indicated that air gun bubbles are typically non spherical because of the effect of the gun body air gun bubble pulsation is often accompanied by bubble coalescence bubble splitting and other complex phenomena and these have significant effects on the near field pressure the interactions between the air gun bubble and the air gun body are complex and thus simple experimental research is not sufficient to explain some bubble pulsation mechanisms the spherical air gun bubble hypothesis is typically used to simulate the far field pressure wavelet emitted by the air gun bubble landrø and sollie 1992 safar 1976 zhang et al 2017a ziolkowski 2010 thus bubble motion can be described by spherical compressible bubble pulsation equations such as the commonly used gilmore equation gilmore 1952 then the above equation is solved via numerical iteration and other methods to obtain the bubble radius and the far field pressure at any moment li et al 2010 2014 wang and liu 2014 this method has high calculation efficiency but ignores the influence of the bubble shape on the far field pressure wavelet the pressure wave is assumed to be spherical and to propagate outwards from the air gun center the wavelength of the pressure wave is much larger than the actual bubble radius so the influence of the change in the bubble shape on the far field pressure wavelet can be ignored ziolkowski 1970 ziolkowski and metselaar 1984 thus the bubble can be treated as a point source however at near field measurement points the flow field pressure changes with the bubble shape such that the pressure exhibits asymmetric characteristics when the bubble appears non spherical thus spherical bubble theory is not suitable for the study of near field air gun bubble characteristics the boundary element method bem is commonly used in the numerical study of the bubble shape and near field air gun pressure cox et al 2004 zhang et al 2018 2019 the bem has several advantages for the study of bubble splitting and coalescence for example li et al 2020a studied non spherical air gun bubbles under the influence of buoyancy and huang et al 2016 investigated interactions between air gun array bubbles using the multi level bem however bubble pulsation under the influence of a gun body belongs to a problem that bubble is very close to wall the grid of the bubble and gun body is prone to cross twisting until recently this difficulty was basically overcome li et al 2020b the finite volume method has a clear advantage over the bem when simulating a bubble that is extremely close to the wall li et al 2019a 2019b the bubble boundary can be determined from the volume fraction of each element without considering the effects of mesh intersections on the bubble jet splitting and coalescence processes 1 3 the goals of this paper air gun bubble pulsation under the influence of the gun body is complex and there are relatively few research papers in this field current practice of employing the air gun for bubble generation and accompanying pressure wave primarily for underwater seismic survey has depended largely on empirical approach hydrodynamics behavior and mechanism behind the air gun bubble pulsation is lack of reasonable theoretical analysis and current refined numerical simulation of air gun bubble is very rare in our previous paper an axisymmetric air gun bubble model was established and bubble pulsation produced by an annular opening air gun was studied zhang et al 2020b but the cases that axisymmetric model can simulate is limited and axisymmetric model is not suitable for four opening air gun bubble simulation as such this work builds a three dimensional air gun bubble model and serves to provide a very systematic analysis of the flow physics arising from the bubble generation via the air gun in this paper we combine the finite volume and volume of fluid methods to implement a three dimensional compressible air gun bubble pulsation model in openfoam then we investigate 3d air gun bubble pulsation and the surrounding fluid pressure produced by four opening air gun with various opening heights and widths the main contents of this paper are as follows first we introduce the application background research status and main goals of this paper second we introduce the basic theory of our numerical model third a simplified air gun experimental model is established based on an experimental electric spark bubble device to verify the validity of the numerical model in the fourth section bubble pulsation of an annular opening and the four opening air gun with various opening heights are simulated the temporal variation of the maximum horizontal bubble displacement and the pressure of the flow field around the bubble are determined in section five the relationship between the pressure pulse and the opening area is discussed finally some basic laws found in the study are summarized 2 numerical model 2 1 basic theory underwater air gun bubble pulsation is analyzed as two phase gas liquid flow the gas is treated as an ideal gas that is insoluble in water this paper uses the finite volume method to solve this problem the entire calculation domain is divided into sparse and dense grid cells to improve the calculation efficiency a dense grid is used near the bubble and a sparse grid is used far away from the bubble to test the convergence of our model our results were compared with results of gilmore which was commonly used to model the motion of spherical bubble in a compressible fluid and good agreements were found zhang et al 2020a each cell of the discrete fluid field carries six unknown variables the water density ρ w gas density ρ g water volume fraction α w gas volume fraction α g flow field pressure p and flow field velocity vector u u x u y u z we need six equations to determine the value of each cell variable at any moment t first the sum of the volume fractions of gas and water in each cell in the flow field is equal to 1 miller et al 2013 that is 1 α w α g 1 second the mass of fluid flowing into each cell is equal to the mass of the fluid flowing out of each cell koch et al 2016 miller et al 2013 the water and gas in the cell can be analyzed via eqs 2 and 3 respectively 2 ρ w t ρ w u d v 0 3 ρ g t ρ g u d v 0 since the fluid is not affected by external forces each fluid cell is subject to conservation of momentum in all directions 4 ρ u t ρ u u μ u d v s p d s where ρ is the total density of the fluid cell which satisfies ρ α w ρ w α g ρ g and μ is the viscosity coefficient moukalled et al 2016 finally the density and pressure of air and water are related via the state equations below 5 p b p b ρ w ρ n 6 p p ρ g ρ n where n and b are the constants for the water n 7 and b 3 108 with the discretization process the above integral equations can be transformed into a series of algebraic equation over each discrete element the mass equation and momentum equation of an element can be expressed as follows 7 ρ w t δ t ρ w t v c f s f ρ w t u t f δ t 0 8 ρ g t δ t ρ g t v c f s f ρ g t u t f δ t 0 9 ρ t δ t u t δ t ρ t u t v c f s f ρ t u t f u f t δ t f μ u t f s f δ t f s f p f δ t where the subscript f denotes the bounding surface of the element δ t is the time increasement at time t s is the surface vector of the element and v c is the volume of the element 2 2 non dimensional method in order to make the research have universal significance the calculation results and analysis in this paper are in the form of dimensionless pearson et al 2004 wang 2014 the equivalent initial bubble radius r 0 is chosen as the reference length which can be calculated using the following equation 10 r 0 3 v g 4 π 1 3 where v g is the initial volume of the gas inside the air gun chamber determined by the size of the air gun the non dimensional opening height h and width w of the air gun respectively meet 11 h h r 0 12 w w r 0 where h and w are the opening height and width of the air gun respectively the hydrostatic pressure p is taken as the reference pressure so non dimensional fluid pressure p is equal to p p the non dimensional time t is scaled with r 0 ρ p 0 5 for the four opening air gun the non dimensional air gun opening area s is equal to 4 h w r 0 2 while for the annular opening air gun s is equal to 2 π r g h r 0 2 in which r g is the outer radius of the air gun body in the following discussion we marked all the non dimensional quantities with a superscript 2 3 air gun bubble model typical air guns commonly used in engineering include those with a single annular opening and those with four openings in order to simplify the calculation the air gun model shown in fig 1 is established and the influence of the internal air gun structure is not considered the upper and lower air gun chambers are directly connected by support rod the gun body is simplified as a hollow cylindrical shell the single annular opening and set of four openings are located at the vertical center of the cylindrical shell the four openings are uniformly distributed along the ring of the gun body the opening height is represented by h regardless of whether a single annular opening or a set of four openings is used and the opening width is represented by w in order to reduce the influence of the boundary on the air gun bubble pulsation the flow field length and width are set to be 200 r 0 the maximum bubble diameter is about 12 r 0 so the domain size is about 17 times the maximum bubble radius the model is symmetrical in the vertical and horizontal directions and the pressure measurement point is five times initial bubble radius 5r 0 from the center of the air gun at the initial moment t 0 the densities of water and gas are 998 kg m3 and m gun v gun respectively where v gun is the volume of gas inside the air gun chamber and can be calculated from the geometric dimensions of the model in fig 1 m gun is the mass of gas inside the air gun chamber which can be calculated via the ideal gas state equation the gas pressure inside the air gun chamber is about 68 times hydrostatic pressure p 101 325 pa and the initial velocity of the entire flow field is zero for a cell full of water α w 1 and α g 0 for a cell full of gas α w 0 and α g 1 for a cell at the bubble boundary 0 α w and α g 1 due to the simultaneous presence of gas and liquid the purpose of this paper is to study the influence of the gun body and opening on air gun bubble pulsation buoyancy is an important factor that induces upward jets inside the bubble blake et al 1986 wang et al 1996 in order to eliminate the influence of buoyancy on air gun bubble pulsation buoyancy is not considered in the model presented in this paper 3 numerical validation the low voltage spark bubble shown in fig 2 is used to verify the numerical model developed in this paper the backlight source is a 2000 w tungsten lamp the full frame shooting frequency of the high speed camera is 6242 frames per second and the highest shooting frequency is 650 000 frames per second in order to ensure that the bubble outline is clear each group of experiments is shot using relatively short exposure times the shooting speed is 51 001 frames per second so the time error associated with each picture does not exceed 0 02 ms experiments are conducted at 24 c and an ambient pressure of 0 1 mpa since the length of each side of the square water tank is 0 5 m which is much larger than the maximum radius of the spark bubble the influence of the water tank on bubble pulsation is negligible the wire diameter is less than 0 25 mm which is much smaller than the bubble diameter the influence of the electrode is also negligible its complex structure makes manufacturing a real air gun difficult a simple four opening air gun body model was established by simulating the opening mode of an existing commercial air gun the gun body is made from plexiglass and has a diameter of 6 mm the barrier between the four outlets is made from hard plastic before the experiment we placed the scaled air gun model in the middle of the transparent glass tank and then connected the thin copper wire used as the discharge electrode in the center of the cylindrical gap we also ensured that the primary bubble was sandwiched between the two ends of the cylinder and adjusted the light source and camera such that the light source camera and electrode center would be at the same height during discharge the capacitance in the bubble generation device quickly releases its stored electricity at the electrode ends instantly breaking down the water around the electrode lapping points generating high temperature high pressure plasma and promoting vaporization of the surrounding water to generate the initial bubble fig 3 compares the four opening air gun bubble pulsation numerical and experimental results the numerical model is basically consistent with the experimental model described in fig 2 the initial pressure of the air gun bubble is set to be 120 times hydrostatic pressure p and high pressure gas is assumed to be full of the gap between two cylinders at initial time other conditions of numerical calculation such as diameter of the cylinder are the same as those of experiments after the bubble overflows from the exhaust port four small bubbles are formed with their roots connected via the cylindrical gap as the volume of each small bubble increases the spacing between them decreases and they begin to merge the bubble volume is maximized at about t 3 0 ms but the small bubbles are not completely merged during collapse the bubble gradually evolves into a square and a jet pointing to the gun body is formed near the air gun opening it can be seen from fig 3 that the experimental and numerical results are consistent with regard to morphology and therefore that the numerical model established in this paper is reliable 4 numerical results 4 1 cases of h 0 8 4 1 1 annular opening fig 4 describes the bubble motion produced by an annular opening air gun the non dimensional height h of the annular opening is 0 8 the model size and relevant calculation parameters are as shown in fig 1 initially the gas pressure inside the air gun chamber is far greater than that of surrounding water after the annular air gun opening in the center of the gun body is opened gas moves rapidly from the air gun chamber to the inside of the bubble and the water surrounding the bubble is repelled outwards the internal bubble pressure drops rapidly upon rapid expansion of the bubble volume bubble expansion decelerates when the internal bubble pressure is less than the flow field pressure as the bubble continues to expand the pressure of the outer flow field gradually exceeds that of the flow field near the bubble t 2 0 at about t 6 0 the bubble expansion speed is reduced to zero the bubble volume reaches its maximum and is ready to collapse the bubble surface is smooth and nearly spherical during expansion when the bubble collapses the bubble volume decreases the internal bubble pressure increases and the high pressure flow field area gradually falls back from the far flow field to the vicinity of the bubble center t 11 0 the bubble wall at the annular opening clearly collapses more quickly than other areas becoming concave to form a circular jet that points to the air gun center at about t 11 4 the bubble volume is nearly minimized the internal bubble pressure is maximized and the bubble is ready to rebound 4 1 2 w 0 8 fig 5 depicts the bubble pulsation process of a four opening air gun the non dimensional opening height h and width w of the air gun are both 0 8 when air gun fires under water the highly compressed gas sealed in the air gun chamber is rapidly released into the water and four relatively independent small bubbles are formed near the air gun opening t 0 4 the four small bubbles are arranged tightly around the air gun body such that the combination of forms appears like a piece of garlic with four cloves as they rapidly expand outward the surfaces of the small bubbles gradually approach each other and begin to merge from the root although the bubbles remain divided into four parts their roots are completely merged at t 0 8 as the bubbles expand the four small bubbles finally merge into one large bubble which is nearly spherical as seen in the pressure contours in fig 5 the high flow field pressure gradually transfers from the bubble center to the far field between 0 and 6 0 when t 6 0 the pressure of the flow field around the bubble is much lower than that of the far field the bubble volume is nearly maximized the expansion speed is reduced to zero and the bubble is ready to collapse in the collapse stage the bubble volume gradually shrinks and the bubble shape gradually transitions from spherical to square t 6 0 9 0 however the presence of the gun body and opening causes the bubble surface to become gradually concave towards the four opening areas where it forms four clear water jets during the subsequent collapse as the bubble continues to collapse it moves gradually towards the bubble center and the high pressure area in the flow field gradually moves from the far field to the bubble surface at t 11 4 the bubble collapse speed is reduced to zero and the bubble volume is minimized thus the bubble is ready to start reverse movement 4 1 3 w 0 4 when the non dimensional air gun opening height h is kept constant at 0 8 and the non dimensional opening width w is reduced to 0 4 the horizontal velocity of the bubble ejected from the air gun opening is significantly greater than the vertical velocity the small bubble is longer along the opening direction than in the vertical direction as shown in fig 6 compared to the case where w 0 8 the four small bubbles coalescence later and the bubble surface is not smooth after coalescence as it contains an obvious fusion line the flow field pressure distribution around the bubble is not spherical similar to that caused by four independent pulsation bubbles cui et al 2016 in the collapse stage the peripheral flow field pressure is significantly higher than that around the bubble and the bubble surface is more concave at the opening in addition the bubble jet width becomes much smaller t 11 2 than in the case where w 0 8 4 1 4 bubble radius and fluid pressure fig 7 describes the temporal variations of the non dimensional maximum horizontal displacements of bubbles formed using a constant non dimensional air gun body opening height h of 0 8 and various opening widths w the non dimensional horizontal maximum displacement r of the bubble and the bubble pulsation period decrease with the opening width w decreasing the opening width w reduces the opening area and thus the gas in the air gun chamber is transferred slowly into the bubble this decreases the farthest distance that bubble can reach in the horizontal direction therefore the annular opening air gun produces the maximum horizontal displacement for a given opening height fig 8 shows temporal variation of the non dimensional flow field pressure caused by the air gun given a constant opening height h 0 8 and different opening widths w the flow field pressure measurement point is five times initial bubble radius 5r 0 from the bubble center the annular opening air gun obviously produces a larger primary pulse first peak on the pressure curve longer bubble pulse period and smaller bubble pulse second peak on pressure curve 4 2 cases of h 0 4 4 2 1 annular opening fig 9 shows air gun bubble pulsation when the non dimensional height of the annular opening h is reduced to 0 4 the decreased opening height slows the gas transfer speed from the air gun chamber to the inside of the bubble at the start t 0 4 the bubble moves faster in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction resulting in a flat thin annular shape however rapid expansion gradually causes the bubble to become spherical when t 6 0 the bubble volume approaches its maximum and the gun body passes vertically through the center of the bubble as the bubble collapses it adheres to the surface of the cylindrical gun body and the high pressure around it causes the bubble surface to become concave at the annular opening of the air gun 4 2 2 w 0 8 fig 10 shows bubble motion produced by a four opening air gun with h 0 4 and w 0 8 because the height is larger than the width the horizontal displacement of the small bubbles formed by the initial air gun exhaust is larger than the longitudinal displacement upon expansion the four small bubbles gradually merge into one large bubble the bubble gradually evolves from square to spherical during bubble collapse the external high pressure flow field moves the fluid backward to the bubble center of the air gun and the bubble presses tightly on the air gun body surface in the final stage of bubble collapse the bubble is clearly concave and forms four water jets that point toward the center of the air gun body 4 2 3 w 0 4 in fig 11 the non dimensional air gun opening height h is 0 4 and the width w is reduced to 0 4 after the air gun fires four small nearly conical bubbles form near the air gun opening as the gas inside the air gun chamber continues to exhaust the four small bubbles expand rapidly outwards and gradually approach each other the four small bubbles eventually merge into one large bubble before the bubble volume approaches its maximum t 6 0 at bubble collapse the presence of the air gun body and openings cause the bubble surface to become gradually concave in the four areas that face the openings thus forming four obvious water jets 4 2 4 bubble radius and fluid pressure fig 12 shows the temporal variations of the non dimensional maximum horizontal displacements formed using a constant air gun body opening height h of 0 4 and various opening widths w when w 0 4 the maximum horizontal bubble displacement appears to be clearly asymmetric during bubble expansion and contraction this may be mainly due to the slow exhaust rate dm dt where m is the mass of gas of the air gun with small openings that is substantial time is required for the gas in the air chamber to complete its flow into the bubble and the newly injected gas has horizontal velocity this continuously drives bubble development along the horizontal direction therefore the smallest opening area produces the bubble with the largest horizontal displacement and collapse period as seen from the temporal variation of the pressure wave measured at the point of five times initial bubble radius 5r 0 away from the bubble fig 13 the primary pulse decreases with the opening width w 5 discussion fig 14 depicts the variation of the non dimensional primary and bubble pulses with the air gun opening area the primary pulse increases with the opening area but also varies when the opening area is constant and the opening direction changes one can compare the cases where w 0 8 h 0 4 and w 0 4 h 0 8 the changes in the bubble pulse are complex but the pulse tends to increase with the opening area the complexity appears primarily because many factors affect the bubble pulse including the jet width velocity etc when more energy is consumed during bubble pulsation less energy is used to release the pressure pulse when the bubble volume is minimized 6 conclusions the research of air gun bubble is of great significance to expand its engineering application in order to analyze the dynamic behavior and pressure characteristics of air gun bubble in detail and quantitatively a three dimensional compressible model of air gun bubble is established in openfoam with the combination of the volume of fluid and finite volume methods good agreement is found between numerical and experimental results and the influences of various opening shapes and sizes on air gun bubble pulsation were investigated several rules are found the air gun gas exhaust rate was slow when the air gun opening area was small this hindered bubble

21089,this paper represents a numerical scale model of ice used to simulate the model experiment of ice ship and ice structure interaction scenarios the micro potential based peridynamic formulations proposed in 7 are used to simulate the deformation and fracture of model scale ice in this configuration a square measure of the bond length change is employed and validated with the finite element method and theoretical solution in present work different scale factors λ 10 20 40 and 50 are investigated and discussed concerning the m convergence δ convergence and the flexible strength of a

the linearity between macroscopic mechanical properties and the relative horizon size δ l is found keywords peridynamics convergence analysis flexible strength model scale ice 1 introduction the increasing frequency of transport and exploration activities in the arctic has increased the importance and demand for vessels and equipment in the ice covered region appropriate performance prediction methods are required for both economic driven arctic related research exploration construction and utilization as well as for the safety of the above operations ice going vessels as one of the candidates to support this enterprising activity xue and liu 2019 to optimize the performance of ice going vessels the semi empirical se formulations are usually employed to evaluate the ice loading in which ice physical parameters such as ice thickness poisson s ratio young s modulus ice density and main ship hull parameters are used to regression analysis of results from the model test experiment during the pre design stage the way these formulations determined boundaries their application fields vance 1980 zahn and phillips 1987 lindquist 1989 keinonen et al 1991 riska 1997 a comparison of ice resistance employing different se methods including model scale tests found that there was a significant constant temptation to over predict the transport efficiency concerning the simulation of an ice going tanker along the northern sea route von bock und polach et al 2015b the estimation of performance in the design stage has a significant effect on the ship construction and potential mispredictions probably lead to drastic financial loss on the one hand this emphasizes the importance of the ice tank model scale experiment and on the other hand the essential for practical numerical simulation methods von bock und polach et al 2015a in addition to the semi empirical formulations the numerical method is necessary because of the high cost and long period of model tests although the complete data on ice loads is rather precious there are still limitations generally the range of parameters is very narrow and on some occasions it is difficult to obtain definite data on the ice properties such as thickness strength friction therefore it is challenging to work out how the parameters influence ice loads by handling the full scale data a different type of data is obtained by numerical simulations on ice structure interaction in a statistical study based on simulation all the parameters used are clear and can change in correspondence with requirements besides it is not difficult to do simulations wherein the parameters only change slightly and thus obtain the results regarding how sensitive the process can be to the changes in parameters von bock and polach 2015 ranta et al 2017 cohesive zone model czm barenblatt 1959 1962 dugdale 1960 kuutti et al 2013 was formed initially to account for the softening behavior as crack propagation and to estimate the nonlinear stress field nearby the crack tip the fem and dem with cohesive elements manage to model the crack discretely i e the crack can only exist along discrete boundaries of the bulk discrete elements accordingly these methods are in their geometrical representation mesh dependent the structural stiffness softening is also observed with varying radial mesh size in the czm based simulation while the czm based simulation has an advantage over other methods in the way that the peak ice breaking loads stay rather stable with varying mesh size the discrete element method dem cundall 1971 cundall and strack 1979 tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 has advantages for modeling the discontinuous phase of the fracture process but accuracy problems during the continuous phase make it unreliable for modeling the whole process from continuous to discontinuous due to its independence from element grids during computation a mesh free method is suitable in the calculation of ice load and modeling icëcship interactions however it is challenging to embed the constitutive model of ice into the framework of dem a review for numerical simulation methods of shipcice interaction see xue et al 2020 peridynamics pd is a reformulation of the classical continuum mechanics ccm in this configuration a force density function exists for any pair of particles and it is assumed that the particles can interact with each other within a finite range which is named horizon the strain energy density at a material point is determined by the deformation of its neighborhood material points silling 2000 silling and askari 2005 silling et al 2007 madenci and oterkus 2014 different from ccm there is no necessity for a continuous field in the framework of pd due to this pd has superiority to deal with discontinuous issues such as crack and damage a couple of works were performed to calculate the ice loads and simulate the interaction of ice and ship structure using pd such as propeller ice

ospd theory is concisely introduced the fundamental derivations of mppd formulations are presented 2 1 ospd fundamental theory peridynamics is a reformulation of elasticity theory for discontinuities and long range forces whose discrete version may treat as a macroscale molecular dynamics in continuum situation silling 2000 the equation of motion for the particle marked as x in terms of its referential coordinates in the referential configuration at time t is 1 ρ x u x t h x t x t x x t x t x x d v x b x t where u is the acceleration vector ρ is the mass density h x is the horizon of x h x x b x x δ d v x is the volume associated with the particle x b denotes the body and δ is the radius of the horizon a positive constant t x t and t x t is the pair force density states at particles x and x respectively which are always parallel to the deformed bond but are not necessarily equal in magnitude for ospd theory the force state has the form as 2 t t m where m is a unit direction vector with m ξ η ξ η ξ is the relative position vectior ξ x x and η is the relative displacement vector η u u t presents the scale of the force state and for the plane stress it is given in le et al 2014

dilatation and e d is deviatoric part of the extension state 2 2 mppd formulation in the present analysis a second order deformation δ of the bond length is introduced in fan et al 2020 as 5 δ y ξ 2 ξ 2 where ξ is the bond length at the reference configuration y ξ is the bond deformation state in the current configuration in ccm theory the deformation state is connected to the undeformed bond length following the cauchy born rule as 6 y ξ f ξ where f is the deformation gradient replacing the deformation state in eq 5 with eq 6 we have 7 δ 2 ξ t e ξ in which e is the green st venant strain tensor also known as green lagrangian strain tensor defined as 8 e 1 2 f t f i or e k l 1 2 x i x k x i x l δ k l or described with the displacement gradient tensor 9 e 1 2 x u t x u x u t x u or in the index form 10 e k l 1 2 u k x l u l x k u m x k u m x l for plane strain and plane stress situations the green lagrangian strain tensor e with a matrix form is given as 11 e ε 11 ε 12 0 ε 21 ε 22

problems 13 ε 33 v 1 v ε 11 ε 22 θ 1 2 v 1 v ε 11 ε 22 e 33 1 3 1 v ε 11 ε 22 substituting eq 11 into eq 7 the second order deformation measure can be written as 14 δ δ v δ d where δ v denotes the volume deformation part and δ d presents the deviatoric deformation part and given as 15 δ v 2 θ 3 ξ 2 δ d 2 e i j ξ i ξ j in current mppd modeling generalized non local strain components ε i j were proposed which is different from the original ospd where the deformation state is the only one quantity available to measure deformation 16 ε i j 1 a h ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 2 ξ i ξ j ξ ξ 1 2 δ i j d s ξ where i j 1 2 a h ω ξ d s ξ which is applied to release the surface effect in numerical computation and d s ξ ξ d ξ d θ the equivalence of the non local strain parts and those in the ccm was proven in appendix a of fan et al 2020 with eq 16 we can describe the non local volumetric strain as 17 θ b a h ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 d s ξ with 18 b 1 2 v 1 v plane stress 1 plane strain therefore the non local deviatoric strain parts can be formed as 19 e i j 1 a h ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 2 ξ i ξ j ξ ξ 3 2 b 6 δ i j d s ξ as used in bond based peridynamics bpd the micro potential is stored in the bond while there are any changes about the bond length which contributes to the macroscopic non local elastic strain energy density nesed at one particle and it is defined as 20 w 1 2 h w η ξ d v ξ where the factor 1 2 represents one bond shared by two material points in the mppd modeling the second order deformation of bond can be decomposed into two components one is from the non local deviatoric strain and the other is from the non local volumetric strain it is similar to the ccm theory as the local strain is described by the deviatoric strain and volumetric strain with this the micro potential at particle x owning to the deformation state y ξ is given as 21 w x ξ y w ˆ δ v δ d where δ v δ v θ and δ d δ d e i j it should note that the micro potential is only dependent on the initial bond length and its stretch in the present mppd modeling the micro potential at particle not only relates to the initial bond length but also is depended on its orientation in the initial configuration besides the current micro potential is a functional of the deformation state y and it is determined by the collective deformation of particles in its horizon for mppd modeling the nesed of particle x can be obtained by taking integral of w over its horizon as 22 w h w x ξ y d v ξ compared with eq 20 there is no factor of 1 2 this is because w is the functional of the deformation state y ξ and the micro bond potential is only stored by particle x to obtain the constitutive model of mppd we first took the variation of the nesed in eq 22 as 23 δ w h δ w d v ξ t h w δ v δ δ v w δ d δ δ d d s ξ where t is the thickness for plane stress and plane strain situations it has the unit of one with eq 14 we have 24 δ δ d δ δ δ δ v substituting eq 24 into eq 23 we have 25 δ w t h w δ v w δ d δ δ v w δ d δ δ

d v ξ according to eq 5 the variation of the total bond length in the deformation configuration is given as 28 δ δ 2 y ξ δ y ξ substituting eqs 26 and 28 into eq 25 one has 29 δ w 4 b 3 a h w δ v w δ d ξ 2 d v ξ h ω β y β δ y β β β d s β 2 h w δ d y ξ δ y ξ d v ξ exchanging the dummy integral variables as ξ switching to β β switching to ξ in the first term at the right hand eq 29 can be rewritten as 30 δ w h 4 b 3 a ω ξ ξ 2 h w δ v w δ d β 2 d s β 2 w δ d y ξ δ y ξ d v ξ the constitutive relation can be obtained by taking the fréchet derivative of w 31 t f w x ξ y where the fréchet derivative is defined as 32 f w x ξ y w y δ y w y w y δ y o δ y where δ y is an increment in the deformation state δ y δ y δ y according to eq 32 the constitutive relation can be obtained as 33 t ξ 4 b 3 a ω ξ ξ 2 h w δ v w δ d β 2 d s β 2 w δ d ξ y ξ the force state in eq 33 can be decomposed as 34 t ξ t 1 ξ t 2 ξ with 35 t 1 ξ 4 b 3 a ω ξ ξ 2 h w δ v w d d β 2 d s β y ξ 36 t 2 ξ 2 w δ d ξ y ξ for geomaterials such as ice rocks ceramics and concrete the failure process is governed by cohesive fracture law to model the cohesive deformation the exponential exponential micro potential eemp function is adopted the bond force derived from the micro potential was discussed in xu and needleman 1994 fan et al 2020 37 w ˆ φ φ 1 ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 2 ξ δ d 2 where φ is a material constant with the dimension of mt 2 l 4 ω 1 ξ and ω 2 ξ are two scalar valued functions that need to meet the following conditions 38a φ h ω 1 2 ξ ξ 4 d v ξ μ 1 y 7 11 v 8 1 2 v 2 plane stress μ 7 4 v

the partial derivatives of the micro potential in eq 37 with respect to δ v and δ d we have 39 w ˆ δ v φ ω 1 2 ξ δ v exp ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 2 ξ δ d 2 40 w ˆ δ d 2 φ ω 2 2 ξ δ d 1 ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 2 ξ δ d 2 the constitutive model in present mppd based on the eemp can be derived by substituting eqs 39 and 40 into eqs 35 and 36 2 3 determination of bond parameters considering the application of exponential micro potential it is challenging to obtain a specific expression to describe the bond force density in general situations in present mppd modeling the plane stress scenario that the body deforms isotropically and homogeneously is analyzed first we have ε 11 x y ε 22 x y ε based on eq 15 the volume deformation part and the deviatoric deformation part of deformed bond length are calculated as 41 δ v 4 1 2 v ε 3 1 v ξ 2 δ d 2 1 v ε 3 1 v ξ 2 to be specific ω 1 ξ and ω 2 ξ are given as 42a ω 1 ξ 1 γ ε c ξ 2 t h d s ξ 42b ω 2 ξ 1 ζ ε c ξ 2 t h d s ξ where ε c is a material constant the critical uniaxial compressive strain γ and ζ are two dimensionless constants which can be obtained by combining eqs 38 and 42 as 43 φ γ 2 μ 1 v 7 11 v ε c 2 8 1 2 v 2 φ ζ 2 μ ε c 2 based on eq 43 we have 44 ζ 2 γ 2 1 v 7 11 v 8 1 2 v 2 substituting eqs 41 43 into eqs 39 and 40 we have 45 w ˆ δ v μ 1 v 7 11 v 6 1 v 1 2 v t h d s ξ 1 ξ 2 ψ 1 ε 46 w ˆ δ d 4 μ 1 v 3 1 v t h d s ξ

failure criterion in this section a failure criterion based on the energy was proposed for the present mppd model as shown in fig 1 a body b at the initial configuration ω 0 is transferred to the deformed body at the current configuration ω n with the deformation state y n the micro potential will generate with deformation and store in the deformed bond linking particle x and x the micro potential of the particle x is calculated by w x ξ y n and the micro potential of particle x is calculated by w x ξ y n the total micro potential owned by the deformed bond is calculated as 54 w x x y n w x ξ y n w x ξ y n as introduced in silling and askari 2005 the energy g 0 required to separate all the bonds per unit fracture area is given as 55 g 0 0 δ 0 t z δ 0 cos 1 z ξ w c d θ d ξ d x d z where w c the critical micro potential an illustration of this calculation is shown in fig 2 after computation of this integral the energy release rate is given by 56 g 0 2 δ 3 t w c 3 since the energy release rate can be obtained by experimental test for brittle materials solving eq 56 for w c yields 57 w c 3 g 0 2 δ 3 t in present fracture criterion a bond linking x and x will be failure forever as the total micro potential w x x y n is greater the critical micro potential w c to do this a history dependent scalar valued function is introduced as 58 μ x x t 1 w x x y n w c 0 otherwise peridynamics enables failure at the bond level with an unambiguous local damage ϕ at a material point x defined as 59 ϕ x t 1 h x μ x x t d v x h x d v x where 0 ϕ 1 0 means initial material and 1 represents all the connections of a material point and its neighborhood particles completely failed 3 numerical implementation based on the peridynamic formulation dr silling and his coworkers at the sandia national laboratories developed peridynamic computational framework that can be applied to investigate the deformation and fracture behavior of material and structure such as emu peridigm silling and askari 2005 parks et al 2012 littlewood 2016 in this section the numerical computational technique of peridynamics is briefly introduced see table 1 since the equation of motion for pd in an integro differential form it is a great challenge to find theoretical solutions therefore the numerical technique based on the spatially discrete scheme is performed to compute integral equations in the present pd model the meshfree collocation method one of the spatial discretization strategies is adopted since its simplicity in this framework the continuous body of interest is first discretized into a series of material points with definite bulk shapes processing spatial integration 3 1 discrete form of governing equations as one of the advantages of the meshless method it is no need to mesh in the pre processing stage i e spatial discretization as a non local theory the constitutive force model of pd naturally includes descriptions for damage and fracture therefore bypassing the ad hoc discontinuity assessment and mesh regeneration in the conventional finite element failure investigation in computations the pd equation of motion i e eq 53 is discretized into the series of discrete equations of motion for each material point 60 ρ i u x i t n j 1 n t x i t n ξ i j t x j t n ξ j i δ v x j b x i t n where n is the time step n represents the total number of neighborhood points of material point i and ξ i j x j x i the non local volumetric strain of mppd is calculated as 61 θ x i t n b a j 1 n ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 δ v x j α x j ξ where a j 1 n ω ξ δ v x j with eqs 61 and 7 we can calculate the deformed bond length components i e the volume deformation part and deviatoric deformation part respectively as defined in eqs 15 and 14 then calculate the micro potential as defined in eq 37 and with eq 54 to determine a bond is dead or not and calculate the bond force density defined in eqs 51 and 52 in the numerical computation the volume correction scheme proposed in liu and hong 2012 is applied in the present model as 62 α x j ξ δ ξ 0 5 δ x δ x if δ 0 5 δ x ξ δ 1 if ξ δ 0 5 δ x 0 otherwise with the volume correction the equation of motion is written as 63 ρ i u x i t n j 1 n t x i t n ξ i j t x j t n ξ j i α x j δ v x j b x i t n 3 2 time integration scheme in present work the velocity and displacement are updated using velocity verlet algorithm as 64 u x i t

explicit solution scheme is conditionally stable which means the maximum admissible time increment must be less than the time cost by the wave propagation to the smallest length of the element and the time taken is known as the stability time increment littlewood 2016 with the classical hypothesis of a von neumann stability analysis littlewood 2016 lapidus and pinder 2011 silling and askari 2005 a stability condition for the time increment used in equations 63 and 64 is given as 65 δ t 2 ρ x j h x v j c x j x i 3 3 modeling of three point bending of ice beam the ice three point bending experiment was conducted by ji et al 2011 with two supports on the bottom of the beam with a distance of l 0 0 6 m and a loading indenter in the middle of the beam the specimen has a length of l 0 75 m and the height of h 0 7 m in current mppd model the horizon size is δ 0 0015 m and the particle size d x δ 4 the ice material properties are listed as follows bulk modulus 1 7 gpa poissons ratio 0 33 and material density 917 kg m 3 the fracture toughness k i c 1 35 10 3 the loading indenter has a velocity of 0 00015 m s the specimen is loaded subsequently up to the crack initiation and propagation fig 3 displays the spatial distribution of the damage variable over the beam it shows that damage initiation occurs in the compression zone firstly after that the crack initiation and propagation in the tensile zone since the stress concentration in the contact regions and it is high enough to lead the failure in the compressive stress regime fig 4 shows the load displacement plot for the mppd results and the experimental data it can be found that once the crack initiates the load bearing capacity of the beam falls dramatically which shows the elastic brittle behavior in the current loading condition from fig 4 it shows that the numerical result of mppd is well consistent with the experimental data since the present mppd model can obtain acceptable results to capture the ice failure behavior 4 model scale ice to obtain a well understanding of material performance different scale specimen experiments are needed the development of numerical or physical models for ice or model scale ice is usually following froude s scaling rules model experimental equipment is applying different natures of model ice materials the existing model scale ice materials can not reflect all the mechanical properties of natural ice but also must consider the influence of the geometry of specimen on the model ice performance many measurements and standards used in the model ice experiment are described in ittc guidelines ittc and procedures 2014 the froude number and the cauchy number used here is originally based on the refs vance 1975 zufelt and ettema 1996 the froude similitude is implemented if gravitational and inertial forces are important i e the ice block is accelerated by the transported momentum of the vessels and submerged by gravitational force until the buoyant force recover its floating position vance 1975 froude similitude is recognized to be valid for usual ice ship interaction scenarios when the interaction speed is low such as drifting ice sheets interacting slowly with offshore structures inertial forces perform a trivial character atkins et al 1975 palmer et al 2009 as found in refs vance 1975 atkins et al 1975 zufelt and ettema 1996 palmer 2008 a

two kinds of convergence analysis i e m convergence and δ convergence for the m convergence analysis the horizon size δ is fixed and adjusts the value of m for the δ convergence analysis we fix the value of m and the horizon size δ is varied in our current work both the m and δ convergence analysis are studied with a cantilever beam in which one side is uniformly loaded with a concentrated force and the other side is fixed the geometrical dimension of the cantilever beam is presented in fig 5 the adaptive dynamic relaxation adr scheme is adopted in the present mppd model which is efficiently to find the solution to quasi static problems three dominant particles equally distributed along the length direction on the top surface of the cantilever beam labeled as p 1 p 2 p 3 respectively are chosen to investigate the m and δ convergence analysis the displacement in the hight directions of the chosen points p 1 p 2 p 3 are investigated comparing to the theoretical solutions for the m convergence study the value δ is set as 75 λ 120 λ 150 λ 300 λ mm and set m 3 4 5 6 respectively for the δ convergence study we fixed the value m 3 4 5 6 and set δ 75 λ 120 λ 150 λ 300 λ mm respectively the mechanical parameters of full scale ice are listed as follows bulk modulus 1 7 gpa poissons ratio 0 33 and material density 917 kg m 3 the length of the full scale model is l 8 0 m and the height is h 1 6 m the theoretical solution of deflection at any section in terms of the length direction is given as 70 y p x 2 6 e i 3 l x where p is total concentrated load i is the second

vertical displacement of chosen points for m 3 4 5 6 and the theoretical solutions are plotted in fig 12 a d respectively 5 4 2 m convergence to investigate the m convergence of the model scale ice λ 50 with mppd model four cases with different discretize parameters listed in table 9 are simulated the results of vertical displacement of chosen points for δ 1 5 2 4 3 0 6 0 mm and the theoretical solutions are plotted in fig 13 a d respectively 5 5 discussion it can be found from figs 6 8 10 and 12 that the numerical results from proposed mppd model shows well agreement with the theoretical solutions with all the scaling factor λ in all scale model simulations δ convergence and m convergence follow the same trend respectively for the δ convergence analysis with a fixed non local ratio m δ d x when the horizon size δ comes down the results from mppd are generally more consistent to the theoretical solutions however for m 4 it shows that the results from δ 150 0 λ mm are not so good as those results from δ 300 0 λ mm for m 5 it shows that the results from δ 150 0 λ mm are even more closer to the theoretical solutions than results from δ 120 0 λ mm the authors have not yet figured out the reason for these two inconsistent results moreover we can find that the ratio of convergence increases with the horizon size increases the authors think the critical convergence time step size leads to this trend as the critical convergence time step size decreases with the decrease of particle size in the present case the adr algorithm is used with the same time step size δ t 1 0 which means the larger the particle size the faster the convergence we should note that it is the horizon size that limits the maximum stable time increment rather than the grid spacing silling and askari 2005 in the m convergence for a fixed horizon size we can find from figs 7 9 11 and 13 that the horizontal displacement of chosen points from the mppd are more convergent to the theoretical solutions with increasing the nonlocal ratio m δ d x in all the scaling simulations it is suggested that m 4 can obtain an accurate solution with acceptable computational costs which is different with m 3 for bpd referred in silling and askari 2005 we should note that the convergence for m 5 is not consistent to the other nonlocal ratios we should also note that when the particle size is the same as d x 2 5 3 0 and 5 0 mm as highlight in table 3 for λ 10 d x 1 25 1 5 and 2 5 mm as highlight in table 5 for λ 20 d x 0 625 0 75 and 1 25 mm as highlight in table 7 for λ 40 d x 0 5 0 6 and 1 0 mm as highlight in table 9 for λ 50 the vertical displacement of particle p 1 the errors to the theoretical solutions are provided in tables 4 6 8 and 10 respectively it shows that with the same particle size the smaller the horizon size is the more accurate the calculation results will be it is different with other numerical methods mainly because of its nonlocal characteristics with the same particle size as shown in tables 3 and 5 d x 2 5 mm λ 10 and 20 and tables 5 and 7 d x 1 25 mm λ 20 and 40 as the scale model factor increases so does the calculation error in other words with the same discrete form of particles the calculation accuracy is relatively low in large scale cases 6 flexible strength of model scale ice to measure the flexural strength of an ice sheet the in situ cantilever beam experiment is the most popular and practical method a loading indenter tip with a constant speed is acted on the top of the cantilever beam until it fails the direction of the load can be downward or upward but it needs to be consistent with the bending direction anticipated in the design model test the suggested dimensions of a cantilever beam are l 5 7 h b 2 3 h where l is the beam length root to tip h is the thickness of the bean and b is the width of the beam the mechanical parameters of full scale ice are listed as follows fracture toughness k i c 100 j m 2 young s modulus 1 9 gpa poissons ratio 0 33 and material density 890 3 kg m 3 the length of full scale model is l 8 0 m and the hight is h 1 6 m the flexural strength σ f is determined by equation 71 based on the bernoulli beam theory timco 1981 and the corresponding beam parameters are shown in fig 14 71 σ f m w 6 f l b b h 2 where f is loading force measured l b is the length from the crack position to loading indenter ideally equal l in section5 the m 4 is suggested for present mppd model in this section the flexible strength of the cantilever beam and the relation between the strength and the ratio of the non local horizon size to the model length is investigated for different scale factors the damage contour of different cases are shown in figs 15 18 respectively it can be found that the smaller the δ the more details of crack capture 6 1 discussion since the explicit time integration scheme is adopted in the present mppd model the oscillations occur as calculating the interaction force the smoothness prior method spm was proposed in kitagawa and gersch 1996 is applied to obtain the data trend from the original data the curve of loading force versus loading displacement of the cantilever beam test and its smoothing and linearly fitting solutions are shown in fig 19 the curves of maximum loading force and vertical deflection calculated with the mppd model for different scale factors are shown in fig 20 for each scale factor the finest horizon size is used since the results are more closed to theoretical solutions as found in section5 fig 20 shown that once the damage occurs the load carrying capability of the cantilever beam falls sharply showing the damage response of the elastic brittle material the vertical displacements as failure occurs are 4 18e 04 2 08e 04 1 01e 04 and 8 14e 05 m respectively the strains as failure occurs are 2 61e 03 2 59e 03 2 54e 03 and 2 54e 03 respectively it can be found that the critical strain of flexible strength is about 2 75e 03 which is consistent with the value of less than 3 0e 3 in schulson and kuehn 1993 kuehn and schulson 1994 schulson and duval 2009 the flexible strength with different scale factors according to eq 71 and their errors to the full scale model are calculated as given in table 11 it is found that the mppd model shows a good numerical stability for different scale factors the horizon size is an important non local parameter of pd theory to investigate the influence of the horizon size on the computational results the dimensionless of this parameter i e the ratio of horizon size to the length of the model is analyzed and the results are shown in fig 21 the linear fitting equations for different scale factors are given as 72 f 8964 5502 δ l 168 060 λ 10 f 1181 065 δ l 42 922 λ 20 f 129 465 δ l 10 278 λ 40 f 73 862 δ l 6 585 λ 50 from the linear fitting of scatter points in fig 21 it can be found that the flexible strength decreases linearly as the relative horizon size δ l increases for all the scale factors this character of the horizon size has not been discussed in other available published literature therefore it is reasonable to accept the macroscopic mechanical properties of the ice will decrease linearly as the relative horizon size δ l increases and approach their critical values i e the intercepts in fig 21 with δ l small enough with equation 71 the flexible strength σ f for each scale factor is calculated as 3 15e 04 1 61e 04 7 71e 03 and 6 17e 03 pa respectively for λ 50 the strength is about 10 kpa in huang et al 2016 and it shows the result from mppd is agreeable it can be found that the flexible strengths for different scale factors follow the froude similitude law in section4 which shows that the mppd model is robust however we need to note that if we want to obtain accurate bending strength the size of the horizon should be small enough taking the scale factor of 50 as an example the length of the chinese polar research ship xuelong is 147 2 m and the width is 22 6 m and the dimensions after scaling are 2 944 0 452 m the thickness of the model scale ice is 0 024 m the length and width are 3 5 m and 1 0 m respectively if we choose the horizon size is 0 0015 m the ice is discretized into 9333 2667 64 with 1 593 088 000 particles which is unacceptable for existing computers to perform if it is discretized into 5 particles in the thickness direction i e the ice is discretized into 729 208 5 with 758 333 particles this can be achieved for the general laptop to do this one candidate is to modify the critical failure energy of the bond to ensure that the mechanical properties of the model ice are correct 7 conclusions in this work the mppd model is used to investigate the m convergence δ convergence and the flexible strength of a model scale ice cantilever beam with different scale factors the influence of the relative horizon size δ l on the flexible strength is also analyzed for the convergence analysis it suggested that m 4 can obtain an accurate solution with acceptable computational costs with the same particle size the finer the horizon size is the more accurate the calculation results will be in other words with the same discrete form of particles the calculation accuracy is relatively low in large model scale cases the critical strain of flexible strength obtained by the present model was consistent with the value of published references the relative horizon size δ l has an important influence on the flexible strength it found that there is linearity between macroscopic mechanical properties and the relative horizon size to obtain a more accurate flexible strength the size of the horizon should be small enough but this will dramatically increase the computational time in this case the computer available can not meet the application of the engineering scale an alternative solution is to increase the value of m while introducing remedies to the critical stretch to obtain

21089,this paper represents a numerical scale model of ice used to simulate the model experiment of ice ship and ice structure interaction scenarios the micro potential based peridynamic formulations

the linearity between macroscopic mechanical properties and the relative horizon size δ l is found keywords peridynamics convergence analysis flexible strength model scale ice 1 introduction the increasing frequency of transport and exploration activities in the arctic has increased the importance and demand for vessels and equipment in the ice covered region appropriate performance prediction methods are required for both economic driven arctic related research exploration construction and utilization as well as for the safety of the above operations ice going vessels as one of the candidates to support this enterprising activity xue and liu 2019 to optimize the performance of ice going vessels the semi empirical se formulations are usually employed to evaluate the ice loading in which ice physical parameters such as ice thickness poisson s ratio young s modulus ice density and main ship hull parameters are used to regression analysis of results from the model test experiment during the pre design stage the way these formulations determined boundaries their application fields vance 1980 zahn and phillips 1987 lindquist 1989 keinonen et al 1991 riska 1997 a comparison of ice resistance employing different se methods including model scale tests found that there was a significant constant temptation to over predict the transport efficiency concerning the simulation of an ice going tanker along the northern sea route von bock und polach et al 2015b the estimation of performance in the design stage has a significant effect on the ship construction and potential mispredictions probably lead to drastic financial loss on the one hand this emphasizes the importance of the ice tank model scale experiment and on the other hand the essential for practical numerical simulation methods von bock und polach et al 2015a in addition to the semi empirical formulations the numerical method is necessary because of the high cost and long period of model tests although the complete data on ice loads is rather precious there are still limitations generally the range of parameters is very narrow and on some occasions it is difficult to obtain definite data on the ice properties such as thickness strength friction therefore it is challenging to work out how the parameters influence ice loads by handling the full scale data a different type of data is obtained by numerical simulations on ice structure interaction in a statistical study based on simulation all the parameters used are clear and can change in correspondence with requirements besides it is not difficult to do simulations wherein the parameters only change slightly and thus obtain the results regarding how sensitive the process can be to the changes in parameters von bock and polach 2015 ranta et al 2017 cohesive zone model czm barenblatt 1959 1962 dugdale 1960 kuutti et al 2013 was formed initially to account for the softening behavior as crack propagation and to estimate the nonlinear stress field nearby the crack tip the fem and dem with cohesive elements manage to model the crack discretely i e the crack can only exist along discrete boundaries of the bulk discrete elements accordingly these methods are in their geometrical representation mesh dependent the structural stiffness softening is also observed with varying radial mesh size in the czm based simulation while the czm based simulation has an advantage over other methods in the way that the peak ice breaking loads stay rather stable with varying mesh size the discrete element method dem cundall 1971 cundall and strack 1979 tuhkuri and polojärvi 2018 has advantages for modeling the discontinuous phase of the fracture process but accuracy problems during the continuous phase make it unreliable for modeling the whole process from continuous to discontinuous due to its independence from element grids during computation a mesh free method is suitable in the calculation of ice load and modeling icëcship interactions however it is challenging to embed the constitutive model of ice into the framework of dem a review for numerical simulation methods of shipcice interaction see xue et al 2020 peridynamics pd is a reformulation of the classical continuum mechanics ccm in this configuration a force density function exists for any pair of particles and it is assumed that the particles can interact with each other within a finite range which is named horizon the strain energy density at a material point is determined by the deformation of its neighborhood material points silling 2000 silling and askari 2005 silling et al 2007 madenci and oterkus 2014 different from ccm there is no necessity for a continuous field in the framework of pd due to this pd has superiority to deal with discontinuous issues such as crack and damage a couple of works were performed to calculate the ice loads and simulate the interaction of ice and ship structure using pd such as propeller ice interactions ye et al 2017 2018a 2018b 2019 wang et al 2018a xiong and chao 2018 xiong et al 2019 ship ice interactions liu et al 2018 xue et al 2019 ice sloping or cylindrical structure interactions

et al 2019 however there are no systematic investigations on the convergence analysis and bending strength of model scale ice in this work the numerical model scale ice was studied to gain insight into its mechanical behavior and to set a fundamental preparation for later model scale simulations of ice and ship structure following the introduction the micro potential based peridynamics mppd formulation is described in section 2 in section 3 the numerical implementation of the mppd model is introduced the froude similitude used in model scale ice is presented in section 4 convergence analysis of the cantilever beam i e m convergence and δ convergence is presented in section 5 the flexible strength of model scale ice and the dimensionless analysis of the horizon size to the length of the model are presented in section 6 finally the conclusions based on the findings of this work are given in section 7 2 peridynamics theory in this section the ordinary state based peridynamics ospd theory is concisely introduced the fundamental derivations of mppd formulations are presented 2 1 ospd fundamental theory peridynamics is a reformulation of elasticity theory for discontinuities and long range forces whose discrete version may treat as a macroscale molecular dynamics in continuum situation silling 2000 the equation of motion for the particle marked as x in terms of its referential coordinates in the referential configuration at time t is 1 ρ x u x t h x t x t x x t x t x x d v x b x t where u is the acceleration vector ρ is the mass density h x is the horizon of x h x x b x x δ d v x is the volume associated with the particle x b denotes the body and δ is the radius of the horizon a positive constant t x t and t x t is the pair force density states at particles x and x respectively which are always parallel to the deformed bond but are not necessarily equal in magnitude for ospd theory the force state has the form as 2 t t m where m is a unit direction vector with m ξ η ξ η ξ is the relative position vectior ξ x x and η is the relative displacement vector η u u t presents the scale of the force state and for the plane stress it is given in le et al 2014 imachi et al 2019 3 t 2 2 v 1 v 1 κ θ α 3 ω e d ξ ω ξ ω ξ ξ α ω e d θ 2 2 v 1 v 1 ω ξ e ω ξ ξ α 8 g ω ξ ξ κ k g ν 1 2 9 2 ν 1 2 and for the plane strain as 4 t 2 κ θ α 3 ω e d ξ ω ξ ω ξ ξ α ω e d θ 2 ω ξ e ω ξ ξ α 8 g ω ξ ξ κ k g 9 where ω is an influence function depending on the distance between particles g and k and ν are shear modulus bulk modulus and poissons ratio respectively θ is nonlocal dilatation and e d is deviatoric part of the extension state 2 2 mppd formulation in the present analysis a second order deformation δ of the bond length is introduced in fan et al 2020 as 5 δ y ξ 2 ξ 2 where ξ is the bond length at the reference configuration y ξ is the bond deformation state in the current configuration in ccm theory the deformation state is connected to the undeformed bond length following the cauchy born rule as 6 y ξ f ξ where f is the deformation gradient replacing the deformation state in eq 5 with eq 6 we have 7 δ 2 ξ t e ξ in which e is the green st venant strain tensor also known as green lagrangian strain tensor defined as 8 e 1 2 f t f i or e k l 1 2 x i x k x i x l δ k l or described with the displacement gradient tensor 9 e 1 2 x u t x u x u t x u or in the index form 10 e k l 1 2 u k x l u l x k u m x k u m x l for plane strain and plane stress situations the green lagrangian strain tensor e with a matrix form is given as 11 e ε 11 ε 12 0 ε 21 ε 22 0 0 0 ε 33 θ 3 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 e 11 e 12 0 e 21 e 22 0 0 0 e 33 in which e i j ε i j 1 3 θ δ i j i j 1 2 for plane strain problems 12 ε 33 0 θ ε 11 ε 22 e 33 1 3 ε 11 ε 22 and for plane stress problems 13 ε 33 v 1 v ε 11 ε 22 θ 1 2 v 1 v ε 11 ε 22 e 33 1 3 1 v ε 11 ε 22 substituting eq 11 into eq 7 the second order deformation measure can be written as 14 δ δ v δ d where δ v denotes the volume deformation part and δ d presents the deviatoric deformation part and given as 15 δ v 2 θ 3 ξ 2 δ d 2 e i j ξ i ξ j in current mppd modeling generalized non local strain components ε i j were proposed which is different from the original ospd where the deformation state is the only one quantity available to measure deformation 16 ε i j 1 a h ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 2 ξ i ξ j ξ ξ 1 2 δ i j d s ξ where i j 1 2 a h ω ξ d s ξ which is applied to release the surface effect in numerical computation and d s ξ ξ d ξ d θ the equivalence of the non local strain parts and those in the ccm was proven in appendix a of fan et al 2020 with eq 16 we can describe the non local volumetric strain as 17 θ b a h ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 d s ξ with 18 b 1 2 v 1 v plane stress 1 plane strain therefore the non local deviatoric strain parts can be formed as 19 e i j 1 a h ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 2 ξ i ξ j ξ ξ 3 2 b 6 δ i j d s ξ as used in bond based peridynamics bpd the micro potential is stored in the bond while there are any changes about the bond length which contributes to the macroscopic non local elastic strain energy density nesed at one particle and it is defined as 20 w 1 2 h w η ξ d v ξ where the factor 1 2 represents one bond shared by two material points in the mppd modeling the second order deformation of bond can be decomposed into two components one is from the non local deviatoric strain and the other is from the non local volumetric strain it is similar to the ccm theory as the local strain is described by the deviatoric strain and volumetric strain with this the micro potential at particle x owning to the deformation state y ξ is given as 21 w x ξ y w ˆ δ v δ d where δ v δ v θ and δ d δ d e i j it should note that the micro potential is only dependent on the initial bond length and its stretch in the present mppd modeling the micro potential at particle not only relates to the initial bond length but also is depended on its orientation in the initial configuration besides the current micro potential is a functional of the deformation state y and it is determined by the collective deformation of particles in its horizon for mppd modeling the nesed of particle x can be obtained by taking integral of w over its horizon as 22 w h w x ξ y d v ξ compared with eq 20 there is no factor of 1 2 this is because w is the functional of the deformation state y ξ and the micro bond potential is only stored by particle x to obtain the constitutive model of mppd we first took the variation of the nesed in eq 22 as 23 δ w h δ w d v ξ t h w δ v δ δ v w δ d δ δ d d s ξ where t is the thickness for plane stress and plane strain situations it has the unit of one with eq 14 we have 24 δ δ d δ δ δ δ v substituting eq 24 into eq 23 we have 25 δ w t h w δ v w δ d δ δ v w δ d δ δ d s ξ with eqs 15 and 17 the variation of δ v can be derived as 26 δ δ v 2 ξ 2 3 δ θ 4 b 3 a ξ 2 h ω β y β δ y β β β d s β where the dot product of two states a and b is used defined by 27 a b h a b ξ d v ξ according to eq 5 the variation of the total bond length in the deformation configuration is given as 28 δ δ 2 y ξ δ y ξ substituting eqs 26 and 28 into eq 25 one has 29 δ w 4 b 3 a h w δ v w δ d ξ 2 d v ξ h ω β y β δ y β β β d s β 2 h w δ d y ξ δ y ξ d v ξ exchanging the dummy integral variables as ξ switching to β β switching to ξ in the first term at the right hand eq 29 can be rewritten as 30 δ w h 4 b 3 a ω ξ ξ 2 h w δ v w δ d β 2 d s β 2 w δ d y ξ δ y ξ d v ξ the constitutive relation can be obtained by taking the fréchet derivative of w 31 t f w x ξ y where the fréchet derivative is defined as 32 f w x ξ y w y δ y w y w y δ y o δ y where δ y is an increment in the deformation state δ y δ y δ y according to eq 32 the constitutive relation can be obtained as 33 t ξ 4 b 3 a ω ξ ξ 2 h w δ v w δ d β 2 d s β 2 w δ d ξ y ξ the force state in eq 33 can be decomposed as 34 t ξ t 1 ξ t 2 ξ with 35 t 1 ξ 4 b 3 a ω ξ ξ 2 h w δ v w d d β 2 d s β y ξ 36 t 2 ξ 2 w δ d ξ y ξ for geomaterials such as ice rocks ceramics and concrete the failure process is governed by cohesive fracture law to model the cohesive deformation the exponential exponential micro potential eemp function is adopted the bond force derived from the micro potential was discussed in xu and needleman 1994 fan et al 2020 37 w ˆ φ φ 1 ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 2 ξ δ d 2 where φ is a material constant with the dimension of mt 2 l 4 ω 1 ξ and ω 2 ξ are two scalar valued functions that need to meet the following conditions 38a φ h ω 1 2 ξ ξ 4 d v ξ μ 1 y 7 11 v 8 1 2 v 2 plane stress μ 7 4 v 8 1 2 v plane strain 38b φ h ω 2 2 ξ ξ 4 d v ξ μ the nesed s equivalence to the linearly elastic strain energy density under infinitesimal deformation was proved in appendix b of fan et al 2020 taking the partial derivatives of the micro potential in eq 37 with respect to δ v and δ d we have 39 w ˆ δ v φ ω 1 2 ξ δ v exp ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 2 ξ δ d 2 40 w ˆ δ d 2 φ ω 2 2 ξ δ d 1 ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 1 ξ δ v exp ω 2 ξ δ d 2 the constitutive model in present mppd based on the eemp can be derived by substituting eqs 39 and 40 into eqs 35 and 36 2 3 determination of bond parameters considering the application of exponential micro potential it is challenging to obtain a specific expression to describe the bond force density in general situations in present mppd modeling the plane stress scenario that the body deforms isotropically and homogeneously is analyzed first we have ε 11 x y ε 22 x y ε based on eq 15 the volume deformation part and the deviatoric deformation part of deformed bond length are calculated as 41 δ v 4 1 2 v ε 3 1 v ξ 2 δ d 2 1 v ε 3 1 v ξ 2 to be specific ω 1 ξ and ω 2 ξ are given as 42a ω 1 ξ 1 γ ε c ξ 2 t h d s ξ 42b ω 2 ξ 1 ζ ε c ξ 2 t h d s ξ where ε c is a material constant the critical uniaxial compressive strain γ and ζ are two dimensionless constants which can be obtained by combining eqs 38 and 42 as 43 φ γ 2 μ 1 v 7 11 v ε c 2 8 1 2 v 2 φ ζ 2 μ ε c 2 based on eq 43 we have 44 ζ 2 γ 2 1 v 7 11 v 8 1 2 v 2 substituting eqs 41 43 into eqs 39 and 40 we have 45 w ˆ δ v μ 1 v 7 11 v 6 1 v 1 2 v t h d s ξ 1 ξ 2 ψ 1 ε 46 w ˆ δ d 4 μ 1 v 3 1 v t h d s ξ

failure criterion in this section a failure criterion based on the energy was proposed for the present mppd model as shown in fig 1 a body b at the initial configuration ω 0 is transferred to the deformed body at the current configuration ω n with the deformation state y n the micro potential will generate with deformation and store in the deformed bond linking particle x and x the micro potential of the particle x is calculated by w x ξ y n and the micro potential of particle x is calculated by w x ξ y n the total micro potential owned by the deformed bond is calculated as 54 w x x y n w x ξ y n w x ξ y n as introduced in silling and askari 2005 the energy g 0 required to separate all the bonds per unit fracture area is given as 55 g 0 0 δ 0 t z δ 0 cos 1 z ξ w c d θ d ξ d x d z where w c the critical micro potential an illustration of this calculation is shown in fig 2 after computation of this integral the energy release rate is given by 56 g 0 2 δ 3 t w c 3 since the energy release rate can be obtained by experimental test for brittle materials solving eq 56 for w c yields 57 w c 3 g 0 2 δ 3 t in present fracture criterion a bond linking x and x will be failure forever as the total micro potential w x x y n is greater the critical micro potential w c to do this a history dependent scalar valued function is introduced as 58 μ x x t 1 w x x y n w c 0 otherwise peridynamics enables failure at the bond level with an unambiguous local damage ϕ at a material point x defined as 59 ϕ x t 1 h x μ x x t d v x h x d v x where 0 ϕ 1 0 means initial material and 1 represents all the connections of a material point and its neighborhood particles completely failed 3 numerical implementation based on the peridynamic formulation dr silling and his coworkers at the sandia national laboratories developed peridynamic computational framework that can be applied to investigate the deformation and fracture behavior of material and structure such as emu peridigm silling and askari 2005 parks et al 2012 littlewood 2016 in this section the numerical computational technique of peridynamics is briefly introduced see table 1 since the equation of motion for pd in an integro differential form it is a great challenge to find theoretical solutions therefore the numerical technique based on the spatially discrete scheme is performed to compute integral equations in the present pd model the meshfree collocation method one of the spatial discretization strategies is adopted since its simplicity in this framework the continuous body of interest is first discretized into a series of material points with definite bulk shapes processing spatial integration 3 1 discrete form of governing equations as one of the advantages of the meshless method it is no need to mesh in the pre processing stage i e spatial discretization as a non local theory the constitutive force model of pd naturally includes descriptions for damage and fracture therefore bypassing the ad hoc discontinuity assessment and mesh regeneration in the conventional finite element failure investigation in computations the pd equation of motion i e eq 53 is discretized into the series of discrete equations of motion for each material point 60 ρ i u x i t n j 1 n t x i t n ξ i j t x j t n ξ j i δ v x j b x i t n where n is the time step n represents the total number of neighborhood points of material point i and ξ i j x j x i the non local volumetric strain of mppd is calculated as 61 θ x i t n b a j 1 n ω ξ y ξ y ξ ξ ξ 1 δ v x j α x j ξ where a j 1 n ω ξ δ v x j with eqs 61 and 7 we can calculate the deformed bond length components i e the volume deformation part and deviatoric deformation part respectively as defined in eqs 15 and 14 then calculate the micro potential as defined in eq 37 and with eq 54 to determine a bond is dead or not and calculate the bond force density defined in eqs 51 and 52 in the numerical computation the volume correction scheme proposed in liu and hong 2012 is applied in the present model as 62 α x j ξ δ ξ 0 5 δ x δ x if δ 0 5 δ x ξ δ 1 if ξ δ 0 5 δ x 0 otherwise with the volume correction the equation of motion is written as 63 ρ i u x i t n j 1 n t x i t n ξ i j t x j t n ξ j i α x j δ v x j b x i t n 3 2 time integration scheme in present work the velocity and displacement are updated using velocity verlet algorithm as 64 u x i t

experiment was conducted by ji et al 2011 with two supports on the bottom of the beam with a distance of l 0 0 6 m and a loading indenter in the middle of the beam the specimen has a length of l 0 75 m and the height of h 0 7 m in current mppd model the horizon size is δ 0 0015 m and the particle size d x δ 4 the ice material properties are listed as follows bulk modulus 1 7 gpa poissons ratio 0 33 and material density 917 kg m 3 the fracture toughness k i c 1 35 10 3 the loading indenter has a velocity of 0 00015 m s the specimen is loaded subsequently up to the crack initiation and propagation fig 3 displays the spatial distribution of the damage variable over the beam it shows that damage initiation occurs in the compression zone firstly after that the crack initiation and propagation in the tensile zone since the stress concentration in the contact regions and it is high enough to lead the failure in the compressive stress regime fig 4 shows the load displacement plot for the mppd results and the experimental data it can be found that once the crack initiates the load bearing capacity of the beam falls dramatically which shows the elastic brittle behavior in the current loading condition from fig 4 it shows that the numerical result of mppd is well consistent with the experimental data since the present mppd model can obtain acceptable results to capture the ice failure behavior 4 model scale ice to obtain a well understanding of material performance different scale specimen experiments are needed the development of numerical or physical models for ice or model scale ice is usually following froude s scaling rules model experimental equipment is applying different natures of model ice materials the existing model scale ice materials can not reflect all the mechanical properties of natural ice but also must consider the influence of the geometry of specimen on the model ice performance many measurements and standards used in the model ice experiment are described in ittc guidelines ittc and procedures 2014 the froude number and the cauchy number used here is originally based on the refs vance 1975 zufelt and ettema 1996 the froude similitude is implemented if gravitational and inertial forces are important i e the ice block is accelerated by the transported momentum of the vessels and submerged by gravitational force until the buoyant force recover its floating position vance 1975 froude similitude is recognized to be valid for usual ice ship interaction scenarios when the interaction speed is low such as drifting ice sheets interacting slowly with offshore structures inertial forces perform a trivial character atkins et al 1975 palmer et al 2009 as found in refs vance 1975 atkins et al 1975 zufelt and ettema 1996 palmer 2008 a

two kinds of convergence analysis i e m convergence and δ convergence for the m convergence analysis the horizon size δ is fixed and adjusts the value of m for the δ convergence analysis we fix the value of m and the horizon size δ is varied in our current work both the m and δ convergence analysis are studied with a cantilever beam in which one side is uniformly loaded with a concentrated force and the other side is fixed the geometrical dimension of the cantilever beam is presented in fig 5 the adaptive dynamic relaxation adr scheme is adopted in the present mppd model which is efficiently to find the solution to quasi static problems three dominant particles equally distributed along the length direction on the top surface of the cantilever beam labeled as p 1 p 2 p 3 respectively are chosen to investigate the m and δ convergence analysis the displacement in the hight directions of the chosen points p 1 p 2 p 3 are investigated comparing to the theoretical solutions for the m convergence study the value δ is set as 75 λ 120 λ 150 λ 300 λ mm and set m 3 4 5 6 respectively for the δ convergence study we fixed the value m 3 4 5 6 and set δ 75 λ 120 λ 150 λ 300 λ mm respectively the mechanical parameters of full scale ice are listed as follows bulk modulus 1 7 gpa poissons ratio 0 33 and material density 917 kg m 3 the length of the full scale model is l 8 0 m and the height is h 1 6 m the theoretical solution of deflection at any section in terms of the length direction is given as 70 y p x 2 6 e i 3 l x where p is total concentrated load i is the second

solutions are plotted in fig 13 a d respectively 5 5 discussion it can be found from figs 6 8 10 and 12 that the numerical results from proposed mppd model shows well agreement with the theoretical solutions with all the scaling factor λ in all scale model simulations δ convergence and m convergence follow the same trend respectively for the δ convergence analysis with a fixed non local ratio m δ d x when the horizon size δ comes down the results from mppd are generally more consistent to the theoretical solutions however for m 4 it shows that the results from δ 150 0 λ mm are not so good as those results from δ 300 0 λ mm for m 5 it shows that the results from δ 150 0 λ mm are even more closer to the theoretical solutions than results from δ 120 0 λ mm the authors have not yet figured out the reason for these two inconsistent results moreover we can find that the ratio of convergence increases with the horizon size increases the authors think the critical convergence time step size leads to this trend as the critical convergence time step size decreases with the decrease of particle size in the present case the adr algorithm is used with the same time step size δ t 1 0 which means the larger the particle size the faster the convergence we should note that it is the horizon size that limits the maximum stable time increment rather than the grid spacing silling and askari 2005 in the m convergence for a fixed horizon size we can find from figs 7 9 11 and 13 that the horizontal displacement of chosen points from the mppd are more convergent to the theoretical solutions with increasing the nonlocal ratio m δ d x in all the scaling simulations it is suggested that m 4 can obtain an accurate solution with acceptable computational costs which is different with m 3 for bpd referred in silling and askari 2005 we should note that the convergence for m 5 is not consistent to the other nonlocal ratios we should also note that when the particle size is the same as d x 2 5 3 0 and 5 0 mm as highlight in table 3 for λ 10 d x 1 25 1 5 and 2 5 mm as highlight in table 5 for λ 20 d x 0 625 0 75 and 1 25 mm as highlight in table 7 for λ 40 d x 0 5 0 6 and 1 0 mm as highlight in table 9 for λ 50 the vertical displacement of particle p 1 the errors to the theoretical solutions are provided in tables 4 6 8 and 10 respectively it shows that with the same particle size the smaller the horizon size is the more accurate the calculation results will be it is different with other numerical methods mainly because of its nonlocal characteristics with the same particle size as shown in tables 3 and 5 d x 2 5 mm λ 10 and 20 and tables 5 and 7 d x 1 25 mm λ 20 and 40 as the scale model factor increases so does the calculation error in other words with the same discrete form of particles the calculation accuracy is relatively low in large scale cases 6 flexible strength of model scale ice to measure the flexural strength of an ice sheet the in situ cantilever beam experiment is the most popular and practical method a loading indenter tip with a constant speed is acted on the top of the cantilever beam until it fails the direction of the load can be downward or upward but it needs to be consistent with the bending direction anticipated in the design model test the suggested dimensions of a cantilever beam are l 5 7 h b 2 3 h where l is the beam length root to tip h is the thickness of the bean and b is the width of the beam the mechanical parameters of full scale ice are listed as follows fracture toughness k i c 100 j m 2 young s modulus 1 9 gpa poissons ratio 0 33 and material density 890 3 kg m 3 the length of full scale model is l 8 0 m and the hight is h 1 6 m the flexural strength σ f is determined by equation 71 based on the bernoulli beam theory timco 1981 and the corresponding beam parameters are shown in fig 14 71 σ f m w 6 f l b b h 2 where f is loading force measured l b is the length from the crack position to loading indenter ideally equal l in section5 the m 4 is suggested for present mppd model in this section the flexible strength of the cantilever beam and the relation between the strength and the ratio of the non local horizon size to the model length is investigated for different scale factors the damage contour of different cases are shown in figs 15 18 respectively it can be found that the smaller the δ the more details of crack capture 6 1 discussion since the explicit time integration scheme is adopted in the present mppd model the oscillations occur as calculating the interaction force the smoothness prior method spm was proposed in kitagawa and gersch 1996 is applied to obtain the data trend from the original data the curve of loading force versus loading displacement of the cantilever beam test and its smoothing and linearly fitting solutions are shown in fig 19 the curves of maximum loading force and vertical deflection calculated with the mppd model for different scale factors are shown in fig 20 for each scale factor the finest horizon size is used since the results are more closed to theoretical solutions as found in section5 fig 20 shown that once the damage occurs the load carrying capability of the cantilever beam falls sharply showing the damage response of the elastic brittle material the vertical displacements as failure occurs are 4 18e 04 2 08e 04 1 01e 04 and 8 14e 05 m respectively the strains as failure occurs are 2 61e 03 2 59e 03 2 54e 03 and 2 54e 03 respectively it can be found that the critical strain of flexible strength is about 2 75e 03 which is consistent with the value of less than 3 0e 3 in schulson and kuehn 1993 kuehn and schulson 1994 schulson and duval 2009 the flexible strength with different scale factors according to eq 71 and their errors to the full scale model are calculated as given in table 11 it is found that the mppd model shows a good numerical stability for different scale factors the horizon size is an important non local parameter of pd theory to investigate the influence of the horizon size on the computational results the dimensionless of this parameter i e the ratio of horizon size to the length of the model is analyzed and the results are shown in fig 21 the linear fitting equations for different scale factors are given as 72 f 8964 5502 δ l 168 060 λ 10 f 1181 065 δ l 42 922 λ 20 f 129 465 δ l 10 278 λ 40 f 73 862 δ l 6 585 λ 50 from the linear fitting of scatter points in fig 21 it can be found that the flexible strength decreases linearly as the relative horizon size δ l increases for all the scale factors this character of the horizon size has not been discussed in other available published literature therefore it is reasonable to accept the macroscopic mechanical properties of the ice will decrease linearly as the relative horizon size δ l increases and approach their critical values i e the intercepts in fig 21 with δ l small enough with equation 71 the flexible strength σ f for each scale factor is calculated as 3 15e 04 1 61e 04 7 71e 03 and 6 17e 03 pa respectively for λ 50 the strength is about 10 kpa in huang et al 2016 and it shows the result from mppd is agreeable it can be found that the flexible strengths for different scale factors follow the froude similitude law in section4 which shows that the mppd model is robust however we need to note that if we want to obtain accurate bending strength the size of the horizon should be small enough taking the scale factor of 50 as an example the length of the chinese polar research ship xuelong is 147 2 m and the width is 22 6 m and the dimensions after scaling are 2 944 0 452 m the thickness of the model scale ice is 0 024 m the length and width are 3 5 m and 1 0 m respectively if we choose the horizon size is 0 0015 m the ice is discretized into 9333 2667 64 with 1 593 088 000 particles which is unacceptable for existing computers to perform if it is discretized into 5 particles in the thickness direction i e the ice is discretized into 729 208 5 with 758 333 particles this can be achieved for the general laptop to do this one candidate is to modify the critical failure energy of the bond to ensure that the mechanical properties of the model ice are correct 7 conclusions in this work the mppd model is used to investigate the m convergence δ convergence and the flexible strength of a model scale ice cantilever beam with different scale factors the influence of the relative horizon size δ l on the flexible strength is also analyzed for the convergence analysis it suggested that m 4 can obtain an accurate solution with acceptable computational costs with the same particle size the finer the horizon size is the more accurate the calculation results will be in other words with the same discrete form of particles the calculation accuracy is relatively low in large model scale cases the critical strain of flexible strength obtained by the present model was consistent with the value of published references the relative horizon size δ l has an important influence on the flexible strength it found that there is linearity between macroscopic mechanical properties and the relative horizon size to obtain a more accurate flexible strength the size of the horizon should be small enough but this will dramatically increase the computational time in this case the computer available can not meet the application of the engineering scale an alternative solution is to increase the value of m while introducing remedies to the critical stretch to obtain convincing the mechanical properties of the corresponding model scale ice credit authorship contribution statement renwei liu conceptualization methodology investigation programing visualization
