20505,structural damage accidents that lead to disastrous results are an important problem in the maritime industry however as a sectoral requirement factors causing break in two accident of ships are not clearly defined in this study an alternative risk analysis approach based on 18 factors that trigger ship structural damage was presented in order to prevent break in two accident of ships these factors were determined by using literature review and they were analyzed using fuzzy dematel decision making trial and evaluation laboratory a widely used method to find out the cause and effect relationship among nine factors for cause and effect groups were investigated separately according to the analyses in the cause group cargo specification 0 87 competency of the crew involved in the cargo handling operation 0 78 compliance with international rules regulations and guidelines about ship safety and cargo operation 0 63 heavy weather 0 59 were identified as the most critical factors however among the effect group cargo stowage and operational plan 3 30 ship s age hull and structure condition 3 31 and complying with the ship s planned maintenance system 2 67 were indicated as the most highly significant factors accordingly some recommendations for using fuzzy dematel approach were made considering ship structural accidents and preventive measures keywords ship structure maritime safety hull damage fuzzy logic dematel risk analysis 1 introduction one of the most important elements of safe maritime cargo transportation is to maintain the structural integrity together with stability of the ship and one of the most critical processes in ship operations is cargo handling as a matter of fact faulty cargo handling operations may cause damages to the cargo and ship structure loss of the ship stability sinking of the ship and break in two accident of ships which finally result in loss of life injuries marine pollution and financial loss ships are designed within the limits that maintain their structural integrity throughout their operational life exceeding these limits causes great stresses and consequently major structural damage when ship s hull crack and its break in two accident are reviewed mid ship region is seen as the region of crack occurrence since the bm bending moment is always greater at the mid ship ship hull is designed to withstand static loads including ship weight and buoyancy of water and dynamic loads caused by waves and ship movements the buoyancy force is more at the mid ship region as the submerged volume and the bm are always greater at this region longitudinal strength of the hull is designed considering bm limit at the mid ship the bottom plate of the ship is exposed to tensile when the ship is sagging and the main deck of the ship is exposed to tensile when the ship is hogging if yield strength limit of the hull material is exceeded during sagging or hogging cracks can occur at mid ship region and propagate through the hull propagation of cracks results in break in two accident of the ships chakraborty 2014 loading and discharging operations are one of the most significant processes for the structural integrity and hull strength of the ship improper cargo handling operations increase stress on the hull and reduce the resistance of the ship against dynamic loads at sea therefore steps of cargo plan should be followed properly and sf shear force and bm limits of the ship should not be exceeded during cargo handling operations there have been a significant number of ships broken in two due to incorrect cargo handling operations that s why cargo operations require correct planning correct cargo handling and great attention during cargo loading and discharging operations the limits of ship s sf and bm are not exceeded a safe cargo handling operation and protection of the ship structure is dependent on the permissible stress not to be exceeded ship crew and port personnel should be in constant coordination at cargo operation planning process and during cargo handling operation before commencing cargo handling operations loading master of the port and chief officer of the ship must agree on loading discharging method and speed of loading discharging cargo operation plan ballast pumping rate and cargo loading unloading rate must be prepared in a way that does not create undue stress to the ship structure taylor 1992 house 2005 continuous and effective communication between the ship and the shore during cargo handling operations must be established during cargo operation according to the imo international maritime organization ship shore safety check list imo 1997 officer of the cargo watch in charge should carefully monitor any deviation from the plan throughout the operation and ensure that the loading discharging operation and the ballast procedure are synchronized hess and hess 2009 international rules regulations and guidelines provide information about requirements ship structure and stability standards safe cargo handling operations and safe cargo transportation for different types of ships barras 2001 imo 2007a 2007b 2008 2011 2016 2018 pepper 2018 survey standards evaluation and repair of ship hull structure fatigue inspections of ship structural details were also comprehensively described in publications of international association of classification societies iacs 2001 2005 and 2012 there are also studies in scope of ship structural analysis in literature paik and frieze 2001 reviewed reliability and safety of ship s structural design methods focusing on collapse of ship hull and recommended technologically advanced design procedures yan et al 2016 proposed a method to assess metal fatigue in ship structural details which was also addressed in another study about management of ship structural fatigue okawa et al 2006 ozguc 2017 focused on theoretical calculations of fatigue assessment andersen 1998 studied on initiation and growth of fatigue crack in ships structure in this study novel fatigue analysis tools were suggested to develop a fatigue resistant slot design nguyen and oterkus 2020 focused on brittle cracks on a ship structure exposed to variable loading conditions and used a new method to assess the structural strength of ship hong 2008 proposed computational methods that can be used to analyze the structure of the ship in case of collision and grounding great efforts have been made in the maritime industry to eliminate marine accidents due to their severe consequences such as loss of life severe injuries marine pollution as well as damage to cargo and ship lots of research articles have been focused on maritime accidents to fill the gaps in the field eliopoulou et al 2016 primorac and parunov 2016 chen et al 2019 kuzu et al 2019 luo and shin 2019 it is possible to find many accident reports and studies related to the ship structural damage accidents in the literature sumi 2019 reviewed the chronological history of ship s hull crack in mid ship section accidents focusing on technological developments and international regulations he also suggested what to be studied to avoid structural failure of ships maib 2008 published investigation report on the structural failure of msc napoli which was a 4419 teu twenty empty units container vessel encountering heavy weather condition and suffering hull failure while transiting the english channel a similar accident was experienced at indian ocean mol comfort was an 8000 teu large container ship that experienced crack in mid ship section and broke in two while sailing to port of jeddah this accident was analyzed and causes of the accident were reported by committee on large container ship safety in japan sumi et al 2015 stellar daisy very large ore carrier vloc experienced a catastrophic structural failure in 2017 and it caused loss of 24 crew members lives and the whole vessel stellar daisy was constructed as very large crude carrier vlcc in 1993 and she was converted to vloc in 2009 blenkey 2019 the last ship structural failure accident was encountered on the 15th of january 2021 mv arvin a 46 year old dry bulk carrier broke in two at turkey s black sea coast whilst transiting from port of poti to port of burgas goddard 2021 zhang and li 2017 analyzed the effects of sea states on ship accidents using ten year ship accident dataset of imo and classified 755 weather related accidents of ships according to initial events 25 4 of initial events were stated as hull damage wang et al 2019 proposed voyage optimization to minimize the structural fatigue accumulation in ships in another study common ship structure failures were addressed indents corrosion metal fatigue cracks and buckling of plates were described as common ship structure failures to address ship structural failures the 3c cause consequence cure method was proposed the first step of the 3c is to identify reason of the ship structural failure while the second step of the 3c is to identify consequences of the ship structural failure and the last step of the 3c is to cure the ship structure raju and premanandh 2018 nair et al 2017 proposed an age based crack assessment criteria taking inducement factors into account which trigger cracks in the hull structure of the ship at the early stage in the study material properties design welding process temperature metal fatigue corrosion and accidents were defined as inducement factors and causes of inducement factors were introduced using references the ships were then classified by age and a circular data visualization was developed for each age category showing inducement factors and reasons ship s age and nasf non accidental structural failure were addressed in a statistical review study it was concluded that the accident frequency of ships increased as ships reached the age of ten primorac and parunov 2016 today one of the most dangerous types of marine accidents is break in two accident of ships as a result of structural damage and such accidents still cannot be prevented why such a serious accident cannot be prevented despite new technologies international regulations and periodic inspections what are the root cause factors affecting this type of accident and what is the relationship between them to be honest the factors that trigger the accident have not been clearly revealed and analyzed in the literature this study addresses the factors that trigger structural damage and break in two accident of ships although there are different types of ship structural damage accidents to be analyzed this study is limited to analysis of those factors that trigger break in two accident of ships although many studies on ship structural analysis and ship structural damage accidents encountered in the literature a detailed analysis of the factors that trigger hull damage and break in two accident of ships has been made quite limited in order to fill this gap in the literature the causal relationships and weighting of the factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were analyzed using the fuzzy dematel method which was used applying the fuzzy logic to multi criteria decision making method this method which has been used in various studies to analyze the cause effect relationship between factors was used for the first time to analyze ship structural damage accidents in the second chapter this method is an integration of fuzzy and dematel approaches in this study by using fuzzy dematel method the factors affecting ship structural damage were determined and an appropriate methodology was proposed to analyze structural damage problem and break in two accident of ships accordingly the factor evaluations based on the data collected by planning flow processes with the fuzzy dematel approach are defined in the third section 2 method approaches such as 3c nasf voyage optimization imo s statistical data set of ship accidents were preferred in ship structural damage and accident studies in the literature as mentioned in the introduction of this study it was evaluated that these approaches are not sufficient in defining and analyzing the critical factors that trigger ship breakage as a matter of fact it is seen that these approaches are mostly used in the evaluation of processes such as material selection metal fatigue corrosion sheering force and bending moment in this study fuzzy dematel method which is a combination of fuzzy and dematel approaches was preferred for risk impact analysis of critical factors the dematel approach is defined as an efficient tool designed to identify the meaning of specifications and the current configuration and relationship between the parameters in which this method is based on a binary diagram dividing the requirements that cause problems into groups of cause and effect gabus and fontela 1972 the most important aspect which distinguishes the dematel approach from other decision making approaches with multiple parameters is the ability to evaluate the relationship between factors that influence the issue and distribution of the factors according to the status of the connection and interactions between current factors akyuz and celik 2015 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 ozdemir et al 2016 investigated marine pollution from various operations of ships using dematel method massami and manyasi 2019 applied dematel method to assess the challenges in training on board in tanzania dematel method has been integrated with other methods in various studies wang et al 2018 integrated dematel and ism interpretive structure modelling to evaluate influencing factors of safety in coal mine production lia et al 2019 also combined and used dematel ism interpretive structure modelling and bn bayesian network methods to analyze the factors causing network of buried urban gas pipeline accident dematel and bn methods were integrated to develop a dynamic quantitative risk evaluation for assessment of accident probabilities caused by leakage on offshore platforms meng et al 2019 in another risk assessment study mentes et al 2015 used dematel together with fsa formal safety assessment vujanovic et al 2012 used dematel and anp analytic network process together to evaluate maintenance management indicators of vehicle fleet using a similar method container terminals performances were evaluated using fuzzy ahp analytic hierarchy process dematel method venkatasubbaiah et al 2014 karuppiah et al 2020 also used fuzzy anp analytic network process dematel for evaluation of faulty behavior risks the use of fuzzy dematel in the solutions of different engineering problems makes it possible to obtain a set of applicable and practical alternatives by considering independent and stochastic evaluations within a certain analytical dimension akyuz and celik 2015 govindan et al 2015 karuppiah et al 2020 luthra et al 2016 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 wu and lee 2007 in this method fuzzy sets were combined with the dematel system that is related to complex problem solution based on linguistic it was ensured that the evaluations of the decision making community were made more appropriate for the application of fuzzy logic to the dematel system by using linguistic variables in communicating ambiguity on the basis of this logic akyuz and celik 2015 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 wu and lee 2007 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 developed a cause and effect model for management of solid waste using fuzzy dematel method akyuz and celik 2015 evaluated hazards of gas free operation in oil tankers using fuzzy dematel method they developed the method by using type 2 fuzzy sets instead of type 1 and they used the developed method in another study celik and akyüz 2016 analyzed causal factors and effects of a real ship collision using dematel method with interval type 2 fuzzy sets seker and zavadskas 2017 proposed a simplified risk assessment model to examine occupational hazards on construction sites using fuzzy dematel method başhan and demirel 2019 made use of fuzzy dematel method to assess operational malfunctions of marine boilers interactions of factors affecting situation awareness were investigated using fuzzy dematel approach mohammadfam et al 2019 2 1 fuzzy sets fuzzy reasoning developed in 1965 by lotfi a zadeh is an effective instrument for dealing with the vagueness ambiguity and complexity of decision making in human judgement and evaluation decision making challenges in the real world require imprecision since priorities limitations and future actions are not precisely defined zadeh 1965 it is easier to translate linguistic words into fuzzy numbers instead of mixing different perceptions thoughts ideas and motives of a person or group of decision maker therefore in fact during decision making it is important to generate fuzzy numbers a triangular fuzzy number can be defined in this context as a triplet a l m u where l m and u denote the lower medium and upper numbers of the fuzzy sets the membership function of a triangular fuzzy number can be expressed as follows μ a 0 x 1 x l m l l x m u x u m m x u 0 x u fig 1 displays a triangular fuzzy number in the light above in accordance with table 1 the corresponding relationship between the linguistic words and triangular fuzzy numbers can be calculated see fig 2 for either of the two fuzzy triangular numbers a 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and a 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 it is possible to characterize the statistical estimation of them as follows aggregation of triangular fuzzy numbers between them a 1 a 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 subtraction of the triangular fuzzy numbers between them a 1 a 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 multiplication among the fuzzy triangular numbers a 1 a 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 the arithmetic sense of the fuzzy triangular numbers k a 1 k l 1 k m 1 k u 1 k 0 a 1 k l 1 k m 1 k u 1 k k 0 2 2 dematel method to resolve dynamic and detailed decision making concerns the dematel approach was developed gabus and fontela 1972 it has been widely accepted as one of the best practical methods for finding cause and effect relationships between evaluated parameters akyuz and celik 2015 ozdemir 2016 the method enables visualization problems to be analyzed and clarified tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 the approach illustrates the relationship of interdependence between the variables as well as influential impact values the basic steps of the dematel process are briefly illustrated as follows step 1for pair wise comparison the purpose of the first step is to create an initial direct relation matrix a community of decision makers who have problem related expertise and experience is decided they are then asked to determine the effects of each pair of variables thus the decision maker s linguistic appraisal is translated to actual values the direct relation matrix is therefore defined a a i j where a is n n non negative matrix a i j indicates the direct impact of factor i on factor j and when i j the diagonal elements a i j 0 step 2the initial direct relation matrix is normalized in this step by comparing the variables step 3the total relation matrix t is calculated using the following equation where i point i outs nxn identity matrix the element t i j indicates the indirect factors that criterion i have on criterion j so t gives the total relationship between the each factor pair t d i d 1 step 4in the fourth step r i and c j are determined by using the following equations in the formula while r i indicates direct and indirect effect totally given by criterion i to all other factors c j denotes the degree of affected impact r i j 1 n t i j c j i 1 n t i j when i j r i c j indicates all factors that are given and received by criterion i that is r i c j shows both criterion i s effect on the whole system and other system factors effect upon factor i so r i c j can indicate the importance degree that criterion i in the whole system on the other hand if the r i c j value is positive the factor i will be a clear cause if r i c j is negative the factor will be a clear result clustered within the impact group akyuz and celik 2015 demirel 2020 wu and lee 2007 step 5in the final step a cause and effect relationship diagram is depicted according to the r i c j and r i c j values thus the complex relationship between factors is easily visualized 2 3 integration of methods fuzzy dematel approach in this portion in order to assess critical hazards in ship structural damage and beak in two incidents fuzzy sets and dematel technique are combined dematel has been shown to be an intelligent decision making approach to evaluate critical factors by dividing them into cause effect groups while fuzzy clusters are a method for dealing with uncertain judgments in the group decision making process the method s main steps are described as follows akyuz and celik 2015 demirel 2020 mentes et al 2015 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 step 1 selection of decision makers in this stage experts who have adequate knowledge and experience of the problem are consulted in order to obtain judgments step 2 determining criteria in this section in order to better analyze and assess important factors are defined step 3 obtaining evaluation of the decision makers and construction of fuzzy scale in terms of linguistic variables a pair wise comparison is obtained the linguistic variable is then used on five fuzzy scales in accordance with no influence very low influence low influence high influence and very high influence subsequently relevant triangular fuzzy members are calculated in addition the fuzzy evaluations are converted into a crisp value that is defuzzified and aggregated step 4 generating direct relation fuzzy matrix and normalized direct relation fuzzy matrix a normalized direct relation fuzzy matrix is constructed in the presence of the initial direct relation matrix thereafter to turn the variables into comparable scales the linear scale transformation is applied step 5 calculation of total relation fuzzy matrix at the fifth step the total relation fuzzy matrix is calculated the crisp case of the total relation fuzzy matrix can be calculated using the formulas below t lim k x 1 x 2 x k where t ij l ij m ij u ij l i j x l i x l 1 m i j x m i x m 1 u i j x u i x u 1 step 6 analysis of the model after having calculated matrix t r i c j and r i c j are determined in the formula r i and c j indicate the sum of the rows and columns of matrix t while r i c j indicates the importance of factor i and r i c j shows the net effect of factor i step 7 defuzzication process in this step r i c j and r i c j are defuzzified by using coa center of area defuzzification method which is introduced by ross 1995 to determine the values of bnp best non fuzzy performance for a convex fuzzy number δ and real number z corresponding to the center of area can be determined by using the formulas below akyuz and celik 2015 z μ z z d z μ z d z the bnp value of a fuzzy number g l i j m i j u i j can be found with following formula b n p i j u i j l i j m i j l i j 3 l i j step 8 obtaining final output and building up cause and effect relation diagram in the final step the cause and effect relation diagram is explained by mapping the dataset of r i c j and r i c j fig 3 shows the flow diagram of the fuzzy dematel method 3 case of approach 3 1 step 1 selection of decision makers to obtain evaluation five decision makers who have enough knowledge and experience about the problem were determined as shipbuilding and structure surveyor ship master port loading master naval architecture and marine engineer and academician 3 2 step 2 determining criteria within the scope of the research model to determine the criteria and alternatives and to obtain data sets a literature review including international rules regulations standards and guidelines academic studies statistics damage and accident reports about ship structure and stability cargo handling operations and cargo transportation was conducted with the experts of the subject and the criteria for the structural damage problem of the ships were tried to be determined as a result of the evaluations made 18 main criteria shown in table 2 were determined 3 3 step 3 obtaining evaluation of the decision makers and construction of fuzzy scale linguistic assessment of the decision makers was obtained and shown in table 3 then a fuzzy evaluation scale was created in order to transform the linguistic pairwise comparison opinions obtained from decision makers into triangular fuzzy numbers 3 4 step 4 generating direct relation fuzzy matrix and normalized direct relation fuzzy matrix in order to define the relations among the n criteria an initial direct relation n n matrix was constructed for decision makers pair wise comparison d 0 d n 1 d 1 n 0 arithmetic mean of all of the decision makers evaluations was used to establish the direct relation fuzzy matrix table 4 shows the direct relation fuzzy matrix the normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix which is shown in table 5 can be obtained using the following formula x i j z i j r l i j r m i j r u i j r where r max i j max i j 1 n u i j max j i 1 n u i j i j 1 2 3 n 3 5 step 5 calculation of total relation fuzzy matrix after generating normalized direct relation matrix the fuzzy total relation matrix can be calculated by using the formula which was introduced at the fifth step of the integrated method the normalized matrix the inverse is first calculated and subtracted from the matrix i and the normalized matrix is later multiplied by the resulting matrix table 6 shows the total relation fuzzy matrix 3 6 step 6 analysis of the model at this step the sum of each row and each column of t is calculated the sum of rows and the sum of columns can be calculated as follows r i j 1 n t i j c j i 1 n t i j then the values of r i c j and r i c j can be calculated by r i and c j where r i c j represent the degree of importance of factor i and r i c j represent net effects of factor i fuzzy scale of r i c j r i c j and r i c j is shown in table 7 3 7 step 7 defuzzification process defuzzification of r i c j and r i c j values was performed for converting the fuzzy numbers into crisp values at this step through the defuzzification method it is ensured that by translating from fuzzy values to exact values the result can be checked and implemented for this reason thanks to the defuzzification process it is possible for cluster elements to be comparable to each other various methods of defuzzification exist the coa center of area technique used in this study was introduced by ross 1995 the coa defuzzification method is used to calculate bnp best non fuzzy performance values ross 1995 the equation introduced at the seventh step of the integrated method is used in order to estimate a convex fuzzy number δ and real number z corresponding to its center of area akyuz and celik 2015 3 8 step 8 obtaining final output and building up cause and effect relation diagram the crisp values of the r i c j r i c j and r i c j provided in table 8 as the final output can be found to build up cause effect relation diagram in the last stage cause and effect relationship diagram can be depicted based on the outcomes the table below shows the final output 4 results and discussion the model of significant relations is shown in cause and effect diagram which was created according to table 8 this model can be represented as a diagram in which the values of r i c j are placed on the horizontal axis and the values of r i c j on the vertical axis the position and interaction of each factor with a point in the coordinates r i c j r i c j are determined by coordinate system fig 4 shows cause and effect diagram according to the diagram it may be necessary to divide the findings into two groups cause and effect factors 4 1 cause factors in order to evaluate factors affecting break in two accident of ships it is crucial to focus on the cause factors that have positive value of r i c j f16 f13 f9 f3 f18 f14 f10 f17 and f5 are in cause group according to the cause effect diagram f16 cargo specification has the highest r i c j value 0 87 among the all factors in cause group this means that f16 has more impact on the entire process furthermore f16 has high r i value 1 39 among the causal factors from the point of influential impact degree it shows that f16 has significant impact on the other factors thereafter f13 competency of the ship and shore crew involved in the cargo handling operation has the second highest r i c j value 0 78 and is the second most important causal factor among all factors f9 compatibility of international rules regulations and guidelines about ship safety construction and cargo operation has the highest degree of influential impact di value which is 2 02 that s why it has great influence on the whole process f9 is also the third most critical factor among the entire process because of its high r i c j value 0 63 for this reason f9 has significant impact on the entire break in two accident of ships similarly f3 heavy weather is another important factor among the whole process because the r i c j value 0 59 is in the fourth place although f5 and f17 have the potential r i values their r i c j values are the lowest among all factors therefore they are not considered as critical factors 4 2 effect factors f7 f1 f4 f2 f6 f8 f11 f12 and f15 have negative r i c j values so these are effect factors according to the cause effect diagram f4 cargo stowage and operational plan and f8 ship s age hull and structure condition have the highest r i c j value 3 30 3 31 among the effect factors furthermore degree of influenced impact index c j values of f4 and f8 1 92 1 86 are high among the whole process f11 and f1 also have the quite high r i c j values 3 13 and 3 01 in the process on the other hand r i c j values of f11 hull and structure status surveys of ship and f1 metal fatigue are very low 0 36 0 66 this means that f11 and f1 are easily affected from other factors f15 complying with the ship s planned maintenance system has the highest r i c j value 0 01 among the effect factor and has r i c j value 2 67 this means that f15 is less effected factor among the whole process and has significant effect on the other factors the most critical factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were identified according to the cause effect diagram it is necessary to focus on these critical factors and to introduce preventive measures which obtained from experts who have enough knowledge and experience about ship structure and stability cargo handling operation hull strength hull damage and materials used in shipbuilding table 9 shows preventive measures against the critical factors 5 conclusion in this study the main factors that trigger ship structural damage and break in two accident of ships were defined and the impact assessments of these factors were examined depending on the risk analysis unlike other studies in the literature the fuzzy dematel method was used in this study and an alternative risk model that could be used for assessment of critical factors was created although studies on the analysis of ship structural damage such as age based crack assessment criteria 3c and nasf in the literature show some results primorac and parunov 2016 nair et al 2017 raju and premanandh 2018 it is striking that there is a lack of study on the factors that trigger break in two accident of ships in this context as a new approach the causal relationships and weighting of the factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were analyzed analyzes revealed that critical factors have significant weights in the cause effect diagram as a result of the analysis 18 factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were evaluated by considering the cause and effect group based on the evaluations of experts who have sufficient knowledge and experience about the structure and stability of the ship cargo handling operation hull strength hull damage and materials used in shipbuilding preventive measures were proposed to prevent break in two accidents of ships accordingly cargo specification 0 87 competency of the crew involved in the cargo handling operation 0 78 compatibility of international rules regulations and guidelines about ship safety construction and cargo operation 0 63 heavy weather 0 59 were identified as the most critical factors among the cause group cargo handling operations cargo stowage and cargo securing should be carried out according to the cargo specification considering material safety datasheet of the cargo to minimize the effect of cargo specification a well organized recruitment process should be applied to identify professionally competent employees detailed familiarization procedures and periodic in service training standards should be established for ship shore crew to ensure competent crew is involved in the cargo handling operation in order to comply with the international rules regulations and guidelines about ship safety construction and cargo operation there should be a well organized ship technical management system carried out by competent ship shore crew who have sufficient experience in the profession proper passage planning should be applied taking care weather routing all deck equipment and cargo lashing should be secured to minimize effects of heavy weather condition cargo stowage and operational plan 3 30 ship s age hull and structure condition 3 31 and complying with the ship s planned maintenance system 2 67 were identified as the most critical factors among the effect group in cargo stowage and operational plan the synchronization of cargo and ballast handling operations should be ensured and sf and bm limits of the ship should not be exceeded the hull and structure condition of a ship directly related to the ship s age should be surveyed at regular intervals by a member of high quality classification society details of the ship s survey especially the thickness measurements of the hull should be analyzed properly the ship s crew should fully comply with the planned maintenance system and should not neglect periodical checks of hull and structure of the ship an alternative risk analysis approach was presented for the maritime industry to prevent break in two accident of ships the results of this study can be used by decision makers such as ship class surveyors ship shore crews loading masters naval architecture and marine engineers to analyze and prevent possible ship structural damage and accidents this study also revealed that the fuzzy dematel approach can be used to analyze processes involving danger and cause effect relationship in various sectors future studies can be developed using a multi criteria decision making method to take preventive measures against critical factors identified in this study the study was limited to focusing on break in two accident which is one type of structural accident of ships other types of ship structural accidents can also be analyzed using the same method credit authorship contribution statement ali cem kuzu conceptualization

20505,structural damage accidents that lead to disastrous results are an important problem in the maritime industry however as a sectoral requirement factors causing break in two accident of ships are not clearly defined in this study an alternative risk analysis approach based on 18 factors that trigger ship structural damage was presented in order to prevent break in two accident of ships these

however among the effect group cargo stowage and operational plan 3 30 ship s age hull and structure condition 3 31 and complying with the ship s planned maintenance system 2 67 were indicated as the most highly significant factors accordingly some recommendations for using fuzzy dematel approach were made considering ship structural accidents and preventive measures keywords ship structure maritime safety hull damage fuzzy logic dematel risk analysis 1 introduction one of the most important elements of safe maritime cargo transportation is to maintain the structural integrity together with stability of the ship and one of the most critical processes in ship operations is cargo handling as a matter of fact faulty cargo handling operations may cause damages to the cargo and ship structure loss of the ship stability sinking of the ship and break in two accident of ships which finally result in loss of life injuries marine pollution and financial loss ships are designed within the limits that maintain their structural integrity throughout their operational life exceeding these limits causes great stresses and consequently major structural damage when ship s hull crack and its break in two accident are reviewed mid ship region is seen as the region of crack occurrence since the bm bending moment is always greater at the mid ship ship hull is designed to withstand static loads including ship weight and buoyancy of water and dynamic loads caused by waves and ship movements the buoyancy force is more at the mid ship region as the submerged volume and the bm are always greater at this region longitudinal strength of the hull is designed considering bm limit at the mid ship the bottom plate of the ship is exposed to tensile when the ship is sagging and the main deck of the ship is exposed to tensile when the ship is hogging if yield strength limit of the hull material is exceeded during sagging or hogging cracks can occur at mid ship region and propagate through the hull propagation of cracks results in break in two accident of the ships chakraborty 2014 loading and discharging operations are one of the most significant processes for the structural integrity and hull strength of the ship improper cargo handling operations increase stress on the hull and reduce the resistance of the ship against dynamic loads at sea therefore steps of cargo plan should be followed properly and sf shear force and bm limits of the ship should not be exceeded during cargo handling operations there have been a significant number of ships broken in two due to incorrect cargo handling operations that s why cargo operations require correct planning correct cargo handling and great attention during cargo loading and discharging operations the limits of ship s sf and bm are not exceeded a safe cargo handling operation and protection of the ship structure is dependent on the permissible stress not to be exceeded ship crew and port personnel should be in constant coordination at cargo operation planning process and during cargo handling operation before commencing cargo handling operations loading master of the port and chief officer of the ship must agree on loading discharging method and speed of loading discharging cargo operation plan ballast pumping rate and cargo loading unloading rate must be prepared in a way that does not create undue stress to the ship structure taylor 1992 house 2005 continuous and effective communication between the ship and the shore during cargo handling operations must be established during cargo operation according to the imo international maritime organization ship shore safety check list imo 1997 officer of the cargo watch in charge should carefully monitor any deviation from the plan throughout the operation and ensure that the loading discharging operation and the ballast procedure are synchronized hess and hess 2009 international rules regulations and guidelines provide information about requirements ship

evaluation and repair of ship hull structure fatigue inspections of ship structural details were also comprehensively described in publications of international association of classification societies iacs 2001 2005 and 2012 there are also studies in scope of ship structural analysis in literature paik and frieze 2001 reviewed reliability and safety of ship s structural design methods focusing on collapse of ship hull and recommended technologically advanced design procedures yan et al 2016 proposed a method to assess metal fatigue in ship structural details which was also addressed in another

variable loading conditions and used a new method to assess the structural strength of ship hong 2008 proposed computational methods that can be used to analyze the structure of the ship in case of collision and grounding great efforts have been made in the maritime industry to eliminate marine accidents due to their severe consequences such as loss of life severe injuries marine pollution as well as damage to cargo and ship lots of research articles have been focused on maritime accidents to fill the gaps in the field eliopoulou et al 2016 primorac and parunov 2016 chen et al 2019 kuzu et al 2019 luo and shin 2019 it is possible to find many accident reports and studies related to the ship structural damage accidents in the literature sumi 2019 reviewed the chronological history of ship s hull crack in mid ship section accidents focusing on technological developments and international regulations he also suggested what to be studied to avoid structural failure of ships maib 2008 published investigation report on the structural failure of msc napoli which was a 4419 teu twenty empty units container vessel encountering heavy weather condition and suffering hull failure while transiting the english channel a similar accident was experienced at indian ocean mol comfort was an 8000 teu large container ship that experienced crack in mid ship section and broke in two while sailing to port of jeddah this accident was analyzed and causes of the accident were reported by committee on large container ship safety in japan sumi et al 2015 stellar daisy very large ore carrier vloc experienced a catastrophic structural failure in 2017 and it caused loss of 24 crew members lives and the whole vessel stellar daisy was constructed as very large crude carrier vlcc in 1993 and she was converted to vloc in 2009 blenkey 2019 the last ship structural failure accident was encountered on the 15th of january 2021 mv arvin a 46 year old dry bulk carrier broke in two at turkey s black sea coast whilst transiting from port of poti to port of burgas goddard 2021 zhang and li 2017 analyzed the effects of sea states on ship accidents using ten year ship accident dataset of imo and classified 755 weather related accidents of ships according to initial events 25 4 of initial events were stated as hull damage wang et al 2019 proposed voyage optimization to minimize the structural fatigue accumulation in ships in another study common ship structure failures were addressed indents corrosion metal fatigue cracks and buckling of plates were described as common ship structure failures to address ship structural failures the 3c cause consequence cure method was proposed the first step of the 3c is to identify reason of the ship structural failure while the second step of the 3c is to identify consequences of the ship structural failure and the last step of the 3c is to cure the ship structure raju and premanandh 2018 nair et al 2017 proposed an age based crack assessment criteria taking inducement factors into account which trigger cracks in the hull structure of the ship at the early stage in the study material properties design welding process temperature metal fatigue corrosion and accidents were defined as inducement factors and causes of inducement factors were introduced using references the ships were then classified by age and a circular data visualization was developed for each age category showing inducement factors and reasons ship s age and nasf non accidental structural failure were addressed in a statistical review study it was concluded that the accident frequency of ships increased as ships reached the age of ten primorac and parunov 2016 today one of the most dangerous types of marine accidents is break in two accident of ships as a result of structural damage and such accidents still cannot be prevented why such a serious accident cannot be prevented despite new technologies international regulations and periodic inspections what are the root cause factors affecting this type of accident and what is the relationship between them to be honest the factors that trigger the accident have not been clearly revealed and analyzed in the literature this study addresses the factors that trigger structural damage and break in two accident of ships although there are different types of ship structural damage accidents to be analyzed this study is limited to analysis of those factors that trigger break in two accident of ships although many studies on ship structural analysis and ship structural damage accidents encountered in the literature a detailed analysis of the factors that trigger hull damage and break in two accident of ships has been made quite limited in order to fill this gap in the literature the causal relationships and weighting of the factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were analyzed using the fuzzy dematel method which was used applying the fuzzy logic to multi criteria decision making method this method which has been used in various studies to analyze the cause effect relationship between factors was used for the first time to analyze ship structural damage accidents in the second chapter this method is an integration of fuzzy and dematel approaches in this study by using fuzzy dematel method the factors affecting ship structural damage were determined and an appropriate methodology was proposed to analyze structural damage problem and break in two accident of ships accordingly the factor evaluations based on the data collected by planning flow processes with the fuzzy dematel approach are defined in the third section 2 method approaches such as 3c nasf voyage optimization imo s statistical data set of ship accidents were preferred in ship structural damage and accident studies in the literature as mentioned in the introduction of this study it was evaluated that these approaches are not sufficient in defining and analyzing the critical factors that trigger ship breakage as a matter of fact it is seen that these approaches are mostly used in the evaluation of processes such as material selection metal fatigue corrosion sheering force and bending moment in this study fuzzy dematel method which is a combination of fuzzy and dematel approaches was preferred for risk impact analysis of critical factors the dematel approach is defined as an efficient tool designed to identify the meaning of specifications and the current configuration and relationship between the parameters in which this method is based on a binary diagram dividing the requirements that cause problems into groups of cause and effect gabus and fontela 1972 the most important aspect which distinguishes the dematel approach from other decision making approaches with multiple parameters is the ability to evaluate the relationship between factors that influence the issue and distribution of the factors according to the status of the connection and interactions between current factors akyuz and celik 2015 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 ozdemir et al 2016 investigated marine pollution from various operations of ships using dematel method massami and manyasi 2019 applied dematel method to assess the challenges in training on board in tanzania dematel method has been integrated with other methods in various studies wang et al 2018 integrated dematel and ism interpretive structure modelling to evaluate influencing factors of safety in coal mine production lia et al 2019 also combined and used dematel ism interpretive structure modelling and bn bayesian network methods to analyze the factors causing network of buried urban gas pipeline accident dematel and bn methods were integrated to develop a dynamic quantitative risk evaluation for assessment of accident probabilities caused by leakage on offshore platforms meng et al 2019 in another risk assessment study mentes et al 2015 used dematel together with fsa formal safety assessment vujanovic et al 2012 used dematel and anp analytic network process together to evaluate maintenance management indicators of vehicle fleet using a similar method container terminals performances were evaluated using fuzzy ahp analytic hierarchy process dematel method venkatasubbaiah et al 2014 karuppiah et al 2020 also used fuzzy anp analytic network process dematel for evaluation of faulty behavior risks the use of fuzzy dematel in the solutions of different engineering problems makes it possible to obtain a set of applicable and practical alternatives by considering independent and stochastic evaluations within a certain analytical dimension akyuz and celik 2015 govindan et al 2015 karuppiah et al 2020 luthra et al 2016 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 wu and lee 2007 in this method fuzzy sets were combined with the dematel system that is related to complex problem solution based on linguistic it was ensured that the evaluations of the decision making community were made more appropriate for the application of fuzzy logic to the dematel system by using linguistic variables in communicating ambiguity on the basis of this logic akyuz and celik 2015 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 wu and lee 2007 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 developed a cause and effect model for management of solid waste using fuzzy dematel method akyuz and celik 2015 evaluated hazards of gas free operation in oil tankers using fuzzy dematel method they developed the method by using type 2 fuzzy sets instead of type 1 and they used the developed method in another study celik and akyüz 2016 analyzed causal factors and effects of a real ship collision using dematel method with interval type 2 fuzzy sets seker and zavadskas 2017 proposed a simplified risk assessment model to examine occupational hazards on construction sites using fuzzy dematel method başhan and demirel 2019 made use of fuzzy dematel method to assess operational malfunctions of marine boilers interactions of factors affecting situation awareness were investigated using fuzzy dematel approach mohammadfam et al 2019 2 1 fuzzy sets fuzzy reasoning developed in 1965 by lotfi a zadeh is an effective instrument for dealing with the vagueness ambiguity and complexity of decision making in human judgement and evaluation decision making challenges in the real world require imprecision since priorities limitations and future actions are not precisely defined zadeh 1965 it is easier to translate linguistic words into fuzzy numbers instead of mixing different perceptions thoughts ideas and motives of a person or group of decision maker therefore in fact during decision making it is important to generate fuzzy numbers a triangular fuzzy number can be defined in this context as a triplet a l m u where l m and u denote the lower medium and upper numbers of the fuzzy sets the membership function of a triangular fuzzy number can be expressed as follows μ a 0 x 1 x l m l l x m u x u m m x u 0 x u fig 1 displays a triangular fuzzy number in the light above in accordance with table 1 the corresponding relationship between the linguistic words and triangular fuzzy numbers can be calculated see fig 2 for either of the two fuzzy triangular numbers a 1 l 1 m 1 u 1 and a 2 l 2 m 2 u 2 it is possible to characterize the statistical estimation of them as follows aggregation of triangular fuzzy numbers between them a 1 a 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 subtraction of the triangular fuzzy numbers between them a 1 a 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 multiplication among the fuzzy triangular numbers a 1 a 2 l 1 l 2 m 1 m 2 u 1 u 2 the arithmetic sense of the fuzzy triangular numbers k a 1 k l 1 k m 1 k u 1 k 0 a 1 k l 1 k m 1 k u 1 k k 0 2 2 dematel method to resolve dynamic and detailed decision making concerns the dematel approach was developed gabus and fontela 1972 it has been widely accepted as one of the best practical methods for finding cause and effect relationships between evaluated parameters akyuz and celik 2015 ozdemir 2016 the method enables visualization problems to be analyzed and clarified tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 the approach illustrates the relationship of interdependence between the variables as well as influential impact values the basic steps of the dematel process are briefly illustrated as follows step 1for pair wise comparison the purpose of the first step is to create an initial direct relation matrix a community of decision makers who have problem related expertise and experience is decided they are then asked to determine the effects of each pair of variables thus the decision maker s linguistic appraisal is translated to actual values the direct relation matrix is therefore defined a a i j where a is n n non negative matrix a i j indicates the direct impact of factor i on factor j and when i j the diagonal elements a i j 0 step 2the initial direct relation matrix is normalized in this step by comparing the variables step 3the total relation matrix t is calculated using the following equation where i point i outs nxn identity matrix the element t i j indicates the indirect factors that criterion i have on criterion j so t gives the total relationship between the each factor pair t d i d 1 step 4in the fourth step r i and c j are determined by using the following equations in the formula while r i indicates direct and indirect effect totally given by criterion i to all other factors c j denotes the degree of affected impact r i j 1 n t i j c j i 1 n t i j when i j r i c j indicates all factors that are given and received by criterion i that is r i c j shows both criterion i s effect on the whole system and other system factors effect upon factor i so r i c j can indicate the importance degree that criterion i in the whole system on the other hand if the r i c j value is positive the factor i will be a clear cause if r i c j is negative the factor will be a clear result clustered within the impact group akyuz and celik 2015 demirel 2020 wu and lee 2007 step 5in the final step a cause and effect relationship diagram is depicted according to the r i c j and r i c j values thus the complex relationship between factors is easily visualized 2 3 integration of methods fuzzy dematel approach in this portion in order to assess critical hazards in ship structural damage and beak in two incidents fuzzy sets and dematel technique are combined dematel has been shown to be an intelligent decision making approach to evaluate critical factors by dividing them into cause effect groups while fuzzy clusters are a method for dealing with uncertain judgments in the group decision making process the method s main steps are described as follows akyuz and celik 2015 demirel 2020 mentes et al 2015 tseng and yuan hsu lin 2009 step 1 selection of decision makers in this stage experts who have adequate knowledge and experience of the problem are consulted in order to obtain judgments step 2 determining criteria in this section in order to better analyze and assess important factors are defined step 3 obtaining evaluation of the decision makers and construction of fuzzy scale in terms of linguistic variables a pair wise comparison is obtained the linguistic variable is then used on five fuzzy scales in accordance with no influence very low influence low influence high influence and very high influence subsequently relevant triangular fuzzy members are calculated in addition the fuzzy evaluations are converted into a crisp value that is defuzzified and aggregated step 4 generating direct relation fuzzy matrix and normalized direct relation fuzzy matrix a normalized direct relation fuzzy matrix is constructed in the presence of the initial direct relation matrix thereafter to turn the variables into comparable scales the linear scale transformation is applied step 5 calculation of total relation fuzzy matrix at the fifth step the total relation fuzzy matrix is calculated the crisp case of the total relation fuzzy matrix can be calculated using the formulas below t lim k x 1 x 2 x k where t ij l ij m ij u ij l i j x l i x l 1 m i j x m i x m 1 u i j x u i x u 1 step 6 analysis of the model after having calculated matrix t r i c j and r i c j are determined in the formula r i and c j indicate the sum of the rows and columns of matrix t while r i c j indicates the importance of factor i and r i c j shows the net effect of factor i step 7 defuzzication process in this step r i c j and r i c j are defuzzified by using coa center of area defuzzification method which is introduced by ross 1995 to determine the values of bnp best non fuzzy performance for a convex fuzzy number δ and real number z corresponding to the center of area can be determined by using the formulas below akyuz and celik 2015 z μ z z d z μ z d z the bnp value of a fuzzy number g l i j m i j u i j can be found with following formula b n p i j u i j l i j m i j l i j 3 l i j step 8 obtaining final output and building up cause and effect relation diagram in the final step the cause and effect relation diagram is explained by mapping the dataset of r i c j and r i c j fig 3 shows the flow diagram of the fuzzy dematel method 3 case of approach 3 1 step 1 selection of decision makers to obtain evaluation five decision makers who have enough knowledge and experience about the problem were determined as shipbuilding and structure surveyor ship master port loading master naval architecture and marine engineer and academician 3 2 step 2 determining criteria within the scope of the research model to determine the criteria and alternatives and to obtain data sets a literature review including international rules regulations standards and guidelines academic studies statistics damage and accident reports about ship structure and stability cargo handling operations and cargo transportation was conducted with the experts of the subject and the criteria for the structural damage problem of the ships were tried to be determined as a result of the evaluations made 18 main criteria shown in table 2 were determined 3 3 step 3 obtaining evaluation of the decision makers and construction of fuzzy scale linguistic assessment of the decision makers was obtained and shown in table 3 then a fuzzy evaluation scale was created in order to transform the linguistic pairwise comparison opinions obtained from decision makers into triangular fuzzy numbers 3 4 step 4 generating direct relation fuzzy matrix and normalized direct relation fuzzy matrix in order to define the relations among the n criteria an initial direct relation n n matrix was constructed for decision makers pair wise comparison d 0 d n 1 d 1 n 0 arithmetic mean of all of the decision makers evaluations was used to establish the direct relation fuzzy matrix table 4 shows the direct relation fuzzy matrix the normalized fuzzy direct relation matrix which is shown in table 5 can be obtained using the following formula x i j z i j r l i j r m i j r u i j r where r max i j max i j 1 n u i j max j i 1 n u i j i j 1 2 3 n 3 5 step 5 calculation of total relation fuzzy matrix after generating normalized direct relation matrix the fuzzy total relation matrix can be calculated by using the formula which was introduced at the fifth step of the integrated method the normalized matrix the inverse is first calculated and subtracted from the matrix i and the normalized matrix is later multiplied by the resulting matrix table 6 shows the total relation fuzzy matrix 3 6 step 6 analysis of the model at this step the sum of each row and each column of t is calculated the sum of rows and the sum of columns can be calculated as follows r i j 1 n t i j c j i 1 n t i j then the values of r i c j and r i c j can be calculated by r i and c j where r i c j represent the degree of importance of factor i and r i c j represent net effects of factor i fuzzy scale of r i c j r i c j and r i c j is shown in table 7 3 7 step 7 defuzzification process defuzzification of r i c j and r i c j values was performed for converting the fuzzy numbers into crisp values at this step through the defuzzification method it is ensured that by translating from fuzzy values to exact values the result can be checked and implemented for this reason thanks to the defuzzification process it is possible for cluster elements to be comparable to each other various methods of defuzzification exist the coa center of area technique used in this study was introduced by ross 1995 the coa defuzzification method is used to calculate bnp best non fuzzy performance values ross 1995 the equation introduced at the seventh step of the integrated method is used in order to estimate a convex fuzzy number δ and real number z corresponding to its center of area akyuz and celik 2015 3 8 step 8 obtaining final output and building up cause and effect relation diagram the crisp values of the r i c j r i c j and r i c j provided in table 8 as the final output can be found to build up cause effect relation diagram in the last stage cause and effect relationship diagram can be depicted based on the outcomes the table below shows the final output 4 results and discussion the model of significant relations is shown in cause and effect diagram which was created according to table 8 this model can be represented as a diagram in which the values of r i c j are placed on the horizontal axis and the values of r i c j on the vertical axis the position and interaction of each factor with a point in the coordinates r i c j r i c j are determined by coordinate system fig 4 shows cause and effect diagram according to the diagram it may be necessary to divide the findings into two groups cause and effect factors 4 1 cause factors in order to evaluate factors affecting break in two accident of ships it is crucial to focus on the cause factors that have positive value of r i c j f16 f13 f9 f3 f18 f14 f10 f17 and f5 are in cause group according to the cause effect diagram f16 cargo specification has the highest r i c j value 0 87 among the all factors in cause group this means that f16 has more impact on the entire process furthermore f16 has high r i value 1 39 among the causal factors from the point of influential impact degree it shows that f16 has significant impact on the other factors thereafter f13 competency of the ship and shore crew involved in the cargo handling operation has the second highest r i c j value 0 78 and is the second most important causal factor among all factors f9 compatibility of international rules regulations and guidelines about ship safety construction and cargo operation has the highest degree of influential impact di value which is 2 02 that s why it has great influence on the whole process f9 is also the third most critical factor among the entire process because of its high r i c j value 0 63 for this reason f9 has significant impact on the entire break in two accident of ships similarly f3 heavy weather is another important factor among the whole process because the r i c j value 0 59 is in the fourth place although f5 and f17 have the potential r i values their r i c j values are the lowest among all factors therefore they are not considered as critical factors 4 2 effect factors f7 f1 f4 f2 f6 f8 f11 f12 and f15 have negative r i c j values so these are effect factors according to the cause effect diagram f4 cargo stowage and operational plan and f8 ship s age hull and structure condition have the highest r i c j value 3 30 3 31 among the effect factors furthermore degree of influenced impact index c j values of f4 and f8 1 92 1 86 are high among the whole process f11 and f1 also have the quite high r i c j values 3 13 and 3 01 in the process on the other hand r i c j values of f11 hull and structure status surveys of ship and f1 metal fatigue are very low 0 36 0 66 this means that f11 and f1 are easily affected from other factors f15 complying with the ship s planned maintenance system has the highest r i c j value 0 01 among the effect factor and has r i c j value 2 67 this means that f15 is less effected factor among the whole process and has significant effect on the other factors the most critical factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were identified according to the cause effect diagram it is necessary to focus on these critical factors and to introduce preventive measures which obtained from experts who have enough knowledge and experience about ship structure and stability cargo handling operation hull strength hull damage and materials used in shipbuilding table 9 shows preventive measures against the critical factors 5 conclusion in this study the main factors that trigger ship structural damage and break in two accident of ships were defined and the impact assessments of these factors were examined depending on the risk analysis unlike other studies in the literature the fuzzy dematel method was used in this study and an alternative risk model that could be used for assessment of critical factors was created although studies on the analysis of ship structural damage such as age based crack assessment criteria 3c and nasf in the literature show some results primorac and parunov 2016 nair et al 2017 raju and premanandh 2018 it is striking that there is a lack of study on the factors that trigger break in two accident of ships in this context as a new approach the causal relationships and weighting of the factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were analyzed analyzes revealed that critical factors have significant weights in the cause effect diagram as a result of the analysis 18 factors that trigger break in two accident of ships were evaluated by considering the cause and effect group based on the evaluations of experts who have sufficient knowledge and experience about the structure and stability of the ship cargo handling operation hull strength hull damage and materials used in shipbuilding preventive measures were proposed to prevent break in two accidents of ships accordingly cargo specification 0 87 competency of the crew involved in the cargo handling operation 0 78 compatibility of international rules regulations and guidelines about ship safety construction and cargo operation 0 63 heavy weather 0 59 were identified as the most critical factors among the cause group cargo handling operations cargo stowage and cargo securing should be carried out according to the cargo specification considering material safety datasheet of the cargo to minimize the effect of cargo specification a well organized recruitment process should be applied to identify professionally competent employees detailed familiarization procedures and periodic in service training standards should be established for ship shore crew to ensure competent crew is involved in the cargo handling operation in order to comply with the international rules regulations and guidelines about ship safety construction and cargo operation there should be a well organized ship technical management system carried out by competent ship shore crew who have sufficient experience in the profession proper passage planning should be applied taking care weather routing all deck equipment and cargo lashing should be secured to minimize effects of heavy weather condition cargo stowage and operational plan 3 30 ship s age hull and structure condition 3 31 and complying with the ship s planned maintenance system 2 67 were identified as the most critical factors among the effect group in cargo stowage and operational plan the synchronization of cargo and ballast handling operations should be ensured and sf and bm limits of the ship should not be exceeded the hull and structure condition of a ship directly related to the ship s age should be surveyed at regular intervals by a member of high quality classification society details of the ship s survey especially the thickness measurements of the hull should be analyzed properly the ship s crew should fully comply with the planned maintenance system and should not neglect periodical checks of hull and structure of the ship an alternative risk analysis approach was presented for the maritime industry to prevent break in two accident of ships the results of this study can be used by decision makers such as ship class surveyors ship shore crews loading masters naval architecture and marine engineers to analyze and prevent possible ship structural damage and accidents this study also revealed that the fuzzy dematel approach can be used to analyze processes involving danger and cause effect relationship in various sectors future studies can be developed using a multi criteria decision making method to take preventive measures against critical factors identified in this study the study was limited to focusing on break in two accident which is one type of structural accident of ships other types of ship structural accidents can also be analyzed using the same method credit authorship contribution statement ali cem kuzu conceptualization

20506,a nonuniform distribution of internal flow along the offshore riser can lead to transient in plane excitation to predict the global riser response due to slug flow by nonlinear time domain analyses a finite element method is developed in this study by combining the absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf and arbitrary lagrange eulerian ale description this proposed method has the capacity to effectively simulate both the nonuniform gravity distribution of slug flow and geometric nonlinearity of the riser the nodal position and slope vectors described in the global coordinate system avoid the complex coordinate transformation of the elements while the internal fluid is effectively integrated into the framework after the accuracy of the proposed program is verified a kind of steep wave riser swr with internal flow is taken as an example to discuss the effect of slug flow the results show that slug flow can result in large local deformations and lead to variable pattern changes in the bending moment keywords arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf slug flow offshore riser finite element method 1 introduction offshore risers conveying hydrocarbon resources from the seabed to offshore platforms are important subsea pieces of equipment in the oil and gas industry the internal flow of the riser often displays a pattern known as slug flow mixed with gases and liquids the nonuniform slug mass distribution along the riser can result in transient in plane excitation the dynamics of slug flow riser interactions are a complex problem the global response of the riser depends on the slug flow behaviour and slug flow development is influenced by the riser configuration currently some computational fluid dynamics cfd programs for such multiphase flow simulations are available in commercial or open source markets however the flow riser coupling problem is still a challenge ortega et al 2018 developed a coupled code to investigate the influence of unsteady slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers considering that the fluid structure interaction method is complicated and time consuming for riser design implementation of an adequate load model due to such slug flow conditions is needed for prediction of the global riser response by nonlinear time domain analyses loading due to internal fluid flow is normally included in terms of the hydrostatic pressure and mass contribution in global riser analyses slug flow can hence be considered a time dependent variation in internal flow velocity and density at any location there are some mathematical models of the steady slug flow proposed for the riser early hara 1973 established the transverse motion equation of a straight pipe in which slug flow was modelled as a series of gas and liquid pistons moving at a certain frequency patel and seyed 1989 modelled slug flow as a liquid gas piston with density sinusoidal with a harmonic slug frequency over position and time to study the effect of fluid gravity curvature force and coriolis force on the dynamic response of the riser based on patel and seyed s slug model vasquez and abila 2019 and bordalo and morooka 2018 analysed the effect of the slug wavelength and slug velocity on the dynamic response of a catenary riser chatjigeorgiou conducted a series of studies on the dynamic response of risers conveying internal fluid the plug flow model proposed by païdoussis 1998 was applied by chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b to a catenary riser and the results showed that internal single phase fluid did not significantly change the particulars of the response furthermore chatjigeorgiou 2017 formulated equilibrium equations of riser conveying slug flows in which slug flow was modelled as liquid film and gas regions chatjigeorgiou s model was adopted by cabrera miranda and paik 2019 to analyse the impact of the slug on the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state of a steel lazy wave riser recently klaycham et al 2020 modelled slug flow as an internal pulsatile force to investigate the influences of the wave frequencies and slug flow on the large amplitude dynamic characteristics of a riser notably the numerical models of the riser structure in the literature above and most of the other relevant studies païdoussis and li 1993 karagiozis et al 2005 2008 bai et al 2018 ma and srinil 2020 xie et al 2019 were based on eulerian description for eulerian descriptions since the axial response of the element caused by the coriolis force and inertial force is the primary factor the description is generally applicable to small lateral displacement conditions shabana 1997 proposed a finite element modelling method named the absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf this formulation employed a global coordinate system to define the node coordinates to avoid complex coordinate transformations it can accurately describe the coupling between rigid displacements and flexible deformation because slope vectors are used instead of angular coordinates to describe the local rotation form in ancf sereshk and salimi 2011 zhang et al 2019 first applied this method to the modelling of flexible structures with large deformation marine engineering in this study we developed a new modelling framework for an offshore riser conveying slug flow by combining the ancf and ale methods to describe slug induced oscillations the paper is structured as detailed below the fundamental framework of ale ancf and the numerical solution integration scheme are briefly introduced in section 2 to describe the flexible riser with its internal fluid subsequently some cases are studied to check the correction and accuracy of the static and dynamic solutions and slug modelling in section 3 moreover using the ale ancf framework simulations of a steep wave riser swr conveying slug flow with top displacement excitation are implemented in section 4 and the characteristics of such risers are discussed in the following final remarks and conclusions are presented in the conclusion section 2 finite element formulation using ale ancf framework in this section the numerical scheme of the riser global analysis with slug flow is briefly introduced in the ale ancf framework the following assumptions are adopted 1 slug flow is a steadily time varying flow in other words the time averaged mass flow rate of liquid and gas over the period is constant and the inflow velocity of the slug flow is equal to the outflow velocity 2 the slug properties are undisturbed by riser oscillations the slug flow is simplified into one dimensional flow with density varying along the pipe 3 both the slug flow and external fluid are ideal fluids and the friction between the slug flow and pipe wall is neglected the pipe restricts the movement of slug flow in the normal direction and the velocity of slug flow in the tangent direction is given as a boundary condition 4 the euler bernoulli beam assumption is adopted for the pipe and the shear deformation effect is neglected 2 1 material points description of slug flow based on the work by hong et al 2011 the fluid particle has two coordinates material coordinate s and absolution spatial coordinate r x y z which integrates the lagrangian description and eulerian description the material coordinates are used to describe the slug flow properties such as varying density the slug element defined by two control boundaries s 1 and s 2 shown in fig 1 and s is measured along the whole medium starting from the head point for the control interval the local coordinate ξ is defined as 1 ξ 2 s s 1 t s 2 t s 1 t s 2 t then the generalized space coordinates of a material point at time t can be expressed into an absolute coordinate system as 2 r r ξ t the position vector r and slope vector r are selected to be continuous at the node between adjacent elements the position of any material point on the control body can be defined as 3 r n w r n w in which 4 w r 1 τ r 1 τ r 2 τ r 2 τ 5 n n 1 i 3 3 n 2 i 3 3 n 3 i 3 3 n 4 i 3 3 where i 3 3 is the 3 3 identity matrix and the following hermite interpolating polynomials are used in

dimensional control element are represented as 7 w e r 1 τ r 1 τ s 1 r 2 τ r 2 τ s 2 then the velocity and acceleration of an arbitrary point can be deduced from eq 3 by time differentiation directly

the superficial slug velocity v i ωl s 2π when the slug flow velocity is steady the movement of internal liquid in the riser s normal direction depends on the shape function and material coordinates can be expressed with the tangent velocity v i 10 s 1 s v i t s 2 s l e v i t where l e is the length of the slug element by combining eq 8 with eq 10 we can obtain the velocity and acceleration of an arbitrary point on the slug element as 11 r n w 2 v i l e n ξ w r n w 4 v i l e n ξ w 4 v i 2 l e 2 2 n ξ 2 2 v i l e n ξ w we assume that the internal fluid is an incompressible ideal fluid and ignore the fluid viscoelastic force and external force the virtual work equation of internal fluid can be described by d alembert s principle as 12 0 l e δ r τ ρ f a f r d s 0 where a f is sectional area of internal fluid then the following equations are obtained 13 m f w q i 0 14 m f l e 2 1 1 ρ f a f n τ n d ξ 15 q i l e 2 1 1 ρ f a f n τ 4 v i l e n ξ w 4 v i 2 l e 2 2 n ξ 2 2 v i l e n ξ w d ξ where a f is sectional area of the internal fluid m f is the mass matrix of the internal fluid element and q i is the addition generalized inertial force in the proposed model the fluid domain does not need to remesh since the fluid elements and pipe elements share the grid nodes a similar method can be found in hong et al 2011 in addition it can be found from the above derivation that the global coordinate system is employed to avoid the transformation between the local element and global coordinates therefore compared with the classical model païdoussis and li 1993 the proposed model can fully consider slug loads without calculating local acceleration angular acceleration and coriolis acceleration 2 2 pipe element description in ancf in the ale ancf the fluid element and pipe element shared the common grid nodes and the velocity and acceleration of an arbitrary point on the pipe element have the same expression as eq 3 as 16 r n w r n w then the dynamic equation of the cable element is given by shabana 2008 and zhang et al 2019 17 m r w q f q e 0 where m r q f and q e are the mass matrix generalized external force and elastic force of the riser element respectively

the axial strain and curvature formula of a spatial point are defined as 21 ε r 1 κ r r r 3 the element stiffness matrix can be described by the partial derivative of elastic force q e to w as 22 k q

applied loads of offshore riser offshore riser loads include the combined actions of internal fluids and external sea water in this study the external forces applied to the riser include gravity f g buoyancy f b drag force f d and inertia force f i defined as 23 f f g f b f d f i gravity and buoyancy are expressed by 24 f g ρ r a r ρ i a i g e z f b ρ w a o g e z where e z is the unit vector in

velocity and acceleration respectively and s 3 3 and t 3 3 are transfer matrixes defined by the unit tangential vector t 0 as 26 t 0 r r t 3 3 t 0 t 0 t s 3 3 i 3 3 t 3 3 2 4 numerical solution scheme after integrated eq 13 and eq 17 the coupled dynamic equation between the pipe element and the slug element is obtained as 27 m r m f w q i q f q e 0 the newton raphson iterative method is employed to solve the equilibrium equation the iteration format is given by kordkheili et al 2011 28 w n 1 w n δ w n δ w n k w n q e q f q i where n is the number of iterations and n 0 at the initial state the iteration terminates until w meets the convergence condition 29 δ w n w 0 by assembling the kinematics of all pipe and slug elements the equilibrium equation of riser conveying slug flow at time t δt is 30 μ t δ t w t δ t k w t δ t q t δ t where m m r m f is the total mass matrix and the generalized force vector q q i q f q e it should be noted that structural damping is neglected in this study because the more remarkable damping effect is introduced by the hydrodynamic drag force after the newmark method is used the time stepper scheme of the displacement velocity and acceleration at time t

must be updated by using the nodal motion state at each time step 3 validation cases of the ale ancf code 3 1 static and dynamic simulation of a catenary in still water first some numerical simulations of a catenary with two ends hinged in still water are performed in this section to validate the code of the riser by using the ancf method the catenary is divided into 35 elements with uniform length and the catenary parameters are given in table 1 the ancf simulation results are checked by comparison with the lumped mass method lmm in low and langley 2006 the static configuration of the catenary is shown in fig 3 sinusoidal motions in the horizontal x y and vertical z directions are exerted on the top node of the catenary with a displacement amplitude of 10 m and a period of 27 s the time step is set as 0 1 s in the dynamic simulation the results of the static tension and the bending moments along the pipe are presented in fig 4 while the tension time histories of the top node of the riser are shown in fig 5 it can be observed that the static results of the tension and bending moment curves by using ancf are close to those by using lmm with 68 elements however approximately 5 15 are distinguishable at an arc length of approximately 60 m where the largest deformation of the catenary occurs the reason is that ancf modelling is a higher order finite element method to model the geometric nonlinearity similarly the variation trend of the top tension of the ancf model basically stays consistent with that of the lmm model in fig 5 which indicates that the proposed ancf model can simulate the dynamic characteristics of risers reliably and reasonably 3 2 dynamic simulation of a curvature pipe with slug flow second the ale modelling of the inertial force and gravity of slug flow is checked by investigating a rigid curvature pipe the 2d curvature pipe conveying slug flow has two parts with different curvatures as shown in fig 6 and the pipe properties and slug configuration are presented in table 2 the simulation total time is set as 8 s and the time step is 0 05 s in the simulation model the nodes are fixed and set on the initial positions the mesh size of slug flow is important for the fluctuation of slug flow density four meshes are discussed in this study mesh 1 10 elements mesh 2 16 elements mesh 3 20 elements and mesh 4 30 elements three typical positions along the pipe as shown in fig 6 as p1 p2 and p3 are focused the nodal gravity g and nodal inertial force f c of the internal fluid at each node under different mesh schemes are investigated the extreme values and errors of nodal inertial force at p1 and p2 and nodal gravity at p3 are given in table 3 in which t is the slug period the theoretical nodal gravity can be obtained by the density from eq 9 and the theoretical nodal inertial force is calculated by the centripetal force formula f c mv i 2 r at the nodal position where m is the mass of the internal fluid and r is the curvature radius of the pipe when the element number is more than 20 the errors of the inertial force and gravity at the extremum are lower than 0 49 and 0 421 respectively the simulation results become closer to the theoretical results with increasing element number the results of the nodal inertial force distribution and its components in the horizontal and vertical directions f cx and f cz along the pipe at time 2 s are plotted in fig 7 while the slug gravity distribution is presented in fig 8 it is clearly shown that the dynamic results from the present code and the theoretical results are virtually indistinguishable indicating that the adopted level of discretization is sufficient 3 3 dynamic simulation of a free hanging flexible riser experiment after the consistency and accuracy of the riser model and the slug model are validated an experimental model of the flexible riser in zhu et al 2018 is used to investigate the effectiveness of the ale ancf simulation program the main parameters of the flexible riser model are given in table 4 this riser is divided into 68 elements in the numerical simulation notably the superficial velocity and length of slug flow in table 4 are approximate values which are transferred from the volumetric flow rate q of liquid and gas according to vasquez and avila 2019 in zhu s experiment random slug was generated by a buffer vessel and centrifugal pump and we chose the experimental case q l q g 1 322 the root mean squares rms of vibration displacements in the x and z directions are shown in fig 9 a b the instantaneous vibration shape of the riser in 1 s of zhu et al 2018 and the presented model are given in fig 9 c d the spanwise evolution of the rms vibration amplitudes of the numerical simulation are in good agreement with the experiment and the maximum values of the horizontal amplitude and vertical amplitude appear on mark 12 and mark 25 respectively which are the same as the experimental results in addition both the vibration responses of the results of the experimental and proposed models present a transition state from the 2nd order mode to the 3rd order mode from the instantaneous shape of the riser in fig 9 c d it is easy to infer that the simulated and experimental results match closely the time histories of the displacement of mark 12 of the numerical simulation and experiment are shown in fig 10 a and b the main reason for the amplitude difference is that the frequency of slug flow is assumed to be constant in the numerical model which in reality does not occur in the numerical simulation the difference in the response phases of the two directions is constant at 180 which is close to the average value of the phase difference in the experiment the various phase differences in the experiment imply that slug flow is transient and unsteady in reality according to the experiment reported by zhu et al 2019 despite the pressure fluctuations induced by unsteady slug flow a predominant single mode response of a catenary riser due to slug flow is found and this feature suggests that the average characteristic can be employed to approximate the randomness of slug flow ma and srinil 2020 the above analysis indicates that the assumption of steady slug flow is reasonable and the simulation results of the steady slug flow model are in good agreement with the randomized slug experiment 4 case study of steep wave riser 4 1 description of the swr and its internal flow the ale ancf code was implemented on a deep water steep wave riser swr conveying slug flow with both ends hinged at a water depth of 1500 m as shown in fig 11 the vertical and horizontal distances between the top and bottom points are 1495 m and 1550 m respectively an swr configuration can be divided into three main sections the upper catenary section l1 represents the length of the riser from the hang off to the beginning of the buoyancy section middle buoyancy section l2 is the riser length covered with buoyancy modules and lower catenary section l3 represents the riser length from the end of the buoyancy section to the end of the riser the structural parameters of the swr are listed in table 5 the swr conveys an upward combination of api 48 crude oil and methane gas with a liquid phase density of 790 kg m3 and a gas phase density of 0 675 kg m3 it is assumed that the slug length fluctuation amplitude coefficient and mean density of the internal fluid in this study are 100 m 0 25 and 632 135 kg m3 respectively which are selected from one of many possibilities to discuss the influence of the slug flow on the swr two models of the internal flow are implemented one is the slug flow and the other is the uniform flow with the same mean density i e 632 135 kg m3 considering the slug length the swr is divided into 490 elements with uniform length 4 2 static results the results of the static configuration are plotted in fig 12 the static configurations of the two swr models have excellent consistency even at the ends of the buoyancy segment from the enlarged views of the swr configuration around node 205 and node 268 in fig 12 it can also be observed that the configurations are slightly different between the uniform flow condition and the short slug condition as shown in fig 13 the occurrence of short slugs has little effect on the tension force of the swr in addition the slug flow does not change the trend of the bending moment curve but significant local fluctuations are found at the place with large local deformations of the pipe the reason is that even a small curvature deformation can cause a large change in the bending moment due to the large bending stiffness of the swr cross section 4 3 dynamic results in the dynamic simulation a harmonic movement in the horizontal direction is applied on the top node of the riser to simulate the forced motion by the floating platform the excitation motion r x is expressed by 34 r x λ sin 2 π t m t in which the motion amplitude λ and the period τ m are set as 0 5 m and 9 s respectively the computational duration time is 2000 s and the time step is set as 0 05 s the superficial velocities of both uniform flow and slug flow are 2 m s the time histories of the tension at the top and bottom are shown in fig 14 the difference in extreme values of the dynamic tension between the slug and uniform conditions is 1 79 kn at the top node and 1 02 kn at the bottom node the slug flow can cause double frequency superposition of dynamic tension the spanwise evolution of the rms vibration amplitude along the riser length is confirmed in fig 15 both the horizontal amplitude and vertical amplitude peaks appear at the same position which indicates that such a short slug has little effect on the mode shape of the swr while the peak values under the slug flow condition are significantly larger than the corresponding values under uniform flow this suggests that such a short slug amplifies the dynamic structural response which agrees with the results in chatjigeorgiou et al 2017 local modulations due to the multimodal interaction are observed from the circles in fig 15 c the contour plots of the displacements in the horizontal direction u and in the vertical direction v along the swr in the time interval 1800 2000 s are investigated as shown in fig 16 in which the mean components from the steady states under uniform flow condition are removed multifrequency features are observed in fig 16 b d which reveals that the introduction of slug flow leads to variation pattern changes in the swr furthermore under uniform flow condition the travelling waves in both the u and v directions propagate from the top of the swr to the bottom and the travelling waves under slug flow condition range from two swr ends to the middle segment this is because the slug flow from the seabed to the surface platform inverted the direction of wave propagation that occurred in the lower catenary section some frequency analysis was performed on the displacement response in fig 16 using the fast fourier transform fft and the fft diagrams of motion frequencies are illustrated in fig 17 in which the peaks have a normalized spectral density amplitude of unity at the frequency of 0 02 hz the magnitude in the large curvature areas is higher than that in other areas because the inertial force induced by slug flow is dependent on the curvature in addition the spectrum magnitudes of sections l2 and l3 at a frequency of 0 02 hz are close to that of 0 11 hz indicating that the motion of the two sections is dominated by both slug flow action and top excitation this is different from the response characteristics of the l1 section because the buoyancy section can suppress the response of the top excitation this is also the reason why the slug flow only changes the travelling wave characteristics of the lower catenary section in addition the direct component dc values in both fig 17 b and d are not zero which reveals that slug flow changes the dynamic equilibrium position of the swr the contour plots of the bending moment along the swr in the time interval 1800 2000 s are presented in fig 18 it is obvious that the fluctuation range of the bending moment under slug flow is larger than that under uniform flow condition a node 205 which has the largest static bending moment under uniform flow is selected for investigation the difference in the fluctuation amplitudes at node 205 between the two cases is 12 3 knm which is approximately 5 5 of the static bending moment under uniform flow condition as seen from fig 18 b the top of the swr near the excitation point has a small curvature and obvious double frequency superposition while the response frequency of the other area is almost close to the slug frequency this means that the influence of slug flow on the bending moment is more prominent than that of the top excitation and the fluctuation frequency is mostly dominated by slug frequency to discuss the effect of the slug frequency a series of cases with different slug frequencies are simulated by changing the superficial velocity of the slug in the range of 0 5 m s to 6 5 m s while the length is kept at 100 m contour plots of the normalized standard deviation nsd of displacements in slug frequency intervals of 0 005 0 065 hz are shown in fig 19 it is clear that the response of the buoyancy section is more sensitive to the change in slug frequency moreover the maximum or minimum values of nsd occur in the range of 0 025 0 045 hz in fig 19 the slug weight is the prevalent slug load compared to the inertia force since the radius of curvature is large and the slug velocities are not high enough in the present case which is why the dynamic response of swr does not increase with the increases of the inertia force associated with the slug velocity in addition the effect of slug frequency variation on local modulations due to the multimodal interaction is another factor contributing to this phenomenon 5 conclusions an ale ancf framework of finite element modelling of offshore riser conveying slug flow is presented in this paper the pipe element is described by global coordinates and slope vectors and the internal slug flow is modelled by an additional material coordinate this formulation can effectively describe the slug flow load and avoid the complex coordinate transformation of the elements this property is an important feature of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation since most existing incremental methods used for the global analysis of offshore risers lead to a rigid displacement and elastic deformation coupling problem additionally it is convenient to model the slug flow load by combining the ale into the ancf the accuracy and correctness of the riser analysis code have been thoroughly examined and compared with the theoretical results of a catenary line in still water and a curvature pipe conveying slug flow the results show that the ale ancf code is efficient and capable of simulating flexible pipes conveying slug flow furthermore a kind of steep wave riser conveying short slugs is studied as an applied example the impact of short slugs on the static and dynamic characteristics of the swr is analysed by comparison with uniform flow and parameter analysis of the slug frequency is then carried out some important features of the global response of the swr conveying short slugs proposed in this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the influence of the short slugs on the bending moment is more remarkable than that on the axial tension 2 there may exist two dominant frequencies in the riser response exciting frequency and slug frequency and the lower catenary section is dominated by slug flow 3 slug flow can convert the travelling wave direction of the lower catenary section resulting in the travelling wave of swr characterized by propagation from two ends to the middle segment to further explore the complex internal multiphase fluid structure interactions a method of combining cfd with ancf needs to be developed and some physical experiments need to be performed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

20506,a nonuniform distribution of internal flow along the offshore riser can lead to transient in plane excitation to predict the global riser response due to slug flow by nonlinear time domain analyses a finite element method is developed in this study by combining the absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf and arbitrary lagrange eulerian ale description this proposed method has the capacity to effectively simulate both the nonuniform gravity distribution of slug flow and geometric nonlinearity of the riser the nodal position and slope vectors described in the global coordinate system avoid the complex coordinate transformation of the elements while the internal fluid is effectively integrated into the framework after the accuracy of the proposed program is verified a kind of steep wave riser swr with internal flow is taken as an example to discuss the effect of slug flow the results show that slug flow can result in large local deformations and lead to variable pattern changes in the bending moment keywords arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf slug flow offshore riser finite element method 1 introduction offshore risers conveying hydrocarbon resources from the seabed to offshore platforms are important subsea pieces of equipment in the oil and gas industry the internal flow of the riser often displays a pattern known as slug flow mixed with gases and liquids the nonuniform slug mass distribution along the riser can result in transient in plane excitation the dynamics of slug flow riser interactions are a complex problem the global response of the riser depends on the slug flow behaviour and slug flow development is influenced by the riser configuration currently some computational fluid dynamics cfd programs for such multiphase flow simulations are available in commercial or open source markets however the flow riser coupling problem is still a challenge ortega et al 2018 developed a coupled code to investigate the influence of unsteady slug flow on the dynamic response of flexible risers considering that the fluid structure interaction method is complicated and time consuming for riser design implementation of an adequate load model due to such slug flow conditions is needed for prediction of the global riser response by nonlinear time domain analyses loading due to internal fluid flow is normally included in terms of the hydrostatic pressure and mass contribution in global riser analyses slug flow can hence be considered a time dependent variation in internal flow velocity and density at any location there are some mathematical models of the steady slug flow proposed for the riser early hara 1973 established the transverse motion equation of a straight pipe in which slug flow was modelled as a series of gas and liquid pistons moving at a certain frequency patel and seyed 1989 modelled slug flow as a liquid gas piston with density sinusoidal with a harmonic slug frequency over position and time to study the effect of fluid gravity curvature force and coriolis force on the dynamic response of the riser based on patel and seyed s slug model vasquez and abila 2019 and bordalo and morooka 2018 analysed the effect of the slug wavelength and slug velocity on the dynamic response of a catenary riser chatjigeorgiou conducted a series of studies on the dynamic response of risers conveying internal fluid the plug flow model proposed by païdoussis 1998 was applied by chatjigeorgiou 2010a 2010b to a catenary riser and the results showed that internal single phase fluid did not significantly change the particulars of the response furthermore chatjigeorgiou 2017 formulated equilibrium equations of riser conveying slug flows in which slug flow was modelled as liquid film and gas regions chatjigeorgiou s model was adopted by cabrera miranda and paik 2019 to analyse the impact of the slug on the ultimate limit state and fatigue limit state of a steel lazy wave riser recently klaycham et al 2020 modelled slug flow as an internal pulsatile force to investigate the influences of the wave frequencies and slug flow on the large amplitude dynamic characteristics of a riser notably the numerical models of the riser structure in the literature above and most of the other relevant studies païdoussis and li 1993 karagiozis et al 2005 2008 bai et al 2018 ma and srinil 2020 xie et al 2019 were based on eulerian description for eulerian descriptions since the axial response of the element caused by the coriolis force and inertial force is the primary factor the description is generally applicable to small lateral displacement conditions shabana 1997 proposed a finite element modelling method named the absolute nodal coordinate formula ancf this formulation employed a global coordinate system to define the node coordinates to avoid complex coordinate transformations it can accurately describe the coupling between rigid displacements and flexible deformation because slope vectors are used instead of angular coordinates to describe the local rotation form in ancf sereshk and salimi 2011 zhang et al 2019 first applied this method to the modelling of flexible structures with large deformation marine engineering in this study we developed a new modelling framework for an offshore riser conveying slug flow by combining the ancf and ale methods to describe slug induced oscillations the paper is structured as detailed below the fundamental framework of ale ancf and the numerical solution integration scheme are briefly introduced in section 2 to describe the flexible riser with its internal fluid subsequently some cases are studied to check the correction and accuracy of the static and dynamic solutions and slug modelling in section 3 moreover using the ale ancf framework simulations of a steep wave riser swr conveying slug flow with top displacement excitation are implemented in section 4 and the characteristics of such risers are discussed in the following final remarks and conclusions are presented in the conclusion section 2 finite element formulation using ale ancf framework in this section the numerical scheme of the riser global analysis with slug flow is briefly introduced in the ale ancf framework the following assumptions are adopted 1 slug flow is a steadily time varying flow in other words the time averaged mass flow rate of liquid and gas over the period is constant and the inflow velocity of the slug flow is equal to the outflow velocity 2 the slug properties are undisturbed by riser oscillations the slug flow is simplified into one dimensional flow with density varying along the pipe 3 both the slug flow and external fluid are ideal fluids and the friction between the slug flow and pipe wall is neglected the pipe restricts the movement of slug flow in the normal direction and the velocity of slug flow in the tangent direction is given as a boundary condition 4 the euler bernoulli beam assumption is adopted for the pipe and the shear deformation effect is neglected 2 1 material points description of slug flow based on the work by hong et al 2011 the fluid particle has two coordinates material coordinate s and absolution spatial coordinate r x y z which integrates the lagrangian description and eulerian description the material coordinates are used to describe the slug flow properties such as varying density the slug element defined by two control boundaries s 1 and s 2 shown in fig 1 and s is measured along the whole medium starting from the head point for the control interval the local coordinate ξ is defined as 1 ξ 2 s s 1 t s 2 t s 1 t s 2 t then the generalized space coordinates of a material point at time t can be expressed into an absolute coordinate system as 2 r r ξ t the position vector r and slope vector r are selected to be continuous at the node between adjacent elements the position of any material point on the control body can be defined as 3 r n w r n w in which 4 w r 1 τ r 1 τ r 2 τ r 2 τ 5 n n 1 i 3 3 n 2 i 3 3 n 3 i 3 3 n 4 i 3 3 where i 3 3 is the 3 3 identity matrix and the following hermite interpolating polynomials are used in shape function matrix n 6 n 1 1 4 2 ξ ξ 1 2 n 2 l e 8 ξ 1 ξ 1 2 n 3 1 4 2 ξ ξ 1 2 n 4 l e 8 ξ 1 ξ 1 2 combining the nodal material coordinates s 1 and s 2 the absolute nodal coordinates of a three dimensional control element are represented as 7 w e r 1 τ r 1 τ s 1 r 2 τ r 2 τ s 2 then the velocity and acceleration of an arbitrary point can be deduced from eq 3 by time differentiation directly

the superficial slug velocity v i ωl s 2π when the slug flow velocity is steady the movement of internal liquid in the riser s normal direction depends on the shape function and material coordinates can be expressed with the tangent velocity v i 10 s 1 s v i t s 2 s l e v i t where l e is the length of the slug element by combining eq 8 with eq 10 we can obtain the velocity and acceleration of an arbitrary point on the slug element as 11 r n w 2 v i l e n ξ w r n w 4 v i l e n ξ w 4 v i 2 l e 2 2 n ξ 2 2 v i l e n ξ w we assume that the internal fluid is an incompressible ideal fluid and ignore the fluid viscoelastic force and external force the virtual work equation of internal fluid can be described by d alembert s principle as 12 0 l e δ r τ ρ f a f r d s 0 where a f is sectional

ξ where a f is sectional area of the internal fluid m f is the mass matrix of the internal fluid element and q i is the addition generalized inertial force in the proposed model the fluid domain does not need to remesh since the fluid elements and pipe elements share the grid nodes a similar method can be found in hong et al 2011 in addition it can be found from the above derivation that the global coordinate system is employed to avoid the transformation between the local element and global coordinates therefore compared with the classical model païdoussis and li 1993 the proposed model can fully consider slug loads without calculating local acceleration angular acceleration and coriolis acceleration 2 2 pipe element description in ancf in the ale ancf the fluid element and pipe element shared the common grid nodes and the velocity and acceleration of an arbitrary point on the pipe element have the same expression as eq 3 as 16 r n w r n w then the dynamic equation of the

after integrated eq 13 and eq 17 the coupled dynamic equation between the pipe element and the slug element is obtained as 27 m r m f w q i q f q e 0 the newton raphson iterative method is employed to solve the equilibrium equation the iteration format is given by kordkheili et al 2011 28 w n 1 w n δ w n δ w n k w n q e q f q i where n is the number of iterations and n 0 at the initial state the iteration terminates until w meets the convergence condition 29 δ w n w 0 by assembling the kinematics of all pipe and slug elements the equilibrium equation of riser conveying slug flow at time t δt is 30 μ t δ t w t δ t k w t δ t q t δ t where m m r m f is the total mass matrix and the generalized force vector q q i q f q e it should be noted that structural damping is neglected in this study because the more remarkable damping effect is introduced by the hydrodynamic drag force after the newmark method is used the time stepper scheme of the displacement velocity and acceleration at time t

must be updated by using the nodal motion state at each time step 3 validation cases of the ale ancf code 3 1 static and dynamic simulation of a catenary in still water first some numerical simulations of a catenary with two ends hinged in still water are performed in this section to validate the code of the riser by using the ancf method the catenary is divided into 35 elements with uniform length and the catenary parameters are given in table 1 the ancf simulation results are checked by comparison with the lumped mass method lmm in low and langley 2006 the static configuration of the catenary is shown in fig 3 sinusoidal motions in the horizontal x y and vertical z directions are exerted on the top node of the catenary with a displacement amplitude of 10 m and a period of 27 s the time step is set as 0 1 s in the dynamic simulation the results of the static tension and the bending moments along the pipe are presented in fig 4 while the tension time histories of the top node of the riser are shown in fig 5 it can be observed that the static results of the tension and bending moment curves by using ancf are close to those by using lmm with 68 elements however approximately 5 15 are distinguishable at an arc length of approximately 60 m where the largest deformation of the catenary occurs the reason is that ancf modelling is a higher order finite element method to model the geometric nonlinearity similarly the variation trend of the top tension of the ancf model basically stays consistent with that of the lmm model in fig 5 which indicates that the proposed ancf model can simulate the dynamic characteristics of risers reliably and reasonably 3 2 dynamic simulation of a curvature pipe with slug flow second the ale modelling of the inertial force and gravity of slug flow is checked by investigating a rigid curvature pipe the 2d curvature pipe conveying slug flow has two parts with different curvatures as shown in fig 6 and the pipe properties and slug configuration are presented in table 2 the simulation total time is set as 8 s and the time step is 0 05 s in the simulation model the nodes are fixed and set on the initial positions the mesh size of slug flow is important for the fluctuation of slug flow density four meshes are discussed in this study mesh 1 10 elements mesh 2 16 elements mesh 3 20 elements and mesh 4 30 elements three typical positions along the pipe as shown in fig 6 as p1 p2 and p3 are focused the nodal gravity g and nodal inertial force f c of the internal fluid at each node under different mesh schemes are investigated the extreme values and errors of nodal inertial force at p1 and p2 and nodal gravity at p3 are given in table 3 in which t is the slug period the theoretical nodal gravity can be obtained by the density from eq 9 and the theoretical nodal inertial force is calculated by the centripetal force formula f c mv i 2 r at the nodal position where m is the mass of the internal fluid and r is the curvature radius of the pipe when the element number is more than 20 the errors of the inertial force and gravity at the extremum are lower than 0 49 and 0 421 respectively the simulation results become closer to the theoretical results with increasing element number the results of the nodal inertial force distribution and its components in the horizontal and vertical directions f cx and f cz along the pipe at time 2 s are plotted in fig 7 while the slug gravity distribution is presented in fig 8 it is clearly shown that the dynamic results from the present code and the theoretical results are virtually indistinguishable indicating that the adopted level of discretization is sufficient 3 3 dynamic simulation of a free hanging flexible riser experiment after the consistency and accuracy of the riser model and the slug model are validated an experimental model of the flexible riser in zhu et al 2018 is used to investigate the effectiveness of the ale ancf simulation program the main parameters of the flexible riser model are given in table 4 this riser is divided into 68 elements in the numerical simulation notably the superficial velocity and length of slug flow in table 4 are approximate values which are transferred from the volumetric flow rate q of liquid and gas according to vasquez and avila 2019 in zhu s experiment random slug was generated by a buffer vessel and centrifugal pump and we chose the experimental case q l q g 1 322 the root mean squares rms of vibration displacements in the x and z directions are shown in fig 9 a b the instantaneous vibration shape of the riser in 1 s of zhu et al 2018 and the presented model are given in fig 9 c d the spanwise evolution of the rms vibration amplitudes of the numerical simulation are in good agreement with the experiment and the maximum values of the horizontal amplitude and vertical amplitude appear on mark 12 and mark 25 respectively which are the same as the experimental results in addition both the vibration responses of the results of the experimental and proposed models present a transition state from the 2nd order mode to the 3rd order mode from the instantaneous shape of the riser in fig 9 c d it is easy to infer that the simulated and experimental results match closely the time histories of the displacement of mark 12 of the numerical simulation and experiment are shown in fig 10 a and b the main reason for the amplitude difference is that the frequency of slug flow is assumed to be constant in the numerical model which in reality does not occur in the numerical simulation the difference in the response phases of the two directions is constant at 180 which is close to the average value of the phase difference in the experiment the various phase differences in the experiment imply that slug flow is transient and unsteady in reality according to the experiment reported by zhu et al 2019 despite the pressure fluctuations induced by unsteady slug flow a predominant single mode response of a catenary riser due to slug flow is found and this feature suggests that the average characteristic can be employed to approximate the randomness of slug flow ma and srinil 2020 the above analysis indicates that the assumption of steady slug flow is reasonable and the simulation results of the steady slug flow model are in good agreement with the randomized slug experiment 4 case study of steep wave riser 4 1 description of the swr and its internal flow the ale ancf code was implemented on a deep water steep wave riser swr conveying slug flow with both ends hinged at a water depth of 1500 m as shown in fig 11 the vertical and horizontal distances between the top and bottom points are 1495 m and 1550 m respectively an swr configuration can be divided into three main sections the upper catenary section l1 represents the length of the riser from the hang off to the beginning of the buoyancy section middle buoyancy section l2 is the riser length covered with buoyancy modules and lower catenary section l3 represents the riser length from the end of the buoyancy section to the end of the riser the structural parameters of the swr are listed in table 5 the swr conveys an upward combination of api 48 crude oil and methane gas with a liquid phase density of 790 kg m3 and a gas phase density of 0 675 kg m3 it is assumed that the slug length fluctuation amplitude coefficient and mean density of the internal fluid in this study are 100 m 0 25 and 632 135 kg m3 respectively which are selected from one of many possibilities to discuss the influence of the slug flow on the swr two models of the internal flow are implemented one is the slug flow and the other is the uniform flow with the same mean density i e 632 135 kg m3 considering the slug length the swr is divided into 490 elements with uniform length 4 2 static results the results of the static configuration are plotted in fig 12 the static configurations of the two swr models have excellent consistency even at the ends of the buoyancy segment from the enlarged views of the swr configuration around node 205 and node 268 in fig 12 it can also be observed that the configurations are slightly different between the uniform flow condition and the short slug condition as shown in fig 13 the occurrence of short slugs has little effect on the tension force of the swr in addition the slug flow does not change the trend of the bending moment curve but significant local fluctuations are found at the place with large local deformations of the pipe the reason is that even a small curvature deformation can cause a large change in the bending moment due to the large bending stiffness of the swr cross section 4 3 dynamic results in the dynamic simulation a harmonic movement in the horizontal direction is applied on the top node of the riser to simulate the forced motion by the floating platform the excitation motion r x is expressed by 34 r x λ sin 2 π t m t in which the motion amplitude λ and the period τ m are set as 0 5 m and 9 s respectively the computational duration time is 2000 s and the time step is set as 0 05 s the superficial velocities of both uniform flow and slug flow are 2 m s the time histories of the tension at the top and bottom are shown in fig 14 the difference in extreme values of the dynamic tension between the slug and uniform conditions is 1 79 kn at the top node and 1 02 kn at the bottom node the slug flow can cause double frequency superposition of dynamic tension the spanwise evolution of the rms vibration amplitude along the riser length is confirmed in fig 15 both the horizontal amplitude and vertical amplitude peaks appear at the same position which indicates that such a short slug has little effect on the mode shape of the swr while the peak values under the slug flow condition are significantly larger than the corresponding values under uniform flow this suggests that such a short slug amplifies the dynamic structural response which agrees with the results in chatjigeorgiou et al 2017 local modulations due to the multimodal interaction are observed from the circles in fig 15 c the contour plots of the displacements in the horizontal direction u and in the vertical direction v along the swr in the time interval 1800 2000 s are investigated as shown in fig 16 in which the mean components from the steady states under uniform flow condition are removed multifrequency features are observed in fig 16 b d which reveals that the introduction of slug flow leads to variation pattern changes in the swr furthermore under uniform flow condition the travelling waves in both the u and v directions propagate from the top of the swr to the bottom and the travelling waves under slug flow condition range from two swr ends to the middle segment this is because the slug flow from the seabed to the surface platform inverted the direction of wave propagation that occurred in the lower catenary section some frequency analysis was performed on the displacement response in fig 16 using the fast fourier transform fft and the fft diagrams of motion frequencies are illustrated in fig 17 in which the peaks have a normalized spectral density amplitude of unity at the frequency of 0 02 hz the magnitude in the large curvature areas is higher than that in other areas because the inertial force induced by slug flow is dependent on the curvature in addition the spectrum magnitudes of sections l2 and l3 at a frequency of 0 02 hz are close to that of 0 11 hz indicating that the motion of the two sections is dominated by both slug flow action and top excitation this is different from the response characteristics of the l1 section because the buoyancy section can suppress the response of the top excitation this is also the reason why the slug flow only changes the travelling wave characteristics of the lower catenary section in addition the direct component dc values in both fig 17 b and d are not zero which reveals that slug flow changes the dynamic equilibrium position of the swr the contour plots of the bending moment along the swr in the time interval 1800 2000 s are presented in fig 18 it is obvious that the fluctuation range of the bending moment under slug flow is larger than that under uniform flow condition a node 205 which has the largest static bending moment under uniform flow is selected for investigation the difference in the fluctuation amplitudes at node 205 between the two cases is 12 3 knm which is approximately 5 5 of the static bending moment under uniform flow condition as seen from fig 18 b the top of the swr near the excitation point has a small curvature and obvious double frequency superposition while the response frequency of the other area is almost close to the slug frequency this means that the influence of slug flow on the bending moment is more prominent than that of the top excitation and the fluctuation frequency is mostly dominated by slug frequency to discuss the effect of the slug frequency a series of cases with different slug frequencies are simulated by changing the superficial velocity of the slug in the range of 0 5 m s to 6 5 m s while the length is kept at 100 m contour plots of the normalized standard deviation nsd of displacements in slug frequency intervals of 0 005 0 065 hz are shown in fig 19 it is clear that the response of the buoyancy section is more sensitive to the change in slug frequency moreover the maximum or minimum values of nsd occur in the range of 0 025 0 045 hz in fig 19 the slug weight is the prevalent slug load compared to the inertia force since the radius of curvature is large and the slug velocities are not high enough in the present case which is why the dynamic response of swr does not increase with the increases of the inertia force associated with the slug velocity in addition the effect of slug frequency variation on local modulations due to the multimodal interaction is another factor contributing to this phenomenon 5 conclusions an ale ancf framework of finite element modelling of offshore riser conveying slug flow is presented in this paper the pipe element is described by global coordinates and slope vectors and the internal slug flow is modelled by an additional material coordinate this formulation can effectively describe the slug flow load and avoid the complex coordinate transformation of the elements this property is an important feature of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation since most existing incremental methods used for the global analysis of offshore risers lead to a rigid displacement and elastic deformation coupling problem additionally it is convenient to model the slug flow load by combining the ale into the ancf the accuracy and correctness of the riser analysis code have been thoroughly examined and compared with the theoretical results of a catenary line in still water and a curvature pipe conveying slug flow the results show that the ale ancf code is efficient and capable of simulating flexible pipes conveying slug flow furthermore a kind of steep wave riser conveying short slugs is studied as an applied example the impact of short slugs on the static and dynamic characteristics of the swr is analysed by comparison with uniform flow and parameter analysis of the slug frequency is then carried out some important features of the global response of the swr conveying short slugs proposed in this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the influence of the short slugs on the bending moment is more remarkable than that on the axial tension 2 there may exist two dominant frequencies in the riser response exciting frequency and slug frequency and the lower catenary section is dominated by slug flow 3 slug flow can convert the travelling wave direction of the lower catenary section resulting in the travelling wave of swr characterized by propagation from two ends to the middle segment to further explore the complex internal multiphase fluid structure interactions a method of combining cfd with ancf needs to be developed and some physical experiments need to be performed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

20507,the ship speed through water stw is a critical variable for evaluation of ship performance with a cubic relation to the expected shaft power even small inaccuracies in measured stw amplifies to more considerable inaccuracies in the expected shaft power stw is traditionally measured using a speed log more specifically by the doppler acoustic speed log principle the stability and precision of this technique is however questionable particularly when ships are exposed to waves for ships equipped with sensors and instrumentation for measuring propulsion related data the stw can be estimated from in service measurements on the propeller shaft an accuracy of this stw estimate similar to the speed log will increase the overall confidence in the ship performance evaluation in this paper we study the uncertainty in the estimated stw using propeller loading measurements and identify the most critical components of ship instrumentation in order to achieve an estimate of stw with sufficient accuracy the uncertainty analysis includes a fixed pitch and controllable pitch propeller influence from including a thrust sensor and influence from waves on the expected uncertainty in estimated stw the uncertainty in estimated stw is found to be similar to the uncertainty provided by manufacturers of doppler speed logs the propeller pitch angle is found to have a significant contribution to the total uncertainty in stw including thrust measurements decreases the uncertainty in stw by 34 and the uncertainty is found to be not very much affected by the presence of waves keywords speed through water doppler speed log sea current uncertainty monte carlo simulation 1 introduction accurate measurements of ship speed through water stw are important in various applications e g ship performance monitoring hull monitoring optimization of ship design and operation speed trials sea state identification etc relative to fuel consumption or consumed shaft power the stw forms a single explicit proof of how efficient the ship moves through the water in waters with no current the stw equals the speed over ground sog in presence of a longitudinal current speed u v however the stw equals sog u v a traditional ship performance analysis evaluates the performance in terms of ship speed vs power e g as a simple speed power scatter plot by regressing propulsion power on the ship speed or in terms of statistically analyzing the excessive use of power relative to a baseline power requirement mainly calm water in either case the need for accurate stw measurements is stated through the cubic relationship between shaft power and the attainable speed the cubic dependency implies that even small variations in stw will have significant impact on the required propulsion power in terms of ship performance this means that the resolution of detectable changes in performance is directly linked to the uncertainty in the stw with the increased focus on greenhouse gas emissions imo 2009 2011 2012 ittc 2014a stw measurements are becoming more relevant in terms of validating ship performance in real operational conditions as well as for optimizing ship design and operation similar is seen in connection with sea state estimation which has been giving more attention to the extent of which the measurement uncertainty affects the calculation of the motion transfer functions nielsen and dietz 2020 considering how the ship speed relates to propulsion power to the power of three the need for precise and reliable measurements of stw is indisputable the same argument holds for the sake of validating the change in fuel efficiency after installing fuel saving devices such as a bulbous retrofit wave foils fuel saving propeller attachments wing sails or flettner rotors as well as after doing regular hull and propeller cleaning in any case measuring stw with very limited uncertainty is critical for the sake of facilitating deeper knowledge of ship performance not to mention for obtaining a thorough knowledge base for optimization of ship design and operation traditionally speed through water is measured using a speed log over the years a number of techniques are established as industrial practice but the most common are the electromagnetic emcp the acoustic correlation accp and the acoustic doppler adcp current profilers often referred to as speed logs vanden boom and hasselaar 2014 the latter by far the most common the working principle of an adcp is to calculate speed relative to the water from the measured doppler frequency shift in ultrasound pulses transmitted from the hull the pulses are reflected by impurities in the water or density differences layers despite its frequent use several recent studies are concerned with the accuracy of speed logs griffiths and bradley 1998 bos 2016 antola et al 2017 hasselaar and den hollander 2017 taudien and bilen 2018 ikonomakis et al 2019 prytz et al 2019 vanden boom et al 2013 states that the speed log is one of the most inaccurate measurement devices onboard ships the concerns relate to several aspects of the measurement technique first of all as the water flow close to the hull is altered by the presence of the ship it is essential to only consider ultrasound pulses reflected at a certain distance away from the hull at least outside the boundary layer this will vary with draft and trim the speed log might however switch to bottom tracking if the tracking depth is set far beneath the ship and the ship enters shallow waters from a hydrodynamic point of view it is also questionable whether the measured stw actually corresponds to the water passing speed that is relevant for the ship this becomes even more relevant in sailing environments having a large vertical gradient of the prevailing current in other words despite the speed measured by the speed log being accurate at the current tracking depth it is not necessarily the same speed as experienced by the hull additionally comes issues directly concerning the sensor accuracy a speed log needs to be calibrated but the calibration might depend on externalities such as temperature if the speed log experiences sensor drifting in service recalibration will be required there are however no obvious ways of recalibrating a speed log for a ship in service other concerns directly related to the accuracy of a speed log are given intaudien and bilen 2018 addressing the total long term accuracy of six different doppler speed log configurations along with experimental validation in a tow tank taudien and bilen 2018 reports a worst case sum of the separate error terms between 0 550 and 1 005 for a 300 khz leveled doppler instrument while between 0 745 and 1 193 when including 20 pitching of the instrument as mentioned it is commonly experienced that speed logs are not providing sufficient measurement accuracy as the doppler measuring technique assumes that the scatterers in the water are moving in a constant uniform motion the quality of the measurement will degrade along with violating this assumption e g in turbulent flow likewise the measurement accuracy will be influenced by acoustic noise pollution in the surrounding environment from e g breaking waves engine noise and turbulent pressure fluctuations in the flow wanis et al 2010 the measurement accuracy is also influenced by ship motions causing aeration ikonomakis et al 2019 in the presence of air bubbles false reflections of ultrasound pulses might enter the speed log which will have a direct impact on the measured stw along with a growing interest in ship energy efficiency evaluation and emission control it is gradually becoming more common to equip ships with sensors and data acquisition systems in order to do in service monitoring dalheim and steen 2020 with that comes new opportunities to extract valuable information from ships in operation which in turn has helped raise concerns about the accuracy of speed logs recent literature has therefore started focusing on estimating stw using various in service measurement data with the aim of overcoming the erratic behavior of speed logs as well as to provide better accuracy than what is experienced from speed logs antola et al 2017 developed a virtual speed log that combined propulsion related data speed over ground sog speed log data and current forecasts in order to improve the stw measurements the virtual speed log was modeled as a state space model evolving as a random walk the results showed that the model was able to reduce the scatter in stw relative to the forecast stw calculated from sog and the current forecast and that the accuracy was superior compared to speed log data as a general assumption the inflow to the propeller was considered undisturbed i e no wake which is a fairly rough assumption pecoraro et al 2015 secondly the added resistance in wind and waves denoted r δ was assumed small compared to the calm water resistance r c s which means that the observational equation including the added resistance could be solved as a perturbation series in r δ r c s this is also to be considered a rough assumption given the large variations in added resistance experienced by ships having e g a length of approximately 100 m dalheim and steen 2020 further on ikonomakis et al 2019 developed a somewhat similar virtual speed log rather than relying on knowledge of the ship s calm water resistance this virtual speed log combined onboard inertial measurements and external hindcast sea current measurements into a kinematic model of vessel motions in order to estimate the stw the model improved the estimated stw compared to measurements provided by the speed log brandsæter and vanem 2018 validated various regression models to predict a ship s stw based on full scale sensor measurements including environmental forces stw prediction by data regression relies however on a training data set and does not resemble a stw estimation model in the sense of its independency of dedicated stw measurement devices such as speed logs in terms of practical applications as well as for research objectives the stw is a fundamental variable concerning several types of analyses and optimization tasks connected to ship performance considering the sensitivity of stw relative to relevant dependent variables the stw stands out as one of the most important measures onboard a ship with reliable measurements of both stw and sog the one dimensional 1d sea current along the longitudinal axis of the ship can be calculated from the difference in sog and stw recent developments in sea current modeling have resulted in sea current forecast models having high temporal and spatial resolution e g the norwegian coastal model norkyst 800 albretsen et al 2011 such forecast models might provide important input to e g equipment for route planning in the innocurrent project the aim is to address possible ways of reducing fuel consumption by making use of high fidelity sea current forecast models such as the norkyst 800 model with focus on selecting a preferred route in terms of sailing distance and sea current if however the route is to be planned according to a forecast of the sea current it is important to know the uncertainty of the predicted sea current it is only by considering the uncertainty that the route planning tool can make informed decisions regarding the preferred sailing route the sea current forecast models are however depending on data for validating the models the idea of using the ship as a sensor is therefore tempting as the ship can provide a continuous stream of validation data at various locations with access to a large fleet of ships in operation recent advances in sensor fusion technologies makes it even possible to provide a more complete and rather detailed picture of how the sea current varies both temporally and spatially this is a similar application as can be found in research concerning e g environmental monitoring berman et al 2020 even though estimating stw from in service measurements might possibly improve the estimate of stw as compared to speed logs there is a clear gap in knowledge regarding the uncertainties related to such estimates if the intention is to use in service measurements for validation purposes e g for validation of sea current forecast models it is essential to acquire knowledge about the uncertainty in the stw estimation and thereby the longitudinal sea current based on ship in service measurements in this paper we address the uncertainty in estimating stw from in service measurements on the propeller shaft by means of monte carlo simulations a particular focus is on the sensitivity to the individual terms entering the stw model which is necessary in order to identify the most critical parts e g precision of the sensor measurements model test data or external factors such as wind and waves in the end we conclude whether estimating stw from in service measurements is reasonable considering the expected uncertainties 2 case vessel a general cargo multipurpose vessel is used as a case vessel for the estimation of uncertainty in stw and directional sea current the use of a case vessel provides better control over input to the analysis as well as it provides results that is easier to evaluate in a physical manner the vessel is designed by kongsberg maritime as it has an overall length of almost 120m beam and max draft of 20m and 5m respectively and a dead weight of about 5000 dwt the vessel is fitted with a rudder and a single screw controllable pitch propeller the propeller has a diameter of d 4 2 m blade area ratio a e a 0 0 515 and a design pitch ratio of p d 0 7 0 975 the typical service speed of the vessel is about 15 knots the vessel is equipped with an in service monitoring system collecting sensor data from selected vessel equipment the data acquisition system provides measurement data to the data logger which is configured to sample at a frequency of 1 hz the case vessel is amongst other things equipped with a norsub 4000 motion reference unit mru vaf instruments tt sense thrust and torque sensor furuno ds 60 doppler speed log and a furuno gp 150 gps navigator 3 uncertainty in stw 3 1 estimating stw using propeller data the speed through water can be estimated from propulsion related data such as propeller revolutions per minute rpm torque and or thrust the method was probably first described bytelfer 1927 in this paper the method for estimating stw from propeller data is referred to as the stw model a flow chart is given in fig 1 to illustrate the steps in the stw model there are various methods for measuring rpm thrust and torque but most involve the use of either strain gauges or optical sensors or a combination of both for ships prepared for in service monitoring it is quite common to install sensors on the propeller shaft measuring propeller rpm and torque is the most common while including measurements of propeller thrust is still quite exceptional this is naturally a matter of installation costs however the physical properties of the propeller shaft makes it far more challenging to get accurate measurements of propeller thrust as compared to propeller torque for the sake of modeling stw from propeller data while ensuring that the procedure is generic it is most convenient to assume that only rpm and torque is measured on the propeller shaft the main part of the stw model is therefore based on using rpm and torque measurements on the propeller shaft considering the advances in sensor developments it is however an interesting question whether the uncertainty in the stw estimate can be reduced by incorporating thrust measurements into the model various ways of including propeller thrust measurements in stw estimation is therefore presented and discussed in section3 4 as is the significance of including propeller thrust measurements in the stw estimation the performance of a propeller can be expressed through the dimensionless thrust k t 1 and torque k q 2 coefficients for a ship equipped with sensors measuring rpm torque and or thrust the speed of water through the propeller v a can be estimated directly through either k t or k q in combination with the advance number j 3 as well as knowledge of the propeller characteristics open water diagram 1 k t j t ρ n 2 d 4 2 k q j q ρ n 2 d 5 3 j v a n d considering that torque and propeller rpm is measured on the propeller shaft the torque coefficient is calculated according to eq 2 the value of k q is used to find the propeller operating point j by intersecting k q on the k q j curve from the intersected j value the speed of water through the propeller v a is calculated using eq 3 v a is often referred to as advance speed for most practical applications however v a is less than the speed through water v the difference in speed is expressed through the wake fraction w s see eq 4 for a single screw vessel the mean wake factor is typically around 0 2 0 3 pecoraro et al 2015 with a very modest increase with forward speed when estimating stw from measurements on the propeller shaft it is therefore essential that a suitable wake fraction is included in the hydrodynamic model the traditional approach for full scale wake estimation is to scale the model scale wake fraction obtained from the propulsion test and open water test using a suitable scaling procedure for single screw vessels the propeller operates largely within the boundary layer from the hull for which the ittc wake scaling procedure ittc 2017a reproduced in eq 5 is frequently used in the scaling t is the thrust deduction factor which can be calculated from the resistance and the propulsion test and w m is the effective model scale wake fraction c f s and δ c f is the full scale frictional resistance coefficient and roughness correction respectively while c f m is the model scale frictional resistance coefficient for twin screw vessels there is no established practice for wake scaling which in practice often means that the full scale wake is set equal to the model scale wake 4 v a 1 w s v 5 w e t 0 04 w m t 0 04 c f s δ c f c f m the k q j curve is usually established in the open water test by using a scaled model of the propeller occasionally computational fluid dynamics cfd is used to establish the k q j relation the model scale wake fraction can be found by intersecting k t from the propulsion test with the open water k t j curve referred to as thrust identity nevertheless the wake fraction is generally valid in the design condition only which for all practical purposes means calm waters and straight ahead forward speed wake data in off design conditions such as waves are rarely available although it is known that the wake fraction in general is quite dependent on waves and ship motions nakamura and naito 1975 guo et al 2012 sadat hosseini et al 2013 ueno et al 2013 taskar et al 2016 taskar et al 2016 presented a formula for the time varying total wake velocity in waves considering a mean increase in wake from the pitch motion based onfaltinsen et al 1980 as well as a fluctuating part caused by wave induced particle motion and vessel surging based onueno et al 2013 for the sake of estimating stw from propeller data the use of a temporal resolution that evaluates the fluctuating part involving instantaneous particle motion and wave excitations is considered unnecessarily complicated the stw model only considers the mean increase in the wake fraction w η 5 as given in eq 6 for the calculation of wake velocity in waves the forward speed u in the equation should be the low pass filtered surge speed for which the instantaneous surge motions in waves are filtered out the total effective full scale wake fraction in presence of waves is therefore expressed as w s w e w η 5 in the stw model the mean increase in wake is built on potential flow theory and depends on the encounter frequency ω e the pitch amplitude η 5 and the longitudinal distance x from the center of gravity of the ship to the propeller if the ship is equipped with a mru or an inertial measurement unit imu the encounter frequency can be obtained close to real time from the pitch motion by further assuming the pitch motion to be approximately sinusoidal the amplitude η 5 can be approximated from the standard deviation of the pitch motion following eq 9 the case vessel used as reference in this paper has a six degrees of freedom mru installed for other ships lacking equipment for ship motion measurements a real time evaluation of the mean increase in wake fraction is not feasible in such cases the mean increase in wake fraction should either be completely disregarded or the estimation of stw must rather be based on post processing the data disregarding the increase in wake fraction might however give an estimation bias in the stw this will be further discussed in section3 4 during data post processing the mean increase in wake can be calculated based on hindcast wave data for which the encounter frequency is calculated from the wave frequency ω and the wave encounter angle β according to eq 8 the pitch amplitude η 5 can be estimated from the pitch rao obtained from e g linear strip theory calculations from model experiments or by cfd due to the speed dependency in wake fraction the stw estimated from eq 4 should be solved by iteration in terms of calculation performance an initial condition should preferably be given to the full scale wake fraction for instance w s 0 2 for each estimate of stw v a new full scale wake fraction is found and the iteration continues until the change in wake fraction is considered negligible k q j relates to a given propeller pitch angle α if the propeller has controllable pitch k q is rather a function of both j and α i e changing with the propeller pitch angle a set of pitch angles can be tested using cfd or with the scaled propeller model in order to simplify the uncertainty analysis it is however presumed that the stw estimation is active for 100 propeller pitch only for the case vessel this practically includes all standard transit operations as the propeller usually operates at 100 pitch during transit what nevertheless adds uncertainty to the stw estimation is whether the 100 full scale propeller pitch physically corresponds to the 100 model scale propeller pitch experience shows that a small bias between 100 propeller pitch on the vessel compared to the propeller design can be introduced during the propulsion system configuration how this can be modeled in terms of adding uncertainty to the stw estimation is further elaborated in section3 2 6 the stw model can be summarized with these steps referring to the flow chart in fig 1 1 calculate k q from measured torque and rpm on the propeller shaft based on eq 2 2 intersect the k q value on the open water k q j curve to find the advance number j 3 calculate the speed of water through the propeller v a using eq 3 4 assume a total wake fraction w s 5 find the estimated stw by eq 4 6 find the total wake fraction w s as the sum of the following a full scale wake fraction w e b change in wake fraction due to vessel pitching in waves w η 5 following eq 6 7 iterate on step 5 and 6 until w s has converged 8 calculate the final estimated stw from eq 4 6 w η 5 1 1 δ p 0 5 ρ u 2 where 7 δ p ρ 4 ω e 2 η 5 2 x 2 8 ω e ω 1 v ω g cos β 9 η 5 2 σ η 5 3 2 input uncertainties to the stw model the uncertainty in the estimated stw is considered key knowledge in terms of deciding whether the stw model approach to speed determination might increase the overall accuracy of stw data from ships errors in the estimated stw is formed by the uncertainties in the input to the model as well as errors in the modeling assumptions in the following sections each individual input will be thoroughly discussed using the case vessel as a reference the focus is to provide a knowledge base relevant for assigning values to each input uncertainty it is assumed that all uncertainties are zero mean gaussian processes and that all input uncertainties are uncorrelated this is a non conservative assumption which will be discussed each individual input uncertainty forms the parameters of the gaussian processes that is used to construct samples for simulating the stw model the parameters of the gaussian processes are given consecutively in the next sections and summarized in table8 3 2 1 propeller shaft measurements the case vessel is single screw where thrust torque and rpm is measured on the shaft the stw model is however initially based on the propeller shaft torque and rpm measurements only the uncertainty in thrust measurements is yet to be discussed for evaluating the outcomes of incorporating thrust measurements into the stw model the vaf tt sensor specification states the sensor accuracy of thrust torque and rpm measurements as given in table2 error supplied the reference is to full scale deflection fsd which means that the relative measurement accuracy is inverse to the loading no data for the particular installation of the shaft sensor is available the value of fsd is therefore set based on the maximum loading of the main engine the main engine delivers approximately 4000 kw with a maximum of 750 rpm with a gear ratio of 5 25 this means that the torque sensor will measure approximately 260 kn m at maximum loading the fsd is therefore assumed corresponding to 2 260 kn m 520 kn m which means an error of 0 25 1 0 2 520 kn m 1 3 kn m full scale resistance at the design speed and design draft corresponds to approximately 250 kn the thrust sensor fsd is therefore assumed corresponding to 2 250 kn 500 kn which means an error of 1 00 1 0 2 500 kn 5 kn for the rpm sensor the fsd is set equal to the maximum propeller shaft rpm this equals 750 5 25 rpm 143 which means an error of 0 25 1 0 2 143 rpm 0 4 rpm the propeller shaft measurement uncertainty distributions are based on the assumed measurement errors the sample gaussian distributions of thrust torque and rpm is therefore n t 5 for the shaft thrust n q 1 3 for the shaft torque and n n 0 4 for the propeller rotational speed 3 2 2 ship motions ship motion measurements in terms of pitch amplitude η 5 and encounter frequency ω e are used to estimate the mean increase in wake fraction due to waves encounter frequency is not a measurement in itself but can be calculated from the pitch motion measurement by analyzing its frequency content for small waves not capable of exciting vessel pitch motions the encounter frequency analysis will not be feasible yet there is in this case no need for the encounter frequency as the increase in wake fraction is caused by the pitching motion the case vessel is equipped with a norsub 4000 mru measuring the pitch motion the sensor accuracy supplied by the manufacturer is given in table3 it is assumed that the error in the pitch angle measurement is normally distributed around the measurement value this basically means that the measurement is assumed to be unbiased the standard deviation of the normal distribution is approximated to 1 4 of the supplied error which means that 95 of the pitch measurements are assumed to be covered by the accuracy limits supplied by the manufacturer the resulting gaussian distribution of the pitch measurements becomes n η 5 0 02 where η 5 is the instantaneous pitch angle measurement the pitch amplitude is calculated from the standard deviation of the pitch motion following eq 9 the standard deviation of the pitch motion is based on a moving window which ensures sufficient timing between the mean increase in wake fraction and the particular stw estimation the window size is set to 1min or 60 samples considering that the in service monitoring system samples at 1hz the encounter frequency is estimated from the same moving window as the pitch amplitude by running a fast fourier transform fft of the signal no additional uncertainty is added to the encounter frequency which means that the uncertainty in the encounter frequency estimation is directly linked to the uncertainty in the pitch motion measurements 3 2 3 model test data the stw estimation is based on using model test data for estimating wake fraction w m and the open water curve k q j in the open water test k q j is calculated from measured shaft moment shaft frequency and forward speed following eqs 2 and 3 the measurements in the open water test are uncertain which means that k q j is based on uncertain measurements additionally comes the uncertainty in the propeller geometry and the water density during the test the latter mainly a result of uncertainty in water temperature in total the k q j curve has inherent uncertainty that has to be considered when being used for estimating the stw the uncertainty in k q j caused by the uncertainty in shaft moment rotational speed and forward speed can be estimated from repeated open water test measurements for single runs already completed there is however no direct approach for estimating the uncertainty in k q j there is also missing information regarding the accuracy of the water temperature measurement during the open water test as well as the uncertainty in propeller geometry the model scale propeller for the specific case vessel is however manufactured to be geometrically similar to the actual full scale propeller the uncertainty in geometry is therefore only related to inaccuracies in production considering the unavailable information the uncertainty in k q j is rather based on the work published byittc 2014b ittc separates the elementary error sources into calibration data acquisition data reduction and conceptual bias the uncertainty parameters that are used from this work are given in table4 specific for an advance number of j 0 6 the open water test curve k q j is used to determine the operational advance number j based on the operational torque coefficient k q calculated using eq 2 uncertainty in the open water test gives uncertainty to the k q j curve that propagates through j to the estimated stw it is assumed that the measurements in the open water test have constant uncertainty along the entire measurement range which means that it is rather the relative uncertainty that changes along the measurement range with reference to the ittc work ittc 2014b k q j 0 6 is used as a basis for setting the input uncertainty it should also be noted that j 0 6 represents a typical advance number for the case vessel similar as for the other input factors it is assumed that the errors are gaussian distributed around the measurement values for k q j this implies that each point along the curve is gaussian distributed with its specific mean and a constant standard deviation this gives the input distributions n k t j k t j 0 6 0 73 100 for the k t values and n k q j k q j 0 6 0 85 100 for the k q values the specific values of k t j 0 6 and k q j 0 6 are not given for reasons of confidentiality the wake fraction w is used to calculate speed through water from the speed through the propeller following eq 4 based on model scale experiments the model scale wake fraction w m is found by relating the open water test advance number j 0 to the corresponding advance number in the propulsion test the wake fraction is usually given as a constant value or a speed dependent curve w m v because the measurements in the open water test and the propulsion test are uncertain the wake fraction is also uncertain which should be taken into consideration when estimating the stw the uncertainty in w m v follows a similar reasoning as for k q j which implies that there is no direct approach for estimating the uncertainty in w m v based on single runs the uncertainty in w m v is therefore based onittc 2017b summarized in table5 the uncertainty is specific for a froude number of f n 0 21 uncertainty in the open water test and propulsion test gives uncertainty to the w m v data that propagates to the estimated stw as for the open water test it is assumed that the measurements in the propulsion test have constant uncertainty along the entire measurement range with reference to the ittc work ittc 2017b w m v f n 0 21 is used as a basis for setting the input uncertainty v f n 0 21 refers to the ship speed corresponding to f n 0 21 which is not given for reasons of confidentiality it is further assumed that the errors are gaussian distributed around the measurement values for w m v this implies that each point along the curve is gaussian distributed with its specific mean and a constant standard deviation this gives the input distribution n w m v w m v f n 0 21 2 3335 100 the ittc wake scaling procedure is used to estimate the full scale effective calm water wake fraction w e based on the model scale wake fraction see eq 5 the wake scaling has certainly a contribution to the uncertainty in the estimated stw however the process of quantifying the uncertainty in the wake scaling is challenging including such uncertainty without having confidence in whether or not the uncertainty parameters in fact are representative for the wake scaling is therefore considered to be less useful in terms of interpreting the final uncertainty in stw the uncertainty in wake scaling is therefore left to be discussed in the evaluation of the total uncertainty in estimated stw 3 2 4 ship parameters among the inputs to the stw model two variables are referred to as ship parameters these are the propeller diameter d and the longitudinal distance from the propeller to the center of buoyancy cob referred to as the distance l p c it is assumed that the full scale propeller is geometrically similar to the model scale propeller total similarity is however not possible due to machining tolerances in production which will add uncertainty to the stw estimation the only input to the stw model concerning propeller geometry is the propeller diameter ittc 2002 assumes the error in the model diameter to be within 0 1 mm corresponding to 0 044 of the nominal diameter full scale inaccuracies are expected to be larger iso 1981 machining tolerances relevant for the case vessel class i refers to a precision of 0 15 of the propeller diameter this has been assumed for the full scale production in the current study the sampling of the propeller diameter is therefore assumed to follow the gaussian distribution n 4 2 6 3 1 0 3 note that the uncertainty in propeller diameter should be considered a bias factor and is not related to any variable that is measured onboard the ship the stw model can be tuned to overcome this bias factor by a physical end to end calibration which also removes the other uncertainties concerning propeller geometry this will be further discussed in section3 4 regarding the position of the propeller it is assumed that the physical position is fixed relative to the hull the distance l p c from the propeller to the cob might however vary due to a variation in cob with the fore aft draft it is therefore assumed that the total uncertainty in l p c is gathered in the uncertainty in cob the cob can be determined by combining draft measurements with displacement data traditional draft sensor technology is based on pressure tubes located fore and aft this is a simple technique however not very reliable pressure tubes are usually sensitive to waves which at minimum will require the use of a low pass filter the draft readings are however also affected by the forward speed of the vessel it is therefore recommended that draft data is extracted prior to starting a transit operation when the ship moves slowly and operates in sheltered waters dalheim and steen 2020 the case vessel is equipped with pressure tubes measuring draft fore and aft by forming a parametric relation between draft and cob the draft measurements can be used directly to estimate cob and moreover the uncertainty in draft measurements can be propagated to form the uncertainty in the cob the parametric relation is assumed to be linear for the case vessel which means that it can be established based on two sailing conditions i e data from two distinct waterlines the draft conditions are referred to as wl1 and wl2 and are assumed to define the range in which the cob varies it is further assumed that the cob is gaussian distributed around the center of this range and with a standard deviation equal to 1 4 of the range this means that 95 of the cob data will be covered by the selected draft conditions the case vessel cob data is given in table6 where the distance relates to the center between the perpendiculars l p p 2 the resulting parameters for the distribution of l p c becomes n l p 2 5 0845 0 02725 where l p 2 is the distance from l p p 2 to the propeller 3 2 5 environmental parameters the water density ρ enters the stw model in the calculation of k q j in general ρ depends on water temperature t w and salinity s w the international association for the properties of water and steam iapws has developed equations expressing water properties such as water density iapws 2008 this has been used as a reference to express the input uncertainty u ρ to the stw model as given ineq 10 the total uncertainty in ρ depends on the inherent uncertainty in the iapws equation u x uncertainty in temperature u t w and uncertainty in salinity u s w input values toeq 10 are given in table7 for a nominal temperature of t w 15 and salinity of s w 35 10 u ρ u x 2 ρ t u t w 2 ρ s u s w 2 fromioc et al 2010 the estimated uncertainty in standard absolute salinity is u s w 0 007 g kg details about the case vessel temperature sensor and its precision limits specifically were not available it is therefore assumed that the uncertainty in the measured temperature is equal to u t w 0 3 c which is based on a dnv gl approved type of screw in temperature sensor tp8 by noris group gmbh noris automation gmbh 2015 this is also between the two uncertainties used byittc 2011 in the example calculation of uncertainty estimates for saltwater properties in total this gives u ρ 0 0516 which is used as the standard deviation of the water density assuming a nominal temperature of t w 15 c this gives the gaussian distribution n 1026 021 0 0516 as input distribution for ρ to the stw model 3 2 6 propeller pitch angle as previously mentioned the case vessel has a controllable pitch propeller which means that k q j relates to a given propeller pitch angle α the propeller model scale has only been tested at 100 pitch referred to as design pitch as practically all standard transit operations for this case vessel are operated close to 100 pitch the uncertainty analysis of the stw model has been simplified in terms of only taking the k q j curve representing design pitch into consideration there is however some uncertainty that should be added to the stw estimation experience shows that the geometrical 100 full scale propeller pitch not always corresponds to the 100 model scale propeller pitch this bias is usually introduced during the propulsion system configuration when the geometrical position of 100 pitch is adjusted as the propeller is usually fully submerged during this configuration it is challenging to physically measure the geometrical propeller angle not to mention to obtain measurements with high accuracy there is no straightforward method of setting the pitch angle bias limit a precise estimation requires access to a large number of propeller configurations for which the geometrical propeller pitch angles in model and full scale can be compared this has not been attainable which has forced another approach the uncertainty in k q caused by the propeller pitch angle α is referred to as u k q α and is the product of the sensitivity in k q α referred to as k q α and the bias in α referred to as u α this is expressed mathematically ineq 11 k q α is preferably established based on testing the propeller for a number of pitch angles in the present study k q α is rather estimated from standard wageningen b series bernitsas et al 1981 propellers of similar geometry by looking at the change in k q δ k q relative to δ α see eq 11 values for a 4 bladed propeller with blade area ratio a e a 0 0 515 were used more specifically the change in k q was calculated for j 0 6 and pitch ratios p d 0 9745 0 9746 0 9755 the resulting sensitivity parameter was found to be k q α 0 3213 11 u k q α k q α u α 12 k q α δ k q j 0 6 δ α u α ineq 11 refers to the bias limit in the geometrical propeller pitch angle corresponding to 100 pitch as it has not been attainable to quantify u α from actual data it is rather assumed that the propeller pitch follows a gaussian distribution centered at the design pitch with a standard deviation of σ α 3 x 1 0 3 rad 1 in terms of the change in k q caused by the uncertainty in α referred to as δ k q α this standard deviation is mapped through eq 11 to the gaussian distribution δ k q α n 0 9 669 1 0 4 3 2 7 input uncertainty summarized all input parameters that are considered to be uncertain are assumed to be gaussian distributed around its respective nominal value with a standard deviation in order of magnitude relative to the expected uncertainty in the parameter the reasoning behind the resulting input uncertainties have been presented in the previous sections in table8 the distributions of the input parameters are summarized the input uncertainties to the stw model are basically independent of the forward speed of the vessel except for the uncertainty in k q and w that relates to a particular advance number and froude number respectively changes in forward speed will however cause only minor changes in the operating advance number suggesting that the uncertainty in k q might also be considered independent of the forward speed a similar reasoning can be used for the wake fraction that will not change very much with the forward speed which means that the uncertainty in w can be considered independent of the forward speed 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis correspond to a set of statistical methods that examine how a model reacts to a change in its input factors the overall goal is to measure how variations propagate from the input factors to the output i e describing the relative importance of each input in determining the output saltelli et al 2007 the input factor sensitivity can be analyzed at a local or global level the local methods investigate the effect of varying an input around a given point in the input space using the one factor at a time method oat global methods allow concurrent input variation in the complete input space and decompose the overall output variance into contributions from the different input factors the following sections investigate the local and global sensitivity indices of the input factors to the stw model the input to the sensitivity analyses are based on the specifications in table8 as the nominal operating point the values of q 150 and n 108 have been used which represent a typical operating point for the case vessel 3 3 1 local sensitivity the local sensitivity analysis investigates how a small perturbation around the input space value x 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 x k 0 influences the output value y of the stw model y ϕ x 0 for input factors 1 k it consists of estimating 13 a i y x i x 0 x 1 0 x k 0 that characterizes the effect on the estimated stw y caused by a perturbation of the input x i near a nominal value x i 0 the local sensitivity coefficients a i are formally defined as first order partial derivatives of the model output with respect to the input factor x i in this study the partial derivatives are not analytically available and they are therefore approximated through monte carlo simulations and the classical oat approach that is each input factor i 1 k is sampled from its probability distribution while the other k 1 input factors are fixed at their respective nominal values the local sensitivity coefficients are determined by simple linear regression on the stw model response using the ordinary least squares method it is assumed that the influence is approximately linear for all input variables which means that each local sensitivity coefficient is given by the linear regression slope coefficient β i in fact standardized regression coefficients are used such that the sensitivity coefficients can be compared relative to each other the standardization follows eq 14 where σ x and σ y represent the estimated standard deviations of the input and the output respectively in order to assess the goodness of fit to the linear model the r 2 statistics is also calculated a series of monte carlo simulations n 10 000 are run to estimate the local sensitivity coefficients the selection of n is based on a convergence study given in table9 the perturbations around the nominal values are based on the respective uncertainties of the input factors the result of the local sensitivity analysis is given in table10 14 β β σ x σ y the local sensitivity coefficients are established by connecting the output to the input for the coefficients a k q and a w this is however not straightforward as k q and w are functions of j and v respectively k q j consists of k q values for all the advance numbers tested in the open water test while w v consist of wake fractions for all forward speeds tested in the resistance and propulsion test when adding uncertainty to k q and w this means that a set of values are allowed to vary while the result is still just a single output in other words for each sample in the monte carlo simulation multiple values k q j or w v are supposed to be mapped to one single output stw through the sensitivity coefficient but this is not achievable in the analysis of the two local sensitivity coefficients a k q and a w the coefficients are rather based on mapping the average perturbation of k q j and w v to the output variation in the stw a number of strategies are conceivable to construct this average perturbation if polynomial curves are fitted to the k q and w data the average perturbation has to consider the uncertainty in all of the data points the result of this is shown in fig 2 for the k q data for a subset of advance numbers the perturbations in k q i e the uncertainty is shown along the first axis while the resulting perturbation in stw is shown on the second axis each curve represent data for the given j value and the slope is therefore to be considered as the local sensitivity to k q when k q is uncertain at that particular j value what is evident from this figure is that the local influence coefficient is depending on for what j value the uncertainty is included adding uncertainty to data that is more at the center of the j values has a very different effect on the resulting stw as compared to uncertainty added to the lower and higher regions of the j values defining an average resulting perturbation based on all the k q j data is therefore not considered practical not to mention reasonable the chosen strategy is therefore rather to form the average perturbation based on allowing only the two k q values closest to the full scale operating point to be uncertain and perform a linear interpolation between the two nearest k q values instead of including all k q values in a polynomial fit for the wake data the strategy is somewhat different based on model test results it is assumed that the wake fraction is linear to the forward speed the resulting perturbations in stw caused by uncertainty in w is shown in fig 3 similar to the k q data because w v is assumed linear the local sensitivity coefficients behave different from the local sensitivity coefficients of k q j which implies that a w can be established by mapping the average perturbation of w v to the output variation in the stw based on the complete set of w v data all of the local sensitivity coefficients except for a k q and a α are found to be close to one this means that the input standard deviation maps to the standard deviation in stw in a one to one relation with positive or negative signs the estimated r 2 also shows that these sensitivity coefficients are virtually constant the local sensitivity of k q is however less that one which means that the input standard deviation of k q in the open water test is reduced in the curve fit to a lower output standard deviation this seems reasonable as the local sensitivity of k q is based on averaging the perturbations of the two k q values enclosing the operating torque coefficient the local sensitivity of the propeller pitch angle α is also found to be less than one this is also reasonable as the uncertainty in α maps through the k q curve it is therefore concluded that all of the input factors are linear to the stw output 3 3 2 global sensitivity of the input factors the global sensitivity of the input factors is explored using a variance based global sensitivity analysis this type of analysis studies how uncertainty in the output of the stw model can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input factors variance based methods have a long history in sensitivity analysis the work ofsobol 1993 is however considered a milestone the total sensitivity indices that have been used were proposed injansen et al 1994 and further discussed inhomma and saltelli 1996 given a generic model y f x 1 x 2 x k the variance based first order effect for a generic factor x i can be expressed as see the notations on table1 15 v x i e x i y x i x i is the i th input factor and x i is the matrix of all input factors except for x i the associated sensitivity measure first order sensitivity coefficient is expressed as 16 s i v x i e x i y x i v y where v y is the total variance in y given ineq 20 s i is a normalized index which means that the sensitivity coefficients can be compared between various input factors the second variance based measure that is useful is the total effect index s t i expressed as 17 s t i e x i v x i y x i v y s t i measures total effect including higher order effects and interactions of input factor x i the equations decomposing this variance based framework are based on the suggestions bysaltelli et al 2010 as expressed in eqs 18 to 20 in terms of the stw model y is to be considered as the estimated stw while f consolidates all steps in the stw model a b and a b is the generated input data to the stw model generated according to the notations in table1 18 v x i e x i y x i v y 1 2 n j 1 n f b j f a b i j 2 19 e x i v x i y x i 1 2 n j 1 n f a j f a b i j 2 20 v y 1 n j 1 n f a 2 1 n j 1 n f a 2 the resulting first order and total effect indices are shown in fig 4 for the case vessel the figure reveals that the uncertainty in the propeller pitch k q α dominates the uncertainty in the estimated stw with more than 71 of the total uncertainty in stw being described by the propeller pitch next the uncertainty in propeller rpm is found to control almost 12 of the total uncertainty in stw for the controllable pitch propeller the detached uncertainty in stw based on uncertainty in the model test k q data given that the propeller pitch is exact is found to be small while the uncertainty in model scale wake fraction and water density is found to be negligible because the propeller pitch controls the total uncertainty in stw to such an extent it is necessary to investigate the global sensitivity when keeping the propeller pitch fixed that is the uncertainty in full scale propeller pitch would never be zero but zero uncertainty is still used to explore the global sensitivity of the remaining input factors to the stw model the result for the fixed pitch propeller is shown fig 5 it is found that the propeller rpm has the largest contribution to the overall uncertainty in the estimated stw with a dedication of more than 36 of the global uncertainty uncertainty in the propeller diameter and propeller torque follows with contributions of 22 8 and 22 3 respectively when the propeller pitch is fixed the uncertainty in model test k q becomes more prominent while the uncertainty in model wake fraction is still negligible in terms of the contribution to the global uncertainty full scale measurements of propeller rpm are in general more precise compared to torque measurements it is therefore worth noting that the uncertainty in propeller rpm contributes more to the overall uncertainty in stw than the uncertainty in propeller torque it is not unlikely that the uncertainty in measured shaft rpm in fact can be lower than used in this analysis at least one should expect the rpm measurement to be more stable than the torque measurement particularly in terms of sensor drifting over time this might result in the uncertainty in propeller rpm contributing less to the uncertainty in stw compared to the propeller torque 3 4 expected uncertainty when estimating stw using propeller data the case vessel is monte carlo simulated n 10 000 using the stw model in order to establish the expected uncertainty in the estimated stw due to the significant impact from uncertainty in propeller pitch discovered during the sensitivity analysis the vessel is simulated with both a cp and a fp propeller the results are given in table11 the expected stw is estimated to 12 3 knots with a standard deviation of 0 45 knots which corresponds to 3 7 of the estimated stw by introducing a fp propeller this uncertainty is reduced to 0 24 knots or 1 96 of the estimated stw which corresponds to a 53 5 reduction in total uncertainty the significant reduction in stw uncertainty obtained by fixed propeller pitch angle is explained by the significant sensitivity index of k q α as shown in fig 4 for both the cp and the fp propeller the resulting stw is gaussian distributed with excess kurtosis k v and skewness s k p approximately zero in terms of the expected uncertainty in estimated stw the distributions have larger standard deviations compared to the doppler speed log errors reported bytaudien and bilen 2018 it should however be emphasized thattaudien and bilen 2018 analyzed the various doppler speed log configurations in a towing tank experiment giving an experimental environment much easier to control for doppler instruments providing stw data on full scale ships some of the basic assumptions of the doppler principle are violated such as the uniformity of the flow and the presence of acoustic noise pollution beneath the hull the furuno ds 60 doppler sonar mounted on the case vessel is stated to serve an accuracy of the water tracking speed equal to 1 or 0 1 knots whichever is greater at the chosen service condition of the case vessel the accuracy of the ds 60 is therefore 1 this is better than the standard deviation of stw obtained by the stw model particularly if the ship is equipped with a cp propeller 3 7 but also if the propeller is fixed pitch 1 96 based on experience in full scale data analysis of various ships combined with the considerable amount of concerns in the literature related to the accuracy of speed logs there are however reasons to believe that the precision limits supplied by the manufacturer are far too optimistic meaning that full scale stw measurements in fact are more uncertain than what has been stated this is basically a challenge concerning most kinds of sensor equipment for which the precision limits supplied by the manufacturer are to be considered as the absolute lower limits of the sensor uncertainty in real operating conditions the given precision limits are usually impossible to fulfill this motivates the use of stw estimation from propeller data at the very least the stw estimate could be used for validation of the speed log measurements from a continuous observation of the signal giving notice if e g the speed log signal drifts or develops calibration issues or the stw model could run in parallel to other stw measurements such as the speed log to produce a sort of best estimate from averaging the two stw values as long as the two inputs have similar uncertainty the average of the two will have lower uncertainty than each of the individual inputs on the other hand it is not unlikely that the individual stw model sensor accuracies can be further improved without adding much extra cost to equipment and installation this could certainly lead to stw estimation from propeller data becoming more attractive particularly if the precision of sensors having large sensitivity indices such as propeller rpm and torque is improved similar to the traditional speed log the stw model does not consider individual sensor calibration errors which might introduce additional bias in the stw estimation the most primitive way of avoiding calibration errors are by running a physical end to end calibration over a sufficient amount of time the average sog and stw should be equal this however requires that no specific equipment for sailing optimization in terms of ocean current is installed sog is usually measured using high quality gps sensors that provide sog with very high accuracy in the end to end calibration a total calibration factor can therefore be added to the stw model based on the difference in average sog and stw over time 3 4 1 including thrust measurements for sensor installations on ships also including measurements of propeller thrust there are various ways of including these measurements in the stw model one method is to use the thrust measurement solely by equating the thrust t and thrust deduction t with the ship resistance r t as ineq 21 to find the ship speed from the speed dependent resistance this method is only applicable in sailing conditions for which the ship resistance is known which generally means calm water if the sailing condition includes wind and or waves a number of corrections have to be made to the calm water resistance as described indalheim and steen 2020 such corrections will introduce additional uncertainty to the stw estimation that is expected to result in a more uncertain stw estimate compared to the more traditional approach that has been presented 21 t 1 t r t a second way to include the thrust measurements is to use thrust identity and find the advance number based on the k t j curve the rest of the procedure is identical to the stw model based on torque identity as already described because the relative uncertainty in measured thrust is assumed to be four times the relative uncertainty in torque it is however not recommended to solely depend on the thrust measurement thrust sensors are also experienced to be more unstable than torque sensors the thrust measurement might however reduce the overall uncertainty in the stw estimation if it is rather working as a supplement to the torque measurement the can be achieved by forming two separate calculations of the advance number j by using both torque and thrust identity and establish the final advance number from the average of the two advance numbers the same case vessel and operational condition has been used to study the effect of including the thrust measurement in terms of numbers this means q 150 knm n 108 rpm and t 204 kn the additional input uncertainties to the stw model are listed in table12 the case vessel is still monte carlo simulated n 10 000 using the extended stw model including thrust measurements in the stw model affects the global sensitivity indices the updated indices including the additional input variables from table12 are shown in fig 6 for both the cp and the fp propeller for the cp propeller the uncertainty in k q caused by uncertainty in propeller pitch k q α still has a definite contribution to the overall uncertainty attributing approximately 40 of the global sensitivity the sensitivity to uncertainty in k t caused by uncertainty in propeller pitch k t α has a much lower contribution amounting to approximately 10 this is similar to the contribution from the uncertainty in the thrust sensor for the fp propeller the global sensitivity index of the thrust measurement is however significantly higher amounting to approximately 24 this makes the thrust measurements the second largest contributor to the global uncertainty in estimated stw the monte carlo simulation is also used to establish the new expected uncertainty in the estimated stw based on the extended stw model the results are given in table13 the expected stw is still estimated to 12 3 knots but the standard deviation of estimated stw is reduced to approximately 0 3 knots for the cp propeller as a result of including thrust measurements this corresponds to 2 4 of the estimated stw by using a fp propeller the total uncertainty is 0 21 knots or 1 67 of the estimated stw which corresponds to 30 6 reduction in total uncertainty compared to the cp propeller the reduction in stw uncertainty obtained by including thrust measurements into the stw model is significantly larger when the propeller has a controllable pitch in numbers the uncertainty is reduced from 3 65 to 2 40 for the cp propeller while from 1 96 to 1 67 for the fp propeller this coincides with the uncertainty factors concerning propeller pitch k q α and k t α for which the uncertainty in k q is almost 16 higher than the uncertainty in k t when evaluated relative to the nominal k q and k t values k t is about 5 7 times higher than k q at the selected operating point of the case vessel including thrust measurements into the stw model is therefore considered to be more attractive for cp propeller installations simply because potential bias in the full scale propeller pitch angle corresponding to model scale 100 pitch has less contribution to uncertainty in stw when it is affecting k t compared to k q careful monitoring of the thrust sensor is however recommended considering potential issues with such types of sensors that is experienced on full scale installations 3 4 2 including waves waves will begin to excite ship motions when the size of the waves relative to the ship increases faltinsen et al 1980 explained how vessel pitching induces velocities that will increase the effective inflow speed to the propeller this effect can be expressed as a change in wake fraction as ineq 6 the stw model has been extended to include the effect of waves on the wake fraction based on a measured pitching motion η 5 the amplitude of the motion η 5 is estimated following eq 9 and the encounter frequency ω e is estimated from the frequency of the pitch motion the case vessel is monte carlo simulated n 10 000 using the stw model including waves the pitch motion is pure sinusoidal including noise according to the mru uncertainty parameters given in table8 the amplitude of the sinusoid is set to 5 the longitudinal distance from the cob to the propeller l p c is sampled from the distribution given in the same table the new sensitivity indices including η 5 and l p c are shown in fig 7 for both the cp and the fp propeller the contribution from the uncertainty in the wave related input variables to the total uncertainty is however found to be negligible with small numbers that may just as well be caused by numerical errors as being actual contributions to the uncertainty in stw initially it may seem odd that the waves have such a small effect on the global uncertainty however considering the small effect the wake fraction has on the global uncertainty the limited contribution from waves on stw uncertainty becomes more reasonable in short when the pitch motion amplitude is 5 the mean increase in water inflow speed to the propeller is small relative to the calm water wake fraction which means that the additional uncertainty caused by the wave related input variables is cut down the wake correction in waves will affect the estimated stw but it will not contribute to additional uncertainty in the estimated stw because the wave related input variables have limited influence on the uncertainty in stw the resulting uncertainty parameters of the stw model output including waves are not given 3 4 3 uncertainty in scaling of model scale wake fraction the stw model is based on assuming no uncertainty in the scaling of the wake fraction this should not be construed as an assertion that the scaling procedure is not uncertain it is certainly uncertain however it is found to be very hard to construct an associated uncertainty from which the input to stw model can be sampled from this means that instead of including some uncertainty that is rather questionable the resulting uncertainty in the stw model should be evaluated knowing that uncertainty in the wake scaling procedure is omitted with that in mind there are ways to ensure that the uncertainty in the wake scaling procedure in fact can be neglected by using principles of speed trials the full scale wake fraction can be calibrated from in service measurements dubois and binns 2018 such that the uncertainty in the full scale wake fraction vanishes during speed trials double runs are performed in order to account for current such that sog in theory can be considered equal to the stw by estimating the water speed through the propeller following the principle of the stw model the relative difference in sog and the estimated speed can be assigned an inaccurate full scale wake fraction the estimated error between the calculated full scale wake fraction and the scaled model wake fraction can then be used as a calibration factor for the error in the scaling procedure if the speed trials are performed at a single speed only the error in wake scaling have to be assumed independent of the forward speed note however that during the speed trial procedure the calibration factor is in fact considering every possible inaccuracy introduced during the propeller inflow speed estimation such as the propeller geometry torque sensor calibration issues etc it is therefore recommended to ensure that the sensors are properly calibrated prior to this full scale wake calibration stating that uncertainty in wake scaling goes to zero is probably too optimistic however performing a full scale wake calibration means that the uncertainty introduced through the wake scaling is reduced 4 conclusions through monte carlo simulations of the case vessel using a simple speed through water stw model it is found that the estimated stw has somewhat higher uncertainty than the uncertainty specified by suppliers of traditional doppler speed logs experience in full scale data analysis combined with concerns in the literature related to the accuracy of speed logs nevertheless gives the impression that the stw model may provide similar uncertainty as the speed logs controllable pitch cp propellers are however found to be challenging in terms of the accuracy of the estimated stw as the uncertainty in full scale propeller pitch is found to have a significant contribution to the total uncertainty in stw the uncertainty in propeller pitch is not related to manufacturing but rather the process of configuring the geometrical pitch angle corresponding to 100 pitch in the model tests the extended stw model including thrust measurements has shown that the stw estimation will benefit from including thrust measurements particularly for cp propellers for which it has been found that thrust measurements may decrease the uncertainty in estimated stw by 34 3 ships are however rarely equipped with thrust sensors so the general recommendation is therefore to use the stw model for ships with fixed pitch fp propellers based on the simulations literature and experience it is expected that the stw model can provide stw data with similar accuracy as doppler speed logs therefore by using the stw model in combination with a speed log e g by averaging between the two measurements the uncertainty in the estimated stw can be reduced further improvement of the estimated stw from propeller data will require that input variables having large contribution to the total uncertainty in estimated stw can be measured more precisely for cp propellers this basically means ensuring that the full scale 100 pitch is identical to the pitch angle that has been tested in model scale or by numerical simulations for fp propellers this means that the sensors measuring rpm and torque should be improved in the presence of waves doppler speed logs can be erratic and unstable small misplacements of the doppler beam relative to its best position may cause erratic behavior of the speed measurements either caused by the waves itself or as a result of ship motions that generate air bubbles or acoustic interference with the pulses from the speed log for some ships it is inevitable to get erratic speed measurements in waves the uncertainty of the stw model on the other hand including the change in wake fraction when the ship moves in pitch was found not to be very much affected by the pitch motion it is therefore reasonable to rely more on the estimated stw from propeller data when waves are exciting ship motions compared to speed logs particularly if the speed log already has been providing unstable measurements in waves while the proposed method to estimate stw from propeller data is not sensitive to the effect of hull fouling it is suspect to influence of propeller fouling a correction for the effect of propeller fouling should be introduced in the future since propeller fouling typically develops slowly a long term trend in the propeller data might be used to correct for this effect however further work is required here credit authorship contribution statement øyvind øksnes

20507,the ship speed through water stw is a critical variable for evaluation of ship performance with a cubic relation to the expected shaft power even small inaccuracies in measured stw amplifies to more considerable inaccuracies in the expected shaft power stw is traditionally measured using a speed log more specifically by the doppler acoustic speed log principle the stability and precision of this technique is however questionable particularly when ships are exposed to waves for ships equipped with sensors and instrumentation for measuring propulsion related data the stw can be estimated from in service measurements on the propeller shaft an accuracy of this stw estimate similar to the speed log will increase the overall confidence in the ship performance evaluation in this paper we study the uncertainty in the estimated stw using propeller loading measurements and identify the most critical components of ship instrumentation in order to achieve an estimate of stw with sufficient accuracy the uncertainty analysis includes a fixed pitch and controllable pitch propeller influence from including a thrust sensor and influence from waves on the expected uncertainty in estimated stw the uncertainty in estimated stw is found to be similar to the uncertainty provided by manufacturers of doppler speed logs the propeller pitch angle is found to have a significant contribution to the total uncertainty in stw including thrust measurements decreases the uncertainty in stw by 34 and the uncertainty is found to be not very much affected by the presence of waves keywords speed through water doppler speed log sea current uncertainty monte carlo simulation 1 introduction accurate measurements of ship speed through water stw are important in various applications e g ship performance monitoring hull monitoring optimization of ship design and operation speed trials sea state identification etc relative to fuel consumption or consumed shaft power the stw forms a single explicit proof of how efficient the ship moves through the water in waters with no current the stw equals the speed over ground sog in presence of a longitudinal current speed u v however the stw equals sog u v a traditional ship performance analysis evaluates the performance in terms of ship speed vs power e g as a simple speed power scatter plot by regressing propulsion power on the ship speed or in terms of statistically analyzing the excessive use of power relative to a baseline power requirement mainly calm water in either case the need for accurate stw measurements is stated through the cubic relationship between shaft power and the attainable speed the cubic dependency implies that even small variations in stw will have significant impact on the required propulsion power in terms of ship performance this means that the resolution of detectable changes in performance is directly linked to the uncertainty in the stw with the increased focus on greenhouse gas emissions imo 2009 2011 2012 ittc 2014a stw measurements are becoming more relevant in terms of validating ship performance in real operational conditions as well as for optimizing ship design and operation similar is seen in connection with sea state estimation which has been giving more attention to the extent of which the measurement uncertainty affects the calculation of the motion transfer functions nielsen and dietz 2020 considering how the ship speed relates to propulsion power to the power of three the need for precise and reliable measurements of stw is indisputable the same argument holds for the sake of validating the change in fuel efficiency after installing fuel saving devices such as a bulbous retrofit wave foils fuel saving propeller attachments wing sails or flettner rotors as well as after doing regular hull and propeller cleaning in any case measuring stw with very limited uncertainty is critical for the sake of facilitating deeper knowledge of ship performance not to mention for obtaining a thorough knowledge base for optimization of ship design and operation traditionally speed through water is measured using a speed log over the years a number of techniques are established as industrial practice but the most common are the electromagnetic emcp the acoustic correlation accp and the acoustic doppler adcp current profilers often referred to as speed logs vanden boom and hasselaar 2014 the latter by far the most common the working principle of an adcp is to calculate speed relative to the water from the measured doppler frequency shift in ultrasound pulses transmitted from the hull the pulses are reflected by impurities in the water or density differences layers despite its frequent use several recent studies are concerned with the accuracy of speed logs griffiths and bradley 1998 bos 2016 antola et al 2017 hasselaar and den hollander 2017 taudien and bilen 2018 ikonomakis et al 2019 prytz et al 2019 vanden boom et al 2013 states that the speed log is one of the most inaccurate measurement devices onboard ships the concerns relate to several aspects of the measurement technique first of all as the water flow close to the hull is altered by the presence of the ship it is essential to only consider ultrasound pulses reflected at a certain distance away from the hull at least outside the boundary layer this will vary with draft and trim the speed log might however switch to bottom tracking if the tracking depth is set far beneath the ship and the ship enters shallow waters from a hydrodynamic point of view it is also questionable whether the measured stw actually corresponds to the water passing speed that is relevant for the ship this becomes even more relevant in sailing environments having a large vertical gradient of the prevailing current in other words despite the speed measured by the speed log being accurate at the current tracking depth it is not necessarily the same speed as experienced by the hull additionally comes issues directly concerning the sensor accuracy a speed log needs to be calibrated but the calibration might depend on externalities such as temperature if the speed log experiences sensor drifting in service recalibration will be required there are however no obvious ways of recalibrating a speed log for a ship in service other concerns directly related to the accuracy of a speed log are given intaudien and bilen 2018 addressing the total long term accuracy of six different doppler speed log configurations along with experimental validation in a tow tank taudien and bilen 2018 reports a worst case sum of the separate error terms between 0 550 and 1 005 for a 300 khz leveled doppler instrument while between 0 745 and 1 193 when including 20 pitching of the instrument as mentioned it is commonly experienced that speed logs are not providing sufficient measurement accuracy as the doppler measuring technique assumes that the scatterers in the water are moving in a constant uniform motion the quality of the measurement will degrade along with violating this assumption e g in turbulent flow likewise the measurement accuracy will be influenced by acoustic noise pollution in the surrounding environment from e g breaking waves engine noise and turbulent pressure fluctuations in the flow wanis et al 2010 the measurement accuracy is also influenced by ship motions causing aeration ikonomakis et al 2019 in the presence of air bubbles false reflections of ultrasound pulses might enter the speed log which will have a direct impact on the measured stw along with a growing interest in ship energy efficiency evaluation and emission control it is gradually becoming more common to equip ships with sensors and data acquisition systems in order to do in service monitoring dalheim and steen 2020 with that comes new opportunities to extract valuable information from ships in operation which in turn has helped raise concerns about the accuracy of speed logs recent literature has therefore started focusing on estimating stw using various in service measurement data with the aim of overcoming the erratic behavior of speed logs as well as to provide better accuracy than what is experienced from speed logs antola et al 2017 developed a virtual speed log that combined propulsion related data speed over ground sog speed log data and current forecasts in order to improve the stw measurements the virtual speed log was modeled as a state space model evolving as a random walk the results showed that the model was able to reduce the scatter in stw relative to the forecast stw calculated from sog and the current forecast and that the accuracy was superior compared to speed log data as a general assumption the inflow to the propeller was considered undisturbed i e no wake which is a fairly rough assumption pecoraro et al 2015 secondly the added resistance in wind and waves denoted r δ was assumed small compared to the calm water resistance r c s which means that the observational equation including the added resistance could be solved as a perturbation series in r δ r c s this is also to be considered a rough assumption given the large variations in added resistance experienced by ships having e g a length of approximately 100 m dalheim and steen 2020 further on ikonomakis et al 2019 developed a somewhat similar virtual speed log rather than relying on knowledge of the ship s calm water resistance this virtual speed log combined onboard inertial measurements and external hindcast sea current measurements into a kinematic model of vessel motions in order to estimate the stw the model improved the estimated stw compared to measurements provided by the speed log brandsæter and vanem 2018 validated various regression models to predict a ship s stw based on full scale sensor measurements including environmental forces stw prediction by data regression relies however on a training data set and does not resemble a stw estimation model in the sense of its independency of dedicated stw measurement devices such as speed logs in terms of practical applications as well as for research objectives the stw is a fundamental variable concerning several types of analyses and optimization tasks connected to ship performance considering the sensitivity of stw relative to relevant dependent variables the stw stands out as one of the most important measures onboard a ship with reliable measurements of both stw and sog the one dimensional 1d sea current along the longitudinal axis of the ship can be calculated from the difference in sog and stw recent developments in sea current modeling have resulted in sea current forecast models having high temporal and spatial resolution e g the norwegian coastal model norkyst 800 albretsen et al 2011 such forecast models might provide important input to e g equipment for route planning in the innocurrent project the aim is to address possible ways of reducing fuel consumption by making use of high fidelity sea current forecast models such as the norkyst 800 model with focus on selecting a preferred route in terms of sailing distance and sea current if however the route is to be planned according to a forecast of the sea current it is important to know the uncertainty of the predicted sea current it is only by considering the uncertainty that the route planning tool can make informed decisions regarding the preferred sailing route the sea current forecast models are however depending on data for validating the models the idea of using the ship as a sensor is therefore tempting as the ship can provide a continuous stream of validation data at various locations with access to a large fleet of ships in operation recent advances in sensor fusion technologies makes it even possible to provide a more complete and rather detailed picture of how the sea current varies both temporally and spatially this is a similar application as can be found in research concerning e g environmental monitoring berman et al 2020 even though estimating stw from in service measurements might possibly improve the estimate of stw as compared to speed logs there is a clear gap in knowledge regarding the uncertainties related to such estimates if the intention is to use in service measurements for validation purposes e g for validation of sea current forecast models it is essential to acquire knowledge about the uncertainty in the stw estimation and thereby the longitudinal sea current based on ship in service measurements in this paper we address the uncertainty in estimating stw from in service measurements on the propeller shaft by means of monte carlo simulations a particular focus is on the sensitivity to the individual terms entering the stw model which is necessary in order to identify the most critical parts e g precision of the sensor measurements model test data or external factors such as wind and waves in the end we conclude whether estimating stw from in service measurements is reasonable considering the expected uncertainties 2 case vessel a general cargo multipurpose vessel is used as a case vessel for the estimation of uncertainty in stw and directional sea current the use of a case vessel provides better control over input to the analysis as well as it provides results that is easier to evaluate in a physical manner the vessel is designed by kongsberg maritime as it has an overall length of almost 120m beam and max draft of 20m and 5m respectively and a dead weight of about 5000 dwt the vessel is fitted with a rudder and a single screw controllable pitch propeller the propeller has a diameter of d 4 2 m blade area ratio a e a 0 0 515 and a design pitch ratio of p d 0 7 0 975 the typical service speed of the vessel is about 15 knots the vessel is equipped with an in service monitoring system collecting sensor data from selected vessel equipment the data acquisition system provides measurement data to the data logger which is configured to sample at a frequency of 1 hz the case vessel is amongst other things equipped with a norsub 4000 motion reference unit mru vaf instruments tt sense thrust and torque sensor furuno ds 60 doppler speed log and a furuno gp 150 gps navigator 3 uncertainty in stw 3 1 estimating stw using propeller data the speed through water can be estimated from propulsion related data such as propeller revolutions per minute rpm torque and or thrust the method was probably first described bytelfer 1927 in this paper the method for estimating stw from propeller data is referred to as the stw model a flow chart is given in fig 1 to illustrate the steps in the stw model there are various methods for measuring rpm thrust and torque but most involve the use of either strain gauges or optical sensors or a combination of both for ships prepared for in service monitoring it is quite common to install sensors on the propeller shaft measuring propeller rpm and torque is the most common while including measurements of propeller thrust is still quite exceptional this is naturally a matter of installation costs however the physical properties of the propeller shaft makes it far more challenging to get accurate measurements of propeller thrust as compared to propeller torque for the sake of modeling stw from propeller data while ensuring that the procedure is generic it is most convenient to assume that only rpm and torque is measured on the propeller shaft the main part of the stw model is therefore based on using rpm and torque measurements on the propeller shaft considering the advances in sensor developments it is however an interesting question whether the uncertainty in the stw estimate can be reduced by incorporating thrust measurements into the model various ways of including propeller thrust measurements in stw estimation is therefore presented and discussed in section3 4 as is the significance of including propeller thrust measurements in the stw estimation the performance of a propeller can be expressed through the dimensionless thrust k t 1 and torque k q 2 coefficients for a ship equipped with sensors measuring rpm torque and or thrust the speed of water through the propeller v a can be estimated directly through either k t or k q in combination with the advance number j 3 as well as knowledge of the propeller characteristics open water diagram 1 k t j t ρ n 2 d 4 2 k q j q ρ n 2 d 5 3 j v a n d considering that torque and propeller rpm is measured on the propeller shaft the torque coefficient is calculated according to eq 2 the value of k q is used to find the propeller operating point j by intersecting k q on the k q j curve from the intersected j value the speed of water through the propeller v a is calculated using eq 3 v a is often referred to as advance speed for most practical applications however v a is less than the speed through water v the difference in speed is expressed through the wake fraction w s see eq 4 for a single screw vessel the mean wake factor is typically around 0 2 0 3 pecoraro et al 2015 with a very modest increase with forward speed when estimating stw from measurements on the propeller shaft it is therefore essential that a suitable wake fraction is included in the hydrodynamic model the traditional approach for full scale wake estimation is to scale the model scale wake fraction obtained from the propulsion test and open water test using a suitable scaling procedure for single screw vessels the propeller operates largely within the boundary layer from the hull for which the ittc wake scaling procedure ittc 2017a reproduced in eq 5 is frequently used in the scaling t is the thrust deduction factor which can be calculated from the resistance and the propulsion test and w m is the effective model scale wake fraction c f s and δ c f is the full scale frictional resistance coefficient and roughness correction respectively while c f m is the model scale frictional resistance coefficient for twin screw vessels there is no established practice for wake scaling which in practice often means that the full scale wake is set equal to the model scale wake 4 v a 1 w s v 5 w e t 0 04 w m t 0 04 c f s δ c f c f m the k q j curve is usually established in the open water test by using a scaled model of the propeller occasionally computational fluid dynamics cfd is used to establish the k q j relation the model scale wake fraction can be found by intersecting k t from the propulsion test with the open water k t j curve referred to as thrust identity nevertheless the wake fraction is generally valid in the design condition only which for all practical purposes means calm waters and straight ahead forward speed wake data in off design conditions such as waves are rarely available although it is known that the wake fraction in general is quite dependent on waves and ship motions nakamura and naito 1975 guo et al 2012 sadat hosseini et al 2013 ueno et al 2013 taskar et al 2016 taskar et al 2016 presented a formula for the time varying total wake velocity in waves considering a mean increase in wake from the pitch motion based onfaltinsen et al 1980 as well as a fluctuating part caused by wave induced particle motion and vessel surging based onueno et al 2013 for the sake of estimating stw from propeller data the use of a temporal resolution that evaluates the fluctuating part involving instantaneous particle motion and wave excitations is considered unnecessarily complicated the stw model only considers the mean increase in the wake fraction w η 5 as given in eq 6 for the calculation of wake velocity in waves the forward speed u in the equation should be the low pass filtered surge speed for which the instantaneous surge motions in waves are filtered out the total effective full scale wake fraction in presence of waves is therefore expressed as w s w e w η 5 in the stw model the mean increase in wake is built on potential flow theory and depends on the encounter frequency ω e the pitch amplitude η 5 and the longitudinal distance x from the center of gravity of the ship to the propeller if the ship is equipped with a mru or an inertial measurement unit imu the encounter frequency can be obtained close to real time from the pitch motion by further assuming the pitch motion to be approximately sinusoidal the amplitude η 5 can be approximated from the standard deviation of the pitch motion following eq 9 the case vessel used as reference in this paper has a six degrees of freedom mru installed for other ships lacking equipment for ship motion measurements a real time evaluation of the mean increase in wake fraction is not feasible in such cases the mean increase in wake fraction should either be completely disregarded or the estimation of stw must rather be based on post processing the data disregarding the increase in wake fraction might however give an estimation bias in the stw this will be further discussed in section3 4 during data post processing the mean increase in wake can be calculated based on hindcast wave data for which the encounter frequency is calculated from the wave frequency ω and the wave encounter angle β according to eq 8 the pitch amplitude η 5 can be estimated from the pitch rao obtained from e g linear strip theory calculations from model experiments or by cfd due to the speed dependency in wake fraction the stw estimated from eq 4 should be solved by iteration in terms of calculation performance an initial condition should preferably be given to the full scale wake fraction for instance w s 0 2 for each estimate of stw v a new full scale wake fraction is found and the iteration continues until the change in wake fraction is considered negligible k q j relates to a given propeller pitch angle α if the propeller has controllable pitch k q is rather a function of both j and α i e changing with the propeller pitch angle a set of pitch angles can be tested using cfd or with the scaled propeller model in order to simplify the uncertainty analysis it is however presumed that the stw estimation is active for 100 propeller pitch only for the case vessel this practically includes all standard transit operations as the propeller usually operates at 100 pitch during transit what nevertheless adds uncertainty to the stw estimation is whether the 100 full scale propeller pitch physically corresponds to the 100 model scale propeller pitch experience shows that a small bias between 100 propeller pitch on the vessel compared to the propeller design can be introduced during the propulsion system configuration how this can be modeled in terms of adding uncertainty to the stw estimation is further elaborated in section3 2 6 the stw model can be summarized with these steps referring to the flow chart in fig 1 1 calculate k q from measured torque and rpm on the propeller shaft based on eq 2 2 intersect the k q value on the open water k q j curve to find the advance number j 3 calculate the speed of water through the propeller v a using eq 3 4 assume a total wake fraction w s 5 find the estimated stw by eq 4 6 find the total wake fraction w s as the sum of the following a full scale wake fraction w e b change in wake fraction due to vessel pitching in waves w η 5 following eq 6 7 iterate on step 5 and 6 until w s has converged 8 calculate the final estimated stw from eq 4 6 w η 5 1 1 δ p 0 5 ρ u 2 where 7 δ p ρ 4 ω e 2 η 5 2 x 2 8 ω e ω 1 v ω g cos β 9 η 5 2 σ η 5 3 2 input uncertainties to the stw model the uncertainty in the estimated stw is considered key knowledge in terms of deciding whether the stw model approach to speed determination might increase the overall accuracy of stw data from ships errors in the estimated stw is formed by the uncertainties in the input to the model as well as errors in the modeling assumptions in the following sections each individual input will be thoroughly discussed using the case vessel as a reference the focus is to provide a knowledge base relevant for assigning values to each input uncertainty it is assumed that all uncertainties are zero mean gaussian processes and that all input uncertainties are uncorrelated this is a non conservative assumption which will be discussed each individual input uncertainty forms the parameters of the gaussian processes that is used to construct samples for simulating the stw model the parameters of the gaussian processes are given consecutively in the next sections and summarized in table8 3 2 1 propeller shaft measurements the case vessel is single screw where thrust torque and rpm is measured on the shaft the stw model is however initially based on the propeller shaft torque and rpm measurements only the uncertainty in thrust measurements is yet to be discussed for evaluating the outcomes of incorporating thrust measurements into the stw model the vaf tt sensor specification states the sensor accuracy of thrust torque and rpm measurements as given in table2 error supplied the reference is to full scale deflection fsd which means that the relative measurement accuracy is inverse to the loading no data for the particular installation of the shaft sensor is available the value of fsd is therefore set based on the maximum loading of the main engine the main engine delivers approximately 4000 kw with a maximum of 750 rpm with a gear ratio of 5 25 this means that the torque sensor will measure approximately 260 kn m at maximum loading the fsd is therefore assumed corresponding to 2 260 kn m 520 kn m which means an error of 0 25 1 0 2 520 kn m 1 3 kn m full scale resistance at the design speed and design draft corresponds to approximately 250 kn the thrust sensor fsd is therefore assumed corresponding to 2 250 kn 500 kn which means an error of 1 00 1 0 2 500 kn 5 kn for the rpm sensor the fsd is set equal to the maximum propeller shaft rpm this equals 750 5 25 rpm 143 which means an error of 0 25 1 0 2 143 rpm 0 4 rpm the propeller shaft measurement uncertainty distributions are based on the assumed measurement errors the sample gaussian distributions of thrust torque and rpm is therefore n t 5 for the shaft thrust n q 1 3 for the shaft torque and n n 0 4 for the propeller rotational speed 3 2 2 ship motions ship motion measurements in terms of pitch amplitude η 5 and encounter frequency ω e are used to estimate the mean increase in wake fraction due to waves encounter frequency is not a measurement in itself but can be calculated from the pitch motion measurement by analyzing its frequency content for small waves not capable of exciting vessel pitch motions the encounter frequency analysis will not be feasible yet there is in this case no need for the encounter frequency as the increase in wake fraction is caused by the pitching motion the case vessel is equipped with a norsub 4000 mru measuring the pitch motion the sensor accuracy supplied by the manufacturer is given in table3 it is assumed that the error in the pitch angle measurement is normally distributed around the measurement value this basically means that the measurement is assumed to be unbiased the standard deviation of the normal distribution is approximated to 1 4 of the supplied error which means that 95 of the pitch measurements are assumed to be covered by the accuracy limits supplied by the manufacturer the resulting gaussian distribution of the pitch measurements becomes n η 5 0 02 where η 5 is the instantaneous pitch angle measurement the pitch amplitude is calculated from the standard deviation of the pitch motion following eq 9 the standard deviation of the pitch motion is based on a moving window which ensures sufficient timing between the mean increase in wake fraction and the particular stw estimation the window size is set to 1min or 60 samples considering that the in service monitoring system samples at 1hz the encounter frequency is estimated from the same moving window as the pitch amplitude by running a fast fourier transform fft of the signal no additional uncertainty is added to the encounter frequency which means that the uncertainty in the encounter frequency estimation is directly linked to the uncertainty in the pitch motion measurements 3 2 3 model test data the stw estimation is based on using model test data for estimating wake fraction w m and the open water curve k q j in the open water test k q j is calculated from measured shaft moment shaft frequency and forward speed following eqs 2 and 3 the measurements in the open water test are uncertain which means that k q j is based on uncertain measurements additionally comes the uncertainty in the propeller geometry and the water density during the test the latter mainly a result of uncertainty in water temperature in total the k q j curve has inherent uncertainty that has to be considered when being used for estimating the stw the uncertainty in k q j caused by the uncertainty in shaft moment rotational speed and forward speed can be estimated from repeated open water test measurements for single runs already completed there is however no direct approach for estimating the uncertainty in k q j there is also missing information regarding the accuracy of the water temperature measurement during the open water test as well as the uncertainty in propeller geometry the model scale propeller for the specific case vessel is however manufactured to be geometrically similar to the actual full scale propeller the uncertainty in geometry is therefore only related to inaccuracies in production considering the unavailable information the uncertainty in k q j is rather based on the work published byittc 2014b ittc separates the elementary error sources into calibration data acquisition data reduction and conceptual bias the uncertainty parameters that are used from this work are given in table4 specific for an advance number of j 0 6 the open water test curve k q j is used to determine the operational advance number j based on the operational torque coefficient k q calculated using eq 2 uncertainty in the open water test gives uncertainty to the k q j curve that propagates through j to the estimated stw it is assumed that the measurements in the open water test have constant uncertainty along the entire measurement range which means that it is rather the relative uncertainty that changes along the measurement range with reference to the ittc work ittc 2014b k q j 0 6 is used as a basis for setting the input uncertainty it should also be noted that j 0 6 represents a typical advance number for the case vessel similar as for the other input factors it is assumed that the errors are gaussian distributed around the measurement values for k q j this implies that each point along the curve is gaussian distributed with its specific mean and a constant standard deviation this gives the input distributions n k t j k t j 0 6 0 73 100 for the k t values and n k q j k q j 0 6 0 85 100 for the k q values the specific values of k t j 0 6 and k q j 0 6 are not given for reasons of confidentiality the wake fraction w is used to calculate speed through water from the speed through the propeller following eq 4 based on model scale experiments the model scale wake fraction w m is found by relating the open water test advance number j 0 to the corresponding advance number in the propulsion test the wake fraction is usually given as a constant value or a speed dependent curve w m v because the measurements in the open water test and the propulsion test are uncertain the wake fraction is also uncertain which should be taken into consideration when estimating the stw the uncertainty in w m v follows a similar reasoning as for k q j which implies that there is no direct approach for estimating the uncertainty in w m v based on single runs the uncertainty in w m v is therefore based onittc 2017b summarized in table5 the uncertainty is specific for a froude number of f n 0 21 uncertainty in the open water test and propulsion test gives uncertainty to the w m v data that propagates to the estimated stw as for the open water test it is assumed that the measurements in the propulsion test have constant uncertainty along the entire measurement range with reference to the ittc work ittc 2017b w m v f n 0 21 is used as a basis for setting the input uncertainty v f n 0 21 refers to the ship speed corresponding to f n 0 21 which is not given for reasons of confidentiality it is further assumed that the errors are gaussian distributed around the measurement values for w m v this implies that each point along the curve is gaussian distributed with its specific mean and a constant standard deviation this gives the input distribution n w m v w m v f n 0 21 2 3335 100 the ittc wake scaling procedure is used to estimate the full scale effective calm water wake fraction w e based on the model scale wake fraction see eq 5 the wake scaling has certainly a contribution to the uncertainty in the estimated stw however the process of quantifying the uncertainty in the wake scaling is challenging including such uncertainty without having confidence in whether or not the uncertainty parameters in fact are representative for the wake scaling is therefore considered to be less useful in terms of interpreting the final uncertainty in stw the uncertainty in wake scaling is therefore left to be discussed in the evaluation of the total uncertainty in estimated stw 3 2 4 ship parameters among the inputs to the stw model two variables are referred to as ship parameters these are the propeller diameter d and the longitudinal distance from the propeller to the center of buoyancy cob referred to as the distance l p c it is assumed that the full scale propeller is geometrically similar to the model scale propeller total similarity is however not possible due to machining tolerances in production which will add uncertainty to the stw estimation the only input to the stw model concerning propeller geometry is the propeller diameter ittc 2002 assumes the error in the model diameter to be within 0 1 mm corresponding to 0 044 of the nominal diameter full scale inaccuracies are expected to be larger iso 1981 machining tolerances relevant for the case vessel class i refers to a precision of 0 15 of the propeller diameter this has been assumed for the full scale production in the current study the sampling of the propeller diameter is therefore assumed to follow the gaussian distribution n 4 2 6 3 1 0 3 note that the uncertainty in propeller diameter should be considered a bias factor and is not related to any variable that is measured onboard the ship the stw model can be tuned to overcome this bias factor by a physical end to end calibration which also removes the other uncertainties concerning propeller geometry this will be further discussed in section3 4 regarding the position of the propeller it is assumed that the physical position is fixed relative to the hull the distance l p c from the propeller to the cob might however vary due to a variation in cob with the fore aft draft it is therefore assumed that the total uncertainty in l p c is gathered in the uncertainty in cob the cob can be determined by combining draft measurements with displacement data traditional draft sensor technology is based on pressure tubes located fore and aft this is a simple technique however not very reliable pressure tubes are usually sensitive to waves which at minimum will require the use of a low pass filter the draft readings are however also affected by the forward speed of the vessel it is therefore recommended that draft data is extracted prior to starting a transit operation when the ship moves slowly and operates in sheltered waters dalheim and steen 2020 the case vessel is equipped with pressure tubes measuring draft fore and aft by forming a parametric relation between draft and cob the draft measurements can be used directly to estimate cob and moreover the uncertainty in draft measurements can be propagated to form the uncertainty in the cob the parametric relation is assumed to be linear for the case vessel which means that it can be established based on two sailing conditions i e data from two distinct waterlines the draft conditions are referred to as wl1 and wl2 and are assumed to define the range in which the cob varies it is further assumed that the cob is gaussian distributed around the center of this range and with a standard deviation equal to 1 4 of the range this means that 95 of the cob data will be covered by the selected draft conditions the case vessel cob data is given in table6 where the distance relates to the center between the perpendiculars l p p 2 the resulting parameters for the distribution of l p c becomes n l p 2 5 0845 0 02725 where l p 2 is the distance from l p p 2 to the propeller 3 2 5 environmental parameters the water density ρ enters the stw model in the calculation of k q j in general ρ depends on water temperature t w and salinity s w the international association for the properties of water and steam iapws has developed equations expressing water properties such as water density iapws 2008 this has been used as a reference to express the input uncertainty u ρ to the stw model as given ineq 10 the total uncertainty in ρ depends on the inherent uncertainty in the iapws equation u x uncertainty in temperature u t w and uncertainty in salinity u s w input values toeq 10 are given in table7 for a nominal temperature of t w 15 and salinity of s w 35 10 u ρ u x 2 ρ t u t w 2 ρ s u s w 2 fromioc et al 2010 the estimated uncertainty in standard absolute salinity is u s w 0 007 g kg details about the case vessel temperature sensor and its precision limits specifically were not available it is therefore assumed that the uncertainty in the measured temperature is equal to u t w 0 3 c which is based on a dnv gl approved type of screw in temperature sensor tp8 by noris group gmbh noris automation gmbh 2015 this is also between the two uncertainties used byittc 2011 in the example calculation of uncertainty estimates for saltwater properties in total this gives u ρ 0 0516 which is used as the standard deviation of the water density assuming a nominal temperature of t w 15 c this gives the gaussian distribution n 1026 021 0 0516 as input distribution for ρ to the stw model 3 2 6 propeller pitch angle as previously mentioned the case vessel has a controllable pitch propeller which means that k q j relates to a given propeller pitch angle α the propeller model scale has only been tested at 100 pitch referred to as design pitch as practically all standard transit operations for this case vessel are operated close to 100 pitch the uncertainty analysis of the stw model has been simplified in terms of only taking the k q j curve representing design pitch into consideration there is however some uncertainty that should be added to the stw estimation experience shows that the geometrical 100 full scale propeller pitch not always corresponds to the 100 model scale propeller pitch this bias is usually introduced during the propulsion system configuration when the geometrical position of 100 pitch is adjusted as the propeller is usually fully submerged during this configuration it is challenging to physically measure the geometrical propeller angle not to mention to obtain measurements with high accuracy there is no straightforward method of setting the pitch angle bias limit a precise estimation requires access to a large number of propeller configurations for which the geometrical propeller pitch angles in model and full scale can be compared this has not been attainable which has forced another approach the uncertainty in k q caused by the propeller pitch angle α is referred to as u k q α and is the product of the sensitivity in k q α referred to as k q α and the bias in α referred to as u α this is expressed mathematically ineq 11 k q α is preferably established based on testing the propeller for a number of pitch angles in the present study k q α is rather estimated from standard wageningen b series bernitsas et al 1981 propellers of similar geometry by looking at the change in k q δ k q relative to δ α see eq 11 values for a 4 bladed propeller with blade area ratio a e a 0 0 515 were used more specifically the change in k q was calculated for j 0 6 and pitch ratios p d 0 9745 0 9746 0 9755 the resulting sensitivity parameter was found to be k q α 0 3213 11 u k q α k q α u α 12 k q α δ k q j 0 6 δ α u α ineq 11 refers to the bias limit in the geometrical propeller pitch angle corresponding to 100 pitch as it has not been attainable to quantify u α from actual data it is rather assumed that the propeller pitch follows a gaussian distribution centered at the design pitch with a standard deviation of σ α 3 x 1 0 3 rad 1 in terms of the change in k q caused by the uncertainty in α referred to as δ k q α this standard deviation is mapped through eq 11 to the gaussian distribution δ k q α n 0 9 669 1 0 4 3 2 7 input uncertainty summarized all input parameters that are considered to be uncertain are assumed to be gaussian distributed around its respective nominal value with a standard deviation in order of magnitude relative to the expected uncertainty in the parameter the reasoning behind the resulting input uncertainties have been presented in the previous sections in table8 the distributions of the input parameters are summarized the input uncertainties to the stw model are basically independent of the forward speed of the vessel except for the uncertainty in k q and w that relates to a particular advance number and froude number respectively changes in forward speed will however cause only minor changes in the operating advance number suggesting that the uncertainty in k q might also be considered independent of the forward speed a similar reasoning can be used for the wake fraction that will not change very much with the forward speed which means that the uncertainty in w can be considered independent of the forward speed 3 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis correspond to a set of statistical methods that examine how a model reacts to a change in its input factors the overall goal is to measure how variations propagate from the input factors to the output i e describing the relative importance of each input in determining the output saltelli et al 2007 the input factor sensitivity can be analyzed at a local or global level the local methods investigate the effect of varying an input around a given point in the input space using the one factor at a time method oat global methods allow concurrent input variation in the complete input space and decompose the overall output variance into contributions from the different input factors the following sections investigate the local and global sensitivity indices of the input factors to the stw model the input to the sensitivity analyses are based on the specifications in table8 as the nominal operating point the values of q 150 and n 108 have been used which represent a typical operating point for the case vessel 3 3 1 local sensitivity the local sensitivity analysis investigates how a small perturbation around the input space value x 0 x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 x k 0 influences the output value y of the stw model y ϕ x 0 for input factors 1 k it consists of estimating 13 a i y x i x 0 x 1 0 x k 0 that characterizes the effect on the estimated stw y caused by a perturbation of the input x i near a nominal value x i 0 the local sensitivity coefficients a i are formally defined as first order partial derivatives of the model output with respect to the input factor x i in this study the partial derivatives are not analytically available and they are therefore approximated through monte carlo simulations and the classical oat approach that is each input factor i 1 k is sampled from its probability distribution while the other k 1 input factors are fixed at their respective nominal values the local sensitivity coefficients are determined by simple linear regression on the stw model response using the ordinary least squares method it is assumed that the influence is approximately linear for all input variables which means that each local sensitivity coefficient is given by the linear regression slope coefficient β i in fact standardized regression coefficients are used such that the sensitivity coefficients can be compared relative to each other the standardization follows eq 14 where σ x and σ y represent the estimated standard deviations of the input and the output respectively in order to assess the goodness of fit to the linear model the r 2 statistics is also calculated a series of monte carlo simulations n 10 000 are run to estimate the local sensitivity coefficients the selection of n is based on a convergence study given in table9 the perturbations around the nominal values are based on the respective uncertainties of the input factors the result of the local sensitivity analysis is given in table10 14 β β σ x σ y the local sensitivity coefficients are established by connecting the output to the input for the coefficients a k q and a w this is however not straightforward as k q and w are functions of j and v respectively k q j consists of k q values for all the advance numbers tested in the open water test while w v consist of wake fractions for all forward speeds tested in the resistance and propulsion test when adding uncertainty to k q and w this means that a set of values are allowed to vary while the result is still just a single output in other words for each sample in the monte carlo simulation multiple values k q j or w v are supposed to be mapped to one single output stw through the sensitivity coefficient but this is not achievable in the analysis of the two local sensitivity coefficients a k q and a w the coefficients are rather based on mapping the average perturbation of k q j and w v to the output variation in the stw a number of strategies are conceivable to construct this average perturbation if polynomial curves are fitted to the k q and w data the average perturbation has to consider the uncertainty in all of the data points the result of this is shown in fig 2 for the k q data for a subset of advance numbers the perturbations in k q i e the uncertainty is shown along the first axis while the resulting perturbation in stw is shown on the second axis each curve represent data for the given j value and the slope is therefore to be considered as the local sensitivity to k q when k q is uncertain at that particular j value what is evident from this figure is that the local influence coefficient is depending on for what j value the uncertainty is included adding uncertainty to data that is more at the center of the j values has a very different effect on the resulting stw as compared to uncertainty added to the lower and higher regions of the j values defining an average resulting perturbation based on all the k q j data is therefore not considered practical not to mention reasonable the chosen strategy is therefore rather to form the average perturbation based on allowing only the two k q values closest to the full scale operating point to be uncertain and perform a linear interpolation between the two nearest k q values instead of including all k q values in a polynomial fit for the wake data the strategy is somewhat different based on model test results it is assumed that the wake fraction is linear to the forward speed the resulting perturbations in stw caused by uncertainty in w is shown in fig 3 similar to the k q data because w v is assumed linear the local sensitivity coefficients behave different from the local sensitivity coefficients of k q j which implies that a w can be established by mapping the average perturbation of w v to the output variation in the stw based on the complete set of w v data all of the local sensitivity coefficients except for a k q and a α are found to be close to one this means that the input standard deviation maps to the standard deviation in stw in a one to one relation with positive or negative signs the estimated r 2 also shows that these sensitivity coefficients are virtually constant the local sensitivity of k q is however less that one which means that the input standard deviation of k q in the open water test is reduced in the curve fit to a lower output standard deviation this seems reasonable as the local sensitivity of k q is based on averaging the perturbations of the two k q values enclosing the operating torque coefficient the local sensitivity of the propeller pitch angle α is also found to be less than one this is also reasonable as the uncertainty in α maps through the k q curve it is therefore concluded that all of the input factors are linear to the stw output 3 3 2 global sensitivity of the input factors the global sensitivity of the input factors is explored using a variance based global sensitivity analysis this type of analysis studies how uncertainty in the output of the stw model can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input factors variance based methods have a long history in sensitivity analysis the work ofsobol 1993 is however considered a milestone the total sensitivity indices that have been used were proposed injansen et al 1994 and further discussed inhomma and saltelli 1996 given a generic model y f x 1 x 2 x k the variance based first order effect for a generic factor x i can be expressed as see the notations on table1 15 v x i e x i y x i x i is the i th input factor and x i is the matrix of all input factors except for x i the associated sensitivity measure first order sensitivity coefficient is expressed as 16 s i v x i e x i y x i v y where v y is the total variance in y given ineq 20 s i is a normalized index which means that the sensitivity coefficients can be compared between various input factors the second variance based measure that is useful is the total effect index s t i expressed as 17 s t i e x i v x i y x i v y s t i measures total effect including higher order effects and interactions of input factor x i the equations decomposing this variance based framework are based on the suggestions bysaltelli et al 2010 as expressed in eqs 18 to 20 in terms of the stw model y is to be considered as the estimated stw while f consolidates all steps in the stw model a b and a b is the generated input data to the stw model generated according to the notations in table1 18 v x i e x i y x i v y 1 2 n j 1 n f b j f a b i j 2 19 e x i v x i y x i 1 2 n j 1 n f a j f a b i j 2 20 v y 1 n j 1 n f a 2 1 n j 1 n f a 2 the resulting first order and total effect indices are shown in fig 4 for the case vessel the figure reveals that the uncertainty in the propeller pitch k q α dominates the uncertainty in the estimated stw with more than 71 of the total uncertainty in stw being described by the propeller pitch next the uncertainty in propeller rpm is found to control almost 12 of the total uncertainty in stw for the controllable pitch propeller the detached uncertainty in stw based on uncertainty in the model test k q data given that the propeller pitch is exact is found to be small while the uncertainty in model scale wake fraction and water density is found to be negligible because the propeller pitch controls the total uncertainty in stw to such an extent it is necessary to investigate the global sensitivity when keeping the propeller pitch fixed that is the uncertainty in full scale propeller pitch would never be zero but zero uncertainty is still used to explore the global sensitivity of the remaining input factors to the stw model the result for the fixed pitch propeller is shown fig 5 it is found that the propeller rpm has the largest contribution to the overall uncertainty in the estimated stw with a dedication of more than 36 of the global uncertainty uncertainty in the propeller diameter and propeller torque follows with contributions of 22 8 and 22 3 respectively when the propeller pitch is fixed the uncertainty in model test k q becomes more prominent while the uncertainty in model wake fraction is still negligible in terms of the contribution to the global uncertainty full scale measurements of propeller rpm are in general more precise compared to torque measurements it is therefore worth noting that the uncertainty in propeller rpm contributes more to the overall uncertainty in stw than the uncertainty in propeller torque it is not unlikely that the uncertainty in measured shaft rpm in fact can be lower than used in this analysis at least one should expect the rpm measurement to be more stable than the torque measurement particularly in terms of sensor drifting over time this might result in the uncertainty in propeller rpm contributing less to the uncertainty in stw compared to the propeller torque 3 4 expected uncertainty when estimating stw using propeller data the case vessel is monte carlo simulated n 10 000 using the stw model in order to establish the expected uncertainty in the estimated stw due to the significant impact from uncertainty in propeller pitch discovered during the sensitivity analysis the vessel is simulated with both a cp and a fp propeller the results are given in table11 the expected stw is estimated to 12 3 knots with a standard deviation of 0 45 knots which corresponds to 3 7 of the estimated stw by introducing a fp propeller this uncertainty is reduced to 0 24 knots or 1 96 of the estimated stw which corresponds to a 53 5 reduction in total uncertainty the significant reduction in stw uncertainty obtained by fixed propeller pitch angle is explained by the significant sensitivity index of k q α as shown in fig 4 for both the cp and the fp propeller the resulting stw is gaussian distributed with excess kurtosis k v and skewness s k p approximately zero in terms of the expected uncertainty in estimated stw the distributions have larger standard deviations compared to the doppler speed log errors reported bytaudien and bilen 2018 it should however be emphasized thattaudien and bilen 2018 analyzed the various doppler speed log configurations in a towing tank experiment giving an experimental environment much easier to control for doppler instruments providing stw data on full scale ships some of the basic assumptions of the doppler principle are violated such as the uniformity of the flow and the presence of acoustic noise pollution beneath the hull the furuno ds 60 doppler sonar mounted on the case vessel is stated to serve an accuracy of the water tracking speed equal to 1 or 0 1 knots whichever is greater at the chosen service condition of the case vessel the accuracy of the ds 60 is therefore 1 this is better than the standard deviation of stw obtained by the stw model particularly if the ship is equipped with a cp propeller 3 7 but also if the propeller is fixed pitch 1 96 based on experience in full scale data analysis of various ships combined with the considerable amount of concerns in the literature related to the accuracy of speed logs there are however reasons to believe that the precision limits supplied by the manufacturer are far too optimistic meaning that full scale stw measurements in fact are more uncertain than what has been stated this is basically a challenge concerning most kinds of sensor equipment for which the precision limits supplied by the manufacturer are to be considered as the absolute lower limits of the sensor uncertainty in real operating conditions the given precision limits are usually impossible to fulfill this motivates the use of stw estimation from propeller data at the very least the stw estimate could be used for validation of the speed log measurements from a continuous observation of the signal giving notice if e g the speed log signal drifts or develops calibration issues or the stw model could run in parallel to other stw measurements such as the speed log to produce a sort of best estimate from averaging the two stw values as long as the two inputs have similar uncertainty the average of the two will have lower uncertainty than each of the individual inputs on the other hand it is not unlikely that the individual stw model sensor accuracies can be further improved without adding much extra cost to equipment and installation this could certainly lead to stw estimation from propeller data becoming more attractive particularly if the precision of sensors having large sensitivity indices such as propeller rpm and torque is improved similar to the traditional speed log the stw model does not consider individual sensor calibration errors which might introduce additional bias in the stw estimation the most primitive way of avoiding calibration errors are by running a physical end to end calibration over a sufficient amount of time the average sog and stw should be equal this however requires that no specific equipment for sailing optimization in terms of ocean current is installed sog is usually measured using high quality gps sensors that provide sog with very high accuracy in the end to end calibration a total calibration factor can therefore be added to the stw model based on the difference in average sog and stw over time 3 4 1 including thrust measurements for sensor installations on ships also including measurements of propeller thrust there are various ways of including these measurements in the stw model one method is to use the thrust measurement solely by equating the thrust t and thrust deduction t with the ship resistance r t as ineq 21 to find the ship speed from the speed dependent resistance this method is only applicable in sailing conditions for which the ship resistance is known which generally means calm water if the sailing condition includes wind and or waves a number of corrections have to be made to the calm water resistance as described indalheim and steen 2020 such corrections will introduce additional uncertainty to the stw estimation that is expected to result in a more uncertain stw estimate compared to the more traditional approach that has been presented 21 t 1 t r t a second way to include the thrust measurements is to use thrust identity and find the advance number based on the k t j curve the rest of the procedure is identical to the stw model based on torque identity as already described because the relative uncertainty in measured thrust is assumed to be four times the relative uncertainty in torque it is however not recommended to solely depend on the thrust measurement thrust sensors are also experienced to be more unstable than torque sensors the thrust measurement might however reduce the overall uncertainty in the stw estimation if it is rather working as a supplement to the torque measurement the can be achieved by forming two separate calculations of the advance number j by using both torque and thrust identity and establish the final advance number from the average of the two advance numbers the same case vessel and operational condition has been used to study the effect of including the thrust measurement in terms of numbers this means q 150 knm n 108 rpm and t 204 kn the additional input uncertainties to the stw model are listed in table12 the case vessel is still monte carlo simulated n 10 000 using the extended stw model including thrust measurements in the stw model affects the global sensitivity indices the updated indices including the additional input variables from table12 are shown in fig 6 for both the cp and the fp propeller for the cp propeller the uncertainty in k q caused by uncertainty in propeller pitch k q α still has a definite contribution to the overall uncertainty attributing approximately 40 of the global sensitivity the sensitivity to uncertainty in k t caused by uncertainty in propeller pitch k t α has a much lower contribution amounting to approximately 10 this is similar to the contribution from the uncertainty in the thrust sensor for the fp propeller the global sensitivity index of the thrust measurement is however significantly higher amounting to approximately 24 this makes the thrust measurements the second largest contributor to the global uncertainty in estimated stw the monte carlo simulation is also used to establish the new expected uncertainty in the estimated stw based on the extended stw model the results are given in table13 the expected stw is still estimated to 12 3 knots but the standard deviation of estimated stw is reduced to approximately 0 3 knots for the cp propeller as a result of including thrust measurements this corresponds to 2 4 of the estimated stw by using a fp propeller the total uncertainty is 0 21 knots or 1 67 of the estimated stw which corresponds to 30 6 reduction in total uncertainty compared to the cp propeller the reduction in stw uncertainty obtained by including thrust measurements into the stw model is significantly larger when the propeller has a controllable pitch in numbers the uncertainty is reduced from 3 65 to 2 40 for the cp propeller while from 1 96 to 1 67 for the fp propeller this coincides with the uncertainty factors concerning propeller pitch k q α and k t α for which the uncertainty in k q is almost 16 higher than the uncertainty in k t when evaluated relative to the nominal k q and k t values k t is about 5 7 times higher than k q at the selected operating point of the case vessel including thrust measurements into the stw model is therefore considered to be more attractive for cp propeller installations simply because potential bias in the full scale propeller pitch angle corresponding to model scale 100 pitch has less contribution to uncertainty in stw when it is affecting k t compared to k q careful monitoring of the thrust sensor is however recommended considering potential issues with such types of sensors that is experienced on full scale installations 3 4 2 including waves waves will begin to excite ship motions when the size of the waves relative to the ship increases faltinsen et al 1980 explained how vessel pitching induces velocities that will increase the effective inflow speed to the propeller this effect can be expressed as a change in wake fraction as ineq 6 the stw model has been extended to include the effect of waves on the wake fraction based on a measured pitching motion η 5 the amplitude of the motion η 5 is estimated following eq 9 and the encounter frequency ω e is estimated from the frequency of the pitch motion the case vessel is monte carlo simulated n 10 000 using the stw model including waves the pitch motion is pure sinusoidal including noise according to the mru uncertainty parameters given in table8 the amplitude of the sinusoid is set to 5 the longitudinal distance from the cob to the propeller l p c is sampled from the distribution given in the same table the new sensitivity indices including η 5 and l p c are shown in fig 7 for both the cp and the fp propeller the contribution from the uncertainty in the wave related input variables to the total uncertainty is however found to be negligible with small numbers that may just as well be caused by numerical errors as being actual contributions to the uncertainty in stw initially it may seem odd that the waves have such a small effect on the global uncertainty however considering the small effect the wake fraction has on the global uncertainty the limited contribution from waves on stw uncertainty becomes more reasonable in short when the pitch motion amplitude is 5 the mean increase in water inflow speed to the propeller is small relative to the calm water wake fraction which means that the additional uncertainty caused by the wave related input variables is cut down the wake correction in waves will affect the estimated stw but it will not contribute to additional uncertainty in the estimated stw because the wave related input variables have limited influence on the uncertainty in stw the resulting uncertainty parameters of the stw model output including waves are not given 3 4 3 uncertainty in scaling of model scale wake fraction the stw model is based on assuming no uncertainty in the scaling of the wake fraction this should not be construed as an assertion that the scaling procedure is not uncertain it is certainly uncertain however it is found to be very hard to construct an associated uncertainty from which the input to stw model can be sampled from this means that instead of including some uncertainty that is rather questionable the resulting uncertainty in the stw model should be evaluated knowing that uncertainty in the wake scaling procedure is omitted with that in mind there are ways to ensure that the uncertainty in the wake scaling procedure in fact can be neglected by using principles of speed trials the full scale wake fraction can be calibrated from in service measurements dubois and binns 2018 such that the uncertainty in the full scale wake fraction vanishes during speed trials double runs are performed in order to account for current such that sog in theory can be considered equal to the stw by estimating the water speed through the propeller following the principle of the stw model the relative difference in sog and the estimated speed can be assigned an inaccurate full scale wake fraction the estimated error between the calculated full scale wake fraction and the scaled model wake fraction can then be used as a calibration factor for the error in the scaling procedure if the speed trials are performed at a single speed only the error in wake scaling have to be assumed independent of the forward speed note however that during the speed trial procedure the calibration factor is in fact considering every possible inaccuracy introduced during the propeller inflow speed estimation such as the propeller geometry torque sensor calibration issues etc it is therefore recommended to ensure that the sensors are properly calibrated prior to this full scale wake calibration stating that uncertainty in wake scaling goes to zero is probably too optimistic however performing a full scale wake calibration means that the uncertainty introduced through the wake scaling is reduced 4 conclusions through monte carlo simulations of the case vessel using a simple speed through water stw model it is found that the estimated stw has somewhat higher uncertainty than the uncertainty specified by suppliers of traditional doppler speed logs experience in full scale data analysis combined with concerns in the literature related to the accuracy of speed logs nevertheless gives the impression that the stw model may provide similar uncertainty as the speed logs controllable pitch cp propellers are however found to be challenging in terms of the accuracy of the estimated stw as the uncertainty in full scale propeller pitch is found to have a significant contribution to the total uncertainty in stw the uncertainty in propeller pitch is not related to manufacturing but rather the process of configuring the geometrical pitch angle corresponding to 100 pitch in the model tests the extended stw model including thrust measurements has shown that the stw estimation will benefit from including thrust measurements particularly for cp propellers for which it has been found that thrust measurements may decrease the uncertainty in estimated stw by 34 3 ships are however rarely equipped with thrust sensors so the general recommendation is therefore to use the stw model for ships with fixed pitch fp propellers based on the simulations literature and experience it is expected that the stw model can provide stw data with similar accuracy as doppler speed logs therefore by using the stw model in combination with a speed log e g by averaging between the two measurements the uncertainty in the estimated stw can be reduced further improvement of the estimated stw from propeller data will require that input variables having large contribution to the total uncertainty in estimated stw can be measured more precisely for cp propellers this basically means ensuring that the full scale 100 pitch is identical to the pitch angle that has been tested in model scale or by numerical simulations for fp propellers this means that the sensors measuring rpm and torque should be improved in the presence of waves doppler speed logs can be erratic and unstable small misplacements of the doppler beam relative to its best position may cause erratic behavior of the speed measurements either caused by the waves itself or as a result of ship motions that generate air bubbles or acoustic interference with the pulses from the speed log for some ships it is inevitable to get erratic speed measurements in waves the uncertainty of the stw model on the other hand including the change in wake fraction when the ship moves in pitch was found not to be very much affected by the pitch motion it is therefore reasonable to rely more on the estimated stw from propeller data when waves are exciting ship motions compared to speed logs particularly if the speed log already has been providing unstable measurements in waves while the proposed method to estimate stw from propeller data is not sensitive to the effect of hull fouling it is suspect to influence of propeller fouling a correction for the effect of propeller fouling should be introduced in the future since propeller fouling typically develops slowly a long term trend in the propeller data might be used to correct for this effect however further work is required here credit authorship contribution statement øyvind øksnes

20508,to investigate the dynamic behavior of the submerged floating tunnel sft under moving vehicle load a sft experimental model is designed and analyzed through typical experiment cases the effects of cable and vehicle with different parameters on the sfts are discussed besides the numerical simulation method is proposed in abaqus explicit module for contrastive analysis the vumap and the vdload subroutines are used for implementing the tube fluid force and the moving vehicle load in the numerical model the results show that the vertical vibration of the sft is relatively independent to other directions and the connection between the tubes will partially weaken the overall stiffness of the sft in addition the deviation amplification effect exists in the sft subjected to moving vehicle load increasing the cable inclination angle and the cable diameter can reduce the amplification effect for the sft with different cable spacing the deviation amplification effect of dense cable arrangement is smaller than that of the sparse cable arrangement but their sensitivities to vehicle velocity are not very different in the practical project the cables should provide sufficient strength to the sft for safety keywords submerged floating tunnel moving vehicle load experimental study numerical model dynamic amplification factor 1 introduction to cope with the increasing traffic demand and improve the infrastructure conditions traffic authorities in various countries are trying to change the existing ferry connection to a fixed bridge or tunnel connection along the highway route when the traditional bridge or tunnel schemes are difficult to implement for some deep water straits or long channels it is necessary to study and adopt new crossing schemes such as submerged floating tunnel sft the sft relies on its own buoyancy and the cable tension to maintain the dynamic balance under the certain depth water tveit 2010 by comparison sft has a good spanning capacity and can work in all weather conditions østlid 2010 because of that the sft is attracting wide interest in the engineering and academic circles because the overall structure of sft has been in the complex marine environment for a long time it faces multiple challenges in the promoting process in terms of the fluid structure interaction fsi kunisu 2010 evaluated the wave force acting on the sft by the boundary element method bem and the morison s equation respectively seo et al 2015a b designed and tested a scale segment model to verify the simplified method for estimation of hydrodynamic forces jin et al 2020 combined a higher order boundary element method hobem and the elastic rod theory to analyze the behavior of the sft in the fluid field they further discussed the influence of design parameters on the coupled system through the scale experiment some sft theoretical models were proposed for structure behavior analysis under extreme loads such as seismic load explosion and shipwreck martinelli et al 2011 lin et al 2019 seo et al 2015 xiang and yang 2017 lu et al 2011 investigated the tether slack phenomena of the sft under wave conditions and derived the slack criterion for slack prediction it revealed that the buoyancy weight ratio bwr and the inclined mooring angle ima were important parameters of affecting the slack taut state of tether kristoffersen et al 2019 analyzed the behaviors of sft with different cross sections on the internal blast loading meantime cantero et al 2017 and sun et al 2009 respectively studied the parametric resonance of sft tether and assessed the fatigue life of the tether by considering geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinear effects to analyze the effect of vortex induced vibration xiang and chao 2012 proposed a theoretical model for the sft cable tube coupled vibration under the action of current these efforts make people easier to cope with the hazards of sft and provide corresponding strategies to solve problems as a marine structure the sft connects islands and provides traffic access for vehicles of crossing straits just like the bridge structures in the research development of vehicle bridge coupled vibration there are already relatively mature theories and methods frýba 2013 yang and yau 1997 zhou and chen 2016 and shin et al 2010 respectively did the related and in depth researches on the calculation efficiency of the vehicle bridge coupled analysis the comfort ability for vehicle driving and the resonance control of the vehicle bridge coupled vibration besides tan et al 2019 analyzed the vehicle bridge interaction vbi experiments and proposed an algorithm to extract the bridge mode shapes and damping ratio for whole bridge structural health monitoring shm those lay a solid foundation for the development of the structure while the research on the vehicle tunnel coupled vibration of sft is still on the initial stage in 2011 tariverdilo et al 2011 began to pay attention to the influence of moving vehicle load on the sft the theoretical models were established and results showed the added mass of tunnel would amplify the dynamic response of the sft on the basis lin et al 2018 proposed a simplified analytical model for considering the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction and discussed the effects of some design parameters considering the tether vibration jin et al 2021 improved the theoretical model and analyzed the sft mooring train interaction under the waves and earthquakes based on model experiments some scholars viecili et al 2013 chang et al 2020 took actual floating bridge as reference and concluded conservative design methods for coupled behavior analysis however there is no case of sft construction or a full experiment test of sft model under vehicle and fluid interaction in the world till today the dynamic responses of sft under moving vehicle load are only in theoretical calculation and have not been verified in practical evidence through extracting the dynamic responses of the sft under vehicle load it can provide a basis for the development of sft theory to understand the dynamic behavior of sft under moving vehicle load the scale sft experimental model was designed the dynamic responses of the model in some characteristic positions were measured during the model test through the testing of typical model cases the effects of cable and vehicle properties on the sfts with different cable spacing were discussed besides the sft numerical models were developed in abaqus explicit module the implementation of the moving vehicle load and the tube fluid force on the sft numerical model were realized by abaqus subroutine method comparison between the experiment results and the analysis values is to be done and to verify the validity of the proposed numerical simulation analysis method for the sft vehicle tunnel coupled vibration under the water 2 model experiments of submerged floating tunnel 2 1 model design to facilitate the observation of experiments and the verification a simplified scale model is designed for investigation experiment studies are carried out in the stormy stream integrated water flume in ocean and hydraulic power lab zhejiang university as shown in fig 1 the size of the water flume is 65 m long and 1 2 m wide the section height is 1 6 m and the allowable depth of water is 1 0 m the scale sft model consists of bracket platforms anchoring devices several tubes and two waterproof boxes the whole length of sft model plus the waterproof box in two ends is 12 8 m and the work span of the sft tube is 10 m the width and the depth of the bracket platform are 0 6 m and 1 3 m respectively the plexiglass waterproof boxes are respectively fixed on the bracket platform by self tapping screws which isolate a dry operating space to simulate a real sft environment and provide a distance for vehicle moving a 0 2 m circular hole is reserved on one side of the waterproof box for splicing with tube the material of the tubes is made by aluminum which has a similar density to concrete the tubes are connected by the flanges and the silicone pads and 2 mm thick waterproof glue is applied for sealing treatment meantime some metal hoops with the same specification as the flange are installed on the tubes for anchor cables connecting the cable types are selected according to different experimental cases fig 2 a and b shows the whole scale sft construction size the moving vehicle indeed has actual springs for vibration reduction in reality but it is very difficult to maintain the effectiveness and consistency of each spring in the test work from the perspective of the preliminary experimental study the work only considers the moving load without the vehicle springs in the model experiment the vehicle velocity is controlled by the traction system and the vehicle mass can be adjusted by a combination of the steel plate blocks as shown in fig 3 a and b three different weight vehicles are 11 845 kg 22 325 kg and 32 705 kg respectively they are corresponding to first second and third grade mass levels which are intended to study the effects of vehicle weight when the traction system is working the vehicle model is dragged by a steel wire from one side of the waterproof box to the other side the traction system consists of a velocity controller a driving motor and an earth leakage protective device the power of the driving motor meets the requirements of pulling different vehicle weights in the variable velocity the entire vehicle model is approximately rigid whose several steel plates are fixed together by the front and rear bolts the distance is 15 cm between the front and rear wheels as for the overall experimental model the flanges and the silicone pads result in the uneven tube stiffness variation yang et al 2019 once discussed the influence of the uneven tube stiffness variation on the sft subjected the impact load they adopted the equivalent stiffness and damping of the tube obtained by the numerical analysis of the tube free vibration which got a good agreement with the test results according to the fact that the size of the tube length direction is much larger than the size of its section in the test model and there are strictly constraints in vertical direction at both ends of the model while the rotational constraints approximately assume to be ignored and then the structure can be regarded as a simply supported euler bernoulli beam to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model results the equivalent stiffness and damping respectively are the average of results from five time free vibrations taking the actual design sft as a reference table 1 lists other parameters of the experimental model martinelli et al 2011 yang et al 2019 due to the limitations of the materials the scale ratio of physical parameters the accurate similarity for the whole structural system cannot be easily realized especially in the dynamic similarity therefore the experimental model design and test only considered the similarity of partly geometric parameters 2 2 sensors arrangement the main object of the experiment is to obtain the displacement acceleration and strain at the key points in the control positions of the tube and relative cable forces of the anchor cable in the different cases the layouts of sensors on the sft with different cable spacing are shown in fig 4 a and b at the mid span 1 2l of the tube two vertical displacement sensors respectively are set on the left and the right side to monitor vertical displacement and torsion of the tube acceleration sensors are also installed for monitoring acceleration in the horizontal and vertical directions of the mid span cross section besides the strains of the mid span cross section can be acquired by the strain sensors on the top and the bottom at the same time the displacement and acceleration sensors are also placed at the 1 4l and 3 4l positions of the tube for the test cases of sft with 2 m cable spacing the displacement acceleration and strain sensors are also placed on the 3 5l position of the tube for analysis the detail location information and the number of sensors are listed in table 2 all sensors should be installed correctly firmly and effectively at the same time all sensors need to be checked to eliminate the system test errors and to be waterproofed to ensure normal work below the water the data acquisition system for the dynamic signal can realize real time signal transmission display and storage 2 3 model test scheme in order to verify the reasonability of the numerical model for analyzing the dynamic responses of the sft under the moving vehicle load the test case of sft with 2 m cable spacing is taken as an example to conduct numerical verification and comparison moreover the effects of sft with different design parameters on dynamic responses are also discussed by the control variable method for the sake of analysis the letters m and v are selected to denote the vehicle weight and velocity respectively and the letters o a and d represent the spacing inclination and diameter of the anchor cable the subscripts such as 1 2 and 3 are corresponding to univariate cases with different parameter values the total model test cases are summarized in table 3 for example the test case m 1 v 1 o 1 a 1 d 1 represents that the sft with 1 m cable spacing suffers the first grade mass vehicle load with the first level velocity and the inclination and the diameter of the cable are 60 and 0 5 mm respectively during the test it is worth noting that each test case must be repeated twice to ensure stable and reasonable test results 3 numerical simulation method 3 1 fem model according to the structural size of the sft test model the numerical models of the sft for test cases are established by abaqus finite element software the tunnel tube is simulated by b31 space beam element the truss element t3d2 is used for simulating the cables of the sft which does not consider the geometric and material nonlinear effect the structural damping is directly defined in abaqus by the keywords modal damping modal direct each mode order is regarded to have the same equivalent damping ratio the mpc beam is used for simulating the connection between the tube and the cables and it ensures the contact points have the same displacement the boundary condition of the sft is simply supported and the cables are hinged in the foundation of sft the entire numerical model contains 1017 nodes 1000 beam elements and 8 truss elements as shown in fig 5 the subspace based time integration scheme in abaqus explicit module is used for coupled system dynamic equations solving 3 2 numerical simulation of moving vehicle load and tube fluid force for the finite element model of sft the morison equation can be considered as an effective weak fluid coupling method for the dynamic effect of fluid on the structure under water the fluid force consists of the added mass force and the hydraulic resistance as shown in eq 1 1 f d x t 1 4 π ρ w d 2 c a 2 w x t t 2 1 2 ρ w dc d w x t t w x t t where f d x t is the fluid force acting on the tube w x t is the displacement of the tube x is the longitudinal direction of the sft d is the characteristic scale of the tube section ρ w is the water density c a and c d are the added mass coefficient and the hydraulic resistance coefficient respectively and c a 1 0 c d 0 6 for the circular section in the package of abaqus explicit module the fluid coupling analysis of the sft can be realized through the vuamp subroutine interface it mainly relies on the sensor function provided by abaqus which could acquire the real time reading of the motion state parameters of the structure in the process such as the displacement velocity acceleration therefore the external force related to structural motion state could be calculated and apply to the structure in the form of a custom amplitude function the implementation process is shown in fig 6 adjust the appropriate time step to ensure the convergence of the structural responses during the integral calculation process xiang and yang 2017 once took this method to simulate the fluid force acting on the structure and analyzed the dynamic response of the sft under impact load the validity of the method has been verified by experiments and numerical analysis besides with referring to the offshore pipeline dynamic analysis it is also possible to establish the sft on the abaqus aqua platform to directly consider the influence of the fluid force by key words fi and fdd to realize the moving vehicle loading on the numerical sft model the vdload subroutine interface is used to apply the vehicle load and position to the structure in real time in the vdload subroutine interface the positional parameter curcoords is used for transmitting the contact position information between the vehicle and the tube and the status parameter values is used to store the contact force to illustrate the effectiveness of the analysis simulation method a once studied single degree freedom vehicle crossing the bridge is illustrated as an example yang et al 2004 as shown in fig 7 the bridge is l 25 m long simply supported beam the area of section and the inertia moment are a 2 0 m2 and i 0 12 m4 respectively the beam elastic modulus and the mass per unit length are e 27 5gpa and m 4800 kg m the vehicle mass and the spring stiffness coefficient are m v 1200 kg and k v 500 kn m respectively the vehicle velocity is 10 m s and the damping of the vehicle is not considered in the calculation besides another finite element model is also established in abaqus explicit module to illustrate in the numerical model the moving vehicle is regarded as the spring mass block acting on the beam by comparing the results of two methods with that of the reference shown in fig 8 there are good agreements among the three results and the reasonability of the proposed method is verified 3 3 results analysis 3 3 1 deflection and cable force response of the tube comparing the test with numerical results in the basic test case m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 fig 9 a and b show the tube vertical deflections and the relative change of the cable forces under the moving vehicle load respectively it can be found that the tube deflection and the relative change of the cable force are roughly consistent with the results obtained by the numerical simulation method however the tube deflections on the ds 1 4l ds 1 2l ds 3 5l and ds 3 4l calculated by the numerical simulation show smoother than the test results the relative changes of the cable forces on the cfs 1 cfs 2 cfs 3 cfs 4 and cfs 5 cable behave apparent local fluctuations at some moments the possible reason for the phenomenon is the discontinuous connection between the tunnel tubes in the reality test due to the existing of the flanges and the silicone pads the vehicle will have some jumps when it passes through the connection of the tube but it can be completely eliminated in the numerical simulation meantime compared with the numerical simulation model the difference in the real water environment also has a certain impact besides whether it is the tube or the cable they can restore to the initial level after the vehicle passes through the structure it shows entire sft system is still in the status of elastic recoverability during the test table 4 gives the maximum values of the tube displacement and the cable force responses in different positions to further illustrate the dynamic behavior of the sft subjected to the moving vehicle in the m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 case the maximum deflection values of ds l 1 2l and ds r 1 2l at the mid span measurement points are 0 945 mm and 0 922 mm respectively the deflection time history curves on the ds l 1 2l and ds r 1 2l do not show much difference which means the tunnel tube does not have apparent torsion during the moving vehicle moving through the tube at ds 1 4l and ds 3 4l symmetric positions along the length of the tube the maximum deflection values are 0 752 mm and 0 756 mm respectively meantime the relative change of cable force on the same section cfs 3 and cfs 5 cable force have reached to 40 51 n and 38 66 n respectively as a whole the dynamic responses of the tube displacement and the cable force behave a good symmetry property from the experimental results it is not obvious coupling vibration of the vertical direction and other directions for the tunnel tube the test case repeated twice the average errors of the two tube deflections and the cable forces are within 6 3 3 2 acceleration response of the tube the continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to deal with the acceleration signal of the characteristic positions on the tube pan and kusunoki 2018 so the time frequency characteristics of the sft under moving vehicle load can be acquired the process of cwt can be written as 2 w ξ η a p ψ ξ η ξ 1 2 a p t ψ t η ξ dt where a p t is the acceleration signal ψ t l 2 r is mother wavelet and the morlet wavelet is applied in the process a p ψ ξ η denotes inner product between a p and ψ ξ η ψ denotes the conjugate operation w ξ η is the wavelet coefficient at scale factor ξ and shift factor η by adjusting the scale and the shift factors the time frequency characteristics of the acceleration signal of the test can be intuitively obtained fig 10 a c e and g gives the vertical acceleration signals of the tube on the as l 4 as 1 2l as 3 5l and as 3 4l positions the corresponding time frequency graphs are shown in fig 10 b d f and h seen from the acceleration time frequency graph the main frequency can be captured for traversing through the entire process during vehicle moving the main frequencies corresponding to the as 1 4l as 1 2l as 3 5l and as 3 4l positions are 10 55 hz 6 13 hz 6 25 hz and 10 64 hz respectively besides some distinct transient high frequencies components appear at times t 7 54s 39 65s 68 78s 97 92 127 32s and 157 63s which also could be tracked in the acceleration time history curves in addition to the impact of the vehicle entering and exiting the tube the discontinuous connection between the tunnel tubes lead to impact effect the first and second orders natural frequencies of the test model analyzed by fem are 6 31 hz and 11 76 hz comparing the results with the test results the frequency difference respectively are 1 21 hz 0 18 hz 0 06 hz and 1 12 hz according the simplified theoretical frequency equation proposed by lin et al 2018 table 5 gives the first two orders natural frequencies of the sft model by different methods 3 ω n e i m n π l 4 k m n 1 2 3 where ω n is the nth order circular frequency of the sft it is found that the structural frequency obtained by the test f test is a little bit less than the results of numerical analysis f fromula and the results of fem analysis f fem are close to the values f fromula estimated by eq 3 the simplified theoretical frequency equation can reveal the rationality and reliability of the structural frequency besides the connection between the tubes and the cables the tubes and the tubes will partially weaken the overall stiffness of the real testing structure 3 3 3 tube strain response in the case of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 fig 11 gives the strain time history responses of the tube at ss 1 2l ss 3 5l and ss 3 4l positions according to the results the strain responses between the numerical model and the test have a similar change law but the strain values measured by the model test at different positions are slighter smaller than that of the monitoring positions calculated by the numerical model the reason is that the tool type strain sensor records the average strain around the monitoring position which leads to a smaller value than the calculation in the mid span section of the sft the strain curves of ss 1 2l are roughly symmetric but there is a spike on the ss b 1 2l strain curve because the strain sensor is installed on the tube bottom surface it will be extruded by the vehicle wheels during the test on the contrary the spike does not occur in the strain curves on the tube top surface 4 discussion on influence factors 4 1 effect of anchor cable inclination angle and diameter as for the actual sft engineering structure the reasonable inclination angle and diameter of the anchor cable are of great significance to the sft operation defining the dynamic amplification factor daf through eq 4 the effect of anchor cable inclination angle on the sft during the vehicle moving is discussed in the cases of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 1 d 2 and m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 2 as shown in fig 12 a and b 4 dynamic amplification factor daf r max r s t a 1 where r max and r sta are the absolute maximum responses under the action of dynamic and static loads lin et al 2018 from the numerical results the deflection dafs on the ds 1 4l and ds 3 4l positions are larger than that on the ds 3 5l and the ds 1 2l positions in which the deflection daf of the ds 1 2l position is the minimum the similar results also occur in the daf of cable force the cable force dafs of the cfs 1 and the cfs 4 approaching the tube ends are bigger than the values of the cfs 2 and the cfs 3 cables the results mean the vehicle driving effect on the tube around the middle part is much smaller than that around the 1 4l and 3 4l positions besides in the different anchor cable diameter cases of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 and m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 2 the deviation amplification effect also exists in the results as shown in fig 13 a and b meantime the overall change law reflected from the experimental results is similar to the numerical simulation in general on this basis the effect of anchor inclination and diameter on the dynamic responses of the sft under moving vehicle load is further analyzed it is found from fig 12 a that it can theoretically cut the deflection dafs of the tube by increasing the inclination angle of anchor cable but the cable force dafs of the sft with larger inclination angle will become more non uniform as shown in fig 12 b changing the cable diameter from 0 5 mm to 1 mm the deflection dafs have been drastically decreased meantime the cable force dafs also have been reduced with the cable diameter increasing it shows different changes in the cable force dafs when increasing the cable inclination angle or the cable diameter for the convenience of discussion the deflection daf of the tube on the ds 3 5l position and the cable force daf of the cfs 3 cable are illustrated the influence difference between the cable diameter and the cable inclination angle as listed in table 6 the numerical results show that the reductions of the deflection daf in the ds 3 5l position are 0 518 and 1 086 respectively when increasing the cable inclination and the cable diameter correspondingly the reductions of the cable force daf on the cfs 3 cable are 0 743 and 1 163 respectively although the results are affected by a slight difference in the initial state it can be found that increasing the cable diameter is better than adjusting the cable inclination angle on reducing the dynamical impact of the sft under moving vehicle load 4 2 effect of vehicle moving velocity as an underwater traffic structure the vehicle moving velocity determines the sft transport capacity adjusting the driving velocity of vehicle the cases v 1 10r min 0 067 m s v 2 20r min 0 109 m s v 3 30r min 0 159 m s v 4 50r min 0 238 m s and v 5 70r min 0 294 m s of the sft with different cable spacing under vehicle moving load were carried out to analyze the influence of vehicle moving velocity fig 14 a and b give the deflection dafs of the tube at the ds 3 5l and the ds 3 4l positions and the cable force dafs of the cfs 3 and the cfs 4 cables in the cases of m 2 o 2 a 2 d 1 due to the deviation amplification effect the dafs of the ds 3 4l position and cfs 4 cable are larger than that of the 3 5l position and the cfs 3 cable meantime with increasing the vehicle velocity the deflection and the cable force dafs both have a certain degree growth in contrast to the cases of m 2 o 1 a 2 d 1 see fig 15 the deflection and the cable force dafs increase with the growth of velocity but the deviation amplification effect is not obvious as the cases of m 2 o 2 a 2 d 1 in other words the sft with dense anchor cables has a smaller deviation amplification effect than the sft with sparse anchor cables in addition the deflection sensor ds 3 5l and the cable force sensor cfs 3 which are set in the same positions on different cable spacing cases could be quantitative to illustrate the vehicle velocity influence difference according to the numerical results in the cases of m 2 o 2 a 2 d 1 the deflection daf of the ds 3 5l position varies from 1 603 to 1 781 when the vehicle velocity increases from 10r m to 70r min the cable force dafs of the cfs 3 cable are 1 579 and 1 769 corresponding to the vehicle velocity v 1 10r min and v 5 70r min meantime the deflection dafs results in the cases of m 2 o 1 a 2 d 1 are 1 131 and 1 293 respectively and the cable force dafs of the cfs 3 cable varies from 1 591 to 1 729 when the vehicle velocity changes as shown in fig 15 a and b although there is some variability in the experimental results the overall trends could be reflected in the curves the sensitivities of the deflection and the cable force on the vehicle velocity not behave too much different meantime the sensitive difference to the vehicle velocity between the sft with dense cables and the sft with sparse cables also shows not too much obvious 4 3 effect of different vehicle weight and the number of vehicle in the model experiment the moving vehicle is made of several steel plates bolted by vertical screws changing the number of steel plates the effect of vehicle mass m 1 m 2 and m 3 on the vibration characteristic of the sft can be analyzed in the cases of v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 table 7 gives the maximum deflections of the tube on the ds 1 2l position and the maximum cable force variations of the cfs 3 cable respectively since the numerical model does not take into account any nonlinearity the variation of the deflection and the cable force increase linearly with the growth of vehicle weight in contrast the test results basically are close to the numerical calculation and maintain a good linear growth characteristic but the deviation will increase with the increasing of the vehicle weight in the case of m 3 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 the maximum cable force variation measured by the model test is slightly higher than that of numerical calculation anchor cables serve as the flexible supporting members in the sft which should provide sufficient strength to the structure and be controlled in the elastic stage for safety in the design in the case of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 it is realized by bundling the steel wire on the screws to increase the number of vehicle on the test the tests of the sft under the different number of vehicles are carried out where the distance is 15 cm between the vehicles fig 16 a and b give the time history curves of the deflection on the ds 3 5l position and the strain on the ss 1 2l b position respectively with the increasing the number of vehicle the deflection curves of experiments are still in a good agreement with the numerical results meantime the number of spikes also increases in the strain time history curves when the sft suffers more vehicles on the whole the effect of different vehicle weight and the number of vehicle on the sft mainly behave the liner growth principle because the experiment model is designed in the elastic stage 5 conclusion based on the sft overall structure model the work investigated the overall dynamic behaviors of the sft under moving vehicle load according to the experimental results the numerical simulation method for the sft by abaqus was verified the implementation of the moving vehicle load and the tube fluid force were realized on the sft numerical model by abaqus subroutine method through testing of the typical model cases the effects of different cable and vehicle parameters on the sfts with different cable spacing were discussed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the sft tube does not have apparent torsion under the symmetrical moving vehicle load in static water environment it means that the vertical vibration of the sft is relatively independent to other directions 2 according to the test results of the acceleration response and the frequencies of the structure model the connection between the tubes will partially weaken the overall stiffness of the sft 3 the deviation amplification exists in the sft under moving vehicle load it results in the tube around 1 4l and 3 4l has larger dafs than that around the middle part increasing the cable inclination angle and the cable diameter can reduce the amplification effect of moving load on the sft but the effect of increasing the diameter of cable is better than that of adjusting the cable inclination angle 4 with increasing the vehicle velocity the deflection and the cable force dafs both have a certain degree growth besides the sft with dense anchor cables has a smaller marginal amplification effect than the sft with sparse anchor cables but the sensitive difference to the vehicle velocity between the sft with dense cables and the sft with sparse cables shows not too much obvious credit authorship contribution statement yiqiang xiang

20508,to investigate the dynamic behavior of the submerged floating tunnel sft under moving vehicle load a sft experimental model is designed and analyzed through typical experiment cases the effects of cable and vehicle with different parameters on the sfts are discussed besides the numerical simulation method is proposed in abaqus explicit module for contrastive analysis the vumap and the vdload subroutines are used for implementing the tube fluid force and the moving vehicle load in the numerical model the results show that the vertical vibration of the sft is relatively independent to other directions and the connection between the tubes will partially weaken the overall stiffness of the sft in addition the deviation amplification effect exists in the sft subjected to moving vehicle load increasing the cable inclination angle and the cable diameter can reduce the amplification effect for the sft with different cable spacing the deviation amplification effect of dense cable arrangement is smaller than that of the sparse cable arrangement but their sensitivities to vehicle velocity are not very different in the practical project the cables should provide sufficient strength to the sft for safety keywords submerged floating tunnel moving vehicle load experimental study numerical model dynamic amplification factor 1 introduction to cope with the increasing traffic demand and improve the infrastructure conditions traffic authorities in various countries are trying to change the existing ferry connection to a fixed bridge or tunnel connection along the highway route when the traditional bridge or tunnel schemes are difficult to implement for some deep water straits or long channels it is necessary to study and adopt new crossing schemes such as submerged floating tunnel sft the sft relies on its own buoyancy and the cable tension to maintain the dynamic balance under the certain depth water tveit 2010 by comparison sft has a good spanning capacity and can work in all weather conditions østlid 2010 because of that the sft is attracting wide interest in the engineering and academic circles because the overall structure of sft has been in the complex marine environment for a long time it faces multiple challenges in the promoting process in terms of the fluid structure interaction fsi kunisu 2010 evaluated the wave force acting on the sft by the boundary element method bem and the morison s equation respectively seo et al 2015a b designed and tested a scale segment model to verify the simplified method for estimation of hydrodynamic forces jin et al 2020 combined a higher order boundary element method hobem and the elastic rod theory to analyze the behavior of the sft in the fluid field they further discussed the influence of design parameters on the coupled system through the scale experiment some sft theoretical models were proposed for structure behavior analysis under extreme loads such as seismic load explosion and shipwreck martinelli et al 2011 lin et al 2019 seo et al 2015 xiang and yang 2017 lu et al 2011 investigated the tether slack phenomena of the sft under wave conditions and derived the slack criterion for slack prediction it revealed that the buoyancy weight ratio bwr and the inclined mooring angle ima were important parameters of affecting the slack taut state of tether kristoffersen et al 2019 analyzed the behaviors of sft with different cross sections on the internal blast loading meantime cantero et al 2017 and sun et al 2009 respectively studied the parametric resonance of sft tether and assessed the fatigue life of the tether by considering geometric and hydrodynamic nonlinear effects to analyze the effect of vortex induced vibration xiang and chao 2012 proposed a theoretical model for the sft cable tube coupled vibration under the action of current these efforts make people easier to cope with the hazards of sft and provide corresponding strategies to solve problems as a marine structure the sft connects islands and provides traffic access for vehicles of crossing straits just like the bridge structures in the research development of vehicle bridge coupled vibration there are already relatively mature theories and methods frýba 2013 yang and yau 1997 zhou and chen 2016 and shin et al 2010 respectively did the related and in depth researches on the calculation efficiency of the vehicle bridge coupled analysis the comfort ability for vehicle driving and the resonance control of the vehicle bridge coupled vibration besides tan et al 2019 analyzed the vehicle bridge interaction vbi experiments and proposed an algorithm to extract the bridge mode shapes and damping ratio for whole bridge structural health monitoring shm those lay a solid foundation for the development of the structure while the research on the vehicle tunnel coupled vibration of sft is still on the initial stage in 2011 tariverdilo et al 2011 began to pay attention to the influence of moving vehicle load on the sft the theoretical models were established and results showed the added mass of tunnel would amplify the dynamic response of the sft on the basis lin et al 2018 proposed a simplified analytical model for considering the fluid vehicle tunnel interaction and discussed the effects of some design parameters considering the tether vibration jin et al 2021 improved the theoretical model and analyzed the sft mooring train interaction under the waves and earthquakes based on model experiments some scholars viecili et al 2013 chang et al 2020 took actual floating bridge as reference and concluded conservative design methods for coupled behavior analysis however there is no case of sft construction or a full experiment test of sft model under vehicle and fluid interaction in the world till today the dynamic responses of sft under moving vehicle load are only in theoretical calculation and have not been verified in practical evidence through extracting the dynamic responses of the sft under vehicle load it can provide a basis for the development of sft theory to understand the dynamic behavior of sft under moving vehicle load the scale sft experimental model was designed the dynamic responses of the model in some characteristic positions were measured during the model test through the testing of typical model cases the effects of cable and vehicle properties on the sfts with different cable spacing were discussed besides the sft numerical models were developed in abaqus explicit module the implementation of the moving vehicle load and the tube fluid force on the sft numerical model were realized by abaqus subroutine method comparison between the experiment results and the analysis values is to be done and to verify the validity of the proposed numerical simulation analysis method for the sft vehicle tunnel coupled vibration under the water 2 model experiments of submerged floating tunnel 2 1 model design to facilitate the observation of experiments and the verification a simplified scale model is designed for investigation experiment studies are carried out in the stormy stream integrated water flume in ocean and hydraulic power lab zhejiang university as shown in fig 1 the size of the water flume is 65 m long and 1 2 m wide the section height is 1 6 m and the allowable depth of water is 1 0 m the scale sft model consists of bracket platforms anchoring devices several tubes and two waterproof boxes the whole length of sft model plus the waterproof box in two ends is 12 8 m and the work span of the sft tube is 10 m the width and the depth of the bracket platform are 0 6 m and 1 3 m respectively the plexiglass waterproof boxes are respectively fixed on the bracket platform by self tapping screws which isolate a dry operating space to simulate a real sft environment and provide a distance for vehicle moving a 0 2 m circular hole is reserved on one side of the waterproof box for splicing with tube the material of the tubes is made by aluminum which has a similar density to concrete the tubes are connected by the flanges and the silicone pads and 2 mm thick waterproof glue is applied for sealing treatment meantime some metal hoops with the same specification as the flange are installed on the tubes for anchor cables connecting the cable types are selected according to different experimental cases fig 2 a and b shows the whole scale sft construction size the moving vehicle indeed has actual springs for vibration reduction in reality but it is very difficult to maintain the effectiveness and consistency of each spring in the test work from the perspective of the preliminary experimental study the work only considers the moving load without the vehicle springs in the model experiment the vehicle velocity is controlled by the traction system and the vehicle mass can be adjusted by a combination of the steel plate blocks as shown in fig 3 a and b three different weight vehicles are 11 845 kg 22 325 kg and 32 705 kg respectively they are corresponding to first second and third grade mass levels which are intended to study the effects of vehicle weight when the traction system is working the vehicle model is dragged by a steel wire from one side of the waterproof box to the other side the traction system consists of a velocity controller a driving motor and an earth leakage protective device the power of the driving motor meets the requirements of pulling different vehicle weights in the variable velocity the entire vehicle model is approximately rigid whose several steel plates are fixed together by the front and rear bolts the distance is 15 cm between the front and rear wheels as for the overall experimental model the flanges and the silicone pads result in the uneven tube stiffness variation yang et al 2019 once discussed the influence of the uneven tube stiffness variation on the sft subjected the impact load they adopted the equivalent stiffness and damping of the tube obtained by the numerical analysis of the tube free vibration which got a good agreement with the test results according to the fact that the size of the tube length direction is much larger than the size of its section in the test model and there are strictly constraints in vertical direction at both ends of the model while the rotational constraints approximately assume to be ignored and then the structure can be regarded as a simply supported euler bernoulli beam to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model results the equivalent stiffness and damping respectively are the average of results from five time free vibrations taking the actual design sft as a reference table 1 lists other parameters of the experimental model martinelli et al 2011 yang et al 2019 due to the limitations of the materials the scale ratio of physical parameters the accurate similarity for the whole structural system cannot be easily realized especially in the dynamic similarity therefore the experimental model design and test only considered the similarity of partly geometric parameters 2 2 sensors arrangement the main object of the experiment is to obtain the displacement acceleration and strain at the key points in the control positions of the tube and relative cable forces of the anchor cable in the different cases the layouts of sensors on the sft with different cable spacing are shown in fig 4 a and b at the mid span 1 2l of the tube two vertical displacement sensors respectively are set on the left and the right side to monitor vertical displacement and torsion of the tube acceleration sensors are also installed for monitoring acceleration in the horizontal and vertical directions of the mid span cross section besides the strains of the mid span cross section can be acquired by the strain sensors on the top and the bottom at the same time the displacement and acceleration sensors are also placed at the 1 4l and 3 4l positions of the tube for the test cases of sft with 2 m cable spacing the displacement acceleration and strain sensors are also placed on the 3 5l position of the tube for analysis the detail location information and the number of sensors are listed in table 2 all sensors should be installed correctly firmly and effectively at the same time all sensors need to be checked to eliminate the system test errors and to be waterproofed to ensure normal work below the water the data acquisition system for the dynamic signal can realize real time signal transmission display and storage 2 3 model test scheme in order to verify the reasonability of the numerical model for analyzing the dynamic responses of the sft under the moving vehicle load the test case of sft with 2 m cable spacing is taken as an example to conduct numerical verification and comparison moreover the effects of sft with different design parameters on dynamic responses are also discussed by the control variable method for the sake of analysis the letters m and v are selected to denote the vehicle weight and velocity respectively and the letters o a and d represent the spacing inclination and diameter of the anchor cable the subscripts such as 1 2 and 3 are corresponding to univariate cases with different parameter values the total model test cases are summarized in table 3 for example the test case m 1 v 1 o 1 a 1 d 1 represents that the sft with 1 m cable spacing suffers the first grade mass vehicle load with the first level velocity and the inclination and the diameter of the cable are 60 and 0 5 mm respectively during the test it is worth noting that each test case must be repeated twice to ensure stable and reasonable test results 3 numerical simulation method 3 1 fem model according to the structural size of the sft test model the numerical models of the sft for test cases are established by abaqus finite element software the tunnel tube is simulated by b31 space beam element the truss element t3d2 is used for simulating the cables of the sft which does not consider the geometric and material nonlinear effect the structural damping is directly defined in abaqus by the keywords modal damping modal direct each mode order is regarded to have the same equivalent damping ratio the mpc beam is used for simulating the connection between the tube and the cables and it ensures the contact points have the same displacement the boundary condition of the sft is simply supported and the cables are hinged in the foundation of sft the entire numerical model contains 1017 nodes 1000 beam elements and 8 truss elements as shown in fig 5 the subspace based time integration scheme in abaqus explicit module is used for coupled system dynamic equations solving 3 2 numerical simulation of moving vehicle load and tube fluid force for the finite element model of sft the morison equation can be considered as an effective weak fluid coupling method for the dynamic effect of fluid on the structure under water the fluid force consists of the added mass force and the hydraulic resistance as shown in eq 1 1 f d x t 1 4 π ρ w d 2 c a 2 w x t t 2 1 2 ρ w dc d w x t t w x t t where f d x t is the fluid force acting on the tube w x t is the displacement of the tube x is the longitudinal direction of the sft d is the characteristic scale of the tube section ρ w is the water density c a and c d are the added mass coefficient and the hydraulic resistance coefficient respectively and c a 1 0 c d 0 6 for the circular section in the package of abaqus explicit module the fluid coupling analysis of the sft can be realized through the vuamp subroutine interface it mainly relies on the sensor function provided by abaqus which could acquire the real time reading of the motion state parameters of the structure in the process such as the displacement velocity acceleration therefore the external force related to structural motion state could be calculated and apply to the structure in the form of a custom amplitude function the implementation process is shown in fig 6 adjust the appropriate time step to ensure the convergence of the structural responses during the integral calculation process xiang and yang 2017 once took this method to simulate the fluid force acting on the structure and analyzed the dynamic response of the sft under impact load the validity of the method has been verified by experiments and numerical analysis besides with referring to the offshore pipeline dynamic analysis it is also possible to establish the sft on the abaqus aqua platform to directly consider the influence of the fluid force by key words fi and fdd to realize the moving vehicle loading on the numerical sft model the vdload subroutine interface is used to apply the vehicle load and position to the structure in real time in the vdload subroutine interface the positional parameter curcoords is used for transmitting the contact position information between the vehicle and the tube and the status parameter values is used to store the contact force to illustrate the effectiveness of the analysis simulation method a once studied single degree freedom vehicle crossing the bridge is illustrated as an example yang et al 2004 as shown in fig 7 the bridge is l 25 m long simply supported beam the area of section and the inertia moment are a 2 0 m2 and i 0 12 m4 respectively the beam elastic modulus and the mass per unit length are e 27 5gpa and m 4800 kg m the vehicle mass and the spring stiffness coefficient are m v 1200 kg and k v 500 kn m respectively the vehicle velocity is 10 m s and the damping of the vehicle is not considered in the calculation besides another finite element model is also established in abaqus explicit module to illustrate in the numerical model the moving vehicle is regarded as the spring mass block acting on the beam by comparing the results of two methods with that of the reference shown in fig 8 there are good agreements among the three results and the reasonability of the proposed method is verified 3 3 results analysis 3 3 1 deflection and cable force response of the tube comparing the test with numerical results in the basic test case m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 fig 9 a and b show the tube vertical deflections and the relative change of the cable forces under the moving vehicle load respectively it can be found that the tube deflection and the relative change of the cable force are roughly consistent with the results obtained by the numerical simulation method however the tube deflections on the ds 1 4l ds 1 2l ds 3 5l and ds 3 4l calculated by the numerical simulation show smoother than the test results the relative changes of the cable forces on the cfs 1 cfs 2 cfs 3 cfs 4 and cfs 5 cable behave apparent local fluctuations at some moments the possible reason for the phenomenon is the discontinuous connection between the tunnel tubes in the reality test due to the existing of the flanges and the silicone pads the vehicle will have some jumps when it passes through the connection of the tube but it can be completely eliminated in the numerical simulation meantime compared with the numerical simulation model the difference in the real water environment also has a certain impact besides whether it is the tube or the cable they can restore to the initial level after the vehicle passes through the structure it shows entire sft system is still in the status of elastic recoverability during the test table 4 gives the maximum values of the tube displacement and the cable force responses in different positions to further illustrate the dynamic behavior of the sft subjected to the moving vehicle in the m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 case the maximum deflection values of ds l 1 2l and ds r 1 2l at the mid span measurement points are 0 945 mm and 0 922 mm respectively the deflection time history curves on the ds l 1 2l and ds r 1 2l do not show much difference which means the tunnel tube does not have apparent torsion during the moving vehicle moving through the tube at ds 1 4l and ds 3 4l symmetric positions along the length of the tube the maximum deflection values are 0 752 mm and 0 756 mm respectively meantime the relative change of cable force on the same section cfs 3 and cfs 5 cable force have reached to 40 51 n and 38 66 n respectively as a whole the dynamic responses of the tube displacement and the cable force behave a good symmetry property from the experimental results it is not obvious coupling vibration of the vertical direction and other directions for the tunnel tube the test case repeated twice the average errors of the two tube deflections and the cable forces are within 6 3 3 2 acceleration response of the tube the continuous wavelet transform cwt is used to deal with the acceleration signal of the characteristic positions on the tube pan and kusunoki 2018 so the time frequency characteristics of the sft under moving vehicle load can be acquired the process of cwt can be written as 2 w ξ η a p ψ ξ η ξ 1 2 a p t ψ t η ξ dt where a p t is the acceleration signal ψ t l 2 r is mother wavelet and the morlet wavelet is applied in the process a p ψ ξ η denotes inner product between a p and ψ ξ η ψ denotes the conjugate operation w ξ η is the wavelet coefficient at scale factor ξ and shift factor η by adjusting the scale and the shift factors the time frequency characteristics of the acceleration signal of the test can be intuitively obtained fig 10 a c e and g gives the vertical acceleration signals of the tube on the as l 4 as 1 2l as 3 5l and as 3 4l positions the corresponding time frequency graphs are shown in fig 10 b d f and h seen from the acceleration time frequency graph the main frequency can be captured for traversing through the entire process during vehicle moving the main frequencies corresponding to the as 1 4l as 1 2l as 3 5l and as 3 4l positions are 10 55 hz 6 13 hz 6 25 hz and 10 64 hz respectively besides some distinct transient high frequencies components appear at times t 7 54s 39 65s 68 78s 97 92 127 32s and 157 63s which also could be tracked in the acceleration time history curves in addition to the impact of the vehicle entering and exiting the tube the discontinuous connection between the tunnel tubes lead to impact effect the first and second orders natural frequencies of the test model analyzed by fem are 6 31 hz and 11 76 hz comparing the results with the test results the frequency difference respectively are 1 21 hz 0 18 hz 0 06 hz and 1 12 hz according the simplified theoretical frequency equation proposed by lin et al 2018 table 5 gives the first two orders natural frequencies of the sft model by different methods 3 ω n e i m n π l 4 k m n 1 2 3 where ω n is the nth order circular frequency of the sft it is found that the structural frequency obtained by the test f test is a little bit less than the results of numerical analysis f fromula and the results of fem analysis f fem are close to the values f fromula estimated by eq 3 the simplified theoretical frequency equation can reveal the rationality and reliability of the structural frequency besides the connection between the tubes and the cables the tubes and the tubes will partially weaken the overall stiffness of the real testing structure 3 3 3 tube strain response in the case of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 fig 11 gives the strain time history responses of the tube at ss 1 2l ss 3 5l and ss 3 4l positions according to the results the strain responses between the numerical model and the test have a similar change law but the strain values measured by the model test at different positions are slighter smaller than that of the monitoring positions calculated by the numerical model the reason is that the tool type strain sensor records the average strain around the monitoring position which leads to a smaller value than the calculation in the mid span section of the sft the strain curves of ss 1 2l are roughly symmetric but there is a spike on the ss b 1 2l strain curve because the strain sensor is installed on the tube bottom surface it will be extruded by the vehicle wheels during the test on the contrary the spike does not occur in the strain curves on the tube top surface 4 discussion on influence factors 4 1 effect of anchor cable inclination angle and diameter as for the actual sft engineering structure the reasonable inclination angle and diameter of the anchor cable are of great significance to the sft operation defining the dynamic amplification factor daf through eq 4 the effect of anchor cable inclination angle on the sft during the vehicle moving is discussed in the cases of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 1 d 2 and m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 2 as shown in fig 12 a and b 4 dynamic amplification factor daf r max r s t a 1 where r max and r sta are the absolute maximum responses under the action of dynamic and static loads lin et al 2018 from the numerical results the deflection dafs on the ds 1 4l and ds 3 4l positions are larger than that on the ds 3 5l and the ds 1 2l positions in which the deflection daf of the ds 1 2l position is the minimum the similar results also occur in the daf of cable force the cable force dafs of the cfs 1 and the cfs 4 approaching the tube ends are bigger than the values of the cfs 2 and the cfs 3 cables the results mean the vehicle driving effect on the tube around the middle part is much smaller than that around the 1 4l and 3 4l positions besides in the different anchor cable diameter cases of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 and m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 2 the deviation amplification effect also exists in the results as shown in fig 13 a and b meantime the overall change law reflected from the experimental results is similar to the numerical simulation in general on this basis the effect of anchor inclination and diameter on the dynamic responses of the sft under moving vehicle load is further analyzed it is found from fig 12 a that it can theoretically cut the deflection dafs of the tube by increasing the inclination angle of anchor cable but the cable force dafs of the sft with larger inclination angle will become more non uniform as shown in fig 12 b changing the cable diameter from 0 5 mm to 1 mm the deflection dafs have been drastically decreased meantime the cable force dafs also have been reduced with the cable diameter increasing it shows different changes in the cable force dafs when increasing the cable inclination angle or the cable diameter for the convenience of discussion the deflection daf of the tube on the ds 3 5l position and the cable force daf of the cfs 3 cable are illustrated the influence difference between the cable diameter and the cable inclination angle as listed in table 6 the numerical results show that the reductions of the deflection daf in the ds 3 5l position are 0 518 and 1 086 respectively when increasing the cable inclination and the cable diameter correspondingly the reductions of the cable force daf on the cfs 3 cable are 0 743 and 1 163 respectively although the results are affected by a slight difference in the initial state it can be found that increasing the cable diameter is better than adjusting the cable inclination angle on reducing the dynamical impact of the sft under moving vehicle load 4 2 effect of vehicle moving velocity as an underwater traffic structure the vehicle moving velocity determines the sft transport capacity adjusting the driving velocity of vehicle the cases v 1 10r min 0 067 m s v 2 20r min 0 109 m s v 3 30r min 0 159 m s v 4 50r min 0 238 m s and v 5 70r min 0 294 m s of the sft with different cable spacing under vehicle moving load were carried out to analyze the influence of vehicle moving velocity fig 14 a and b give the deflection dafs of the tube at the ds 3 5l and the ds 3 4l positions and the cable force dafs of the cfs 3 and the cfs 4 cables in the cases of m 2 o 2 a 2 d 1 due to the deviation amplification effect the dafs of the ds 3 4l position and cfs 4 cable are larger than that of the 3 5l position and the cfs 3 cable meantime with increasing the vehicle velocity the deflection and the cable force dafs both have a certain degree growth in contrast to the cases of m 2 o 1 a 2 d 1 see fig 15 the deflection and the cable force dafs increase with the growth of velocity but the deviation amplification effect is not obvious as the cases of m 2 o 2 a 2 d 1 in other words the sft with dense anchor cables has a smaller deviation amplification effect than the sft with sparse anchor cables in addition the deflection sensor ds 3 5l and the cable force sensor cfs 3 which are set in the same positions on different cable spacing cases could be quantitative to illustrate the vehicle velocity influence difference according to the numerical results in the cases of m 2 o 2 a 2 d 1 the deflection daf of the ds 3 5l position varies from 1 603 to 1 781 when the vehicle velocity increases from 10r m to 70r min the cable force dafs of the cfs 3 cable are 1 579 and 1 769 corresponding to the vehicle velocity v 1 10r min and v 5 70r min meantime the deflection dafs results in the cases of m 2 o 1 a 2 d 1 are 1 131 and 1 293 respectively and the cable force dafs of the cfs 3 cable varies from 1 591 to 1 729 when the vehicle velocity changes as shown in fig 15 a and b although there is some variability in the experimental results the overall trends could be reflected in the curves the sensitivities of the deflection and the cable force on the vehicle velocity not behave too much different meantime the sensitive difference to the vehicle velocity between the sft with dense cables and the sft with sparse cables also shows not too much obvious 4 3 effect of different vehicle weight and the number of vehicle in the model experiment the moving vehicle is made of several steel plates bolted by vertical screws changing the number of steel plates the effect of vehicle mass m 1 m 2 and m 3 on the vibration characteristic of the sft can be analyzed in the cases of v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 table 7 gives the maximum deflections of the tube on the ds 1 2l position and the maximum cable force variations of the cfs 3 cable respectively since the numerical model does not take into account any nonlinearity the variation of the deflection and the cable force increase linearly with the growth of vehicle weight in contrast the test results basically are close to the numerical calculation and maintain a good linear growth characteristic but the deviation will increase with the increasing of the vehicle weight in the case of m 3 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 the maximum cable force variation measured by the model test is slightly higher than that of numerical calculation anchor cables serve as the flexible supporting members in the sft which should provide sufficient strength to the structure and be controlled in the elastic stage for safety in the design in the case of m 2 v 1 o 2 a 2 d 1 it is realized by bundling the steel wire on the screws to increase the number of vehicle on the test the tests of the sft under the different number of vehicles are carried out where the distance is 15 cm between the vehicles fig 16 a and b give the time history curves of the deflection on the ds 3 5l position and the strain on the ss 1 2l b position respectively with the increasing the number of vehicle the deflection curves of experiments are still in a good agreement with the numerical results meantime the number of spikes also increases in the strain time history curves when the sft suffers more vehicles on the whole the effect of different vehicle weight and the number of vehicle on the sft mainly behave the liner growth principle because the experiment model is designed in the elastic stage 5 conclusion based on the sft overall structure model the work investigated the overall dynamic behaviors of the sft under moving vehicle load according to the experimental results the numerical simulation method for the sft by abaqus was verified the implementation of the moving vehicle load and the tube fluid force were realized on the sft numerical model by abaqus subroutine method through testing of the typical model cases the effects of different cable and vehicle parameters on the sfts with different cable spacing were discussed the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the sft tube does not have apparent torsion under the symmetrical moving vehicle load in static water environment it means that the vertical vibration of the sft is relatively independent to other directions 2 according to the test results of the acceleration response and the frequencies of the structure model the connection between the tubes will partially weaken the overall stiffness of the sft 3 the deviation amplification exists in the sft under moving vehicle load it results in the tube around 1 4l and 3 4l has larger dafs than that around the middle part increasing the cable inclination angle and the cable diameter can reduce the amplification effect of moving load on the sft but the effect of increasing the diameter of cable is better than that of adjusting the cable inclination angle 4 with increasing the vehicle velocity the deflection and the cable force dafs both have a certain degree growth besides the sft with dense anchor cables has a smaller marginal amplification effect than the sft with sparse anchor cables but the sensitive difference to the vehicle velocity between the sft with dense cables and the sft with sparse cables shows not too much obvious credit authorship contribution statement yiqiang xiang

20509,the form changeable boats have received much attention due to its far ranging applicability strong combat capability and the low operating cost this paper constructs a variable structure boat whose mainhull is planing hull form and twin retractable deep v side hulls are placed on both sides of the mainhull aims at assessing its seakeeping performance in the monomer form state mfs and the trimaran form state tfs by model tests numerical simulation and sea trials regular head wave tests were conducted at volume froude numbers fr ranging from 0 44 to 2 67 for the mfs and tfs models verification and validation of the cfd method were performed the influences of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs model under different wave configurations were analysed sea trials of the full scale vessel usv in irregular sea were also carried out at the design velocities the results show that the tfs has different effects on motion responses and vertical accelerations of the model at different speeds and wavelengths the applicable range of side hulls with gain effect is in the diaplacement and semi planing stage and the maximum velocity is suggested not to exceed fr 2 22 for the usv at fr 1 33 the tfs mainly cut down its roll in irregular head sea followed by following and beam sea when the fr increases to 1 78 the roll gain declines but the pitch gains more the better side

the usv 1 introduction conventional water surface vehicles are relatively single in application mode and operational sea area while the marine environment is often changing and hard to predict thus the demand for a low cost variable structure surface vehicle that can adapt to different sea conditions and combat missions is particularly urgent wang et al 2021 planing hulls are high speed marine vessels that are known as good performers in calm water and due to its deep v prismatic configuration their static stability is generally superior to traditional ships savitsky 1964 1985 wang et al 2020 therefore the mainhull of variable structure boat in this paper was designed as the planing hull form to make it has superior rapidity and static stability however the small vessels are the most vulnerable to the rough sea gene et al 2019 even in the gently sloped wave the larger wave induced motions and vertical accelerations may appear which extremely threaten the survivability of the vessel and the mariners anders et al 2017 in addition considering some special tasks based on the variable structure boat such as arranging ultra short baseline positioning system under medium or higher sea condition applying sonar and fiber optic hydrophone thin line array to monitor underwater environment et al it is necessary for the vessel to have better seakeeping and directional stability when sailing at low or medium speeds thus referring to the design concept of multi hull boats poundra et al 2017 yanuar and waskito 2017 wang et al 2018 ghadimi et al 2019 nazemian and ghadimi 2021 a variable structure boat which can achieve the form state switching between the mfs and tfs by retracting and releasing side hulls is first proposed in this paper on the one hand the vessel in the tfs has higher rapidity by releasing the side hulls to inhibit longitudinal porpoising instability of mainhull planing hull in high speed planing regime wang et al 2021 on the other hand at medium and low speed more longitudinal and transverse damping moments are provided by releasing side hulls thus improving the seakeeping and directional stability of the boat in waves and this paper focus on assessing the seakeeping of the variable structure boat in the mfs and the tfs since the unsteady motions of a vessel in waves were found in ulstein and faltinsen 1996 larger wave induced motion and vertical acceleration at bow were again observed in katayama et al 2000 recent years due to the prosperity of mathematical model and excellence in experimental apparatus it emerged a lot of works on exploring the seakeeping improvement of high performance boats combing 2d t theory and boundary element method bem sun and odd 2010a b performed nonlinear time domain simulations of a prismatic planing boat in incident waves dong et al designed three deep v planing hulls to achieve the wave piercing in rough sea and evaluated their hydrodynamic characteristics wang et al 2014 estimated the motion laws of the vessel sailing in head waves using cfd method ascertained that the effects of irregular jump on response amplitudes are stronger than the regular jump to assess the motion of a planing craft in seaway validation and testing of a computational model were presented in himabindu and morel 2020 besides the steering qualities on the broaching to behaviour of a planing craft in following and stern quartering waves were assessed by the 3d time domain boundary element method in bonci et al 2019 and validated using model tests in regular waves which shows that the modification of turning ability was beneficial to avoid the inception of broaching to inversely caused dynamics control loss moreover wave piercing design of small crafts sailing in adverse sea is a revolution seo et al 2016 assessed the resistance and seakeeping of a wave piercing high speed vessel with spray rails and optimized its installation wei et al 2019 developed four typical wave piercing crafts studied their wave piercing hydrodynamics analysed the advantages of each original hull form in resistance and dynamic effects systematic model tests can prompt engineers to deeply grasp the static water and seakeeping performance of vessels begovic et al 2012 2014 carried out a systematic experimental program of the warped planing hull series assessed the effect of dead rise angle variation along hull length on resistance and seakeeping indicating that the bottom warping can reduce the influence of higher order harmonics and the effect is more evident at bow and higher speeds also the statistical analysis on motion responses and accelerations in irregular head sea was completed in begovic et al 2016 further deluca and pensa 2017 2019 conducted a systematic test on the sekeeping of the naples systematic series nss warped hard chine hulls in irregular head waves which provided valuable data to detect the influence of hull form on the seakeeping also the extended campaigns of the tests cartwright lounguet higgins and probability density function were performed to describe heave pitch motion and vertical accelerations and aimed at the unsteady planing in waves of the c2s hull one of the nss models sasan et al 2020 studied the wave induced dynamic responses and vertical accelerations by model tests cfd and 2d t model judge et al 2020 assessed the test and cfd capability on the slamming of high velocity deep v planing hulls operating in head waves indicated that the emerging slam was due to the hull emerging from next wave peak and being pushed airborne large wave induced motions and vertical accelerations normally restrain the maximum speed of boats but that can be controlled by using external devices such as hydrofoils interceptors trim tabs stern flaps as described in bi et al 2020 park et al 2019 sakaki et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition in the doctoral thesis of jiang 2018 also indicates that the twin side hulls of a high speed trimaran planing craft is beneficial to improve seakeeping but that increases navagation resistance at high speeds thus a newly developed variable structure boat whose mainhull is hard bilge planing hull form and capable of freely retracting and releasing the twin slender deep v side hulls is constructed in this paper in medium or high sea conditions it expands into the tfs to resist the rough sea at lower velocities when on a relatively calm sea it maintains the mfs to advance rapidly but due to the strong interference of nonlinear factors between mainhull and side hull there are few studies concerned with the seakeeping of such a variable structure boat thus its resistance and seakeeping performance in regular and irregular waves were assessed in this research the paper structure is organized as follows section 2 presents the geometric description of the mfs and tfs model and their seakeeping tests results in the displacement and semi planing stage fr 0 44 2 67 section 3 gives a brief introduction of the cfd method and section 4 conducts the verification and validation studies and the influences of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs model under different wave configurations and design speeds fr 1 33 1 78 are analysed in section 5 then sea trials of the usv is carried out to verify the cfd and the optimal side hull draft ratio is obtained in section 6 finally conclusions are provided in section 7 2 towing tank tests 2 1 model design this investigation took a 1 3 scale model of the actual variable structure boat usv no 7 capable of freely retracting and releasing twin side hulls by electric cylinders mounted on outrigger as research object its mfs and tfs are shown in fig 1 and the principal parameters of the boat at each form state are listed in table 1 the variable structure boat is mainly composed of mainhull planing hull twin side hulls and outrigger its mainhull is slender square tailed non stepped has a larger knuckle line width and a plurality of spray deflectors with variant dimensions are symmetrically installed at its hull bottom to improve its seakeeping and resistance performance the twin side hulls are symmetrically arranged at both broadsides of the mainhull by outrigger and electric cylinders slender deep v vertical in bilge provide partial buoyancy and lift to improve directional stability of the mainhull the moulded lines of mainhull and side hull are presented in fig 2 besides to conveniently adjust to the cg location and urge the tfs more easily to start planing the side hulls were placed on both sides of the rear of mainhull as shown in fig 1 b the specific location is listed in table 1 2 2 experimental setup all model tests were conducted in the towing tank 510 m 6 5 m 6 8 m of the high velocity hydrodynamic laboratory of special aircraft research institute of china involving the seakeeping and resistance performance of the mfs and tfs models considering the twin side hulls were not contacted with sea surface in the mfs both were not installed in the tests of mfs model but the mainhull was ballasted to ensure the equal displacement δ and l cg with that of the tfs the model was attached to a carriage 0 1 as shown in fig 3 and two guide robs were fixed in the carriage separately inserted into the guide plates of bow and stern towing points were located at the broadside and aligned with the cg both cable extension displacement sensor 0 01 mm and gyroscope 0 01 were fixed at the cg to measure the motion of heave and pitch three acceleration sensors was separately installed on the cg deck of bow and stern to measure vertical accelerations longitudinal distances of the bow and stern acceleration sensors from the cg were 1 38 m and 0 82 m vertical distance from the cg were 0 127 m the electronic dynamometer 0 02 kg was mounted on carriage pulled tow bar for measuring resistance the accuracy of measuring instruments are presented in the corresponding brackets and the front and rear cameras were fixed on the fore and aft of carriage to capture the experimental phenomena of the model sailing in regular waves for the mfs and tfs models the calm water resistance tests and seakeeping tests were carried out in the displacement and semi planing stage volume froude numbers fr ranged from 0 44 to 2 67 v m 1 6 m s and aimed at the regular head wave tests in the displacement mode six groups of different operational conditions oc were designed and shown in table 2 the δ and l cg of mfs and tfs models were 137 3 kg 0 882 m respectively the wave height ζw was 0 05 m wavelength λ ranged from 1 l m to 4 l m the specific characteristics of regular waves are listed in table 3 2 3 experimental results motion response of the boat in waves is low frequency and narrow frequency band after those time history curves of motion responses vertical accelerations and resistance in regular waves were collected through the data acquisition system the fft fs spectrum thinning technology was used to process the motion response measured by experiment then according to the oscillation curves the peak values y p and trough values y t in same period were measured and the double amplitudes y p y t of heave h m pitch θ m accelerations at bow a b cg a g stern a s the average resistance r m and the added wave resistance r ma in each wave condition as well as calm water resistance r t were obtained those are detaily listed in appendix i above results were further processed into the dimensionless form h m and θ m were transformed into the forms of response amplitude operators raos based on the means of begovic et al 2014 the a b a g and a s were expressed as the a b g a g g and a s g respectively the r m and r ma were treated into r m δ and r ma δ the comparison of test results for mfs and tfs models was shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows the change of heave rao η3 ζ a with increasing wavelength for mfs and tfs models at different velocities when λ l m 1 3 3 5 and 4 at same velocity the heave rao of tfs are less than the mfs especially when λ l m 3 the beneficial effect is more obvious when λ l m 2 5 fr 0 44 and 0 89 the heave rao of tfs still reduces but at fr 0 67 that of tfs get more intense likewise when λ l m 1 5 2 the heave rao of tfs aggravates compared with the mfs the adverse effect is even more serious when λ l m 2 fig 4 b shows the comparisons of mfs and tfs models on pitch rao η5 kζ a at different wavelengths and velocities when λ l m 2 at equal velocity the pitch rao of tfs are obviously less than the mfs and the advantaged effect is more remarkable when λ l m 2 5 3 later with the increase of wavelength the advantage of tfs declines likewise it also exists a decrease on pitch rao of tfs when λ l m 2 fr 0 44 0 89 but when λ l m 1 that of tfs is more intense when λ l m 1 5 the effect on pitch rao of tfs becomes a little confusing summing up the above in displacement mode at longer wavelengths λ l m 2 the tfs can cut down the heave and pitch amplitudes of the model in head waves especially for the pitch rao the gain effect is improved more at shorter wavelength λ l m 1 the tfs is also useful to reduce the heave rao but aggravates the pitch due to the higher encounter frequency between waves and hulls when λ l m 1 5 2 considering the existence of resonance wavelength region the effect on heave and pitch amplitudes of the tfs becomes confusing fig 4 c e shows the comparisons of mfs and tfs on a b a g and a s at different wavelengths and velocities when λ l m 2 at same wavelength the a b a g a s all gradually increase with the increasing velocity the velocity has larger influence on the a b followed by the a g and a s moreover whether the mfs or the tfs with the increase of wavelength the a b a g and a s all sharply increase to a maximum value at λ l m 1 5 or 2 then gradually decrease to a relatively smaller value at λ l m 4 which indicates the resonance wavelength λ r is nearby λ l m 1 5 or 2 and it is worth noting that the λ r seems to move towards a longer wavelength as velocity increasing at resonance wavelengths such as fr 0 44 λ l m 1 5 fr 0 67 λ l m 1 5 fr 0 89 λ l m 2 the a b of tfs reduce compared with the mfs but the a g of tfs appear dramatic increase and the a s of tfs become exceptionally large at fr 0 44 λ l m 1 5 the above show that nearby the λ r the release of side hulls at the rear of mainhull broadsides side hull location of tfs in table 1 can reduce the a b to a certain extent but causes the a g and a s to enlarge the side hull location is sensitive to the acceleration oscillation of the tfs when resonance occurs in addition for longer wavelengths λ l m 2 at fr 0 44 the tfs has little effect on the reduction of the a b a g a s even aggravates at most wavelengths but at fr 0 67 0 89 there exists evident decrease on a b a g a s of tfs at λ l m 2 5 later the gain effect on acceleration amplitudes declines as wavelength increasing that implies at the lower velocity fr 0 44 the side hulls take no effect on weakening the acceleration amplitudes and generate no or less damping but works at the slightly higher velocities in displacement mode fig 4 f shows that the r m of mfs and tfs appear a marked rise with increasing velocity the tfs causes r m to increase at λ l m 1 3 4 moreover the added wave resistance r ma of tfs decreases at fr 0 44 0 67 compared with mfs especially at fr 0 67 the decline is remarkable however for the r ma at λ l m 4 a negative value unexpectedly appears that was mainly caused by measurement errors at fr 0 89 the comparison of r ma for mfs and tfs models at different wavelengths is a bit messy fig 5 shows that the ship travelling wave elevation around the bow of tfs is obviously lower than the mfs the wave elevation around side hulls also appears slight decline that implies the side hulls improve the seakeeping of vessel besides for tfs the wave elevation of stern wake is higher that was caused by the superposition of each other for the stern wakes of side hulls and mainhull fig 6 shows the wave surface around the tfs model at fr 1 78 v m 4 m s and 2 67 v m 6 m s in the velocity range the navigation of mainhull was in the semi planing stage as shown in fig 6 a at fr 1 78 the spray from mainhull mainly concentrated around its forward bilge only a fraction interfered the bow of side hulls but due to the existence of side hull travelling waves there still formed a very high elevation in the upper part of side hull bow deck besides the heave and pitch amplitudes in short wavelength waves were obviously smaller however the oscillation was more frequent due to the higher encounter frequency as velocity increasing in the semi planing stage the spray from mainhull gradually moved backward and became more violent at fr 2 67 as shown in fig 6 b a majority of spray from mainhull midship splashed the bow of side hull and the backward spray formed extremely violent jet between mainhull and side hull which caused the tfs to oscillate more frequently and suffered more resistance including spray resistance interfered its normal navigation thus for side hulls the applicable range with gain effect is in the diaplacement mode and partial velocity range of the semi planing stage the maximum velocity is recommended not to exceed fr 2 22 3 computational fluid dynamics 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model to simulate the viscous flow field around the sailing vessel the governing equations of viscous incompressible fluid were introduced and solved by the simple solver based on the star ccm software as described in patankar and spalding 1992 meanwhile the shear stress transport turbulence sst k ω model was adopted to solve the reynolds stress term despite that the strong adverse pressure gradient led to inaccurate solution of the rans model existed some application limitations in menter 1994 ghasemi et al 2014 the sst k ω turbulence model still can be used to deal with high reynolds number flow problems due to its higher precision on solving the flow field around planing crafts wang et al 2013 3 2 dynamic fluid body interaction dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi module was used to obtain the hull position and sailing attitudes in this research bi et al 2020 the dfbi module includes solving force and moment on hull surface and 6 dof rigid body motion model based on obtained mesh node displacement stress and pressure of the flow field the combined force f and moment m acted on the hull can be obtained by integrating as follows 1 f s τ p i n d s g 2 m s r r g τ p i n d s where τ p i and g are the shear stress pressure and gravity respectively s is the hull surface area r is the displacement of mesh nodes and r g is the displacement of cg then in order to predict ship motions in waves 6 dof rigid body motion model were solved with the combined force and the combined moment on hull surface the equations was given as 3 d b d t ω b f d k d t ω k v b m where b is the momentum of the model ω p q r is the angular velocity f x y z is the combined force k is the momentum moment relative to the cg v u v w is the velocity and m l m n is the combined moment moreover to expediently describe the ship motions two right handed cartesian coordinate systems were adopted including an absolute inertial earth fixed coordinate system and a relative non inertial ship fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 7 positive x y and z pointed to bow port and upward direction respectively in the two coordinate system ship fixed coordinate system moves with the motions of ship and its origin is always fixed at the cg of the ship 3 3 computational domain and boundary conditions to prevent the reflection of waves in the computational domain and obtain a better precision the domain should be no less than five times the hull length bi et al 2019 thus it was designed to a cuboid region with dimensions of 7 5 l m 2 l m 2 6 l m the specific dimensions of detail regions were depicted in fig 8 considering the symmetry of the model and flow field only half domain of the model was established to reduce the simulation duration the boundary conditions of computational domain have far reaching influence on solving the governing equations in this research overset region was embedded in the background region as shown in fig 8 and boundary conditions were set as follows for the background region incoming flow inlet top bottom and side were all set to the velocity inlet the outlet was the pressure outlet the middle longitudinal section was a symmetry plane for the overset region the mid ship section was still a symmetry plane the ambient planes were set to the overset mesh boundaries and the hull body was defined as non slip wall 3 4 wave generating method volume of fluid vof model was used to simulate the incident regular waves this model can not only generate regular waves with different wavelengths and wave heights by defining boundary condition also can control the velocity and pressure parameters of inlet and outlet to simulate the wave and damp to simulate a realistic viscous non linear wave as much as possible the non linear fifth order wave was built in the model and to verify its accuracy second order stokes wave wang et al 2014 was introduced to compare with the numerical nonlinear wave l m ζw 23 λ l m 1 the comparison was shown in fig 9 as can be seen the non linear regular wave generated by the vof model is satisfactory in addition the vof model was primitively designed by hirt and nichols 1981 to track the change of free surface in flow field the most critical treatment is to obtain the function f which is the volume occupancy ratio of the specified fluid in a grid cell when the f values in each grid cell are obtained the motion interface of the liquid gas two phase flow can be tracked 3 5 overset grid method overset grid method involves with region segmentation and grid combination which includes background and overset region as shown in fig 10 the grids of in the two regions were defined as follow the cutting hexahedron grids were used to discretise the background region both cutting hexahedron grids and prismatic layer grids were chosen to fill the overset region due to the complex geometrical details of hull body and to obtain the accurate flow characteristics around the hull the circumambience of hull was refined by smaller hexahedron grids in the local refinement region the grids around the free surface in the two regions need to be set to exceed twenty layers in vertical direction to clearly capture the change of free surface also the boundary layer grids were imposed on the surface of hull body fig 10 b shows the grid combination of overset method which includes two parts 1 divide grid cells in the entire domain into effective cells and invalid cells by hole cutting method only the effective cells participate in solving flow field 2 find contributor cells which means matching contributor cells with corresponding recipient cells contributor cells and receiver cells combine together and form an information exchange region where the hole boundary nodes of background region grids and the extrapolation nodes of overset region grids can mutually exchange grid information through linear interpolation the formation of the hole boundary nodes was due to the removal of the invalid cells in the background region and the extrapolation nodes is formed along the boundary of overset region both are closely coupled and the governing equations were solved simultaneously in the effective cells of the two regions 3 6 wall y and time step set up accurate boundary layer grids set up is vital to solve the stress and pressure of flow field around the hull thus five boundary layers with a grid growth rate of 1 3 were adopted and the wall functions was used to simulate the non slip hull wall the wall non dimensional distance of the first layer grid y was determined as below 4 y y υ 1 2 u 2 0 074 r e l wl 1 5 where y is the realistic height of first layer grid u is the velocity of vessel l wl is waterline length of the vessel υ is the fluid viscosity coefficient re is the reynolds number in addition wang 2005 analysed the influence of y on turbulence problem indicating that the y value near the hull should be restrained between 30 and 300 thus six different y values of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 were selected and based on medium grid and medium time step δt 0 006s simulations of different y for the mfs model at fr 0 89 were conducted the time histories of calm water resistance for different y are presented in fig 11 that shows when velocities are lower the smaller y is more accurate to simulate the boundary layers inversly the larger y causes the accuracy to decline thus the y 50 is identified as the more suitable choice besides considering the δt depends on flow characteristics in the implicit unsteady simulation su et al 2020 the initial range of δt was obtained as follow 5 δ t 0 005 0 01 l wl u 4 verification and validation evaluation of the numerical results was conducted using asme v 2009 validation procedure the american society of mechanical engineers 2009 which was based on experimental data numerical solution experimental and numerical uncertainties and input parameter uncertainties considering that all the input parameters were determinate thus their uncertainties were assumed to be zero the tests of mfs and tfs models in calm water and regular wave have been carried out to validate the numerical method subsequently verification and validation have been conducted for the two models advancing in calm water and regular head wave at fr 0 89 4 1 verification of cfd code 4 1 1 calm water resistance systematic uncertainty analysis includes grid time step and iterative convergence verification that has been carried out by referring to xing and stern 2010 in the method the convergence ratio r was defined as 6 r s f s m s m s c when 0 r 1 the monotonic convergence is obtained according to richardson extrapolation method the order of accuracy p re can be acquired as 7 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r a distance measurement to the asymptotic range was adopted by the ratio p and according to the factor of safety method numerical uncertainty u fs was computed as 8 u f s 2 45 0 85 p s f s m r p r e 1 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p 1 for grid convergence verification three different grids with grid refinement ratio r g 2 were designed whose grid parameters are listed in table 4 based on y 50 and medium time step calculations for resistance of mfs and tfs models in calm water were conducted under the coarse medium and fine grids and the corresponding results s gc s gm and s gf are shown in table 5 for time step convergence verification three time steps with r t 2 were designed separately corresponding to coarse δt 0 0085s medium δt 0 006s and fine δt 0 0042s verification was based on y 50 and medium grid simulated results for resistance of the two models in calm water by coarse medium and fine time steps represented as s tc s tm and s tf were listed in table 6 for iterative convergence verification which was conducted on the medium grid and medium time step and those errors were very small the largest one did not even exceed 1 of the grid and time step errors in tables 5 and 6 thus the iterative errors could be neglected uncertainties of grid and time step verification were summarized in table 7 the convergence ratios r of both grid and time step were in the range of 0 1 which indicated that the monotonic convergence was achieved and the numerical uncertainties u fs could be obtained by using factor of safety method for mfs and tfs models the u fs of grid were 0 90 s f and 0 84 s f and those of time step were 0 38 s f and 0 43 s f respectively the grid uncertainty u g was obviously larger than time step uncertainty u t which showed that the grid errors occupied a dominant position for numerical uncertainty moreover the grid and time step convergence verification was achieved 4 1 2 motions in regular head wave likewise verification of the motion response for mfs and tfs models sailing in the regular head waves l m ζw 46 λ l m 3 at fr 0 89 has been completed using the same method three different grids with r g 2 and three different time steps with r t 2 were used as designed above likewise the monotonic convergence was achieved and the factor of safety method was used to calculate the numerical uncertainties the results of grid and time step convergence verification for the heave and pitch double amplitudes were shown in table 8 and the verification results were shown in table 9 overall good convergence for both grid and time step were achieved subsequently the medium grid and medium time step were selected for the next numerical study 4 2 validation of cfd code in validation process the comparison error e is computed using numerical result s and test data d defined as 9 e d s and the validation uncertainty u v is calculated as 10 u v 2 u d 2 u f s 2 the u fs can be obtained as 11 u f s 2 u g 2 u t 2 u i 2 validation of the numerical results can be conducted by comparing e with u v when e u v the numerical method is considered to be validated under the u v level 4 2 1 calm water resistance the calm water resistance tests have been conducted to validate the numerical method and the experimental details and data were shown in section 2 according to those the results of validation for resistance of the two models can be obtained and shown in table 10 the validation results show e u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level fig 12 shows the comparison of numerical results cfd and experimental data efd for total resistance r t δ of mfs and tfs models when fr 0 44 2 22 as can be seen the cfd results of total resistance agree well with experimental data for all design speeds fig 13 shows the wave pattern generated of tfs model advancing in calm water in the semi diaplacement or semi planing stage the wave pattern is useful to analyze ship resistance and wave making interference between hulls as can be observed in fig 13 originally the wave rising at bow is obvious with the increase of speed the wave at bow gradually moves towards midship at the same time the wave gradually evolves into the spray and jet at the ship s bilge it could be observed that higher wave is formed at the bow of side hull fig 13 c which is caused by the interference effects between wave systems of mainhull and side hull besides with the increase of fr the wave making region behind the stern becomes lankier and the cocktail wake and cavity move far away from the stern 4 2 2 motions in regular head wave seakeeping tests have been conducted in order to validate the simulated heave and pitch table 10 shows the validation results likewise the comparison errors e of both heave and pitch motion are lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level then those wave conditions l m ζw 46 λ l m 1 4 were further selected to calculate the motions and accelerations of the mfs and tfs models at fr 0 44 using the validated numerical method the comparison of cfd and efd results for raos a b g a g g and r m δ are shown in fig 14 and the specific errors are listed in appendix ⅱ fig 14 shows that the change trends of cfd results for raos a b and a g with increasing wave lengths are consistent with those of efd results in the long and gentle waves λ l m 2 the cfd results of raos agree well with test data for mfs and tfs models but in the short and steep waves λ l m 2 the error of raos becomes larger which are caused by the higher encounter frequency and the resonance further adding to the limitation of its own smaller amplitude for vertical accelerations the larger errors of a b appear in the longer and gentle waves λ l m 3 inversely the larger errors of a g are in the shorter and steep waves λ l m 2 and the difference is more prominent for the tfs model such interesting result implies that in short and steep waves the release of side hulls produces more nonlinear waves such as bow slamming which not only causes the a g of tfs model to become more violent also make the grid generate greater deformation resulting in the inability to capture more details of the flow field for the errors of r m except for the resonance wavelength λ l m 2 of mfs model remaining errors are controlled within 5 which indicates the cfd code can accurately predict the average resistance of the two model in head regular waves 5 result and discussion 5 1 seakeeping comparisons of the mfs and tfs model at higher velocities in this section based on the validated cfd code the sailing in head regular waves of the mfs and tfs models in the semi planing stage were simulated the selected velocities were fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 v m 3 4 5 m s and the characteristics of the operating waves are shown in table 11 fig 15 a b show the comparisons on raos of the mfs and tfs at fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 at longer wave lengths λ l m 2 the heave and pitch raos of tfs are evidently lower than that of the mfs and at same wavelength the gain effect of tfs is better as the velocity increases at shorter wave lengths λ l m 2 for the heave rao of tfs there still exists some adverse matching points such as fr 1 33 λ l m 1 2 fr 1 78 λ l m 2 but almost all the pitch raos of tfs are weaker than the mfs only at the short and steep wavelength λ l m 1 due to the limitation of its own smaller amplitude the gain effect of tfs is not obvious summing up the above the seakeeping of tfs model acquires better promotion at fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 especially at longer wavelengths the benficial effect gains more but the tfs is likely to cause larger heave amplitude at shorter wavelengths because more dynamic lift is acquired by side hulls as velocity increasing adding to the existence of higher ω e but inversely generates more damping to weaken the pitch response fig 15 c shows that the tfs can also better weaken the a b at shorter wavelengths λ l m 1 2 and the higher velocities fr 1 78 2 22 the reduced extent is more prominent due to more damping generated by side hulls for the a g at most wavelengths the a g of tfs are lower than the mfs and the higher velocities bring more gain effect however at fr 1 78 λ l m 3 5 or 4 an adverse phenomenon see fig 15 d appears due to the resonance between hulls and waves fig 15 d shows that the tfs brings more r m compared with mfs and as velocity increases the r m increases more thus to avoid sufferring more sailing resistance in waves the maximum velocity of tfs in semi planing stage is also suggested not to exceed fr 2 22 fig 15 f shows that at fr 1 33 the mfs brings more r ma inversely at fr 2 22 the r ma of tfs is more and far beyond the mfs indicating the tfs generates different effects on the r ma in semi planing stage fig 16 shows the comparison on wave surface of mfs and tfs at the crest when λ l m 1 which proves that the tfs is more conductive to improve the seakeeping at fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 as the velocity increases the pray from mainhull bilge moved backward more spray are splashed to the side hulls on both sides that results in more increase in added wave resistance of the tfs and accords with what was observed in the test 5 2 influence of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs model 5 2 1 draft adjustments of the twin side hulls in general the layout of twin side hulls has a subtle influence on the seakeeping and directional stabilities of the planing craft ghadimi et al 2019 analysed the influences of twin side hulls in longitudinal and horizontal layout on motion characteristics of a bow piercing trimaran in waves that was not considering the draft of side hull moreover aimed at the longitudinal instability wang et al 2021 discussed the influence of longitudinal and vertical side hull locations on inhibiting porpoising further offered the optimal range of side hull location thus the influence of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs was analysed in this section based on the a t in table 1 and considering the electric cylinder stroke l m and depth t d five different draft ratios d d t d were designed and presented in fig 17 which separately correspond to cases 1 5 in table 12 the specific side hull locations and corresponding l m were offered and the ratios δ d δ t l cgt ix t iy t v cgt of cases 1 5 were measured by utilizing the creo software 5 2 2 optimal side hull draft design on the seakeeping of tfs model in head waves as the cfd set up in section 4 simulations for cases 1 5 sailing in head waves were conducted the selected velocities and characteristics of operating waves were presented in table 13 then a detailed comparison of the raos a b a g r m for cases 1 5 is shown in fig 18 and the percentage change pc of gain effect relative to the mfs of above results were further listed in table 14 fig 18 and table 14 show that the raos a b g and a g g of cases 2 5 are lower than the mfs which further prove the gain effect of tfs at fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 specifically at fr 0 89 the deeper draft case 5 brings the heave rao and a g more gain effect see table 14 inversely weakens the gain effect of pitch rao even aggravates the a b and suffers more r m that is because the side hulls of case 5 provide more positive torque to mainhull and the damping torque is not enough to reduce the pitch response thus the lesser draft case 2 is suggested to adopt its heave and pitch raos are better and the r m increases less when fr 1 33 as the draft ratio increases the gain effect on raos a b a g all first increase then decrease at d d t d 0 67 that implies the deeper draft case 5 causes gain effect to decrease and it s worth noting that the r m of cases 2 4 are lesser compared with the mfs indicating that the better draft ratio is 0 67 case 4 at fr 1 33 the seakeeping is significantly improved and its r m is also reduced when fr 1 78 the deeper draft case 5 brings the tfs remarkable decline on raos a b and a g inversly causes r m to increase too much that is not conducive to the choice of the propeller in comparison case 3 is preferred as the most suitable draft the seakeeping is evidently improved at the cost of increasing very little resistance fig 19 a shows the wave elevation around case 4 at the crest when fr 1 33 the spray of mainhull is mainly distributed around its fore bilge and most is splashing in the front area of side hull bow which forms a favorable wave for entire vessel meanwhile due to the small submerged volume of side hulls the r m of cases 2 4 decline compared with the mfs however as the fr increases to 1 78 as shown in fig 19 b the spray of mainhull moves backward and the most is splashing on the bow of side hull some even is going over to the side hull deck which causes more volume of side hulls to be submerged in the waves thus leads to an increase in r m 5 3 seakeeping of the tfs model under larger wave height to ascertain the seakeeping of the tfs model under larger wave heights computations for the raos a b a g and r m of cases 1 5 in larger height head waves were performed in this section the selected velocities were still fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 the characteristics of operating waves are shown in table 15 besides considering the influence of larger wave heights to meticulously capture the change of wave surface obtain better accuracy the vertical dimensions of the free surface region was increased the specific grid size and corresponding total grid numbers are shown in table 16 table 17 shows the raos a b a g and r m of cases 1 5 and the corresponding pcs at ζw 0 1 m at fr 0 89 as the side hull draft increases the gain effects on heave rao and a g increase for the pitch rao and a b the better side hull draft is case 2 or 5 but the r m of case 5 is reduced more thus case 5 is selected as the optimal side hull draft when fr 1 33 the pitch rao and a b of case 4 reduce most however for the heave rao and a g the better side hull draft are case 5 and 3 respectively and the pcs of cases 2 5 are similar thus that is difficult to ascertain the optimal side hull draft but considering the better seaworthiness case 4 is suggested due to its smaller pitch rao besides fig 20 shows the wave elvations around mfs and case 4 at crest which proves the superiority of case 4 to improve the seakeeping when fr 1 78 the raos a b a g of case 5 are all superior to other cases but its r m increases more 12 62 in comparison case 3 is considered as the better choice the seakeeping acquires higher promotion and r m also declines slightly table 18 shows the raos a b a g and r m of cases 1 5 at ζw 0 15 m after detailed comparison on the pcs aimed at the seakeeping and resistance case 5 is confirmed as the best side hull draft at fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 fig 21 shows the sailing of mfs and case 5 at crest when fr 1 78 due to the bow lifting of mainhull the twin side hulls are still not submerged by the spray inversely pierce through the waves which leads to a reduction in resistance for the larger height head waves 6 sea trials 6 1 the full scale vessel to verify the gain effect of the twin side hulls on the full scale vessel usv scaling s 3 the usv capable of freely retracting and releasing side hulls by electric cylinders was assembled in dalian port arthur of china its principal parameters are listed in table 19 meanwhile to strengthen the structural strength and stability of the electric push rod a group of sleeves were installed on both sides of the push rod so that they can move synchronously with the push rod as shown in fig 22 a besides when the electric cylinder stroke l s was 0 3 m 0 4 m 0 5 m 0 6 m the side hull draft ratio reached 0 25 0 33 0 67 1 0 in turn separately corresponding to cases 6 9 6 2 sea trials in irregular sea the sea trials of usv were carried out in the sheepshead bay of port arthur as shown in fig 22 b where the wave height and surface water temperature was reported as 1 1 m sea state3 and 18 c respectively the sea trials of usv were conducted in a driverless way and it was instructed by the communication system to sail in the head oblique and following irregular sea along the pre planned rectangular path as depicted in fig 23 a the sea trials of the usv in mfs and tfs cases 6 9 were conducted at the design velocities fr 1 33 1 78 corresponding to v s 5 and 7 knots after the usv completed the rectangular path task the yaw angle velocity roll and pitch were recorded by integrated inertial navigation system as shown in fig 23 b e then according to the change trend of yaw with time step the roll and pitch of the usv in head beam and following sea could be intercepted as depicted in fig 23 adopting the same method to process other sea trial data of cases 6 9 at fr 1 33 and 1 78 the real time roll angle ϕs and pitch angle θs of the usv in head beam and following sea can be obtained and compared as shown in fig 24 then the rms values of ϕs and θs were calculated and compared in fig 25 further the pcs for cases 6 9 relative to mfs were also detaily listed in table 20 fig 25 a and table 20 a show that when fr 1 33 the tfs can reduce the usv s rms of roll and pitch to a certain extent improve the seakeeping of usv in head beam following irregular waves and compared with the pitch the rms of roll is reduced more especially in the head sea the gain effect pc is more significant that is even cut in nearly half 48 37 at d ds t ds 1 followed by the following and beam waves moreover whether in the head beam or following sea the usv s rms of roll and pitch show a downward trend with the increase of side hull draft thus when fr 1 33 the optimal side hull draft ratio is 1 0 both roll and pitch of the usv are obviously improved fig 25 b and table 20 b show that when fr 1 78 in head sea with the increase of draft ratio the side hulls were often completely submerged and came out of waves which aggravated the roll thus the smaller draft ratio d ds t ds 0 25 is more beneficial to the roll s gain inversely as draft ratio increasing the pitch gain increased first and then reduced at d ds t ds 0 67 and compared with fr 1 33 the pitch gain at fr 1 78 is greater in comparsion the draft ratio 0 67 can be chosen in head sea in which the gain of pitch is greatly improved and the roll is not aggravated in beam sea compared with fr 1 33 the roll gain at fr 1 78 declined the pitch gain still increased and that increased as draft ratio increasing however the excessive draft ratio d ds t ds 1 0 did not bring more gains to the pitch inversly it made the roll gain reduce thus in beam sea it is preferred that the side hull draft ratio is also 0 67 in following sea compared with fr 1 33 again the pitch gains more at this time and when side hull draft increases the roll gain reaches the maximum at d ds t ds 0 67 then decreases and pitch gain was not improved too much considering comprehensively 0 67 is still selected as the most suitable side hull draft ratio for the usv sailing in following waves summing up the above when fr 1 33 the better side hull draft ratio is 1 0 in which both roll and pitch in the head beam following sea were cut to the maximum extent it s suggested that the higher moulded depth of side hull should be designed to resist the rougher sea when fr 1 78 the optimal side hull draft ratio is 0 67 in which the pitch gains more in head and beam sea and the roll gain merely is a little worse pc 0 75 7 conclusion in this research a comparative analysis of the seakeeping performance for a variable structure boat in the mfs and tfs were conducted by model tests numerical simulations and sea trials the following conclusions can be drawn 7 1 model tests in the displacement mode at longer wavelengths the tfs can cut down the raos of the vessel in regular head waves and the pitch gains more than the heave but at shorter wavelengths the gain of side hulls is limited the velocity has larger influence on the a b followed by a g and a s and at the resonance wavelengths the tfs can reduce the a b to a certain extent but lead to severe oscillation at cg and stern at fr 0 44 the side hulls take no effect on weakening the vertical accelerations at longer wavelengths but generates positive effect at fr 0 67 0 89 as fr increased from 1 78 to 2 67 the spray from mainhull bow moved towards midship and gradually evolved into the jet at the ship s bilge which caused the tfs to oscillate more frequently interfered its normal navigation thus for side hulls the applicable range with gain effect is in the diaplacement mode and partial velocity range of the semi planing stage the maximum velocity is recommended not to exceed fr 2 22 7 2 cfd method verification and validation of the numerical method are achieved for the calm water resistance and ship motions in regular waves and the results show that at design speeds fr 0 89 1 78 the seakeeping of tfs can acquire better promotion especially at long wavelengths the gain effect of pitch is more remarkable as velocity increasing but at short wavelengths the tfs causes larger heave motion the tfs can weaken the a b and a g at most wavelengths but brings more navigation resistance in waves and added wave resistance the better side hull draft were analysed for the tfs under different wave heights in the long and gentle head waves l m ζw 46 better draft ratios are 0 25 0 67 0 33 corresponding to fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 respectively in the long and steep waves l m ζw 23 those are 1 0 0 67 0 33 in the steeper waves l m ζw 15 better draft ratios are 1 0 for all chosen velocities which indicates that the moulded depth of side hull should be designed higher to resist the rougher sea 7 3 sea trials sea trials of the usv show that when fr 1 33 the tfs can improve the seakeeping of usv in head beam following irregular waves and is extremely beneficial to cut down the roll especially in head sea followed by following and beam sea the optimal draft ratio is 1 0 at this time the higher moulded depth of side hull is suggested when fr 1 78 the roll gain declines but the pitch gains more which verifies the previous cfd analysis on pitch it is preferred that the side hull draft ratio is 0 67 in head beam following sea in which the pitch gains more roll gain merely is a little worse credit authorship contribution statement yumin su project

20509,the form changeable boats have received much attention due to its far ranging applicability strong combat capability and the low operating cost this paper constructs a variable structure boat whose mainhull is planing hull form and twin retractable deep v side hulls are placed on both sides of the mainhull aims at assessing its seakeeping performance in the monomer form state mfs and the trimaran form state tfs by model tests numerical simulation and sea trials regular head wave tests were conducted at volume froude numbers fr ranging from 0 44 to 2 67 for the mfs and tfs models verification and validation of the cfd method were performed the influences of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs model under different wave configurations were analysed sea trials of the full scale vessel usv in irregular sea were also carried out at the design velocities the results show that the tfs has different effects on motion responses and vertical accelerations of the model at different speeds and wavelengths the applicable range of side hulls with gain effect is in the diaplacement and semi planing stage and the maximum velocity is suggested not to exceed fr 2 22 for the usv at fr 1 33 the tfs mainly cut down its roll in irregular head sea followed by following and beam sea when the fr increases to 1 78 the roll gain declines but the pitch gains more the better side

the usv 1 introduction conventional water surface vehicles are relatively single in application mode and operational sea area while the marine environment is often changing and hard to predict thus the demand for a low cost variable structure surface vehicle that can adapt to different sea conditions and combat missions is particularly urgent wang et al 2021 planing hulls are high speed marine vessels that are known as good performers in calm water and due to its deep v prismatic configuration their static stability is generally superior to traditional ships savitsky 1964 1985 wang et al 2020 therefore the mainhull of variable structure boat in this paper was designed as the planing hull form to make it has superior rapidity and static stability however the small vessels are the most vulnerable to the rough sea gene et al 2019 even in the gently sloped wave the larger wave induced motions and vertical accelerations may appear which extremely threaten the survivability of the vessel and the mariners anders et al 2017 in addition considering some special tasks based on the variable structure boat such as arranging ultra short baseline positioning system under medium or higher sea condition applying sonar and fiber optic hydrophone thin line array to monitor underwater environment et al it is necessary for the vessel to have better seakeeping and directional stability when sailing at low or medium speeds thus referring to the design concept of multi hull boats poundra et al 2017 yanuar and waskito 2017 wang et al 2018 ghadimi et al 2019 nazemian and ghadimi 2021 a variable structure boat which can achieve the form state switching between the mfs and tfs by retracting and releasing side hulls is first proposed in this paper on the one hand the vessel in the tfs has higher rapidity by releasing the side hulls to inhibit longitudinal porpoising instability of mainhull planing hull in high speed planing regime wang et al 2021 on the other hand at medium and low speed more longitudinal and transverse damping moments are provided by releasing side hulls thus improving the seakeeping and directional stability of the boat in waves and this paper focus on assessing the seakeeping of the variable structure boat in the mfs and the tfs since the unsteady motions of a vessel in waves were found in ulstein and faltinsen 1996 larger wave induced motion and vertical acceleration at bow were again observed in katayama et al 2000 recent years due to the prosperity of mathematical model and excellence in experimental apparatus it emerged a lot of works on exploring the seakeeping improvement of high performance boats combing 2d t theory and boundary element method bem sun and odd 2010a b performed nonlinear time domain simulations of a prismatic planing boat in incident waves dong et al designed three deep v planing hulls to achieve the wave piercing in rough sea and evaluated their hydrodynamic characteristics wang et al 2014 estimated the motion laws of the vessel sailing in head waves using cfd method ascertained that the effects of irregular jump on response amplitudes are stronger than the regular jump to assess the motion of a planing craft in seaway validation and testing of a computational model were presented in himabindu and morel 2020 besides the steering qualities on the broaching to behaviour of a planing craft in following and stern quartering waves were assessed by the 3d time domain boundary element method in bonci et al 2019 and validated using model tests in regular waves which shows that the modification of turning ability was beneficial to avoid the inception of broaching to inversely caused dynamics control loss moreover wave piercing design of small crafts sailing in adverse sea is a revolution seo et al 2016 assessed the resistance and seakeeping of a wave piercing high speed vessel with spray rails and optimized its installation wei et al 2019 developed four typical wave piercing crafts studied their wave piercing hydrodynamics analysed the advantages of each original hull form in resistance and dynamic effects systematic model tests can prompt engineers to deeply grasp the static water and seakeeping performance of vessels begovic et al 2012 2014 carried out a systematic experimental program of the warped planing hull series assessed the effect of dead rise angle variation along hull length on resistance and seakeeping indicating that the bottom warping can reduce the influence of higher order harmonics and the effect is more evident at bow and higher speeds also the statistical analysis on motion responses and accelerations in irregular head sea was completed in begovic et al 2016 further deluca and pensa 2017 2019 conducted a systematic test on the sekeeping of the naples systematic series nss warped hard chine hulls in irregular head waves which provided valuable data to detect the influence of hull form on the seakeeping also the extended campaigns of the tests cartwright lounguet higgins and probability density function were performed to describe heave pitch motion and vertical accelerations and aimed at the unsteady planing in waves of the c2s hull one of the nss models sasan et al 2020 studied the wave induced dynamic responses and vertical accelerations by model tests cfd and 2d t model judge et al 2020 assessed the test and cfd capability on the slamming of high velocity deep v planing hulls operating in head waves indicated that the emerging slam was due to the hull emerging from next wave peak and being pushed airborne large wave induced motions and vertical accelerations normally restrain the maximum speed of boats but that can be controlled by using external devices such as hydrofoils interceptors trim tabs stern flaps as described in bi et al 2020 park et al 2019 sakaki et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition in the doctoral thesis of jiang 2018 also indicates that the twin side hulls of a high speed trimaran planing craft is beneficial to improve seakeeping but that increases navagation resistance at high speeds thus a newly developed variable structure boat whose mainhull is hard bilge planing hull form and capable of freely retracting and releasing the twin slender deep v side hulls is constructed in this paper in medium or high sea conditions it expands into the tfs to resist the rough sea at lower velocities when on a relatively calm sea it maintains the mfs to advance rapidly but due to the strong interference of nonlinear factors between mainhull and side hull there are few studies concerned with the seakeeping of such a variable structure boat thus its resistance and seakeeping performance in regular and irregular waves were assessed in this research the paper structure is organized as follows section 2 presents the geometric description of the mfs and tfs model and their seakeeping tests results in the displacement and semi planing stage fr 0 44 2 67 section 3 gives a brief introduction of the cfd method and section 4 conducts the verification and validation studies and the influences of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs model under different wave configurations and design speeds fr 1 33 1 78 are analysed in section 5 then sea trials of the usv is carried out to verify the cfd and the optimal side hull draft ratio is obtained in section 6 finally conclusions are provided in section 7 2 towing tank tests 2 1 model design this investigation took a 1 3 scale model of the actual variable structure boat usv no 7 capable of freely retracting and releasing twin side hulls by electric cylinders mounted on outrigger as research object its mfs and tfs are shown in fig 1 and the principal parameters of the boat at each form state are listed in table 1 the variable structure boat is mainly composed of mainhull planing hull twin side hulls and outrigger its mainhull is slender square tailed non stepped has a larger knuckle line width and a plurality of spray deflectors with variant dimensions are symmetrically installed at its hull bottom to improve its seakeeping and resistance performance the twin side hulls are symmetrically arranged at both broadsides of the mainhull by outrigger and electric cylinders slender deep v vertical in bilge provide partial buoyancy and lift to improve directional stability of the mainhull the moulded lines of mainhull and side hull are presented in fig 2 besides to conveniently adjust to the cg location and urge the tfs more easily to start planing the side hulls were placed on both sides of the rear of mainhull as shown in fig 1 b the specific location is listed in table 1 2 2 experimental setup all model tests were conducted in the towing tank 510 m 6 5 m 6 8 m of the high velocity hydrodynamic laboratory of special aircraft research institute of china involving the seakeeping and resistance performance of the mfs and tfs models considering the twin side hulls were not contacted with sea surface in the mfs both were not installed in the tests of mfs model but the mainhull was ballasted to ensure the equal displacement δ and l cg with that of the tfs the model was attached to a carriage 0 1 as shown in fig 3 and two guide robs were fixed in the carriage separately inserted into the guide plates of bow and stern towing points were located at the broadside and aligned with the cg both cable extension displacement sensor 0 01 mm and gyroscope 0 01 were fixed at the cg to measure the motion of heave and pitch three acceleration sensors was separately installed on the cg deck of bow and stern to measure vertical accelerations longitudinal distances of the bow and stern acceleration sensors from the cg were 1 38 m and 0 82 m vertical distance from the cg were 0 127 m the electronic dynamometer 0 02 kg was mounted on carriage pulled tow bar for measuring resistance the accuracy of measuring instruments are presented in the corresponding brackets and the front and rear cameras were fixed on the fore and aft of carriage to capture the experimental phenomena of the model sailing in regular waves for the mfs and tfs models the calm water resistance tests and seakeeping tests were carried out in the displacement and semi planing stage volume froude numbers fr ranged from 0 44 to 2 67 v m 1 6 m s and aimed at the regular head wave tests in the displacement mode six groups of different operational conditions oc were designed and shown in table 2 the δ and l cg of mfs and tfs models were 137 3 kg 0 882 m respectively the wave height ζw was 0 05 m wavelength λ ranged from 1 l m to 4 l m the specific characteristics of regular waves are listed in table 3 2 3 experimental results motion response of the boat in waves is low frequency and narrow frequency band after those time history curves of motion responses vertical accelerations and resistance in regular waves were collected through the data acquisition system the fft fs spectrum thinning technology was used to process the motion response measured by experiment then according to the oscillation curves the peak values y p and trough values y t in same period were measured and the double amplitudes y p y t of heave h m pitch θ m accelerations at bow a b cg a g stern a s the average resistance r m and the added wave resistance r ma in each wave condition as well as calm water resistance r t were obtained those are detaily listed in appendix i above results were further processed into the dimensionless form h m and θ m were transformed into the forms of response amplitude operators raos based on the means of begovic et al 2014 the a b a g and a s were expressed as the a b g a g g and a s g respectively the r m and r ma were treated into r m δ and r ma δ the comparison of test results for mfs and tfs models was shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows the change of heave rao η3 ζ a with increasing wavelength for mfs and tfs models at different velocities when λ l m 1 3 3 5 and 4 at same velocity the heave rao of tfs are less than the mfs especially when λ l m 3 the beneficial effect is more obvious when λ l m 2 5 fr 0 44 and 0 89 the heave rao of tfs still reduces but at fr 0 67 that of tfs get more intense likewise when λ l m 1 5 2 the heave rao of tfs aggravates compared with the mfs the adverse effect is even more serious when λ l m 2 fig 4 b shows the comparisons of mfs and tfs models on pitch rao η5 kζ a at different wavelengths and velocities when λ l m 2 at equal velocity the pitch rao of tfs are obviously less than the mfs and the advantaged effect is more remarkable when λ l m 2 5 3 later with the increase of wavelength the advantage of tfs declines likewise it also exists a decrease on pitch rao of tfs when λ l m 2 fr 0 44 0 89 but when λ l m 1 that of tfs is more intense when λ l m 1 5 the effect on pitch rao of tfs becomes a little confusing summing up the above in displacement mode at longer wavelengths λ l m 2 the tfs can cut down the heave and pitch amplitudes of the model in head waves especially for the pitch rao the gain effect is improved more at shorter wavelength λ l m 1 the tfs is also useful to reduce the heave rao but aggravates the pitch due to the higher encounter frequency between waves and hulls when λ l m 1 5 2 considering the existence of resonance wavelength region the effect on heave and pitch amplitudes of the tfs becomes confusing fig 4 c e shows the comparisons of mfs and tfs on a b a g and a s at different wavelengths and velocities when λ l m 2 at same wavelength the a b a g a s all gradually increase with the increasing velocity the velocity has larger influence on the a b followed by the a g and a s moreover whether the mfs or the tfs with the increase of wavelength the a b a g and a s all sharply increase to a maximum value at λ l m 1 5 or 2 then gradually decrease to a relatively smaller value at λ l m 4 which indicates the resonance wavelength λ r is nearby λ l m 1 5 or 2 and it is worth noting that the λ r seems to move towards a longer wavelength as velocity increasing at resonance wavelengths such as fr 0 44 λ l m 1 5 fr 0 67 λ l m 1 5 fr 0 89 λ l m 2 the a b of tfs reduce compared with the mfs but the a g of tfs appear dramatic increase and the a s of tfs become exceptionally large at fr 0 44 λ l m 1 5 the above show that nearby the λ r the release of side hulls at the rear of mainhull broadsides side hull location of tfs in table 1 can reduce the a b to a certain extent but causes the a g and a s to enlarge the side hull location is sensitive to the acceleration oscillation of the tfs when resonance occurs in addition for longer wavelengths λ l m 2 at fr 0 44 the tfs has little effect on the reduction of the a b a g a s even aggravates at most wavelengths but at fr 0 67 0 89 there exists evident decrease on a b a g a s of tfs at λ l m 2 5 later the gain effect on acceleration amplitudes declines as wavelength increasing that implies at the lower velocity fr 0 44 the side hulls take no effect on weakening the acceleration amplitudes and generate no or less damping but works at the slightly higher velocities in displacement mode fig 4 f shows that the r m of mfs and tfs appear a marked rise with increasing velocity the tfs causes r m to increase at λ l m 1 3 4 moreover the added wave resistance r ma of tfs decreases at fr 0 44 0 67 compared with mfs especially at fr 0 67 the decline is remarkable however for the r ma at λ l m 4 a negative value unexpectedly appears that was mainly caused by measurement errors at fr 0 89 the comparison of r ma for mfs and tfs models at different wavelengths is a bit messy fig 5 shows that the ship travelling wave elevation around the bow of tfs is obviously lower than the mfs the wave elevation around side hulls also appears slight decline that implies the side hulls improve the seakeeping of vessel besides for tfs the wave elevation of stern wake is higher that was caused by the superposition of each other for the stern wakes of side hulls and mainhull fig 6 shows the wave surface around the tfs model at fr 1 78 v m 4 m s and 2 67 v m 6 m s in the velocity range the navigation of mainhull was in the semi planing stage as shown in fig 6 a at fr 1 78 the spray from mainhull mainly concentrated around its forward bilge only a fraction interfered the bow of side hulls but due to the existence of side hull travelling waves there still formed a very high elevation in the upper part of side hull bow deck besides the heave and pitch amplitudes in short wavelength waves were obviously smaller however the oscillation was more frequent due to the higher encounter frequency as velocity increasing in the semi planing stage the spray from mainhull gradually moved backward and became more violent at fr 2 67 as shown in fig 6 b a majority of spray from mainhull midship splashed the bow of side hull and the backward spray formed extremely violent jet between mainhull and side hull which caused the tfs to oscillate more frequently and suffered more resistance including spray resistance interfered its normal navigation thus for side hulls the applicable range with gain effect is in the diaplacement mode and partial velocity range of the semi planing stage the maximum velocity is recommended not to exceed fr 2 22 3 computational fluid dynamics 3 1 governing equations and turbulence model to simulate the viscous flow field around the sailing vessel the governing equations of viscous incompressible fluid were introduced and solved by the simple solver based on the star ccm software as described in patankar and spalding 1992 meanwhile the shear stress transport turbulence sst k ω model was adopted to solve the reynolds stress term despite that the strong adverse pressure gradient led to inaccurate solution of the rans model existed some application limitations in menter 1994 ghasemi et al 2014 the sst k ω turbulence model still can be used to deal with high reynolds number flow problems due to its higher precision on solving the flow field around planing crafts wang et al 2013 3 2 dynamic fluid body interaction dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi module was used to obtain the hull position and sailing attitudes in this research bi et al 2020 the dfbi module includes solving force and moment on hull surface and 6 dof rigid body motion model based on obtained mesh node displacement stress and pressure of the flow field the combined force f and moment m acted on the hull can be obtained by integrating as follows 1 f s τ p i n d s g 2 m s r r g τ p i n d s where τ p i and g are the shear stress pressure and gravity respectively s is the hull surface area r is the displacement of mesh nodes and r g is the displacement of cg then in order to predict ship motions in waves 6 dof rigid body motion model were solved with the combined force and the combined moment on hull surface the equations was given as 3 d b d t ω b f d k d t ω k v b m where b is the momentum of the model ω p q r is the angular velocity f x y z is the combined force k is the momentum moment relative to the cg v u v w is the velocity and m l m n is the combined moment moreover to expediently describe the ship motions two right handed cartesian coordinate systems were adopted including an absolute inertial earth fixed coordinate system and a relative non inertial ship fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 7 positive x y and z pointed to bow port and upward direction respectively in the two coordinate system ship fixed coordinate system moves with the motions of ship and its origin is always fixed at the cg of the ship 3 3 computational domain and boundary conditions to prevent the reflection of waves in the computational domain and obtain a better precision the domain should be no less than five times the hull length bi et al 2019 thus it was designed to a cuboid region with dimensions of 7 5 l m 2 l m 2 6 l m the specific dimensions of detail regions were depicted in fig 8 considering the symmetry of the model and flow field only half domain of the model was established to reduce the simulation duration the boundary conditions of computational domain have far reaching influence on solving the governing equations in this research overset region was embedded in the background region as shown in fig 8 and boundary conditions were set as follows for the background region incoming flow inlet top bottom and side were all set to the velocity inlet the outlet was the pressure outlet the middle longitudinal section was a symmetry plane for the overset region the mid ship section was still a symmetry plane the ambient planes were set to the overset mesh boundaries and the hull body was defined as non slip wall 3 4 wave generating method volume of fluid vof model was used to simulate the incident regular waves this model can not only generate regular waves with different wavelengths and wave heights by defining boundary condition also can control the velocity and pressure parameters of inlet and outlet to simulate the wave and damp to simulate a realistic viscous non linear wave as much as possible the non linear fifth order wave was built in the model and to verify its accuracy second order stokes wave wang et al 2014 was introduced to compare with the numerical nonlinear wave l m ζw 23 λ l m 1 the comparison was shown in fig 9 as can be seen the non linear regular wave generated by the vof model is satisfactory in addition the vof model was primitively designed by hirt and nichols 1981 to track the change of free surface in flow field the most critical treatment is to obtain the function f which is the volume occupancy ratio of the specified fluid in a grid cell when the f values in each grid cell are obtained the motion interface of the liquid gas two phase flow can be tracked 3 5 overset grid method overset grid method involves with region segmentation and grid combination which includes background and overset region as shown in fig 10 the grids of in the two regions were defined as follow the cutting hexahedron grids were used to discretise the background region both cutting hexahedron grids and prismatic layer grids were chosen to fill the overset region due to the complex geometrical details of hull body and to obtain the accurate flow characteristics around the hull the circumambience of hull was refined by smaller hexahedron grids in the local refinement region the grids around the free surface in the two regions need to be set to exceed twenty layers in vertical direction to clearly capture the change of free surface also the boundary layer grids were imposed on the surface of hull body fig 10 b shows the grid combination of overset method which includes two parts 1 divide grid cells in the entire domain into effective cells and invalid cells by hole cutting method only the effective cells participate in solving flow field 2 find contributor cells which means matching contributor cells with corresponding recipient cells contributor cells and receiver cells combine together and form an information exchange region where the hole boundary nodes of background region grids and the extrapolation nodes of overset region grids can mutually exchange grid information through linear interpolation the formation of the hole boundary nodes was due to the removal of the invalid cells in the background region and the extrapolation nodes is formed along the boundary of overset region both are closely coupled and the governing equations were solved simultaneously in the effective cells of the two regions 3 6 wall y and time step set up accurate boundary layer grids set up is vital to solve the stress and pressure of flow field around the hull thus five boundary layers with a grid growth rate of 1 3 were adopted and the wall functions was used to simulate the non slip hull wall the wall non dimensional distance of the first layer grid y was determined as below 4 y y υ 1 2 u 2 0 074 r e l wl 1 5 where y is the realistic height of first layer grid u is the velocity of vessel l wl is waterline length of the vessel υ is the fluid viscosity coefficient re is the reynolds number in addition wang 2005 analysed the influence of y on turbulence problem indicating that the y value near the hull should be restrained between 30 and 300 thus six different y values of 50 100 150 200 250 and 300 were selected and based on medium grid and medium time step δt 0 006s simulations of different y for the mfs model at fr 0 89 were conducted the time histories of calm water resistance for different y are presented in fig 11 that shows when velocities are lower the smaller y is more accurate to simulate the boundary layers inversly the larger y causes the accuracy to decline thus the y 50 is identified as the more suitable choice besides considering the δt depends on flow characteristics in the implicit unsteady simulation su et al 2020 the initial range of δt was obtained as follow 5 δ t 0 005 0 01 l wl u 4 verification and validation evaluation of the numerical results was conducted using asme v 2009 validation procedure the american society of mechanical engineers 2009 which was based on experimental data numerical solution experimental and numerical uncertainties and input parameter uncertainties considering that all the input parameters were determinate thus their uncertainties were assumed to be zero the tests of mfs and tfs models in calm water and regular wave have been carried out to validate the numerical method subsequently verification and validation have been conducted for the two models advancing in calm water and regular head wave at fr 0 89 4 1 verification of cfd code 4 1 1 calm water resistance systematic uncertainty analysis includes grid time step and iterative convergence verification that has been carried out by referring to xing and stern 2010 in the method the convergence ratio r was defined as 6 r s f s m s m s c when 0 r 1 the monotonic convergence is obtained according to richardson extrapolation method the order of accuracy p re can be acquired as 7 p r e ln s m s c s f s m ln r a distance measurement to the asymptotic range was adopted by the ratio p and according to the factor of safety method numerical uncertainty u fs was computed as 8 u f s 2 45 0 85 p s f s m r p r e 1 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 s f s m r p r e 1 p 1 for grid convergence verification three different grids with grid refinement ratio r g 2 were designed whose grid parameters are listed in table 4 based on y 50 and medium time step calculations for resistance of mfs and tfs models in calm water were conducted under the coarse medium and fine grids and the corresponding results s gc s gm and s gf are shown in table 5 for time step convergence verification three time steps with r t 2 were designed separately corresponding to coarse δt 0 0085s medium δt 0 006s and fine δt 0 0042s verification was based on y 50 and medium grid simulated results for resistance of the two models in calm water by coarse medium and fine time steps represented as s tc s tm and s tf were listed in table 6 for iterative convergence verification which was conducted on the medium grid and medium time step and those errors were very small the largest one did not even exceed 1 of the grid and time step errors in tables 5 and 6 thus the iterative errors could be neglected uncertainties of grid and time step verification were summarized in table 7 the convergence ratios r of both grid and time step were in the range of 0 1 which indicated that the monotonic convergence was achieved and the numerical uncertainties u fs could be obtained by using factor of safety method for mfs and tfs models the u fs of grid were 0 90 s f and 0 84 s f and those of time step were 0 38 s f and 0 43 s f respectively the grid uncertainty u g was obviously larger than time step uncertainty u t which showed that the grid errors occupied a dominant position for numerical uncertainty moreover the grid and time step convergence verification was achieved 4 1 2 motions in regular head wave likewise verification of the motion response for mfs and tfs models sailing in the regular head waves l m ζw 46 λ l m 3 at fr 0 89 has been completed using the same method three different grids with r g 2 and three different time steps with r t 2 were used as designed above likewise the monotonic convergence was achieved and the factor of safety method was used to calculate the numerical uncertainties the results of grid and time step convergence verification for the heave and pitch double amplitudes were shown in table 8 and the verification results were shown in table 9 overall good convergence for both grid and time step were achieved subsequently the medium grid and medium time step were selected for the next numerical study 4 2 validation of cfd code in validation process the comparison error e is computed using numerical result s and test data d defined as 9 e d s and the validation uncertainty u v is calculated as 10 u v 2 u d 2 u f s 2 the u fs can be obtained as 11 u f s 2 u g 2 u t 2 u i 2 validation of the numerical results can be conducted by comparing e with u v when e u v the numerical method is considered to be validated under the u v level 4 2 1 calm water resistance the calm water resistance tests have been conducted to validate the numerical method and the experimental details and data were shown in section 2 according to those the results of validation for resistance of the two models can be obtained and shown in table 10 the validation results show e u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level fig 12 shows the comparison of numerical results cfd and experimental data efd for total resistance r t δ of mfs and tfs models when fr 0 44 2 22 as can be seen the cfd results of total resistance agree well with experimental data for all design speeds fig 13 shows the wave pattern generated of tfs model advancing in calm water in the semi diaplacement or semi planing stage the wave pattern is useful to analyze ship resistance and wave making interference between hulls as can be observed in fig 13 originally the wave rising at bow is obvious with the increase of speed the wave at bow gradually moves towards midship at the same time the wave gradually evolves into the spray and jet at the ship s bilge it could be observed that higher wave is formed at the bow of side hull fig 13 c which is caused by the interference effects between wave systems of mainhull and side hull besides with the increase of fr the wave making region behind the stern becomes lankier and the cocktail wake and cavity move far away from the stern 4 2 2 motions in regular head wave seakeeping tests have been conducted in order to validate the simulated heave and pitch table 10 shows the validation results likewise the comparison errors e of both heave and pitch motion are lower than the validation uncertainty u v which indicates that the simulation results are validated under the u v level then those wave conditions l m ζw 46 λ l m 1 4 were further selected to calculate the motions and accelerations of the mfs and tfs models at fr 0 44 using the validated numerical method the comparison of cfd and efd results for raos a b g a g g and r m δ are shown in fig 14 and the specific errors are listed in appendix ⅱ fig 14 shows that the change trends of cfd results for raos a b and a g with increasing wave lengths are consistent with those of efd results in the long and gentle waves λ l m 2 the cfd results of raos agree well with test data for mfs and tfs models but in the short and steep waves λ l m 2 the error of raos becomes larger which are caused by the higher encounter frequency and the resonance further adding to the limitation of its own smaller amplitude for vertical accelerations the larger errors of a b appear in the longer and gentle waves λ l m 3 inversely the larger errors of a g are in the shorter and steep waves λ l m 2 and the difference is more prominent for the tfs model such interesting result implies that in short and steep waves the release of side hulls produces more nonlinear waves such as bow slamming which not only causes the a g of tfs model to become more violent also make the grid generate greater deformation resulting in the inability to capture more details of the flow field for the errors of r m except for the resonance wavelength λ l m 2 of mfs model remaining errors are controlled within 5 which indicates the cfd code can accurately predict the average resistance of the two model in head regular waves 5 result and discussion 5 1 seakeeping comparisons of the mfs and tfs model at higher velocities in this section based on the validated cfd code the sailing in head regular waves of the mfs and tfs models in the semi planing stage were simulated the selected velocities were fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 v m 3 4 5 m s and the characteristics of the operating waves are shown in table 11 fig 15 a b show the comparisons on raos of the mfs and tfs at fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 at longer wave lengths λ l m 2 the heave and pitch raos of tfs are evidently lower than that of the mfs and at same wavelength the gain effect of tfs is better as the velocity increases at shorter wave lengths λ l m 2 for the heave rao of tfs there still exists some adverse matching points such as fr 1 33 λ l m 1 2 fr 1 78 λ l m 2 but almost all the pitch raos of tfs are weaker than the mfs only at the short and steep wavelength λ l m 1 due to the limitation of its own smaller amplitude the gain effect of tfs is not obvious summing up the above the seakeeping of tfs model acquires better promotion at fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 especially at longer wavelengths the benficial effect gains more but the tfs is likely to cause larger heave amplitude at shorter wavelengths because more dynamic lift is acquired by side hulls as velocity increasing adding to the existence of higher ω e but inversely generates more damping to weaken the pitch response fig 15 c shows that the tfs can also better weaken the a b at shorter wavelengths λ l m 1 2 and the higher velocities fr 1 78 2 22 the reduced extent is more prominent due to more damping generated by side hulls for the a g at most wavelengths the a g of tfs are lower than the mfs and the higher velocities bring more gain effect however at fr 1 78 λ l m 3 5 or 4 an adverse phenomenon see fig 15 d appears due to the resonance between hulls and waves fig 15 d shows that the tfs brings more r m compared with mfs and as velocity increases the r m increases more thus to avoid sufferring more sailing resistance in waves the maximum velocity of tfs in semi planing stage is also suggested not to exceed fr 2 22 fig 15 f shows that at fr 1 33 the mfs brings more r ma inversely at fr 2 22 the r ma of tfs is more and far beyond the mfs indicating the tfs generates different effects on the r ma in semi planing stage fig 16 shows the comparison on wave surface of mfs and tfs at the crest when λ l m 1 which proves that the tfs is more conductive to improve the seakeeping at fr 1 33 1 78 2 22 as the velocity increases the pray from mainhull bilge moved backward more spray are splashed to the side hulls on both sides that results in more increase in added wave resistance of the tfs and accords with what was observed in the test 5 2 influence of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs model 5 2 1 draft adjustments of the twin side hulls in general the layout of twin side hulls has a subtle influence on the seakeeping and directional stabilities of the planing craft ghadimi et al 2019 analysed the influences of twin side hulls in longitudinal and horizontal layout on motion characteristics of a bow piercing trimaran in waves that was not considering the draft of side hull moreover aimed at the longitudinal instability wang et al 2021 discussed the influence of longitudinal and vertical side hull locations on inhibiting porpoising further offered the optimal range of side hull location thus the influence of side hull draft on the seakeeping of tfs was analysed in this section based on the a t in table 1 and considering the electric cylinder stroke l m and depth t d five different draft ratios d d t d were designed and presented in fig 17 which separately correspond to cases 1 5 in table 12 the specific side hull locations and corresponding l m were offered and the ratios δ d δ t l cgt ix t iy t v cgt of cases 1 5 were measured by utilizing the creo software 5 2 2 optimal side hull draft design on the seakeeping of tfs model in head waves as the cfd set up in section 4 simulations for cases 1 5 sailing in head waves were conducted the selected velocities and characteristics of operating waves were presented in table 13 then a detailed comparison of the raos a b a g r m for cases 1 5 is shown in fig 18 and the percentage change pc of gain effect relative to the mfs of above results were further listed in table 14 fig 18 and table 14 show that the raos a b g and a g g of cases 2 5 are lower than the mfs which further prove the gain effect of tfs at fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 specifically at fr 0 89 the deeper draft case 5 brings the heave rao and a g more gain effect see table 14 inversely weakens the gain effect of pitch rao even aggravates the a b and suffers more r m that is because the side hulls of case 5 provide more positive torque to mainhull and the damping torque is not enough to reduce the pitch response thus the lesser draft case 2 is suggested to adopt its heave and pitch raos are better and the r m increases less when fr 1 33 as the draft ratio increases the gain effect on raos a b a g all first increase then decrease at d d t d 0 67 that implies the deeper draft case 5 causes gain effect to decrease and it s worth noting that the r m of cases 2 4 are lesser compared with the mfs indicating that the better draft ratio is 0 67 case 4 at fr 1 33 the seakeeping is significantly improved and its r m is also reduced when fr 1 78 the deeper draft case 5 brings the tfs remarkable decline on raos a b and a g inversly causes r m to increase too much that is not conducive to the choice of the propeller in comparison case 3 is preferred as the most suitable draft the seakeeping is evidently improved at the cost of increasing very little resistance fig 19 a shows the wave elevation around case 4 at the crest when fr 1 33 the spray of mainhull is mainly distributed around its fore bilge and most is splashing in the front area of side hull bow which forms a favorable wave for entire vessel meanwhile due to the small submerged volume of side hulls the r m of cases 2 4 decline compared with the mfs however as the fr increases to 1 78 as shown in fig 19 b the spray of mainhull moves backward and the most is splashing on the bow of side hull some even is going over to the side hull deck which causes more volume of side hulls to be submerged in the waves thus leads to an increase in r m 5 3 seakeeping of the tfs model under larger wave height to ascertain the seakeeping of the tfs model under larger wave heights computations for the raos a b a g and r m of cases 1 5 in larger height head waves were performed in this section the selected velocities were still fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 the characteristics of operating waves are shown in table 15 besides considering the influence of larger wave heights to meticulously capture the change of wave surface obtain better accuracy the vertical dimensions of the free surface region was increased the specific grid size and corresponding total grid numbers are shown in table 16 table 17 shows the raos a b a g and r m of cases 1 5 and the corresponding pcs at ζw 0 1 m at fr 0 89 as the side hull draft increases the gain effects on heave rao and a g increase for the pitch rao and a b the better side hull draft is case 2 or 5 but the r m of case 5 is reduced more thus case 5 is selected as the optimal side hull draft when fr 1 33 the pitch rao and a b of case 4 reduce most however for the heave rao and a g the better side hull draft are case 5 and 3 respectively and the pcs of cases 2 5 are similar thus that is difficult to ascertain the optimal side hull draft but considering the better seaworthiness case 4 is suggested due to its smaller pitch rao besides fig 20 shows the wave elvations around mfs and case 4 at crest which proves the superiority of case 4 to improve the seakeeping when fr 1 78 the raos a b a g of case 5 are all superior to other cases but its r m increases more 12 62 in comparison case 3 is considered as the better choice the seakeeping acquires higher promotion and r m also declines slightly table 18 shows the raos a b a g and r m of cases 1 5 at ζw 0 15 m after detailed comparison on the pcs aimed at the seakeeping and resistance case 5 is confirmed as the best side hull draft at fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 fig 21 shows the sailing of mfs and case 5 at crest when fr 1 78 due to the bow lifting of mainhull the twin side hulls are still not submerged by the spray inversely pierce through the waves which leads to a reduction in resistance for the larger height head waves 6 sea trials 6 1 the full scale vessel to verify the gain effect of the twin side hulls on the full scale vessel usv scaling s 3 the usv capable of freely retracting and releasing side hulls by electric cylinders was assembled in dalian port arthur of china its principal parameters are listed in table 19 meanwhile to strengthen the structural strength and stability of the electric push rod a group of sleeves were installed on both sides of the push rod so that they can move synchronously with the push rod as shown in fig 22 a besides when the electric cylinder stroke l s was 0 3 m 0 4 m 0 5 m 0 6 m the side hull draft ratio reached 0 25 0 33 0 67 1 0 in turn separately corresponding to cases 6 9 6 2 sea trials in irregular sea the sea trials of usv were carried out in the sheepshead bay of port arthur as shown in fig 22 b where the wave height and surface water temperature was reported as 1 1 m sea state3 and 18 c respectively the sea trials of usv were conducted in a driverless way and it was instructed by the communication system to sail in the head oblique and following irregular sea along the pre planned rectangular path as depicted in fig 23 a the sea trials of the usv in mfs and tfs cases 6 9 were conducted at the design velocities fr 1 33 1 78 corresponding to v s 5 and 7 knots after the usv completed the rectangular path task the yaw angle velocity roll and pitch were recorded by integrated inertial navigation system as shown in fig 23 b e then according to the change trend of yaw with time step the roll and pitch of the usv in head beam and following sea could be intercepted as depicted in fig 23 adopting the same method to process other sea trial data of cases 6 9 at fr 1 33 and 1 78 the real time roll angle ϕs and pitch angle θs of the usv in head beam and following sea can be obtained and compared as shown in fig 24 then the rms values of ϕs and θs were calculated and compared in fig 25 further the pcs for cases 6 9 relative to mfs were also detaily listed in table 20 fig 25 a and table 20 a show that when fr 1 33 the tfs can reduce the usv s rms of roll and pitch to a certain extent improve the seakeeping of usv in head beam following irregular waves and compared with the pitch the rms of roll is reduced more especially in the head sea the gain effect pc is more significant that is even cut in nearly half 48 37 at d ds t ds 1 followed by the following and beam waves moreover whether in the head beam or following sea the usv s rms of roll and pitch show a downward trend with the increase of side hull draft thus when fr 1 33 the optimal side hull draft ratio is 1 0 both roll and pitch of the usv are obviously improved fig 25 b and table 20 b show that when fr 1 78 in head sea with the increase of draft ratio the side hulls were often completely submerged and came out of waves which aggravated the roll thus the smaller draft ratio d ds t ds 0 25 is more beneficial to the roll s gain inversely as draft ratio increasing the pitch gain increased first and then reduced at d ds t ds 0 67 and compared with fr 1 33 the pitch gain at fr 1 78 is greater in comparsion the draft ratio 0 67 can be chosen in head sea in which the gain of pitch is greatly improved and the roll is not aggravated in beam sea compared with fr 1 33 the roll gain at fr 1 78 declined the pitch gain still increased and that increased as draft ratio increasing however the excessive draft ratio d ds t ds 1 0 did not bring more gains to the pitch inversly it made the roll gain reduce thus in beam sea it is preferred that the side hull draft ratio is also 0 67 in following sea compared with fr 1 33 again the pitch gains more at this time and when side hull draft increases the roll gain reaches the maximum at d ds t ds 0 67 then decreases and pitch gain was not improved too much considering comprehensively 0 67 is still selected as the most suitable side hull draft ratio for the usv sailing in following waves summing up the above when fr 1 33 the better side hull draft ratio is 1 0 in which both roll and pitch in the head beam following sea were cut to the maximum extent it s suggested that the higher moulded depth of side hull should be designed to resist the rougher sea when fr 1 78 the optimal side hull draft ratio is 0 67 in which the pitch gains more in head and beam sea and the roll gain merely is a little worse pc 0 75 7 conclusion in this research a comparative analysis of the seakeeping performance for a variable structure boat in the mfs and tfs were conducted by model tests numerical simulations and sea trials the following conclusions can be drawn 7 1 model tests in the displacement mode at longer wavelengths the tfs can cut down the raos of the vessel in regular head waves and the pitch gains more than the heave but at shorter wavelengths the gain of side hulls is limited the velocity has larger influence on the a b followed by a g and a s and at the resonance wavelengths the tfs can reduce the a b to a certain extent but lead to severe oscillation at cg and stern at fr 0 44 the side hulls take no effect on weakening the vertical accelerations at longer wavelengths but generates positive effect at fr 0 67 0 89 as fr increased from 1 78 to 2 67 the spray from mainhull bow moved towards midship and gradually evolved into the jet at the ship s bilge which caused the tfs to oscillate more frequently interfered its normal navigation thus for side hulls the applicable range with gain effect is in the diaplacement mode and partial velocity range of the semi planing stage the maximum velocity is recommended not to exceed fr 2 22 7 2 cfd method verification and validation of the numerical method are achieved for the calm water resistance and ship motions in regular waves and the results show that at design speeds fr 0 89 1 78 the seakeeping of tfs can acquire better promotion especially at long wavelengths the gain effect of pitch is more remarkable as velocity increasing but at short wavelengths the tfs causes larger heave motion the tfs can weaken the a b and a g at most wavelengths but brings more navigation resistance in waves and added wave resistance the better side hull draft were analysed for the tfs under different wave heights in the long and gentle head waves l m ζw 46 better draft ratios are 0 25 0 67 0 33 corresponding to fr 0 89 1 33 1 78 respectively in the long and steep waves l m ζw 23 those are 1 0 0 67 0 33 in the steeper waves l m ζw 15 better draft ratios are 1 0 for all chosen velocities which indicates that the moulded depth of side hull should be designed higher to resist the rougher sea 7 3 sea trials sea trials of the usv show that when fr 1 33 the tfs can improve the seakeeping of usv in head beam following irregular waves and is extremely beneficial to cut down the roll especially in head sea followed by following and beam sea the optimal draft ratio is 1 0 at this time the higher moulded depth of side hull is suggested when fr 1 78 the roll gain declines but the pitch gains more which verifies the previous cfd analysis on pitch it is preferred that the side hull draft ratio is 0 67 in head beam following sea in which the pitch gains more roll gain merely is a little worse credit authorship contribution statement yumin su project
