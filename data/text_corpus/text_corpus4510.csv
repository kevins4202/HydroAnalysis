22550,flow induced vibration of a square cylinder with rounded corners at a low reynolds number of 200 is investigated numerically simulations are conducted for a mass ratio of 10 a damping ratio of 0 and non dimensional radius r of the rounded corners ranging from 0 square cylinder to 0 5 circular cylinder the principal aim of this study is to find out the effects of the rounded corner on vortex induced vibration and galloping which are typical phenomena of an elastically mounted square cylinder in fluid flow galloping is fully suppressed if r is greater than 0 1 inclusive and greatly mitigated as r 0 03 and 0 05 and still exists with large amplitude if r 0 01 however the rounded corner is found to broaden the viv lock in regime and also increases the maximum response amplitude in the lock in regime the maximum non dimensional amplitude in the lock in regime increases from 0 26 to 0 57 as r increases from 0 to 0 5 rounded corner also affects the beating phenomenon in the viv lock in regime the beating is type a beating when r is small and type b beating when r is large in type a beating the vibration frequency varies around the natural frequency while in type b beating the vibration frequency varies between the vortex shedding frequency and natural frequency in the galloping regime both the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient have dual frequencies a low vibration frequency and a high vortex shedding frequency the dominant frequency of the lift coefficient is the vortex shedding frequency instead of the vibration frequency keywords flow induced

vibration fiv is an important factor that may cause structural failure extensive research has been carried out to understand the fundamental mechanisms and the suppression techniques of fiv most of the research on fiv has been focused on cylindrical structures that are popularly used in engineering such as pipelines in subsea engineering bridge cables heat exchanger tubes the fiv of circular cylinders is commonly called vortex induced vibration viv because it is caused by the vortex shedding flow high amplitude vibration occurs when the structural oscillation frequency and the vortex shedding frequency synchronize govardhan and williamson 2000 synchronization between vibration frequency and the vortex shedding frequency is also called lock in in literature experimental studies of viv of circular cylinders were mainly conducted in the very fundamental case of one degree of freedom 1dof viv in the transverse direction of the flow cross flow direction when studying viv of circular cylinders the velocity of the fluid is non dimensionalized as the reduced velocity which is defined as v r u f n d where u f n and d are the fluid velocity structural natural frequency measured in vacuum and diameter of the cylinder respectively the lock in regime of the reduced velocity for 1dof viv in the cross flow direction of a circular cylinder in the turbulent regime can be divided into three branches initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch khalak and williamson 1997 1999 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 garcia and bernitsas 2018 when the damping ratio is very small the phase difference between the vibration displacement of the cylinder and the lift coefficient jumps from 0 to 180 as the vibration transitions from the upper to lower branch khalak and williamson 1999 gao et al 2018 when reynolds number is small the response of a cylinder only has two branches even at low mass ratios initial and lower branches prasanth and mittal 2008 anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 conducted experiments of viv of a circular at low reynolds numbers between 90 and 150 and their results show only initial and lower branches and that the maximum response amplitude occurs at the lower end of the lower branch which agree with all the later numerical simulations mittal and kumar 1999 prasanth et al 2006 in addition to viv galloping is another format of fiv galloping is driven by the synchronization of the time averaged fluid force over the vortex shedding period with the structural vibration frequency robertson et al 2003 blevins 1990 the frequency of galloping is much lower than the vortex shedding frequency the typical example of galloping is the galloping of a square cylinder in fluid flow the minimum fluid velocity for the occurrence of galloping is dependent on the damping ratio and the shape of the cross section of the cylinder blevins 1990 as a result of galloping the vibration amplitude of a square cylinder in the turbulent flow regime continuously increasing with increasing reduced velocity and does not have an upper boundary zhao et al 2014 nemes et al 2012 when reynolds number is small in the laminar regime the starting reduced velocity of the galloping regime is higher than the upper boundary of the viv regime make the viv and galloping distinctly separated from each other sen and mittal 2011 2015 by using a sinusoidal quasi steady model joly et al 2012 found that galloping of a square cylinder occurs only when the reynolds number exceeds 140 galloping also occurs when a rectangular cylinder is elastically mounted in flow robertson et al 2003 zhao 2015 galloping of a structure in flow mainly occurs when the structure has sharp corners in many engineering applications such as tension leg platforms in offshore engineering rounded corners are generally applied to square cylinders to make the structure more streamlined it is expected that rounded corners can mitigate galloping how effective they are and the mechanisms of galloping mitigation suppression have not been studied in addition the effects of rounded corners on viv also needs to be understood gonçalves et al 2016 conducted an experimental study on the effects of rounded corners on fiv of a square cylinder and found that the rounded corners reduces the vibration in the cross floe direction only when the reduced velocity is greater than 8 they did not discuss the effects of rounded corners on viv in this paper the effects of rounded corner on both viv and galloping of an elastically mounted square cylinder are studied numerically a sketch of the cylinder is shown in fig 1 the cylinder is allowed to vibrate only in the cross flow direction to enable performing numerical simulations at a wide parametric space two dimensional numerical simulations are conducted for fiv of a square cylinder at a low reynolds number of 200 eight rounded corner radiuses in the range between 0 and 0 5 and a wide range of reduced velocities between 1 and 40 2 numerical method fig 1 is a sketch of the computational domain for simulating flow induced vibration of a square cylinder with rounded corners which is only confined in the transverse direction of the flow the boundary length of the square cylinder and the diameter of the rounded corners are d and r respectively a non dimensional rounded corner radius r is defined as r r d a coordinate system is defined with its origin located at the static balanced position of the centre of the cylinder the x and y axes are in the flow direction and the transverse direction of the flow respectively the governing equations for the flow are the incompressible two dimensional navier stokes ns equations the ns equations are solved using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme considering the continuously changed boundary of the computational domain caused by the cylinder motion the length the velocity the time and the pressure are non dimensionalized as x i x i d u i u i u t t u d and p p ρ u 2 where the prime stands for dimensional values x 1 x x 2 y u i is the velocity in the x i th direction t is time p is pressure ρ is the density of the fluid and u is the free stream velocity the non dimensional ns equations in the ale scheme are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u ˆ j u i x j p x i 1 re 2 u i x j x j where u ˆ i is the velocity of the mesh movement re u d ν is the reynolds number and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the non dimensional equation of motion of the cylinder in the cross flow direction is 3 d 2 y d t 2 4 π ζ v r d y d t 4 π 2 v r 2 y c l 2 m α c where y is the displacement of the cylinder in the cross flow direction v r u f n d is the reduced velocity f n is the structural natural frequency measured in vacuum ζ is the damping ratio m is the mass ratio defined as the ratio of the cylinder mass to the displaced fluid mass α c is the sectional area factor defined as α c a c d 2 with a c being the sectional area of the cylinder and c l is the lift coefficient defined as c l f y ρ d u 2 2 where f y is the lift force in the y direction the right side of eq 3 becomes 2 c l π m for a circular cylinder with r d 0 5 singh and mittal 2005 guilmineau and queutey 2004 and c l 2 m for a square cylinder sen and mittal 2011 the length and width of the computational domain shown in fig 1 are 50d and 40d respectively and the inlet boundary is 20d upstream the cylinder the ns equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem proposed by brooks and hughes 1982 the detailed pg fem formulae for solving the ns equations can be found in zhao et al 2007 the computational domain is divided into four node quadrilateral finite elements the finite element number is 91776 for a square cylinder r 0 and 69184 for a circular cylinder r 0 5 the finite element numbers for 0 r 0 5 are between the numbers of the square and circular cylinders fig 2 shows some computational meshes near the cylinder surfaces and a corner of the cylinders the non dimensional mesh size next to the cylinder surface in the normal direction of the boundary is 0 002 after the ns equations and the equation of motion are solved within each computational time step the boundary of the cylinder surface is updated according to the updated displacement of the cylinder since the vibration is a one degree of freedom vibration the mesh nodes are only moved in the y direction and the positions of the finite element nodes are moved accordingly by solving the modified laplace equation 4 γ s y 0 where s y represents the displacement of the nodal points in the y direction and γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation which is set to be γ 1 a with a being the area of a finite element eq 4 is solved by the galerkin finite element method the boundary condition for eq 4 is that s y is the same as the displacement of the cylinder on the cylinder surface and zero on the rest of the boundaries the numerical model used in this study is the same as the one used by the second author previously the previous validation cases of the present numerical model includes flow past a stationary square cylinder at re 100 150 and 200 zhao 2015 flow induced vibration of a square cylinders for laminar and turbulent flows cui et al 2015 zhao 2015 and flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder at re 100 and 150 zhao 2013 zhao and yan 2013 some more comparison between the present results of flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder at m 2 and re 200 and other numerical results is shown in fig 3 the present results of the vibration amplitude for ζ 0 agree well with the results by li et al 2016 the vibration amplitudes by leontini et al 2006 are smaller than the present results mainly because of the difference in the damping ratio prasanth and mittal 2008 reported that when the reynold number is low in the laminar flow regime the lock in regime only have two branches initial branches and lower branch the initial branch starts at a reduced velocity where the vibration amplitude suddenly increases and the vibration frequency starts not following the strouhal law the boundary between initial and lower branches is the v r where the amplitude reaches its maximum the lower branch ends at a reduced velocity where the vibration amplitude suddenly decreases and the vibration frequency starts following the strouhal law the upper branch only occurs in the turbulent flow regime and does not exist at low reynolds numbers the boundary between the initial and lower branches in fig 3 is v r 4 4 in the present results 3 numerical results numerical simulations are conducted for a constant reynolds number of re 200 a constant mass ratio of 10 and a wide range of reduced velocity between 1 and 40 the damping ratio is zero in all simulations to identify the effects of the rounded corners on the vibration nine rounded corners are considered r 0 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 fig 4 shows the variation of the vibration amplitude with the reduced velocity and fig 5 shows the variation of the vibration frequency with the reduced velocity for all the simulated r the non dimensional vibration amplitude is defined as a y y max where y max is the maximum non dimensional vibration displacement the non dimensional vibration frequency f is defined as f f f n where f is the vibration frequency of the cylinder to clearer see the vibration amplitudes in the lock in regimes for different rounded radiuses fig 4 b shows the amplitudes in a smaller range of v r in the lock in regime instead of increasing with increasing reduced velocity the non dimensional vibration frequency f remains almost unchanged and close to unity generally the boundary v r between the initial and lower branches is found to shift towards higher reduced velocity with decreasing r it is v r 4 4 for r 0 5 and increases to v r 5 2 for r 0 in addition the lock in regimes become narrower and the maximum vibration amplitude in the lock in regime decreases as r decreases the maximum vibration amplitude occurs when the cylinder is circular with r 0 5 a narrower lock in regime of a square cylinder than that of a circular cylinder was also reported previously sen and mittal 2011 2015 fig 5 c shows the variation of vibration strouhal number defined as s tv f d u with the reduced velocity in the lock in regimes when the reduced velocity is smaller than the lower boundary of the lock in regime the s tv changes slightly with the increase of v r s tv jumps suddenly at the lower boundary of the lock in regime because the vortex shedding frequency and the natural frequency synchronize s tv decreases with the increase of v r in the lock in regime and remain nearly independent on v r again when v r is greater than the upper boundary of the lock in regime the identified initial and lower branches in the lock in regime for all the rounded corner radiuses are mapped on the r v r plane in fig 6 generally both the initial and lower branches widen with increasing r rounded corner radius affects the boundary v r between initial and lower branches only as r 0 2 as r 0 2 the boundary v r between these two branches remains unchanged however the reduction of the starting v r of the initial branch and the increase of the ending v r or the lower branch makes the lock in range become wide as r increases the galloping phenomenon can be clearly identified through the variation of the vibration amplitude in a wide range of v r shown in fig 4 a it is well known that galloping occurs when a structure has sharp corners robertson et al 2003 galloping and viv regimes can overlap with each other when a noncircular cylindrical structure is placed in a flow with high reynolds numbers in turbulent flow regime chang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 however when the reynolds number is in the laminar flow regime the galloping and viv regimes can be separated from each other sen and mittal 2011 the galloping and viv regimes are distinctly separated from each other in fig 4 a in the turbulent flow regime the galloping starts at much smaller reduced velocity that is in the viv regime making the viv and galloping regimes combine together zhao et al 2014 cui et al 2015 tamimi et al 2017 using proper rounded corners with large enough r is expected to mitigate galloping rounded corners with r 0 01 are not able to supress galloping although it reduces the galloping amplitude slightly compared with r 0 rounded corners with r 0 03 and 0 05 reduces galloping amplitude dramatically and also delays galloping the vibration amplitudes at these two rounded radiuses are only about 0 1 rounded corners with r 1 fully suppress galloping in the reduced velocity range of v r 40 the critical reduced velocity for galloping can also be clearly identified using the vibration frequency shown in fig 5 a the vibration frequency increases with increasing reduced velocity in the non lock in and non galloping regimes at the critical reduced velocity where galloping starts the vibration frequency jumps to a very small value base on the change in the vibration frequency the critical reduced velocities for galloping for r 0 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 are v r 13 14 26 26 respectively these reduced velocities are those where the vibration amplitude starts to increases with increasing v r in fig 4 a unlike that of viv the regime of galloping does not have upper v r boundary once galloping occurs the vibration amplitude increases continuously with the increase of v r vibration of the cylinder is periodic in most of the cases except limited cases fig 7 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement for some selected cases of aperiodic vibrations except fig 7 e where the vibration is periodic the beating phenomenon in fig 7 is characterized by periodically increasing and decreasing vibration amplitude the vibration amplitude a y shown in fig 4 for the aperiodic vibration is the maximum amplitude in the whole beating period as shown illustrated in fig 7 g beating phenomenon was also reported in studies of viv of a circular cylinder at low reynolds numbers but no explanation of beating was given prasanth and mittal 2008 singh and mittal 2005 in fig 7 a the vibration amplitude increases gradually until it suddenly reduces then it gradually increases again in fig 7 f the beating is symmetric i e the times spent on increasing and decreasing vibration amplitude are not very different from each other to see how vibration frequency changes during the vibration a local frequency is defined based on the zero crossing points in the time histories of the displacement a zero crossing point is the time when the vibration displacement crosses the y 0 line from negative to positive values as illustrated in fig 7 g the local period is defined as the duration between two consecutive zero crossing points and the local frequency is the reciprocal of the local period when the vibration amplitude does not change with time see fig 7 e the vibration frequency remains constant when beating happens the vibration frequency is found to changes slightly within each beating period except when the vibration amplitude reaches its minimum in fig 7 a and b the vibration frequency can be greater or smaller than the natural frequency the vibration frequency crosses the natural frequency while the vibration amplitude is increasing and is smaller than the natural frequency before the amplitude reaches its minimum the beating in fig 7 a and b is defined as type a beating the beating in fig 7 c d and f where the vibration frequency varies between the natural frequency and the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder f s is defined as type b beating type a beating has longer period than type b beating in type a beating the vibration amplitude increases with time slowly and suddenly decreases to a very small value in type b beating the beating shows a symmetric pattern i e increasing and decreasing velocity take more or less same amount of time fig 8 maps all the beating cases on the r v r plan it can be seen that a square cylinder without or with a small radius rounded corner only has type a beating while a circular cylinder or a square cylinder with a large radius rounded corner only has type b beating the reduced velocities for type a beating of a square cylinder with very small radius rounded corner is greater than the boundary velocity between the initial and lower branch while type b beating of a circular cylinder is smaller the energy transferring between the fluid and the cylinder for a beating phenomenon is analysed through the phase difference between the vibration displacement and the lift force if an oscillator vibrates sinusoidally with a non dimensional amplitude a y under the action of a non dimensional external force c l the displacement and the force can be expressed as 5 y t a y sin ω t ψ y 6 c l t a cl sin ω t ψ cl where a cl is the amplitude of the force coefficient ω 2π t is the angular frequency t is the vibration period and ψ y and ψ cl are the phase of displacement and force respectively the time averaged non dimensional energy that the cylinder received over one period of vibration is 7 p 1 t o t y t c l t d t 1 2 ω a y a cl sin ψ where ψ ψ cl ψ y is the phase difference between c l and y if the structural damping is zero the phase difference ψ is either 0 or 180 this has been proved in experimental and numerical studies of viv of a circular cylinder at zero or very small damping ratios khalak and williamson 1999 guilmineau and queutey 2004 anagnostopoulos 2000 based on the same method shown in fig 7 g the zero crossing points of the lift coefficient can also be identified and the local phase difference between the lift coefficient and the vibration displacement can be determined by ψ δ t c t 360 where δt c is the time difference between the zero crossing points of c l and y fig 9 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement the lift coefficient the power p and the phase difference ψ for the beating at r 0 and v r 5 2 where v y is the non dimensional velocity of the cylinder from fig 9 a and b it can be seen that the vibration displacement is out of phase with the lift coefficient and the vibration velocity v y has about 90 phase difference from the lift coefficient most of time except when the vibration amplitude experiences sudden changes the vibration amplitude increases gradually before it reaches its maximum because the net energy the cylinder received p is greater than zero as shown in fig 9 c correspondingly the phase difference ψ is found to be slightly smaller than 180 sinψ 0 while the vibration amplitude is increasing between t 500 and 525 the phase difference ψ reduced to nearly zero the change of ψ to nearly negative 90 and the significant increase of the lift coefficient at t 528 causes very quick reduction in the vibration amplitude the negative net p between with large magnitude t 525 and 528 makes the vibration amplitude decrease the recovering of the vibration amplitude after it reaches its minimum is associated with the positive p and the ψ between 0 and 90 after t 537 fig 10 shows the vortex shedding pattern of the beating at r 0 and v r 5 2 presented by the contours of the vorticity the instants numbered by 1 16 of the vortex shedding flows are marked on the time histories of y on the top of fig 10 the vortex flow structures are those at the instants when the cylinder is at its either highest or lowest position the vibration is in the single pair sp regime where only one pair of vortices are shed from the cylinder in one period of vibration the phase difference between the vortex shedding in different vibration periods can be seen in fig 10 in instants 1 and 3 a negative vortex is about to be shed from the cylinder the vortex shedding in instant 4 is clearly delayed compared with that in instants 1 and 3 the delay of the vortex shedding after each period causes the increase in the vortex shedding period at instants 7 8 and 9 the vortices generated from the cylinder become stronger causing significant increase in the lift coefficient however the lift coefficient reduces the vibration amplitude because it is out of phase with the cylinder s velocity the vortex street formed by the vortices generated at theses instants are wider the vortex shedding after instants 11 becomes normal if the rounded corner is not large enough r 0 05 galloping occurs when the reduced velocity exceeds a critical value the maximum vibration displacement a y increases if rounded corner radius reduces as shown in fig 4 fig 11 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient for three representative galloping cases the case of r 0 v r 20 and 35 have galloping amplitudes of about 0 4 and 0 8 respectively the dominant frequency of y is much smaller than that of c l however the low frequency component of c l which is the same as the vibration frequency can be clearly seen in the time history galloping amplitude for r 0 03 and v r 35 is much smaller than that for r 0 and the same v r the decrease in the galloping amplitude makes the high frequency component in the vibration displacement clearer in fig 11 c fig 12 shows the fft fast fourier transform amplitude spectra of the displacement and lift coefficient in the galloping regime each spectrum has one primary peak and one secondary peak the primary peak of y and the secondary peak of c l are the same the secondary peak frequency of the lift coefficient lock in with the vibration frequency and create large amplitude mainly because it is close to the natural frequency as shown in fig 5 a the secondary peak frequency of y and the primary peak frequency of c l are the same as the vortex shedding frequency which does not change with v r the modulation between the vortex shedding frequency and the vibration frequency generates some more peak frequencies with lower energy as shown in the fft spectra fig 13 shows the contours of the vorticity in the galloping regime from the time histories shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the vibration frequency is much lower than the frequency of the lift coefficient which is the same as the vortex shedding frequency based on fig 4 it can be seen that the galloping amplitude increases with the increase of the reduced velocity in the case of r 0 03 and v r 35 see fig 11 c and fig 13 c the low frequency component of the displacement is slightly higher than the high frequency component indicating that where galloping is weak because its frequency is very low the vibration of the cylinder does not make much change on the vortex shedding compared with that of a stationary cylinder however inclined vortex streets are observed in the wake of the cylinder when the galloping amplitude is high for example in fig 13 a where the cylinder is at its lowest position the vortex street is aligned diagonally because the motion of the cylinder from top to the bottom in the previous period makes the effective flow attack angle point upright direction similarly the effective flow attack angle in the downright direction when the cylinders moves upwards makes the vortex shedding aligned in the downright direction in fig 13 b the inclination of the vortex street becomes weak when v r 20 because the galloping amplitude is reduced as r 0 03 and v r 35 the very small vibration amplitude low frequency of the vibration result in a vortex street that are parallel to the incoming flow direction and nearly the same as the on in the wake of a stationary cylinder to examine the flow separation during the vibration in the lock in regime fig 14 shows the streamlines based on the relative velocity and contours of vorticity near the cylinder for r 0 0 2 0 3 and 0 5 at two instants when cylinder is at its lowest position and when the cylinder moves up crossing its mean position the relative velocity in the x i direction is defined as u r i u i u c i where u c i is the vibration velocity of the cylinder in the x i direction it can be seen that the flow separation point changes significantly during the vibration for a square cylinder the separation point is always on the two upstream corner when the square cylinder is at its highest position the separated shear layers reattach to the top and bottom surfaces the reattachment does not occur at the bottom surface of the square cylinder when the cylinder moves up crossing its mean position when the cylinder is at highest position the boundary layer flow nearly attaches to the whole cylinder surface except for r 0 where weak separation occurs at the two upstream corners when the cylinder moves up and cross its mean position the flow patterns from all r are similar to each other which are characterized by two main vortices behind and below the cylinder respectively the separation point for a cylinder with rounded corner is found to be at the connection point between rounded corner and the flat part of a boundary as r 0 03 and 0 05 the flow structure is similar to that of a stationary cylinder because the galloping amplitude is very small to observe the separation points on the cylinder surface for the high amplitude galloping fig 15 shows the streamlines based on the relative velocity and contours of vorticity for r 0 01 and v r 35 at five instants within one period of vibration the mean positions of the cylinder are marked as dash dotted lines and the instants a to e are marked on the diagram of time histories of the velocity and displacement f a rounded radius of r 0 01 is so small that the flow structure is similar to that for r 0 separation is found to only occurs at corners and reattachment occurs occasionally on either side of the cylinder when the cylinder is at its lowest or highest positions fig 15 a and c the separation points are at the two upstream corner reattachment occurs in front of one downstream corner in fig 15 a and after reattachment separation occurs again and generate a small vortex fig 15 b and d are the instants where the velocity is maximum in the positive and negative directions respectively and the cylinder is nearly at its mean position in these two instants flow separation occurs at one upstream corner and one downstream corner resulting two main vortices on the side and behind the cylinder respectively fig 15 e is similar to fig 15 a where the reattachment of the separated shear layer separates again and cause a small vortex near the bottom right corner of the cylinder 4 conclusions flow induced vibration of a square cylinder with rounded corners is investigated for a low reynolds number of 200 a mass ratio of 10 a zero damping ratio and rounded corner radiuses r 0 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the rounded corners fully suppress galloping when the their radius r 0 1 and have little effect on galloping as r 0 01 when r 0 03 and 0 05 the rounded corners effectively mitigate galloping and the galloping amplitude is extremely small 2 however the rounded corners widen the viv lock in regime and also increases the maximum vibration amplitude in the lock in regime which is found to increases with increasing radius of the rounded corners the response of all the cylinders with different rounded corners has two branches initial and lower branch the maximum non dimensional amplitude in the lock in regime increases from 0 26 to 0 57 as r increases from 0 to 0 5 3 beating in the viv regime is a typical phenomenon for all the simulated cases and it is found that the vibration frequency changes with time if beating happens beating is classified into two types type a beating where the vibration frequency varies around the natural frequency and type b beating where the vibration frequency varies between the natural frequency and the vortex shedding frequency type a beating occurs when r is small and type b beating when r is large a square cylinder only has type a beating and a circular cylinder only has type b beating 4 both the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient have dual frequencies when galloping occurs the vibration frequency that is the dominant frequency of the displacement and the vortex shedding frequency that is the dominant frequency of the lift coefficient the vortex shedding mode in the wake of the cylinder is similar to that of a stationary cylinder at galloping however the vortex street is aligned diagonally if the galloping amplitude is large because the relative velocity of the incoming flow is inclined acknowledgement

22550,flow induced vibration of a square cylinder with rounded corners at a low reynolds number of 200 is investigated numerically simulations are conducted for a mass ratio of 10 a damping ratio of 0 and non dimensional radius r of the rounded corners ranging from 0 square cylinder to 0 5 circular cylinder the principal aim of this study is to find out the effects of the rounded corner on vortex induced vibration and galloping which are typical phenomena of an elastically mounted square cylinder in fluid flow galloping is fully suppressed if r is greater than 0 1 inclusive and greatly mitigated as r 0 03 and 0 05 and still exists with large amplitude if r 0 01 however the rounded corner is found to broaden the viv lock in regime and also increases the maximum response amplitude in the lock in regime the maximum non dimensional amplitude in the lock in regime increases from 0 26 to 0 57 as r increases from 0 to 0 5 rounded corner also affects the beating phenomenon in the viv lock in regime the beating is type a beating when r is small and type b beating when r is large in type a beating the vibration frequency varies around the natural frequency while in type b beating the vibration frequency varies between the vortex shedding frequency and natural frequency in the galloping regime both the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient have dual frequencies a low

vibration fiv is an important factor that may cause structural failure extensive research has been carried out to understand the fundamental mechanisms and the suppression techniques of fiv most of the research on fiv has been focused on cylindrical structures that are popularly used in engineering such as pipelines in subsea engineering bridge cables heat exchanger tubes the fiv of circular cylinders is commonly called vortex induced vibration viv because it is caused by the vortex shedding flow high amplitude vibration occurs when the structural oscillation frequency and the vortex shedding frequency synchronize govardhan and williamson 2000 synchronization between vibration frequency and the vortex shedding frequency is also called lock in in literature experimental studies of viv of circular cylinders were mainly conducted in the very fundamental case of one degree of freedom 1dof viv in the transverse direction of the flow cross flow direction when studying viv of circular cylinders the velocity of the fluid is non dimensionalized as the reduced velocity which is defined as v r u f n d where u f n and d are the fluid velocity structural natural frequency measured in vacuum and diameter of the cylinder respectively the lock in regime of the reduced velocity for 1dof viv in the cross flow direction of a circular cylinder in the turbulent regime can be divided into three branches initial branch the upper branch and the lower branch khalak and williamson 1997 1999 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 garcia and bernitsas 2018 when the damping ratio is very small the phase difference between the vibration displacement of the cylinder and the lift coefficient jumps from 0 to 180 as the vibration transitions from the upper to lower branch khalak and williamson 1999 gao et al 2018 when reynolds number is small the response of a cylinder only has two branches even at low mass ratios initial and lower branches prasanth and mittal 2008 anagnostopoulos and bearman 1992 conducted experiments of viv of a circular at low reynolds numbers between 90 and 150 and their results show only initial and lower branches and that the maximum response amplitude occurs at the lower end of the lower branch which agree with all the later numerical simulations mittal and kumar 1999 prasanth et al 2006 in addition to viv galloping is another format of fiv galloping is driven by the synchronization of the time averaged fluid force over the vortex shedding period with the structural vibration frequency robertson et al 2003 blevins 1990 the frequency of galloping is much lower than the vortex shedding frequency the typical example of galloping is the galloping of a square cylinder in fluid flow the minimum fluid velocity for the occurrence of galloping is dependent on the damping ratio and the shape of the cross section of the cylinder blevins 1990 as a result of galloping the vibration amplitude of a square cylinder in the turbulent flow regime continuously increasing with increasing reduced velocity and does not have an upper boundary zhao et al 2014 nemes et al 2012 when reynolds number is small in the laminar regime the starting reduced velocity of the galloping regime is higher than the upper boundary of the viv regime make the viv and galloping distinctly separated from each other sen and mittal 2011 2015 by using a sinusoidal quasi steady model joly et al 2012 found that galloping of a square cylinder occurs only when the reynolds number exceeds 140 galloping also occurs when a rectangular cylinder is elastically mounted in flow robertson et al 2003 zhao 2015 galloping of a structure in flow mainly occurs when the structure has sharp corners in many engineering applications such as tension leg platforms in offshore engineering rounded corners are generally applied to square cylinders to make the structure more streamlined it is expected that rounded corners can mitigate galloping how effective they are and the mechanisms of galloping mitigation suppression have not been studied in addition the effects of rounded corners on viv also needs to be understood gonçalves et al 2016 conducted an experimental study on the effects of rounded corners on fiv of a square cylinder and found that the rounded corners reduces the vibration in the cross floe direction only when the reduced velocity is greater than 8 they did not discuss the effects of rounded corners on viv in this paper the effects of rounded corner on both viv and galloping of an elastically mounted square cylinder are studied numerically a sketch of the cylinder is shown in fig 1 the cylinder is allowed to vibrate only in the cross flow direction to enable performing numerical simulations at a wide parametric space two dimensional numerical simulations are conducted for fiv of a square cylinder at a low reynolds number of 200 eight rounded corner radiuses in the range between 0 and 0 5 and a wide range of reduced velocities between 1 and 40 2 numerical method fig 1 is a sketch of the computational domain for simulating flow induced vibration of a square cylinder with rounded corners which is only confined in the transverse direction of the flow the boundary length of the square cylinder and the diameter of the rounded corners are d and r respectively a non dimensional rounded corner radius r is defined as r r d a coordinate system is defined with its origin located at the static balanced position of the centre of the cylinder the x and y axes are in the flow direction and the transverse direction of the flow respectively the governing equations for the flow are the incompressible two dimensional navier stokes ns equations the ns equations are solved using the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme considering the continuously changed boundary of the computational domain caused by the cylinder motion the length the velocity the time and the pressure are non dimensionalized as x i x i d u i u i u t t u d and p p ρ u 2 where the prime stands for dimensional values x 1 x x 2 y u i is the velocity in the x i th direction t is time p is pressure ρ is the density of the fluid and u is the free stream velocity the non dimensional ns equations in the ale scheme are expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u ˆ j u i x j p x i 1 re 2 u i x j x j where u ˆ i is the velocity of the mesh movement re u d ν is the reynolds number and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the non dimensional equation of motion of the cylinder in the cross flow direction is 3 d 2 y d t 2 4 π ζ v r d y d t 4 π 2 v r 2 y c l 2 m α c where y is the displacement of the cylinder in the cross flow direction v r u f n d is the reduced velocity f n is the structural natural frequency measured in vacuum ζ is the damping ratio m is the mass ratio defined as the ratio of the cylinder mass to the displaced fluid mass α c is the sectional area factor defined as α c a c d 2 with a c being the sectional area of the cylinder and c l is the lift coefficient defined as c l f y ρ d u 2 2 where f y is the lift force in the y direction the right side of eq 3 becomes 2 c l π m for a circular cylinder with r d 0 5 singh and mittal 2005 guilmineau and queutey 2004 and c l 2 m for a square cylinder sen and mittal 2011 the length and width of the computational domain shown in fig 1 are 50d and 40d respectively and the inlet boundary is 20d upstream the cylinder the ns equations are solved by the petrov galerkin finite element method pg fem proposed by brooks and hughes 1982 the detailed pg fem formulae for solving the ns equations can be found in zhao et al 2007 the computational domain is divided into four node quadrilateral finite elements the finite element number is 91776 for a square cylinder r 0 and 69184 for a circular cylinder r 0 5 the finite element numbers for 0 r 0 5 are between the numbers of the square and circular cylinders fig 2 shows some computational meshes near the cylinder surfaces and a corner of the cylinders the non dimensional mesh size next to the cylinder surface in the normal direction of the boundary is 0 002 after the ns equations and the equation of motion are solved within each computational time step the boundary of the cylinder surface is updated according to the updated displacement of the cylinder since the vibration is a one degree of freedom vibration the mesh nodes are only moved in the y direction and the positions of the finite element nodes are moved accordingly by solving the modified laplace equation 4 γ s y 0 where s y represents the displacement of the nodal points in the y direction and γ is a parameter that controls the mesh deformation which is set to be γ 1 a with a being the area of a finite element eq 4 is solved by the galerkin finite element method the boundary condition for eq 4 is that s y is the same as the displacement of the cylinder on the cylinder surface and zero on the rest of the boundaries the numerical model used in this study is the same as the one used by the second author previously the previous validation cases of the present numerical model includes flow past a stationary square cylinder at re 100 150 and 200 zhao 2015 flow induced vibration of a square cylinders for laminar and turbulent flows cui et al 2015 zhao 2015 and flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder at re 100 and 150 zhao 2013 zhao and yan 2013 some more comparison between the present results of flow induced vibration of a circular cylinder at m 2 and re 200 and other numerical results is shown in fig 3 the present results of the vibration amplitude for ζ 0 agree well with the results by li et al 2016 the vibration amplitudes by leontini et al 2006 are smaller than the present results mainly because of the difference in the damping ratio prasanth and mittal 2008 reported that when the reynold number is low in the laminar flow regime the lock in regime only have two branches initial branches and lower branch the initial branch starts at a reduced velocity where the vibration amplitude suddenly increases and the vibration frequency starts not following the strouhal law the boundary between initial and lower branches is the v r where the amplitude reaches its maximum the lower branch ends at a reduced velocity where the vibration amplitude suddenly decreases and the vibration frequency starts following the strouhal law the upper branch only occurs in the turbulent flow regime and does not exist at low reynolds numbers the boundary between the initial and lower branches in fig 3 is v r 4 4 in the present results 3 numerical results numerical simulations are conducted for a constant reynolds number of re 200 a constant mass ratio of 10 and a wide range of reduced velocity between 1 and 40 the damping ratio is zero in all simulations to identify the effects of the rounded corners on the vibration nine rounded corners are considered r 0 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 fig 4 shows the variation of the vibration amplitude with the reduced velocity and fig 5 shows the variation of the vibration frequency with the reduced velocity for all the simulated r the non dimensional vibration amplitude is defined as a y y max where y max is the maximum non dimensional vibration displacement the non dimensional vibration frequency f is defined as f f f n where f is the vibration frequency of the cylinder to clearer see the vibration amplitudes in the lock in regimes for different rounded radiuses fig 4 b shows the amplitudes in a smaller range of v r in the lock in regime instead of increasing with increasing reduced velocity the non dimensional vibration frequency f remains almost unchanged and close to unity generally the boundary v r between the initial and lower branches is found to shift towards higher reduced velocity with decreasing r it is v r 4 4 for r 0 5 and increases to v r 5 2 for r 0 in addition the lock in regimes become narrower and the maximum vibration amplitude in the lock in regime decreases as r decreases the maximum vibration amplitude occurs when the cylinder is circular with r 0 5 a narrower lock in regime of a square cylinder than that of a circular cylinder was also reported previously sen and mittal 2011 2015 fig 5 c shows the variation of vibration strouhal number defined as s tv f d u with the reduced velocity in the lock in regimes when the reduced velocity is smaller than the lower boundary of the lock in regime the s tv changes slightly with the increase of v r s tv jumps suddenly at the lower boundary of the lock in regime because the vortex shedding frequency and the natural frequency synchronize s tv decreases with the increase of v r in the lock in regime and remain nearly independent on v r again when v r is greater than the upper boundary of the lock in regime the identified initial and lower branches in the lock in regime for all the rounded corner radiuses are mapped on the r v r plane in fig 6 generally both the initial and lower branches widen with increasing r rounded corner radius affects the boundary v r between initial and lower branches only as r 0 2 as r 0 2 the boundary v r between these two branches remains unchanged however the reduction of the starting v r of the initial branch and the increase of the ending v r or the lower branch makes the lock in range become wide as r increases the galloping phenomenon can be clearly identified through the variation of the vibration amplitude in a wide range of v r shown in fig 4 a it is well known that galloping occurs when a structure has sharp corners robertson et al 2003 galloping and viv regimes can overlap with each other when a noncircular cylindrical structure is placed in a flow with high reynolds numbers in turbulent flow regime chang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 however when the reynolds number is in the laminar flow regime the galloping and viv regimes can be separated from each other sen and mittal 2011 the galloping and viv regimes are distinctly separated from each other in fig 4 a in the turbulent flow regime the galloping starts at much smaller reduced velocity that is in the viv regime making the viv and galloping regimes combine together zhao et al 2014 cui et al 2015 tamimi et al 2017 using proper rounded corners with large enough r is expected to mitigate galloping rounded corners with r 0 01 are not able to supress galloping although it reduces the galloping amplitude slightly compared with r 0 rounded corners with r 0 03 and 0 05 reduces galloping amplitude dramatically and also delays galloping the vibration amplitudes at these two rounded radiuses are only about 0 1 rounded corners with r 1 fully suppress galloping in the reduced velocity range of v r 40 the critical reduced velocity for galloping can also be clearly identified using the vibration frequency shown in fig 5 a the vibration frequency increases with increasing reduced velocity in the non lock in and non galloping regimes at the critical reduced velocity where galloping starts the vibration frequency jumps to a very small value base on the change in the vibration frequency the critical reduced velocities for galloping for r 0 0 01 0 03 and 0 05 are v r 13 14 26 26 respectively these reduced velocities are those where the vibration amplitude starts to increases with increasing v r in fig 4 a unlike that of viv the regime of galloping does not have upper v r boundary once galloping occurs the vibration amplitude increases continuously with the increase of v r vibration of the cylinder is periodic in most of the cases except limited cases fig 7 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement for some selected cases of aperiodic vibrations except fig 7 e where the vibration is periodic the beating phenomenon in fig 7 is characterized by periodically increasing and decreasing vibration amplitude the vibration amplitude a y shown in fig 4 for the aperiodic vibration is the maximum amplitude in the whole beating period as shown illustrated in fig 7 g beating phenomenon was also reported in studies of viv of a circular cylinder at low reynolds numbers but no explanation of beating was given prasanth and mittal 2008 singh and mittal 2005 in fig 7 a the vibration amplitude increases gradually until it suddenly reduces then it gradually increases again in fig 7 f the beating is symmetric i e the times spent on increasing and decreasing vibration amplitude are not very different from each other to see how vibration frequency changes during the vibration a local frequency is defined based on the zero crossing points in the time histories of the displacement a zero crossing point is the time when the vibration displacement crosses the y 0 line from negative to positive values as illustrated in fig 7 g the local period is defined as the duration between two consecutive zero crossing points and the local frequency is the reciprocal of the local period when the vibration amplitude does not change with time see fig 7 e the vibration frequency remains constant when beating happens the vibration frequency is found to changes slightly within each beating period except when the vibration amplitude reaches its minimum in fig 7 a and b the vibration frequency can be greater or smaller than the natural frequency the vibration frequency crosses the natural frequency while the vibration amplitude is increasing and is smaller than the natural frequency before the amplitude reaches its minimum the beating in fig 7 a and b is defined as type a beating the beating in fig 7 c d and f where the vibration frequency varies between the natural frequency and the vortex shedding frequency of a stationary cylinder f s is defined as type b beating type a beating has longer period than type b beating in type a beating the vibration amplitude increases with time slowly and suddenly decreases to a very small value in type b beating the beating shows a symmetric pattern i e increasing and decreasing velocity take more or less same amount of time fig 8 maps all the beating cases on the r v r plan it can be seen that a square cylinder without or with a small radius rounded corner only has type a beating while a circular cylinder or a square cylinder with a large radius rounded corner only has type b beating the reduced velocities for type a beating of a square cylinder with very small radius rounded corner is greater than the boundary velocity between the initial and lower branch while type b beating of a circular cylinder is smaller the energy transferring between the fluid and the cylinder for a beating phenomenon is analysed through the phase difference between the vibration displacement and the lift force if an oscillator vibrates sinusoidally with a non dimensional amplitude a y under the action of a non dimensional external force c l the displacement and the force can be expressed as 5 y t a y sin ω t ψ y 6 c l t a cl sin ω t ψ cl where a cl is the amplitude of the force coefficient ω 2π t is the angular frequency t is the vibration period and ψ y and ψ cl are the phase of displacement and force respectively the time averaged non dimensional energy that the cylinder received over one period of vibration is 7 p 1 t o t y t c l t d t 1 2 ω a y a cl sin ψ where ψ ψ cl ψ y is the phase difference between c l and y if the structural damping is zero the phase difference ψ is either 0 or 180 this has been proved in experimental and numerical studies of viv of a circular cylinder at zero or very small damping ratios khalak and williamson 1999 guilmineau and queutey 2004 anagnostopoulos 2000 based on the same method shown in fig 7 g the zero crossing points of the lift coefficient can also be identified and the local phase difference between the lift coefficient and the vibration displacement can be determined by ψ δ t c t 360 where δt c is the time difference between the zero crossing points of c l and y fig 9 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement the lift coefficient the power p and the phase difference ψ for the beating at r 0 and v r 5 2 where v y is the non dimensional velocity of the cylinder from fig 9 a and b it can be seen that the vibration displacement is out of phase with the lift coefficient and the vibration velocity v y has about 90 phase difference from the lift coefficient most of time except when the vibration amplitude experiences sudden changes the vibration amplitude increases gradually before it reaches its maximum because the net energy the cylinder received p is greater than zero as shown in fig 9 c correspondingly the phase difference ψ is found to be slightly smaller than 180 sinψ 0 while the vibration amplitude is increasing between t 500 and 525 the phase difference ψ reduced to nearly zero the change of ψ to nearly negative 90 and the significant increase of the lift coefficient at t 528 causes very quick reduction in the vibration amplitude the negative net p between with large magnitude t 525 and 528 makes the vibration amplitude decrease the recovering of the vibration amplitude after it reaches its minimum is associated with the positive p and the ψ between 0 and 90 after t 537 fig 10 shows the vortex shedding pattern of the beating at r 0 and v r 5 2 presented by the contours of the vorticity the instants numbered by 1 16 of the vortex shedding flows are marked on the time histories of y on the top of fig 10 the vortex flow structures are those at the instants when the cylinder is at its either highest or lowest position the vibration is in the single pair sp regime where only one pair of vortices are shed from the cylinder in one period of vibration the phase difference between the vortex shedding in different vibration periods can be seen in fig 10 in instants 1 and 3 a negative vortex is about to be shed from the cylinder the vortex shedding in instant 4 is clearly delayed compared with that in instants 1 and 3 the delay of the vortex shedding after each period causes the increase in the vortex shedding period at instants 7 8 and 9 the vortices generated from the cylinder become stronger causing significant increase in the lift coefficient however the lift coefficient reduces the vibration amplitude because it is out of phase with the cylinder s velocity the vortex street formed by the vortices generated at theses instants are wider the vortex shedding after instants 11 becomes normal if the rounded corner is not large enough r 0 05 galloping occurs when the reduced velocity exceeds a critical value the maximum vibration displacement a y increases if rounded corner radius reduces as shown in fig 4 fig 11 shows the time histories of the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient for three representative galloping cases the case of r 0 v r 20 and 35 have galloping amplitudes of about 0 4 and 0 8 respectively the dominant frequency of y is much smaller than that of c l however the low frequency component of c l which is the same as the vibration frequency can be clearly seen in the time history galloping amplitude for r 0 03 and v r 35 is much smaller than that for r 0 and the same v r the decrease in the galloping amplitude makes the high frequency component in the vibration displacement clearer in fig 11 c fig 12 shows the fft fast fourier transform amplitude spectra of the displacement and lift coefficient in the galloping regime each spectrum has one primary peak and one secondary peak the primary peak of y and the secondary peak of c l are the same the secondary peak frequency of the lift coefficient lock in with the vibration frequency and create large amplitude mainly because it is close to the natural frequency as shown in fig 5 a the secondary peak frequency of y and the primary peak frequency of c l are the same as the vortex shedding frequency which does not change with v r the modulation between the vortex shedding frequency and the vibration frequency generates some more peak frequencies with lower energy as shown in the fft spectra fig 13 shows the contours of the vorticity in the galloping regime from the time histories shown in fig 11 it can be seen that the vibration frequency is much lower than the frequency of the lift coefficient which is the same as the vortex shedding frequency based on fig 4 it can be seen that the galloping amplitude increases with the increase of the reduced velocity in the case of r 0 03 and v r 35 see fig 11 c and fig 13 c the low frequency component of the displacement is slightly higher than the high frequency component indicating that where galloping is weak because its frequency is very low the vibration of the cylinder does not make much change on the vortex shedding compared with that of a stationary cylinder however inclined vortex streets are observed in the wake of the cylinder when the galloping amplitude is high for example in fig 13 a where the cylinder is at its lowest position the vortex street is aligned diagonally because the motion of the cylinder from top to the bottom in the previous period makes the effective flow attack angle point upright direction similarly the effective flow attack angle in the downright direction when the cylinders moves upwards makes the vortex shedding aligned in the downright direction in fig 13 b the inclination of the vortex street becomes weak when v r 20 because the galloping amplitude is reduced as r 0 03 and v r 35 the very small vibration amplitude low frequency of the vibration result in a vortex street that are parallel to the incoming flow direction and nearly the same as the on in the wake of a stationary cylinder to examine the flow separation during the vibration in the lock in regime fig 14 shows the streamlines based on the relative velocity and contours of vorticity near the cylinder for r 0 0 2 0 3 and 0 5 at two instants when cylinder is at its lowest position and when the cylinder moves up crossing its mean position the relative velocity in the x i direction is defined as u r i u i u c i where u c i is the vibration velocity of the cylinder in the x i direction it can be seen that the flow separation point changes significantly during the vibration for a square cylinder the separation point is always on the two upstream corner when the square cylinder is at its highest position the separated shear layers reattach to the top and bottom surfaces the reattachment does not occur at the bottom surface of the square cylinder when the cylinder moves up crossing its mean position when the cylinder is at highest position the boundary layer flow nearly attaches to the whole cylinder surface except for r 0 where weak separation occurs at the two upstream corners when the cylinder moves up and cross its mean position the flow patterns from all r are similar to each other which are characterized by two main vortices behind and below the cylinder respectively the separation point for a cylinder with rounded corner is found to be at the connection point between rounded corner and the flat part of a boundary as r 0 03 and 0 05 the flow structure is similar to that of a stationary cylinder because the galloping amplitude is very small to observe the separation points on the cylinder surface for the high amplitude galloping fig 15 shows the streamlines based on the relative velocity and contours of vorticity for r 0 01 and v r 35 at five instants within one period of vibration the mean positions of the cylinder are marked as dash dotted lines and the instants a to e are marked on the diagram of time histories of the velocity and displacement f a rounded radius of r 0 01 is so small that the flow structure is similar to that for r 0 separation is found to only occurs at corners and reattachment occurs occasionally on either side of the cylinder when the cylinder is at its lowest or highest positions fig 15 a and c the separation points are at the two upstream corner reattachment occurs in front of one downstream corner in fig 15 a and after reattachment separation occurs again and generate a small vortex fig 15 b and d are the instants where the velocity is maximum in the positive and negative directions respectively and the cylinder is nearly at its mean position in these two instants flow separation occurs at one upstream corner and one downstream corner resulting two main vortices on the side and behind the cylinder respectively fig 15 e is similar to fig 15 a where the reattachment of the separated shear layer separates again and cause a small vortex near the bottom right corner of the cylinder 4 conclusions flow induced vibration of a square cylinder with rounded corners is investigated for a low reynolds number of 200 a mass ratio of 10 a zero damping ratio and rounded corner radiuses r 0 0 01 0 03 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the rounded corners fully suppress galloping when the their radius r 0 1 and have little effect on galloping as r 0 01 when r 0 03 and 0 05 the rounded corners effectively mitigate galloping and the galloping amplitude is extremely small 2 however the rounded corners widen the viv lock in regime and also increases the maximum vibration amplitude in the lock in regime which is found to increases with increasing radius of the rounded corners the response of all the cylinders with different rounded corners has two branches initial and lower branch the maximum non dimensional amplitude in the lock in regime increases from 0 26 to 0 57 as r increases from 0 to 0 5 3 beating in the viv regime is a typical phenomenon for all the simulated cases and it is found that the vibration frequency changes with time if beating happens beating is classified into two types type a beating where the vibration frequency varies around the natural frequency and type b beating where the vibration frequency varies between the natural frequency and the vortex shedding frequency type a beating occurs when r is small and type b beating when r is large a square cylinder only has type a beating and a circular cylinder only has type b beating 4 both the vibration displacement and the lift coefficient have dual frequencies when galloping occurs the vibration frequency that is the dominant frequency of the displacement and the vortex shedding frequency that is the dominant frequency of the lift coefficient the vortex shedding mode in the wake of the cylinder is similar to that of a stationary cylinder at galloping however the vortex street is aligned diagonally if the galloping amplitude is large because the relative velocity of the incoming flow is inclined acknowledgement

22551,an offshore integrated meteorological mast oimm featured by integrating the offshore transportation of the foundation and steel mast into one operation is proposed the most critical technique of the oimm is a self floating towing operation with a reasonable subdivision inside the floating tank to find out the towing dynamic behaviors of the oimm with different drafts mooring positions towing velocities and towrope lengths in various sea conditions the hydrodynamic analyses were carried out by using moses the oimm model in prototype scale was established in moses to simulate the static stability and dynamic responses induced by coupled wave and wind conditions a small tugboat and a single towrope are employed for this towing system the results show that the oimm has sufficient intact stability and acceptable damage stability for its inner subdivision configuration the towrope length exerts the most impact on fluctuation response than draft and mooring positions draft depths and mooring positions impact more on pitch motion than on heave motion the normalized maximum values of motion responses are equally influenced by draft and mooring position coupled effects of sea states and towing speed on dynamic features are also illustrated keywords offshore integrated meteorological mast oimm hydrodynamic response towing stability dynamic response offshore wind 1 introduction in the early stages of wind farm development meteorological masts are employed to provide meteorological data for assessments of the wind resource and energy production of offshore wind farms dnv gl 2014 offshore meteorological masts are usually required to be installed on a fixed or a floating foundation it can be expensive to install such a structure on a foundation or platform and maintain the safety of instruments in an offshore location a meteorological mast with a height of 90 120 m is a temporary structure usually constructed of lightweight steel that remains in service for approximately 1 2 years some up to 5 years for example a twisted jacket foundation was first used for the meteorological mast to collect high quality wind data up to 103 m above the sea in the hornsea project conducted in the uk subsea world news 2011 laizhou bay s 100 m high tower snptc 2012 used a large diameter single pile as an ice resistant foundation for the first time in china in addition two innovative suction installed foundations were first installed on dogger bank offshorewind biz 2013 the foundations supported 93 m high meteorological lattice masts that monitored the wave and wind conditions at the site later two meteorological masts with tripod suction bucket foundations were constructed on the west coast of korea kwag et al 2014 with a water depth of 30 m these novel foundation designs aimed to significantly reduce foundation capital expense costs see fig 1 subsea world news 2011 snptc 2012 offshorewind biz 2013 tianjin university and dao da heavy industry company ddhi developed an offshore meteorological mast with an innovative foundation as an integrated structure oimm that reduces costs by increasing the speed of the transportation and installation process and minimizing the required amount of marine operation equipment ding et al 2014 2019 zhang et al 2018 the integrated installation and floating technique one step installation which has been successfully employed in the large scale composite bucket foundation ding et al 2013 2015 zhang et al 2013 is referenced and adopted for the installation of oimm there have been six engineering project cases using innovative techniques in the offshore wind farms of china regardless of how efficient the installation is it is inevitable to spend a major proportion of time on assembling the steel mast with foundation on site that magnifies the benefits for constructing the floating foundation with the steel mast into one integrated structure before installation shown in fig 2 compared with other resembling structures this oimm can be constructed and integrated onshore with high quality wet towed to the installation site with a small tugboat submerged into water and finally installed into seabed by an air water displacement self sinking method shown in fig 3 the installation concept described in this paper meets the requirement to perform a wet towing operation and the feasibility of this integrated transportation can be investigated based on the numerical simulation method by which the hydrodynamic responses of the oimm can be obtained towing operations are the most common marine operations and are usually defined as the transport of a self floating object by one or several towing tugs berg 2017 jacobsen 2010 studied the basic dynamics of the assembled system of a subsea template that needed to be towed and calculated the dynamic forces and displacements by using time integration in simo the dry transport of a tlp by a heavy lift transport vessel was investigated by zhang et al 2012 to demonstrate its feasibility for transport and the transport vessel behavior and tlp structure were evaluated in sweden the wet towing of a substructure to a fwtu was performed with special equipment and vessels eriksson and kullander 2013 a series of wet tow operations was studied based on a nuclear plant and offshore wind turbines and some filed experiments were conducted these mainly focused on towing stability features and important influence factors jurewicz 2015 the towing motion responses of a jack up unit kang et al 2016 and a multi cylinder fpso zhao et al 2016 were analyzed under different towing conditions to estimate the extreme motion and the towing stability kim et al 2017a 2017b compared the cost estimation between dry towing and wet towing for a semisubmersible platform and suggested that wet towing was more cost saving for their project to determine the right time when the average towing tension and the estimated time of arrival were low a wet tow method was applied and some field experiments were performed on the wet towing of an integrated transportation vessel with two bucket foundations for offshore wind turbines zhang et al 2015 to determine the motion behaviors of this special vessel some numerical simulations by sesam have been conducted on towing performance of multi cylinder fpso for offshore marginal field zhao et al 2016 and on a dynamics of a floating wind turbine in wet tow by using a multibody dynamic model ding et al 2017 the latter is to study the stability of the floating wind turbine and the towline force while considerable research has been conducted on the simulation of offshore wind structures few numerical studies have been performed on transportation of such light high rise met mast structure in a wet tow process in this study the static stability coupled wave and wind induced dynamic and motion response analyses are carried out based on a proposed innovative oimm which can be self floating in a wet tow operation hydrodynamic analyses were carried out using moses to find out the behaviors of oimm with different operation conditions in operational and harsh sea states the towing system is composed by a small tugboat and a single towrope which is economic in terms of the costs 2 oimm model and towing system 2 1 oimm model fig 4 a shows the components of the innovative offshore meteorological mast which integrates a truss tower a floating tank and three triangular caissons as one unit for towing transportation and onsite installation during transportation see fig 4 b the floating tank provides enough towing stability for the integrated structure then three triangular caissons penetrate the seabed after the floating tank is pumped with water or other ballast materials the ballasted tank and three triangular caissons work together as a supporting foundation to provide bearing capacity during its service time the typical height of the tower above sea level is 90 110 m and the side length of the floating tank is 25 40 m the height of the floating tank is around 2 4 m and the height and side length of the triangular suction caissons are 2 4 m and 5 6 m respectively the optional installation water depth is no more than 15 m the parameters of the floating tank of the oimm used in this analysis are listed in table 1 the height and the side length can be referred to fig 4 a the net cross area is cross sectional area in horizontal level resembling to the water plane when the oimm being in a directly vertical floating state the available buoyancy in this table refers to the maximum upward floating force provided by the floating tank the initial draft is 0 85 m which can provide the buoyancy to balance the self weight during the wet towing transportation the floating stability can be adjusted by reasonably decreasing the height of the center of gravity this is achieved by filling ballast in the compartments of this floating tank to investigate the hydrodynamic motion of the oimm during wet towing in terms of practical application several draft conditions and sea environments are given these are listed in table 2 and table 3 2 2 towing system the towing system is simulated by moses and its commands are used for both system modeling and simulations the modeling process is finished in the local coordinate system for each body while the towing operation is performed in the global coordinate system see fig 5 three hydrodynamic theories are employed by strip theory three dimensional diffraction theory and morison s equation the morison s equation is used for a beam element in the mode and the viscous drag will be computed the feasibility of using moses 3d diffraction code as a hydrodynamic analysis tool was proven by carrying out a series of comparisons between moses and wave analysis at massachusetts institute of technology wamit for a wide range of wave periods and wave heading angles wamit is a three dimensional panel based program for computing wave loads and motions of offshore structures moses 2009 there are three components in this towing system the oimm model a single towrope and a tugboat the oimm model was set up in the prototype dimensions see table 1 and since the tugboat in this analysis was primarily used to provide the drag force it was modeled in general dimensions that had a longitude length of 30 m as for the towrope three parameters are important the material property the length and the diameter given that the entire weight of this oimm is relatively light compared with general offshore floating platforms or wind turbines the towing resistance is relatively small at around several tens tons for extreme sea conditions therefore the towrope material adopted here is a steel wire line with a diameter of 50 mm the steel wire line modeled by a type of sling element in moses is rigid in tension with a length defined by the distance between two mooring points in moses the forward speed of this towing system can be achieved by modeling a drag force on the tugboat in addition the environmental loads are important for towing system simulations three types of sea loads wind current and wave will be used in the time domain simulations four grades of load conditions are defined based on the local sea environment as shown in table 3 the wind load is defined by the mean wind velocity in knots and by the wind direction from which the wind blows to model a wave a sea of significant height and period at a specified angle are the basic parameters for defining an irregular wave condition the current load defined in this system has the same propagation direction as the wave load dose 3 numerical method 3 1 hydrodynamic model and time domain process waves wind and current are principal factors that cause floating structure disturbances during wet towing operations therefore the most critical numerical problem for an oimm is its dynamic response in a complex environment the motion of the oimm in a random sea state is characterized by response operators the numerical simulation aims to supplement important information for practical application for instance the design of offshore foundation structures and motion control systems the motion history of an oimm in six degrees of freedom can be expressed in a reference system the origin of which is chosen in the water plane three dimensional potential theory was adopted to determine the hydrodynamic forces of the oimm let m be the mass and the added mass matrices of the oimm the tugboat and the towline let d be the damping matrices and k be the stiffness matrices q e represents the environmental sea loads and the drag force the relevant equations of motion in the horizontal plane is a function of time as follows moses reference manual 1 m x x d x x k x x q e x x x t where x x x are the motion displacement velocity and acceleration matrices respectively the time domain processes are a set of configurations that satisfy the basic motion equation in moses the newmark method is adopted to work this process suppose that the solution of function 1 at time t 1 is known and the solution at t 2 can be written as 2 x t 2 x t 1 α 3 x t 2 x t 1 δ x t 1 γ δ α 4 x t 2 x t 1 δ x t 1 1 2 δ 2 x t 1 β δ 2 α where δ t 2 t 1 and α γ β are constant eliminating α from function 4 gives 5 x t 2 a x

motion are differential equations converted into a sequence of algebraic equations and solved by a newton method the newmark method was applied in this process which involved in two importance parameters γ β if γ 0 5 β 0 25 the newmark method is unconditionally stable that is the rate of change of acceleration within a time step is constant note that the time step interval should be short enough to obtain a stable solution which is usually taken as t 10 where t is the shortest natural period of the structural system gavin 2001 moses 2009 the wave spectrum employed in this paper is issc wave this spectrum can be represented by the equation moses 2009 s f α 172 8 h s 2 z exp 1948 184 z p f where f is the frequency in rad sec z 1 f t p 4 p γ exp β 1 2 2 σ 2 β t p f 2 π α is a parameter computed to make the total area under the spectrum equal to h s 2 16 σ is 0 07 for frequencies less than the peak and 0 09 for those greater than the peak 3 2 intact and damage stability analysis the metacentric height gm is a measurement of the initial static stability of a floating body it is calculated as the distance between the center of gravity of a floating body and its metacenter a larger metacentric height implies better initial stability against overturning moments the metacentric height also implicates the natural period of the rolling mode of a hull and a very large metacentric height is associated with shorter periods of roll which have an adverse effect on meteorological devices such as cup anemometers hence a sufficient but not excessive metacentric height is considered ideal for anemometer masts equipped with expensive wind assessment devices gm is calculated as follows 11 g m ρ z g z b 12 ρ i v where ρ is the metacentric radius v is the displacement volume corresponding to the self weight of the structure i is the moment of inertia from the waterplane of the floating tank to the axis gm is the metacentric height z g is the center of mass and z b is the center of buoyancy these equations will be used to compute the stability related parameters in table 5 listed in the column of the theoretical results stability criterion numeral k is an important basic requirement of the floating stability k is calculated as the ratio of the corresponding area under the righting arm and heeling arm within the second intersection angle of these two curves imo 2009 when k 1 4 the heeling moment is 40 less than the minimum righting moment which is necessary for keeping the floating structure from capsizing therefore it is believed that the structure has adequate intact stability the oimm is different from a general offshore floater since the draft of the structure is less than 2 m to prevent the anemometer tower from overturning during a wet towing operation the floating tank should sustain the stability once some areas of the tank have unexpected damage therefore it is necessary to set compartments inside the floating tank to solve this problem there are two schemes of subdivisions for the floating tank one is divided into three compartments and the other is divided into nine compartments as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b respectively 3 3 convergence analyses of mesh and simulation period for numerical simulation with potential theory the panel model is used and mesh density sensitivity analysis should be conducted to achieve sufficient precision and optimum efficiency the mesh dimension is supposed to be smaller than the minimum dimensional feature of the target structure given that the minimal dimension of the floating tank is 2 m mesh lengths of 0 8 m 1 0 m 1 2 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m are adopted and compared in terms of viscous drag force and motion responses except for the mesh size the rest of the parameters maintain constant note that for panel model moses has provided verified examples with mesh features shown in fig 6 which can be a benchmark table 4 listed the detailed information of different mesh lengths and statistics of motion responses fig 7 shows the mesh induced percentage differences of parameters in table 4 as shown in fig 7 the time domain statistics of hydrodynamic parameters under different mesh density barely change within 1 0 m and 1 4 m however a clear change can be seen for more intensive mesh or sparser mesh generally a relative reasonable mesh length is suggested to be 1 3 1 4 of the dimension features as shown in fig 7 tlp and semi submersible given that the mesh size we applied in following analyses is 1 2 m 4 numerical results 4 1 stability analysis results table 5 lists the related parameters of the intact stability of an oimm computed by two methods the theoretical method section 3 2 and the default calculation by the moses model see in fig 8 from table 5 the maximum difference of the static stability parameters by the two methods is shown in draft i around 5 6 in that the aircushion effect is not considered in theoretical method and it eliminates the static stability for other draft conditions the results are quite close which verifies the feasibility and accuracy of the moses model fig 9 a and b illustrate the intact stability checking results for two draft conditions considering a wind velocity of 100 knots it is obvious that the stability righting arm increases as the rolling angle grows to a limit angle which is approximately 5 10 for draft conditions ii and iv see table 2 respectively when the rolling angle is larger there is a clear drop in the righting arm curve due to the downward position of the center of mass while the curve of the area ratio is much more stable it is considered to have enough intact stability if gm 0 15 and k 1 4 according to the criteria imo 2009 thus from fig 9 it is reasonable to believe that the oimm has sufficient intact stability and that increasing the draft may lead to a decrease in this feature the results of the damage stability are listed in table 6 considering various combinations of damaged compartments three draft conditions are chosen from 0 85 m to 1 5 m according to table 6 for the three compartment scheme any compartment damage will result in the failure of the stability however for the nine compartment scheme by comparison partial damage of the tank will lead to a decrease in the stability especially when damage occurs in a single large rectangular compartment such as a2 a3 b2 b3 c2 c3 or multi compartments a1 a2 a2 b2 a1 b1 c1 when the draft goes deeper the stability of the oimm will be more sensitive to the damage to the compartments for instance in table 6 the a2 damage a2 b2 damage and a1 b1 c1 damage conditions will deprive the safety of the oimm under draft condition iv while the damaged condition of a1 a2 fails to pass the stability requirements for all generally under the same draft the best stability of the oimm exists in the no damage condition intact condition for the same damage condition draft condition ii has better stability with a larger area ratio number k the multi compartment design scheme of the oimm is critical for stability safety during transportation from a practical viewpoint finally the frequency domain analyses were conducted for oimm table 7 illustrates the natural periods with different draft conditions at two incident wave directions see fig 6 a the frequency domain analysis of rao in moses is shown in fig 10 generally the first order wave frequency is around 0 3 0 75 rad s 8 s 21 s therefore the natural periods of heave motion is away from the range of wave frequencies 4 2 dynamic response results as previously mentioned the hydrodynamic responses of a large floater with a steel meteorological mast depend not only on the sea load conditions and drafts but also on the towing system including the mooring position the towing speed and the towrope length therefore the following results are based on these factors random sea conditions are used and the heading wave is described by an issc spectrum with a significant wave height in meters and corresponding period in seconds the significant height and period of this issc wave spectrum is from table 3 for a time domain analyses we compared three groups of time duration 3 h 1 h and 1000s in respect to their statistical values because the recommended 3 h simulation dnv 2011 barltrop and adams 2013 is time consuming for a preliminarily qualitative analysis the comparison shows that the std standard deviation of motion responses around 0 3 2 5 barely changes under different simulation time and the mean values are also stable around 2 6 5 8 given that the time consumption is much reduced and the operational factors induced variations are the center of attention the 1000s duration was adopted in this paper it has to be mentioned that a compromise was made for the undervalued maximums around 10 fig 11 shows a typical time series of the motion response under a 3 h towing simulation the comparison is shown in table 8 4 2 1 draft the floating tank is relatively short in height and its water plane area and wet surface may vary significantly when the pitch and heave motions are huge to obtain an optimal dynamic stability four different draft conditions are chosen see in table 2 and compared in terms of pitch and heave modes responses as well as the induced speed it has to be mentioned that the draft depth of 0 5 m is lower than the draft depth for balancing the self weight therefore the additional buoyancy is achieved by air cushion inside the shirt plates which eliminates the stability as illustrated in section 4 1 the draft depth of 2 m will lead to a capsize of oimm the dynamic responses analyses resulted from draft depth are conducted considering a mooring position of 2 m towrope length of 100 m towing speed of 3 m s and sea condition of grade iv table 9 listed the statistics of dynamic responses under different draft depths fig 12 shows a time series of pitch angle with lower envelope curves at first 200 s to illustrate the details fig 13 compares normalized maximum of responses for heave roll pitch motions and induced speed karimirad and moan 2011 as fig 12 shown the time history curves fluctuate significantly for different draft conditions a reduction can be observed when a deeper draft of 1 5 m is reached the most significant fluctuation of pitch motion is caused by the lowest draft condition 0 5 m this may because the small submerged area can only conduct to a small righting force while fig 13 suggests that larger area of wet surface may not contribute to a moderate motion response especially in heave mode which shows a clear increase from the draft depth of 0 85 m 1 0 m after which this normalized maximum responses show a decrease at draft of 1 5 m compared with motion responses in heave pitch and roll mode towing speed shows the minimum impact by draft conditions even though the draft related features in these three modes are different the optimum draft depth can still be suggested as 1 5 m it is reasonable to conclude that dynamic motion responses can be tuned by appropriately increasing the draft of the oimm 4 2 2 mooring position vs towing speed to determine the effect of mooring positions and towing speed on dynamic performance of the oimm five mooring positions fig 14 and three towing speeds are chosen and compared in terms of pitch and heave motions notice that different towing speed was achieved by setting different towing force the towing force is constant when the mooring position varies these comparisons are conducted based on a draft condition of 0 85 m towrope length of 100 m and sea state of grade iv figs 15 and 16 are typical time series of pitch and heave responses under three towing speeds with a mooring position of 2 0 m the lower envelope curves are drawn for the first 200 s period for detailed comparison table 10 lists the basic statistics of dynamic responses resulting from different mooring positions in heave and pitch modes for a induced speed of 1 m s the max and std values of pitch and heave under three speeds are demonstrated in fig 17 and normalized maximum of responses are shown in fig 18 from figs 15 and 16 dynamic responses in pitch and heave modes fluctuate dramatically and differences resulting from towing speed are quite clear the max value shows a reduction as the mooring position becomes higher in both pitch and heave modes as shown in fig 17 while the std values barely change as the mooring position for pitch motion mooring position seems has larger impact on max value when the towing speed is higher which however is opposite in heave motion the maximum and std values in both pitch and heave modes are smaller when the towing speed is high fig 18 compares the normalized maximum of responses of pitch heave and induced speed at different mooring positions it suggests that mooring position exerts much lower impact on induced speed than it does on heave motions and then on pitch motion the normalized maximum in heave mode response exhibits limited impact by towing speeds however the normalized pitch motion shows that higher towing speed leads to higher fluctuations overall it can be concluded that for oimm moderate dynamic response amplitudes can be achieved with a higher mooring position and faster towing speed in that the induced speed fluctuates the weakest 4 2 3 towrope length vs sea state in this towing system the towrope length is required to be long enough to guard oimm from crashing into tugboat but will not mount dynamic responses given that the weight and dimensional features of oimm are relatively small the towrope length adopted here is relative short 100 m 150 m 200 m with a given draft of 0 85 m mooring position of 2 m and towing speed of 3 m s dynamic responses are analyzed in fig 19 time series of dynamic motion responses in pitch and heave modes are depicts the lower envelop curves are drawn which shows a clear variation of the amplitude fig 20 shows the std and maximum values of pitch and roll motions under different sea states and towrope length more specific pitch motion statistics are shown in fig 21 as well as the statistics in heave mode fig 22 demonstrates normalized maximum of responses in pitch heave motions and induced speed the time domain series curves in fig 19 show that dynamic motion in heave mode fluctuates severer than it does in pitch mode the return period of maximum amplitudes for heave motion is longer than that in pitch motion which is not affected by towrope length from fig 20 the std and maximum values of pitch and roll motions show a limited impact resulted from towrope length except for sever sea state longer towrope length slightly enhances the fluctuation std of pitch responses for moderate sea states but eliminates the max amplitude while in roll mode it is different that towrope length of 150 m shows the most significant response more details can be observed from fig 21 which shows that pitch motion with a towrope length of 100 m was influenced mostly by sea states for heave motion with a towrope length of 150 m the statistics of response were least affected by sea states as fig 22 depicted sea states affect the normalized maximum values of pitch heave and induced speed in varying degrees the variation seems to be less influenced by towrope length especially for pitch motion the towing speed fluctuates the most in extreme condition and it can be larger with a towrope length of 200 m with longer towrope length the oimm seems more sensitive to extreme sea state than that of the shorter length which straight lines shows a clear decrease in growth rate from sea state of grade vi to extreme generally the dynamic motion in the pitch and heave modes resulting from the towrope length demonstrates a similar characteristic which is different from that in roll mode with longer towrope length pitch and heave motion responses are comparatively small but roll motion will be larger these differences of responses statistics due to towrope length can be limited in moderate ses states except for the induced towing speed 5 conclusions the oimm structure introduced in this paper featured by a steel meteorological mast supported by a triangular floating tank which has subdivisions inside a small tugboat and a single towrope can achieve the primary requirement for this wet tow operation an integrated wet towing operation for this oimm is proposed and designed to be a highly economical technique for involving simple and less expensive transportation equipment the feasibility of this wet towing operation is assessed by numerical method using moses static stability coupled wave and wind induced dynamic and motion response analyses are carried out to find out the behavior of the oimm in different operation conditions and sea states the oimm has sufficient intact stability and acceptable damage stability with a proper subdivision scheme constantly increasing the draft will lead to a decrease in this feature the stability of the oimm will be more sensitive to the damage of compartments with deeper drafts the multi compartment design is critical for stability safety during transportation from a practical viewpoint hydrodynamic analyses were carried out using moses as an effective method it can provide operational suggestions and predict the hydrodynamic behaviors in six degrees of freedom for this oimm the initial draft of oimm exerts more impact on motion responses than on induced speed and the optimal draft condition is the deepest in that the wet surface is larger and the position of center of gravity is lower due to ballast weight the mooring position has greater impact on maximum amplitudes of pitch and heave motions than on stds also the normalized maximum pitch motion is larger than that in heave motion moderate dynamic responses can be achieved with a higher mooring position and faster towing speed the towrope length induced responses in heave and pitch modes are similar with longer towrope lengths maximum and std values are larger in roll mode but smaller in pitch and heave modes the normalized maximum responses are more sensitive to the towrope length when the sea states are severer the sea states have greater impact on the towing speed than on motions responses this oimm is light in weight and equipment saving in towing transportation the towing stability can be tuned optionally by the draft the mooring position and the towrope length which enables this oimm more adaptive for offshore wind farms acknowledgments the

22551,an offshore integrated meteorological mast oimm featured by integrating the offshore transportation of the foundation and steel mast into one operation is proposed the most critical technique of the oimm is a self floating towing operation with a reasonable subdivision inside the floating tank to find out the towing dynamic behaviors of the oimm with different drafts mooring positions towing velocities and towrope lengths in various sea conditions the hydrodynamic analyses were carried out by using moses the oimm model in prototype scale was established in moses to simulate the static stability and dynamic responses induced by coupled wave and wind conditions a small tugboat and a single towrope are employed for this towing system the results show that the oimm has sufficient intact stability and acceptable damage stability for its inner subdivision configuration the towrope length exerts the most impact on fluctuation response than draft and mooring positions draft depths and mooring positions impact more on pitch motion than on heave motion the normalized maximum values of motion responses are equally influenced by draft and mooring position coupled effects of sea states and towing speed on dynamic features are also illustrated keywords offshore integrated meteorological mast oimm hydrodynamic response towing stability dynamic response offshore wind 1 introduction in the early stages of wind farm development meteorological masts are employed to provide meteorological data for assessments of the wind resource and energy production of offshore wind farms dnv gl 2014 offshore meteorological masts are usually required to be installed on a fixed or a floating foundation it can be expensive to install such a structure on a foundation or platform and maintain the safety of instruments in an offshore location a meteorological mast with a height of 90 120 m is a temporary structure usually constructed of lightweight steel that remains in service for approximately 1 2 years some up to 5 years for example a twisted jacket foundation was first used for the meteorological mast to collect high quality wind data up to 103 m above the sea in the hornsea project conducted in the uk subsea world news 2011 laizhou bay s 100 m high tower snptc 2012 used a large diameter single pile as an ice resistant foundation for the first time in china in addition two innovative suction installed foundations were first installed on dogger bank offshorewind biz 2013 the foundations supported 93 m high meteorological lattice masts that monitored the wave and wind conditions at the site later two meteorological masts with tripod suction bucket foundations were constructed on the west coast of korea kwag et al 2014 with a water depth of 30 m these novel foundation designs aimed to significantly reduce foundation capital expense costs see fig 1 subsea world news 2011 snptc 2012 offshorewind biz 2013 tianjin university and dao da heavy industry company ddhi developed an offshore meteorological mast with an innovative foundation as an integrated structure oimm that reduces costs by increasing the speed of the transportation and installation process and minimizing the required amount of marine operation equipment ding et al 2014 2019 zhang et al 2018 the integrated installation and floating technique one step installation which has been successfully employed in the large scale composite bucket foundation ding et al 2013 2015 zhang et al 2013 is referenced and adopted for the installation of oimm there have been six engineering project cases using innovative techniques in the offshore wind farms of china regardless of how efficient the installation is it is inevitable to spend a major proportion of time on assembling the steel mast with foundation on site that magnifies the benefits for constructing the floating foundation with the steel mast into one integrated structure before installation shown in fig 2 compared with other resembling structures this oimm can be constructed and integrated onshore with high quality wet towed to the installation site with a small tugboat submerged into water and finally installed into seabed by an air water displacement self sinking method shown in fig 3 the installation concept described in this paper meets the requirement to perform a wet towing operation and the feasibility of this integrated transportation can be investigated based on the numerical simulation method by which the hydrodynamic responses of the oimm can be obtained towing operations are the most common marine operations and are usually defined as the transport of a self floating object by one or several towing tugs berg 2017 jacobsen 2010 studied the basic dynamics of the assembled system of a subsea template that needed to be towed and calculated the dynamic forces and displacements by using time integration in simo the dry transport of a tlp by a heavy lift transport vessel was investigated by zhang et al 2012 to demonstrate its feasibility for transport and the transport vessel behavior and tlp structure were evaluated in sweden the wet towing of a substructure to a fwtu was performed with special equipment and vessels eriksson and kullander 2013 a series of wet tow operations was studied based on a nuclear plant and offshore wind turbines and some filed experiments were conducted these mainly focused on towing stability features and important influence factors jurewicz 2015 the towing motion responses of a jack up unit kang et al 2016 and a multi cylinder fpso zhao et al 2016 were analyzed under different towing conditions to estimate the extreme motion and the towing stability kim et al 2017a 2017b compared the cost estimation between dry towing and wet towing for a semisubmersible platform and suggested that wet towing was more cost saving for their project to determine the right time when the average towing tension and the estimated time of arrival were low a wet tow method was applied and some field experiments were performed on the wet towing of an integrated transportation vessel with two bucket foundations for offshore wind turbines zhang et al 2015 to determine the motion behaviors of this special vessel some numerical simulations by sesam have been conducted on towing performance of multi cylinder fpso for offshore marginal field zhao et al 2016 and on a dynamics of a floating wind turbine in wet tow by using a multibody dynamic model ding et al 2017 the latter is to study the stability of the floating wind turbine and the towline force while considerable research has been conducted on the simulation of offshore wind structures few numerical studies have been performed on transportation of such light high rise met mast structure in a wet tow process in this study the static stability coupled wave and wind induced dynamic and motion response analyses are carried out based on a proposed innovative oimm which can be self floating in a wet tow operation hydrodynamic analyses were carried out using moses to find out the behaviors of oimm with different operation conditions in operational and harsh sea states the towing system is composed by a small tugboat and a single towrope which is economic in terms of the costs 2 oimm model and towing system 2 1 oimm model fig 4 a shows the components of the innovative offshore meteorological mast which integrates a truss tower a floating tank and three triangular caissons as one unit for towing transportation and onsite installation during transportation see fig 4 b the floating tank provides enough towing stability for the integrated structure then three triangular caissons penetrate the seabed after the floating tank is pumped with water or other ballast materials the ballasted tank and three triangular caissons work together as a supporting foundation to provide bearing capacity during its service time the typical height of the tower above sea level is 90 110 m and the side length of the floating tank is 25 40 m the height of the floating tank is around 2 4 m and the height and side length of the triangular suction caissons are 2 4 m and 5 6 m respectively the optional installation water depth is no more than 15 m the parameters of the floating tank of the oimm used in this analysis are listed in table 1 the height and the side length can be referred to fig 4 a the net cross area is cross sectional area in horizontal level resembling to the water plane when the oimm being in a directly vertical floating state the available buoyancy in this table refers to the maximum upward floating force provided by the floating tank the initial draft is 0 85 m which can provide the buoyancy to balance the self weight during the wet towing transportation the floating stability can be adjusted by reasonably decreasing the height of the center of gravity this is achieved by filling ballast in the compartments of this floating tank to investigate the hydrodynamic motion of the oimm during wet towing in terms of practical application several draft conditions and sea environments are given these are listed in table 2 and table 3 2 2 towing system the towing system is simulated by moses and its commands are used for both system modeling and simulations the modeling process is finished in the local coordinate system for each body while the towing operation is performed in the global coordinate system see fig 5 three hydrodynamic theories are employed by strip theory three dimensional diffraction theory and morison s equation the morison s equation is used for a beam element in the mode and the viscous drag will be computed the feasibility of using moses 3d diffraction code as a hydrodynamic analysis tool was proven by carrying out a series of comparisons between moses and wave analysis at massachusetts institute of technology wamit for a wide range of wave periods and wave heading angles wamit is a three dimensional panel based program for computing wave loads and motions of offshore structures moses 2009 there are three components in this towing system the oimm model a single towrope and a tugboat the oimm model was set up in the prototype dimensions see table 1 and since the tugboat in this analysis was primarily used to provide the drag force it was modeled in general dimensions that had a longitude length of 30 m as for the towrope three parameters are important the material property the length and the diameter given that the entire weight of this oimm is relatively light compared with general offshore floating platforms or wind turbines the towing resistance is relatively small at around several tens tons for extreme sea conditions therefore the towrope material adopted here is a steel wire line with a diameter of 50 mm the steel wire line modeled by a type of sling element in moses is rigid in tension with a length defined by the distance between two mooring points in moses the forward speed of this towing system can be achieved by modeling a drag force on the tugboat in addition the environmental loads are important for towing system simulations three types of sea loads wind current and wave will be used in the time domain simulations four grades of load conditions are defined based on the local sea environment as shown in table 3 the wind load is defined by the mean wind velocity in knots and by the wind direction from which the wind blows to model a wave a sea of significant height and period at a specified angle are the basic parameters for defining an irregular wave condition the current load defined in this system has the same propagation direction as the wave load dose 3 numerical method 3 1 hydrodynamic model and time domain process waves wind and current are principal factors that cause floating structure disturbances during wet towing operations therefore the most critical numerical problem for an oimm is its dynamic response in a complex environment the motion of the oimm in a random sea state is characterized by response operators the numerical simulation aims to supplement important information for practical application for instance the design of offshore foundation structures and motion control systems the motion history of an oimm in six degrees of freedom can be expressed in a reference system the origin of which is chosen in the water plane three dimensional potential theory was adopted to determine the hydrodynamic forces of the oimm let m be the mass and the added mass matrices of the oimm the tugboat and the towline let d be the damping matrices and k be the stiffness matrices q e represents the environmental sea loads and the drag force the relevant equations of motion in the horizontal plane is a function of time as follows moses reference manual 1 m x x d x x k x x q e x x x t where x x x are the motion displacement velocity and acceleration matrices respectively the time domain processes are a set of configurations that satisfy the basic motion equation in moses the newmark method is adopted to work this process suppose that the solution of function 1 at time t 1 is known and the solution

parameters γ β if γ 0 5 β 0 25 the newmark method is unconditionally stable that is the rate of change of acceleration within a time step is constant note that the time step interval should be short enough to obtain a stable solution which is usually taken as t 10 where t is the shortest natural period of the structural system gavin 2001 moses 2009 the wave spectrum employed in this paper is issc

computed to make the total area under the spectrum equal to h s 2 16 σ is 0 07 for frequencies less than the peak and 0 09 for those greater than the peak 3 2 intact and damage stability analysis the metacentric height gm is a measurement of the initial static stability of a floating body it is calculated as the distance between the center of gravity of a floating body and its metacenter a larger metacentric height implies better initial stability against overturning moments the metacentric height also implicates the natural period of the rolling mode of a hull and a very large metacentric height is associated with shorter periods of roll which have an adverse effect on meteorological devices such as cup anemometers hence a sufficient but not excessive metacentric height is considered ideal for anemometer masts equipped with expensive wind assessment devices gm is calculated as follows 11 g m ρ z g z b 12 ρ i v where ρ is the metacentric radius v is the displacement volume corresponding to the self weight of the structure i is the moment of inertia from the waterplane of the floating tank to the axis gm is the metacentric height z g is the center of mass and z b is the center of buoyancy these equations will be used to compute the stability related parameters in table 5 listed in the column of the theoretical results stability criterion numeral k is an important basic requirement of the floating stability k is calculated as the ratio of the corresponding area under the righting arm and heeling arm within the second intersection angle of these two curves imo 2009 when k 1 4 the heeling moment is 40 less than the minimum righting moment which is necessary for keeping the floating structure from capsizing therefore it is believed that the structure has adequate intact stability the oimm is different from a general offshore floater since the draft of the structure is less than 2 m to prevent the anemometer tower from overturning during a wet towing operation the floating tank should sustain the stability once some areas of the tank have unexpected damage therefore it is necessary to set compartments inside the floating tank to solve this problem there are two schemes of subdivisions for the floating tank one is divided into three compartments and the other is divided into nine compartments as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b respectively 3 3 convergence analyses of mesh and simulation period for numerical simulation with potential theory the panel model is used and mesh density sensitivity analysis should be conducted to achieve sufficient precision and optimum efficiency the mesh dimension is supposed to be smaller than the minimum dimensional feature of the target structure given that the minimal dimension of the floating tank is 2 m mesh lengths of 0 8 m 1 0 m 1 2 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m are adopted and compared in terms of viscous drag force and motion responses except for the mesh size the rest of the parameters maintain constant note that for panel model moses has provided verified examples with mesh features shown in fig 6 which can be a benchmark table 4 listed the detailed information of different mesh lengths and statistics of motion responses fig 7 shows the mesh induced percentage differences of parameters in table 4 as shown in fig 7 the time domain statistics of hydrodynamic parameters under different mesh density barely change within 1 0 m and 1 4 m however a clear change can be seen for more intensive mesh or sparser mesh generally a relative reasonable mesh length is suggested to be 1 3 1 4 of the dimension features as shown in fig 7 tlp and semi submersible given that the mesh size we applied in following analyses is 1 2 m 4 numerical results 4 1 stability analysis results table 5 lists the related parameters of the intact stability of an oimm computed by two methods the theoretical method section 3 2 and the default calculation by the moses model see in fig 8 from table 5 the maximum difference of the static stability parameters by the two methods is shown in draft i around 5 6 in that the aircushion effect is not considered in theoretical method and it eliminates the static stability for other draft conditions the results are quite close which verifies the feasibility and accuracy of the moses model fig 9 a and b illustrate the intact stability checking results for two draft conditions considering a wind velocity of 100 knots it is obvious that the stability righting arm increases as the rolling angle grows to a limit angle which is approximately 5 10 for draft conditions ii and iv see table 2 respectively when the rolling angle is larger there is a clear drop in the righting arm curve due to the downward position of the center of mass while the curve of the area ratio is much more stable it is considered to have enough intact stability if gm 0 15 and k 1 4 according to the criteria imo 2009 thus from fig 9 it is reasonable to believe that the oimm has sufficient intact stability and that increasing the draft may lead to a decrease in this feature the results of the damage stability are listed in table 6 considering various combinations of damaged compartments three draft conditions are chosen from 0 85 m to 1 5 m according to table 6 for the three compartment scheme any compartment damage will result in the failure of the stability however for the nine compartment scheme by comparison partial damage of the tank will lead to a decrease in the stability especially when damage occurs in a single large rectangular compartment such as a2 a3 b2 b3 c2 c3 or multi compartments a1 a2 a2 b2 a1 b1 c1 when the draft goes deeper the stability of the oimm will be more sensitive to the damage to the compartments for instance in table 6 the a2 damage a2 b2 damage and a1 b1 c1 damage conditions will deprive the safety of the oimm under draft condition iv while the damaged condition of a1 a2 fails to pass the stability requirements for all generally under the same draft the best stability of the oimm exists in the no damage condition intact condition for the same damage condition draft condition ii has better stability with a larger area ratio number k the multi compartment design scheme of the oimm is critical for stability safety during transportation from a practical viewpoint finally the frequency domain analyses were conducted for oimm table 7 illustrates the natural periods with different draft conditions at two incident wave directions see fig 6 a the frequency domain analysis of rao in moses is shown in fig 10 generally the first order wave frequency is around 0 3 0 75 rad s 8 s 21 s therefore the natural periods of heave motion is away from the range of wave frequencies 4 2 dynamic response results as previously mentioned the hydrodynamic responses of a large floater with a steel meteorological mast depend not only on the sea load conditions and drafts but also on the towing system including the mooring position the towing speed and the towrope length therefore the following results are based on these factors random sea conditions are used and the heading wave is described by an issc spectrum with a significant wave height in meters and corresponding period in seconds the significant height and period of this issc wave spectrum is from table 3 for a time domain analyses we compared three groups of time duration 3 h 1 h and 1000s in respect to their statistical values because the recommended 3 h simulation dnv 2011 barltrop and adams 2013 is time consuming for a preliminarily qualitative analysis the comparison shows that the std standard deviation of motion responses around 0 3 2 5 barely changes under different simulation time and the mean values are also stable around 2 6 5 8 given that the time consumption is much reduced and the operational factors induced variations are the center of attention the 1000s duration was adopted in this paper it has to be mentioned that a compromise was made for the undervalued maximums around 10 fig 11 shows a typical time series of the motion response under a 3 h towing simulation the comparison is shown in table 8 4 2 1 draft the floating tank is relatively short in height and its water plane area and wet surface may vary significantly when the pitch and heave motions are huge to obtain an optimal dynamic stability four different draft conditions are chosen see in table 2 and compared in terms of pitch and heave modes responses as well as the induced speed it has to be mentioned that the draft depth of 0 5 m is lower than the draft depth for balancing the self weight therefore the additional buoyancy is achieved by air cushion inside the shirt plates which eliminates the stability as illustrated in section 4 1 the draft depth of 2 m will lead to a capsize of oimm the dynamic responses analyses resulted from draft depth are conducted considering a mooring position of 2 m towrope length of 100 m towing speed of 3 m s and sea condition of grade iv table 9 listed the statistics of dynamic responses under different draft depths fig 12 shows a time series of pitch angle with lower envelope curves at first 200 s to illustrate the details fig 13 compares normalized maximum of responses for heave roll pitch motions and induced speed karimirad and moan 2011 as fig 12 shown the time history curves fluctuate significantly for different draft conditions a reduction can be observed when a deeper draft of 1 5 m is reached the most significant fluctuation of pitch motion is caused by the lowest draft condition 0 5 m this may because the small submerged area can only conduct to a small righting force while fig 13 suggests that larger area of wet surface may not contribute to a moderate motion response especially in heave mode which shows a clear increase from the draft depth of 0 85 m 1 0 m after which this normalized maximum responses show a decrease at draft of 1 5 m compared with motion responses in heave pitch and roll mode towing speed shows the minimum impact by draft conditions even though the draft related features in these three modes are different the optimum draft depth can still be suggested as 1 5 m it is reasonable to conclude that dynamic motion responses can be tuned by appropriately increasing the draft of the oimm 4 2 2 mooring position vs towing speed to determine the effect of mooring positions and towing speed on dynamic performance of the oimm five mooring positions fig 14 and three towing speeds are chosen and compared in terms of pitch and heave motions notice that different towing speed was achieved by setting different towing force the towing force is constant when the mooring position varies these comparisons are conducted based on a draft condition of 0 85 m towrope length of 100 m and sea state of grade iv figs 15 and 16 are typical time series of pitch and heave responses under three towing speeds with a mooring position of 2 0 m the lower envelope curves are drawn for the first 200 s period for detailed comparison table 10 lists the basic statistics of dynamic responses resulting from different mooring positions in heave and pitch modes for a induced speed of 1 m s the max and std values of pitch and heave under three speeds are demonstrated in fig 17 and normalized maximum of responses are shown in fig 18 from figs 15 and 16 dynamic responses in pitch and heave modes fluctuate dramatically and differences resulting from towing speed are quite clear the max value shows a reduction as the mooring position becomes higher in both pitch and heave modes as shown in fig 17 while the std values barely change as the mooring position for pitch motion mooring position seems has larger impact on max value when the towing speed is higher which however is opposite in heave motion the maximum and std values in both pitch and heave modes are smaller when the towing speed is high fig 18 compares the normalized maximum of responses of pitch heave and induced speed at different mooring positions it suggests that mooring position exerts much lower impact on induced speed than it does on heave motions and then on pitch motion the normalized maximum in heave mode response exhibits limited impact by towing speeds however the normalized pitch motion shows that higher towing speed leads to higher fluctuations overall it can be concluded that for oimm moderate dynamic response amplitudes can be achieved with a higher mooring position and faster towing speed in that the induced speed fluctuates the weakest 4 2 3 towrope length vs sea state in this towing system the towrope length is required to be long enough to guard oimm from crashing into tugboat but will not mount dynamic responses given that the weight and dimensional features of oimm are relatively small the towrope length adopted here is relative short 100 m 150 m 200 m with a given draft of 0 85 m mooring position of 2 m and towing speed of 3 m s dynamic responses are analyzed in fig 19 time series of dynamic motion responses in pitch and heave modes are depicts the lower envelop curves are drawn which shows a clear variation of the amplitude fig 20 shows the std and maximum values of pitch and roll motions under different sea states and towrope length more specific pitch motion statistics are shown in fig 21 as well as the statistics in heave mode fig 22 demonstrates normalized maximum of responses in pitch heave motions and induced speed the time domain series curves in fig 19 show that dynamic motion in heave mode fluctuates severer than it does in pitch mode the return period of maximum amplitudes for heave motion is longer than that in pitch motion which is not affected by towrope length from fig 20 the std and maximum values of pitch and roll motions show a limited impact resulted from towrope length except for sever sea state longer towrope length slightly enhances the fluctuation std of pitch responses for moderate sea states but eliminates the max amplitude while in roll mode it is different that towrope length of 150 m shows the most significant response more details can be observed from fig 21 which shows that pitch motion with a towrope length of 100 m was influenced mostly by sea states for heave motion with a towrope length of 150 m the statistics of response were least affected by sea states as fig 22 depicted sea states affect the normalized maximum values of pitch heave and induced speed in varying degrees the variation seems to be less influenced by towrope length especially for pitch motion the towing speed fluctuates the most in extreme condition and it can be larger with a towrope length of 200 m with longer towrope length the oimm seems more sensitive to extreme sea state than that of the shorter length which straight lines shows a clear decrease in growth rate from sea state of grade vi to extreme generally the dynamic motion in the pitch and heave modes resulting from the towrope length demonstrates a similar characteristic which is different from that in roll mode with longer towrope length pitch and heave motion responses are comparatively small but roll motion will be larger these differences of responses statistics due to towrope length can be limited in moderate ses states except for the induced towing speed 5 conclusions the oimm structure introduced in this paper featured by a steel meteorological mast supported by a triangular floating tank which has subdivisions inside a small tugboat and a single towrope can achieve the primary requirement for this wet tow operation an integrated wet towing operation for this oimm is proposed and designed to be a highly economical technique for involving simple and less expensive transportation equipment the feasibility of this wet towing operation is assessed by numerical method using moses static stability coupled wave and wind induced dynamic and motion response analyses are carried out to find out the behavior of the oimm in different operation conditions and sea states the oimm has sufficient intact stability and acceptable damage stability with a proper subdivision scheme constantly increasing the draft will lead to a decrease in this feature the stability of the oimm will be more sensitive to the damage of compartments with deeper drafts the multi compartment design is critical for stability safety during transportation from a practical viewpoint hydrodynamic analyses were carried out using moses as an effective method it can provide operational suggestions and predict the hydrodynamic behaviors in six degrees of freedom for this oimm the initial draft of oimm exerts more impact on motion responses than on induced speed and the optimal draft condition is the deepest in that the wet surface is larger and the position of center of gravity is lower due to ballast weight the mooring position has greater impact on maximum amplitudes of pitch and heave motions than on stds also the normalized maximum pitch motion is larger than that in heave motion moderate dynamic responses can be achieved with a higher mooring position and faster towing speed the towrope length induced responses in heave and pitch modes are similar with longer towrope lengths maximum and std values are larger in roll mode but smaller in pitch and heave modes the normalized maximum responses are more sensitive to the towrope length when the sea states are severer the sea states have greater impact on the towing speed than on motions responses this oimm is light in weight and equipment saving in towing transportation the towing stability can be tuned optionally by the draft the mooring position and the towrope length which enables this oimm more adaptive for offshore wind farms acknowledgments the

22552,in this study a wave generation boundary capable of absorbing secondary reflections is embedded in an openfoam based numerical toolbox to model the wave structure interactions of a jarlan type caisson breakwater jtcb numerical simulations of wave structure interactions of a jtcb have been compared to experimental data where the reflection coefficient the velocity field and the wave load of the jtcb are analyzed in detail it has been found that conventional two dimensional 2d simulation will underestimate the reflection coefficient especially when the value of the nondimensional wave dissipation chamber length is in the range 0 12 0 21 this underestimation of the reflection coefficient could be related to an overestimation of the porosity of the perforated wall considered in conventional 2d structure simplifications a porosity equivalent 2d structure whose porosity is the same as that of the three dimensional 3d structure is presented and shown to effectively avoid this problem in addition in terms of wave loads the agreement between the 2d simulation and the experiment has also been improved significantly using the porosity equivalent 2d structure additionally the interaction process including the run up on the back wall and the eddy formation process is described via the changes of the velocity field and the free surface relatively good overall agreement between the calculated values and the experimental values is observed indicating that this toolbox is useful and efficient for simulating wave structure interactions of this kind this study is expected to be useful to engineers concerned with the numerical modeling preliminary feasibility assessment and conceptual design of jtcbs keywords jarlan type caisson reflection coefficient velocity field wave load 2d simplification 1 introduction breakwaters are mainly used to protect harbor facilities and provide a calm basin for ships by reducing wave induced disturbances conventional vertical breakwaters which provide excellent shelter contain a traditional caisson on a rubble mound foundation however a large deadweight is needed for the stability of this conventional structure which can make a vertical breakwater an infeasible option due to economic or technical constraints moreover a conventional vertical breakwater results in a strong wave reflection which negatively impacts the safety of facilities and ships under these conditions jarlan 1961 proposed the basic concept of a perforated caisson breakwater which consists of a perforated front wall and a solid back wall separated by a wave dissipation chamber such perforated structures effectively reduce wave reflection and horizontal wave forces and help reduce the scour of the seabed in front of the breakwater liu and li 2011 since jarlan s proposal several researchers have introduced modifications to this type of perforated structure to improve the hydrodynamic performance of the jarlan type caisson breakwater jtcb elbisy 2017 physical modeling is a valuable and reliable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of the jtcb and many studies have been conducted with this type of modeling garrido and medina 2012 liu et al 2015 however because experimental studies are often expensive and time consuming the hydrodynamic parameters of structures such as reflection and transmission coefficient values are characterized for only a limited number of wave conditions and setups as a result multiple analytical solutions have been developed and successfully validated with experimental data most existing mathematical models are based on the potential theory which ignores the viscosity of the fluid the most significant part of the derivation step for perforated structures is handling the nonlinear condition of the perforated front wall generally flows are turbulent in regions close to the gaps of the perforated wall and the energy dissipation as well as the phase shift of wave motions can be represented by either linear or quadratic pressure drop conditions liu and li 2017 as mentioned above one widely used method of modeling the perforated front wall is the use of a porous effect parameter g yu 1995 i e the perforated wall is treated as a thin porous wall g is an empirical complex coefficient expressed as follows 1 g ε k δ f i s where δ is the thickness of the perforated front wall ε is the porosity of the front wall i 1 f is the linear resistance coefficient and s is the inertia coefficient which is related to the added mass coefficient c m sollitt and cross 1972 2 s 1 c m 1 ε ε the resistance coefficient f arises from a linearization of the velocity squared term associated with the head loss across the perforated wall and the evaluation of f requires an iterative procedure zhu and zhu 2010 however for problems of interactions between waves and perforated walls this iteration is not feasible which means that f is always calculated by the least squares method based on a series of model tests li et al 2006 in recent research liu and li 2016 indicated that the resistance coefficient f is mainly dependent on the keulegan carpenter kc number which is expressed as 3 k c j u t δ h l 2 d δ where u is the depth averaged value of the amplitude of the horizontal fluid velocity for the incident wave t h and l are the period height length of the incident wave respectively and d is the still water depth then the resistance coefficient f can be obtained by liu and li 2016 4 f 0 989 k c j 0 746 re j 150 2000 0 270 k c j 0 957 re j 0 6 1 8 10 5 where re j is the reynolds number for this kind of problem defined as 5 re j u δ ν h l δ 2 ν d t where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid for the inertia coefficient s under the condition of a thin perforated wall it is suitable to set the value of c m 0 rather than to 0 34 van gent 1995 which means s 1 once the porous effect parameter g has been calculated the reflection coefficient k r of a fully perforated jtcb can be defined as sahoo et al 2000 6 k r 1 g 1 i cot k b 1 g 1 i cot k b where k is the wave number and b is the wave dissipation length eq 6 is widely accepted and could provide a relatively good prediction for k r if there is a rubble mound in the wave dissipation chamber the situation becomes complicated because of the existence of evanescent waves the analytical solution of this problem can be obtained by the matching eigenfunction expansion method which is slightly complicated but feasible according to the results of isaacson et al 2000 liu et al 2007 and liu and faraci 2014 in general the analytical solutions of the jtcb has been fully developed and details of these solutions can be found in the review of huang et al 2011 however as the situation becomes complicated the analytical solution will also become complicated and it may not be possible to explicitly obtain the solution furthermore most theory analysis methods are derived under the condition of a 2d axis which neglects some 3d effects to disappear for example in the following analysis it could be observed that some values of k r calculated from the 2d cases are much smaller than those obtained by 3d cases and the existence of the vertical part of the front wall which is ignored in 2d models does affect critical parameters such as k r in fact the theoretical solution method is frequently used to provide a preliminary evaluation on the reflection performance of the jtcb in practical engineering such a method lacks the capacity for detailed description which provides a chance for the application of numerical models based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations rans equations keep the viscous item in the momentum equation and are suitable for simulating complex hydrodynamic phenomena in the field of coastal engineering one of the greatest advantages of numerical models based on rans equations is its intrinsic ability to capture the velocity and pressure fields in detail which especially in combination with physical scale model tests provides engineers with a clear understanding of the nature of the problem in the present study a numerical toolbox was developed to simulate interactions between waves and a jtcb considering the complex phenomenon of this type of problem and the advantages of the rans model this numerical model based on the open source cfd toolbox openfoam solves the problem of a two phase incompressible viscous fluid and the vof scheme hirt and nichols 1981 is employed to capture the free surface to investigate the processes of wave propagation through a perforated wall and energy dissipation a rock filled jtcb located on a trapezoidal rubble mound foundation was selected for simulation and the result is compared with both experimental data conducted at dalian university of technology dut xia 2017 and the analytical solution mentioned above several hydrodynamic processes have been analyzed and some recommendations are proposed the paper is organized as follows the numerical model is described in section 2 including the procedure of determining parameters section 3 consists of the verification of the numerical model comparisons between the experimental and numerical results as well as a detailed analysis of such problems are explored in section 4 further discussions are provided in section 5 the conclusions obtained in the present study are discussed in section 6 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equation 2 1 1 governing equations of the wave field the governing equations of the wave field are a

the governing equations are the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations which contain the effect of porosity the volume average is adopted to variables of the rans equations eqs 7 9 and the new term brought by this operation is modeled by the drag force of the porous media these kinds of equations have been studied in detail for the past three decades and there are numerous publications on the topic del jesus et al 2012 higuera et al 2014a 2014b jacobsen et al 2015 jensen et al 2014a liu et al 1999 losada et al 2016 gave a comprehensive review of the modeling of water waves with porous coastal structures although there are still some fundamental problems that need to be solved relatively good results of such modeling methods could be obtained using the varans equations like the rans equations the varans equations for static porous media consist of the conservation of mass conservation of momentum and vof function advection equations higuera 2015 14 u 0 15

other values such as 0 0 can be set for c m jensen et al 2014b comparing the standard rans equations and the varans equations mentioned above it can be concluded that i the two mass conservation equations are identical indicating that during the solving procedure no modifications are needed for the pressure equation and ii the major difference between the two coefficient matrices of velocity is a factor with a value of 1 ϕ which can also be said of the vof equations in openfoam with respect to the momentum equation this factor can be added to the velocity coefficient matrix explicitly higuera et al 2014a or through the built in member function addresistance of the porositymodel class jacobsen et al 2015 for the vof function this factor is added by modifying the solving function of the mules jasak 1996 algorithm i e explicitsolve 2 2 boundary conditions two kinds of boundary conditions are adopted during the simulation i the no slip condition for both the fixed jtcb and the other boundaries in the computational domain i e the condition for smooth solid walls and ii the wave generation boundary at the left side of the computational domain in this study a moving wall method which has been widely used in wave generation research kuai et al 2018 wu and hsiao 2018 is adopted for wave generation in the linear theory for a piston wave maker for monochromatic waves there is a linear relationship between the wave height and the stroke of the paddle 24 h s h s 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d where hs is this linear relationship and s is the stroke of the wave maker based on this linear theory madsen 1971 presented the second order theory for regular wave generation with a surface elevation of 25 η x t h 2 cos k x ω t k h 2 16 2 cosh 2 k d cosh k d sinh 3 k d cos

reflection that occurs at the wave paddle is a major problem in both physical model tests and numerical simulations schaffer and klopman 2000 lengthening or widening the wave flume is one widely used traditional way to reduce the influence of secondary reflection however in a numerical model this traditional approach may result in a large number of calculations therefore the active absorption capability of secondary reflection is often required to provide better results at lower costs in the present model when generating waves additional motions are embedded into the wave generation boundary to absorb the secondary reflection waves impinging on it if u corr denotes the correct velocity of the active absorbing wave paddle the corresponding displacement in every time step δt is 28 x c o r r u c o r r δ t the sum of these displacements constitutes the final correction of the active absorbing wave maker thus the final displacement of the active absorbing wave paddle is the superposition of the normal displacement and the correction part wang et al 2018 29 x c o r r t x t u c o r r d t with 30 u c o r r ω h s η m η 0 ω is the circular frequency η m and η 0 in eq 30 are

presented in this subsection it is widely accepted that the turbulence level could be quantified by the reynolds number therefore the reynolds number of such problems should be estimated before simulation regarding the interaction between waves and a jtcb the reynolds number re j and kc number kc j could be calculated by eq 5 and eq 3 respectively the thickness of the front wall of the jtcb adopted in the present study is 0 01 m thus the values of re j and kc j vary from 1095 to 1707 and from 10 95 to 23 9 regarding the interaction between waves and porous media the pore reynolds number dybbs and edwards 1984 can be defined as 31 re p u d 50 ϕ ν h l d 50 2 ϕ ν d t similarly according to eq 22 the kc number can be calculated as 32 k c p t o u m d 50 ϕ t u d 50 ϕ h l 2 d d 50 ϕ note that the pore reynolds number and the kc number are calculated via the depth averaged value of the amplitude of the horizontal fluid velocity of the incident wave and the oscillation velocity used in eq 32 is represented by the wave period as proposed by losada et al 2008 an alternative approach for kc p calculation that is derived from the shallow water theory which can be found in jacobsen et al 2015 values calculated from the present approach and the alternative approach are of the same order of magnitude in fact for wave problems the value of kc p will not cause significant differences as it is always much greater than 7 5 and located in the denominator position of eq 23 additionally the effect of kc p can be incorporated into the value of β 1 making it a matter of coefficient differences which may be the reason why kc p is missing in some publications hsu et al 2002 wu and hsiao 2013 the values of re p and kc p in the present study vary from 3128 to 4877 and from 21 72 to 47 42 according to burcharth and andersen 1995 when re p 300 a highly unsteady and chaotic i e fully turbulent flow regime has developed we find that for wave related problems the pore reynolds number is always greater than 300 the high reynolds numbers indicate that turbulence modeling is needed for such problems however for surface waves several widely used turbulence models have a tendency to severely overestimate turbulence levels which leads to excessive wave damping during wave propagations larsen and fuhrman 2018 therefore the turbulence model adopted in the present study is the recently presented buoyancy modified k omega model which could result in stable wave propagation without significant wave damping over the length of the wave flume devolder et al 2017 2018 detailed discussions can be found in section 3 3 verifications the sensitivity to the mesh refinement of the present model the selection of turbulence models and the active absorption capacity of the wave generation boundary are investigated in this section according to eça and hoekstra 2014 for cfd simulations of simple problems the discretization error ε ζ could be estimated by power series expansions 33 ε ζ ζ i ζ 0 q h i p ζ i represents any integral or other function of a local flow quantity ζ 0 is an estimation of the exact value q is a constant that needs to be determined h i is the typical grid size and p is the order of mesh convergence at least three meshes are required to calculate the three unknown variables in eq 33 when using this power series expansions method two assumptions should be satisfied i the three meshes must be asymptotic to guarantee that the leading term of power series expansion can sufficiently estimate the error and ii a single parameter h i can sufficiently describe the mesh satisfying these assumptions requires the grids to be geometrically similar i e the grid refinement ratio the ratio between the length and the height of a cell should be constant for different grids with all conditions satisfied the convergence of the meshes can also be estimated by the discriminating ratio roache 2009 34 r ζ r ζ m ζ m ζ c where the subscripts r m and c represent the refined medium and coarse mesh respectively substituting eq 33 into eq 34 we get 35 r h r h m p 1 h m h r p 1 h c h m p with the second assumption mentioned above i e h r h m h m h c eq 35 can be simplified to 36 log r p log h r h m it should be noted that only the discretization error estimation is adopted to investigate the mesh refinement sensitivity this is because i the present numerical model is mass conserved as a result of adopting the moving wall wave generation method and no wave damping terms ii all the grids share a similar rectangular shape identical aspect ratio without complex geometries these two reasons make the cases sufficient to use this estimation method according to the experiment which will be further discussed six wave conditions are selected and reproduced in the present simulation among these wave conditions the one with the largest wave steepness i e that with a 0 08 m wave height 1 0 s wave period and 0 4 m water depth is selected for verification fig 1 shows a sketch of the numerical wave tank nwt for verification the length of nwt is equal to 7 3 m which is quintuple the wave length the height of nwt is equal to 0 8 m five wave gauges wgs with positions in the x direction of 1 0 l 2 0 l 3 0 l 4 0 l and 5 0 l are labeled from 1 to 5 the wave generation boundary is in the left part of the nwt and the right boundary is treated as a vertical wall to obtain a total reflection three meshes labeled i ii and iii share the same background mesh and are refined asymptotically in the vicinity of the free surface from z 0 1 m to z 0 1 m the basic parameters of the three meshes are listed in table 1 the total computation time is 30t 30 0 s the initial time step is set to 0 001 s and it is adjusted automatically according to the maximum courant number which is set to 0 5 in the present simulation the time histories of the surface elevations at wgs 1 5 are shown in fig 2 the vertical and horizontal axes represent the nondimensional surface elevations η a η surface elevation a amplitude and nondimensional time respectively from the figure we could find that the free surface elevations of different meshes are almost coincident at each specific measure position which means a convergent result is obtained in addition the nondimensional surface elevations are approximately equal to 2 0 which means stable standing waves are obtained in the nwt even for a wave with the maximum wave steepness and the wave generation boundary has the capacity to absorb secondary reflection however slight phase lags of the signal calculated from mesh i can observed at x 4 0 l and 5 0 l indicating that mesh i may be not refined enough to quantitatively describe the convergence behavior the average wave height measured at wg 5 in the time range 10t 30t is calculated and adopted for convergence analysis wg 5 is adopted for the following reasons i there should be only standing waves observed at wg 5 making the exact value of the average wave height easy to obtained i e 0 16 m and ii in the following 2d and 3d cases the front wall of the jtcb is located at the position of wg 5 the parameters and the values used for convergence analysis are listed in table 2 all the relative errors calculated by ζ i and ζ e are smaller than 5 moreover the result of p 2 and r 0 25 represent the second order monotonic convergence of the mesh compared to mesh iii mesh ii obtains an almost identical average wave height with far fewer cells therefore mesh ii is selected for the following simulations a succinct verification of the selection of the turbulence model can be performed since the appropriate grid size has been ensured based on mesh ii two cases with different turbulence closure schemes are calculated the first case is performed with laminar flow and the other can is performed with the k ω model wilcox 1988 all surface elevations are listed in fig 3 from fig 3 it is evident that results of the laminar and buoyancy modified k omega model are coincident the signal of the standard k ω model is severely polluted because of both the wave decaying problem mentioned by larsen and fuhrman 2018 and the undesirable surface elevation at the wave generation boundary brought out by it this undesirable water level is used in eq 30 at each time step and will lead to a significant cumulative error on the motion of the wave generation boundary 4 validations 4 1 porous media flow a laconic validation of porous media flow is presented in this subsection a benchmark problem of a porous dam break experiment by liu et al 1999 is adopted and reproduced the 2d nwt is 0 89 m long and 0 4 m high a porous dam whose length and height are 0 29 m and 0 4 m is placed at the center of the nwt from x 0 3 m to x 0 59 m the mean size and porosity of the porous material are 0 0159 m and 0 49 respectively a reservoir is set at the left side of the computational domain and there is a gap 0 02 m between the reservoir and the porous dam two initial water levels high d 0 355 m and low d 0 136 m are adopted there is water with a height of 0 02 m at the bottom of the nwt at the first time step both the δx and δz values are set to 0 005 m for a total of 14 240 cells the total computation time for the two cases is 2 5 s and the time step is 0 001 s the comparisons of the numerical results for the high water level and the corresponding experimental data at different time steps are listed in fig 4 a the water rushes to the dam at the beginning of the simulation then a strong impact occurs and the water accumulates to form a small upward jet on the surface of the porous dam t 0 35 s over time the water flows out from the dam and combined with the action of the reflection from the right wall of the nwt forms a vortex t 1 55 s these phenomena are observed not only in the experiment but also in the numerical simulation the comparisons of the numerical results of the low water level and the corresponding experimental data at different time steps are listed in fig 4 b most of the phenomena of the low water level are the same as those of the high water level but there are no vortices in the former the overall agreement observed in fig 4 is good which means that the porous media flow in the present model is effective 4 2 interactions between waves and a jtcb 4 2 1 setup of the experiment and simulation a short but complete enough description of the experiment is presented here since papers about this experiment are wrote and published in chinese xia 2017 the experiment was conducted in dut with a glass walled wave tank that is 56 0 m long 0 7 m wide and 1 0 m high this experiment can be regarded as an extended version of the series of experiments by li et al 2006 liu et al 2006 and liu et al 2008 and the most significant difference is the existence of the rubble mound foundation figs 5 and 6 are the dimensional drawings of the jtcb and the experiment setup respectively the thickness of the front wall which is 35 0 m from the wave paddle of the jtcb is 0 01 m the porosity of the front wall is equal to 0 2 calculated from z 0 2 m to the top of the front wall the two values of the length of the wave dissipation chamber considered in the experiment are 0 15 m and 0 3 m the porosity of all porous materials used in the experiment is 0 42 the height of the rock core in the wave dissipation chamber is 0 1 m the average diameter of the porous material is approximately 0 012 m to measure wave loads there are various pressure sensors at the outer and inner parts of the front wall the bottom and the back wall details of the positions and numbers of these sensors can be found in fig 7 the experiment is conducted with a constant water depth of 0 4 m and the wave properties adopted in both the experiment and the following simulations can be found in table 3 wave heights of 0 06 m and 0 08 m are adopted which means that the nonlinearity h d values of the input wave are 0 15 and 0 20 respectively three wave periods with values of 1 0 s 1 2 s and 1 4 s are adopted which means that the wave steepness h l varies from 0 025 to 0 055 in numerical simulations the thickness of the front wall remains unchanged and a shorter nwt is used for 2d cases the length of the nwt is set to 5 0 l l 0 where l 0 1 0 m is the extra domain for the jtcb the front wall of the jtcb is located at x 5 0 l the reflection coefficient is calculated by the two point method goda and suzuki 1976 and another three wgs separated by gaps of 0 1 l are considered in the vicinity of wg 4 to obtain an accurate reflection coefficient in other words the reflection coefficient is the average value of the six results calculated by data from two of four wgs 4 6 7 and 8 and the gap between the two selected wgs varies from 0 1 l to 0 3 l a refinement is employed near the free surface and in the vicinity of the jtcb and as mentioned in section 3 the refined cell is 0 005 m in length and 0 0025 m in height mesh ii a sketch of the nwt for 2d simulations is shown in fig 8 the total computation time is 30 0 t the initial time step is 0 001 s and it adjusted automatically according to the maximum courant number with a value of 0 5 the time range for calculating the reflection coefficient is 20 0 t 30 0 t for 3d cases mesh i is adopted and the length of the nwt decreases to 3 0 l l 0 to diminish the grid number the width of the 3d nwt is 0 7 m as the jtcb in the experiment is also approximately equal to 0 7 m in width fig 9 is the 3d schematic diagram of the nwt only cases with b 0 3 m are reproduced via 3d simulation the total computation time is 15 0 t and other setups such as the initial time step are identical to those of the 2d cases the time range for calculating the reflection coefficient is 7 0 t 15 0 t general views of the computational mesh of both the 2d and 3d nwts are shown in fig 10 to quantize the agreement between the numerical and experimental values we use the refined index of agreement given by willmott et al 2012 this index is defined as 37 d r 1 m 1 m p m o m 2 m 1 m o m o m 1 m p m o m 2 m 1 m o m o 2 m 1 m o m o m 1 m p m o m 1 m 1 m p m o m 2 m 1 m o m o where p m and o m are calculated and experimental values respectively and o is the average value of o m this index varies from 1 0 to 1 0 and a value of d r 1 0 indicates a better agreement between the calculated and experimental results 4 2 2 reflection coefficient the reflection coefficient may be one of the most important factors considered by engineers during the design of jtcbs and other coastal structures as mentioned above theoretical formulas calculating k r under many forms of the jtcb have been fully developed and can be found in the review of huang et al 2011 however empirical formulas for k r estimation are typically obtained by the curve fitting method using experimental data during this analysis process evaluations of how factors affect the result are needed in the present experiment based on the experimental data an assumption was made in which the nondimensional height of the rubble mound foundation h m l the nondimensional length of the wave dissipation chamber b l and the relative water depth d l have nonlinear effects on the reflection coefficient while the wave steepness h l and the porosity of the front wall have linear effects on the reflection coefficient such an assumption for k r calculation was adopted by meringolo et al 2015 under this assumption an empirical k r formula whose correlation coefficient is 0 867 was proposed by xia 2017 via the method of the least squares curve fitting 38 k r 0 387 h m l 2 0 078 h m l 25 017 b l 2 9 114 b l 2 223 d l 2 1 076 d l 0 099 h l 0 025 ε 0 95 the height of the rubble mound foundation is a constant value of 0 1 m in the present paper other variables remain the same as those in the previous section fig 11 lists the k r values obtained from the 2d numerical simulations the theoretical formula eq 6 the empirical formula eq 38 and the experiment eq 6 is derived under the conditions of a fully perforated front wall and without any porous media the minimum k r could be found in the vicinity of b l 0 25 and k r becomes larger as b l decreases huang et al 2011 regarding the experimental value a similar tendency can be observed and the minimum value can be found at approximately b l 0 2 that is the b l value for the minimum value of k r decreases compared to eq 6 which is identical to what has been found by liu and li 2006 the k r value calculated by eq 38 has the same tendency as the experimental ones it should be noted that the k r values calculated by eq 38 are almost same at b l 0 155 and 0 205 which means that the minimum value of k r should be observed at approximately b l 0 17 regarding the 2d simulation the minimum k r value occurs at b l 0 12 which is not identical to the experimental results to determine why this difference exists several 3d cases are conducted as mentioned above only the case whose b l value is in the range 0 12 0 21 is simulated because the 2d result seems good with b l 0 12 a comparison of the values of k r obtained from the numerical simulation and the experiment is presented in fig 12 the dashed lines represent the 10 lines which are the limits usually assumed when dealing with reflection coefficients jacobsen et al 2015 lópez et al 2018 identical to fig 11 for the result of 2d simulations there are three points far from the error lines in fig 12 most of them have been corrected when using the 3d simulation the blue vectors point from the 2d result to the 3d result while another point is observed to be overcorrected the red vector points from the 2d result to the 3d result which indicates that the uncertainty of k r evaluation for such problems is partly due to the 2d simplification in which the vertical part of the front wall has been eliminated however the structure used in 2d simulations is obtained by directly slicing the 3d structure which may be appropriate for many structures except the jtcb for example the porosity of the front wall of the jtcb is 0 2 according to fig 10 b however the porosity switches to approximately 0 3 according to fig 10 a in other words slicing the structure directly leads to an overestimation of the porosity of the perforated wall this overestimation may be critical for k r prediction because the minimum value of k r seems to be sensitive to the porosity of the front wall which can be concluded from the experiment of liu et al 2007 details of this overestimation will be discussed in section 5 in general when b l 0 12 the 2d simulation can provide a sufficient estimation of k r 4 2 3 velocity field regarding the velocity field several velocity sensors are adopted in the numerical simulation the distribution of these sensors is listed in fig 13 v 1 is located outside of the jtcb while the other four sensors are located inside the jtcb by comparing the velocity values measured at v 1 and v 2 the changes of the velocity before and after wave propagation through the perforated wall can be clearly obtained sensors v 3 v 4 and v 5 from the top to the bottom in the z direction are located at the middle of the wave dissipation chamber in the x direction and v 5 is in the region of the porous media by comparing the velocity values measured at v 3 v 4 and v 5 the time histories of the velocity field inside the wave dissipation chamber can be obtained for the 3d simulations the sensors in fig 13 are in a slice whose normal vector is 0 1 0 the reference point for slicing is 0 0 43 0 making the slice go through the middle part of the wave dissipation chamber in this subsection most analyses are conducted based on the result of 2d simulations followed by a comparison between 2d and 3d results the horizontal velocity curves measured by velocity sensors v 1 and v 2 are shown in fig 14 the vertical and horizontal axes represent the horizontal velocity and the nondimensional time respectively it is evident that the horizontal velocity measured by v 2 is smaller than that measured by v 1 this horizontal velocity reduction becomes larger and the high order harmonic appears with the decrease of b l when b l is smaller than 0 12 obvious high order harmonics can be observed because a smaller b l will result in a stronger more immediate reflection which makes the run up process on the back wall occur instantly in other words after propagating through the perforated wall the jet flow does not have enough space to propagate horizontally and it moves upward before arriving the position of v 2 this phenomenon will be further discussed in the following analysis in addition no significant phase lags are observed not even when b l 0 063 and h 0 08 m fig 15 shows the vertical velocity curves measured by velocity sensors v 1 and v 2 similar but not identical to the horizontal velocity high order harmonics appear even if b l is greater than 0 12 however when b l is greater than 0 12 the high order harmonic is stable and the curve is periodic the high order harmonics become unstable with the decrease of b l which results in curves that are not periodic it should also be indicated that the zero position for vertical velocity fluctuation is always larger than 0 for v 1 while it is approximated to 0 for v 2 if we look back to fig 14 it can be found that the zero position for the horizontal velocity fluctuation is always smaller than 0 for both v 1 and v 2 in other words at most times the velocity vector in the vicinity of the nethermost pore points to the left top i e the motion state of the fluid in the vicinity of the nethermost pore of the front wall is flowing out the horizontal velocity curves measured by v 3 v 4 and v 5 are listed in fig 16 obviously the horizontal velocity magnitude measured inside the porous media is much smaller than those measured outside the zero position for the horizontal velocity fluctuation is always larger than 0 for v 3 while it is smaller than 0 for v 4 leading to a phenomenon of separation in fig 16 this separation becomes more apparent as b l decreases this separation phenomenon means that there must be an eddy inside the wave dissipation chamber some of the fluid will flow into the porous media under the effect of this eddy and this process enhances the wave energy dissipation fig 17 shows the vertical velocity curves measured by velocity sensors v 3 v 4 and v 5 the vertical velocity magnitudes measured by v 4 and v 5 are much less than that measured by v 3 it should be noted that when b l is smaller than 0 08 the zero position for vertical velocity fluctuation is always larger than 0 for v 3 which reveals that when the wave dissipation chamber is not long enough the jet fluid will move along the right top direction and then impact the back wall directly making the run up occur immediately this tendency weakens with the increase of b l snapshots of the velocity vector and the corresponding free surface at typical instants are listed in fig 18 the left and right parts of fig 18 are drawn by data obtained when b l 0 063 and 0 126 respectively the wave height is 0 06 m based on the figure and the preceding analysis the process of wave structure interaction can be described as follows at t t 24 71 the flow out process is finishing and another wave front reaches the front wall of the jtcb an eddy can be observed inside the wave dissipation chamber and the velocity vectors in the vicinity of the nether pore of the perforated wall is oriented toward the top left which is identical to the findings of figs 14 and 15 at t t 24 93 the fluid is flowing into the jtcb and the water level inside the wave dissipation chamber starts to rise the velocity magnitude becomes larger as a result of the pressure drop forming a jet flow the velocity vectors inside the wave dissipation chamber are oriented toward the top right which is identical to the findings of figs 16 and 17 for a smaller b l the jet flow will move along the top right direction with a larger elevation angle making the run up at the back wall occur immediately at t t 25 14 for b l 0 063 the run up process is finishing and the fluid will start to flow out for b l 0 126 the run up process is still in progress a new eddy starts to form inside the wave dissipation chamber as a result of the run down at t t 25 36 the flow out process starts while the eddy keeps growing most fluid goes into the porous media before leaving the wave dissipation chamber under the effect of the eddy at t t 25 57 most fluid flows out through the pore of the perforated wall and the next wave front will come soon it is worth noting that the fluid will move toward the top right direction and run up on the back wall once it flows into the wave dissipation chamber making the interaction of waves and porous media such as the rock core occur during the process of flowing out comparisons of the 2d and 3d velocity curves are shown in fig 19 only one case is presented because comparisons of other cases are similar it is evident that the x and z directional velocity components play a dominant role and that the y directional component is an accessory of them which is logical since no oblique waves are considered in the present simulation the overall agreement of the curves in fig 19 is relatively good in terms of frequency regarding the amplitude the most obvious difference can be observed for signals measured by v 3 because v 3 is close to the free surface and the free surface in the 3d simulation is more complicated than that in the 2d one in other words this difference will decrease as the distance of the sensor from the free surface increases which is why the agreement at v 4 is better fig 20 shows snapshots of the free surface at typical instants during one wave period at t t 7 71 the flow out process is finishing and a new wave is coming from the figure it can be found that the water level inside the wave dissipation chamber is slightly higher than that outside the free surface in front of the perforated wall is very complicated due to the interaction of the fluid that flows out from different wave dissipation chambers at t t 7 93 the wave crest arrives and the flow in process starts the water level outside the wave dissipation chamber is much higher than that inside at t t 8 14 most fluid has flowed into the wave dissipation chamber and impacted the back wall causing the run up which is identical to the phenomenon of fig 18 at t t 8 43 the fluid starts to flow out from the pore on the perforated wall and the next wave is coming this figure provides an intuitive description of the wave structure interaction process and from which we could conclude that most hydrodynamic processes here are similar to what we have observed for the 2d simulation 4 2 4 wave load substantial attention has been paid to the wave load of the jtcb especially in the structure design stage it is widely accepted that the total force can be evaluated by integrating the hydrodynamic pressure measured by pressure sensors huang et al 2011 therefore getting the hydrodynamic pressure with good accuracy is critical for both experiments and numerical simulations wave loads measured by sensors in the numerical simulation and experiment which adopted both 2d and 3d cases with h 0 08 m and b l 0 126 are shown in figs 21 25 horizontal and vertical wave loads are shown in figs 21 23 and figs 24 25 respectively the horizontal axis is the nondimensional time and the vertical axis is the wave load regarding the 3d result good overall agreement can be observed among the figures and most of the values of d r are greater than 0 9 among these results the numerical data measured by sensor 10 and sensor 24 do not match the experimental data very well for sensor 10 the numerical results are smaller than the experimental results the refined index of agreement is equal to 0 761 which is not perfect but acceptable because complicated phenomena such as wave breaking occur in the wave dissipation chamber before the reflected wave reaches the inside part of the front wall for sensor 24 the amplitude of the numerical curve is similar to that of the experimental curve while the zero position is slightly different this result could be improved by refining the mesh in the region of the rubble mound foundation compared with that of the 3d result the overall agreement of the 2d result is imperfect however the result could be acceptable for preliminary design considering the calculation time required for the 2d modeling additionally most d r values are larger than 0 7 regarding section 4 2 3 no phase lags are observed indicating that the existence of the vertical part of the front wall will not considerably affect the frequency of the wave load only relatively small high order contributions are observed causing a slightly different tendency of the amplitude of the 2d result if we record the moment that the peak pressure occurs in one wave period the order and duration of the wave structure interaction will be approximated taking the curve in the nondimensional time range 10 0 11 0 as an example in the first stage the wave crest impacts the outside of the front wall t t 10 0 fig 21 simultaneously the vertical load on the outside of the bottom reaches the peak value fig 25 in the second stage the wave crest passes through the front wall and impacts the back wall t t 10 25 fig 23 subsequently the vertical load on the inside part of the bottom reaches the peak value t t 10 25 fig 24 in the last stage the reflected wave crest moves backward and impacts the inside of the front wall and then it flows out from the wave dissipation chamber t t 10 40 all peak values of the impacted pressure occur during the first half of the wave period followed by a sustained flow out process the values of d r calculated from the experimental and numerical data are collected in fig 26 some sensors have been eliminated because no pressure is measured by them during the experiment from this figure we can find that the overall agreement is relative good compared to the 2d result obvious improvements can be observed for the 3d result most values of d r fluctuate in the vicinity of 0 81 and 0 92 for the 2d and 3d simulations respectively for 2d simulations the d r values at sensors 10 23 and 24 are not good enough for sensors 23 and 24 the d r values of the 3d simulations increase a lot mainly due to the lack of y directional contributions for sensor 10 some values are still not good enough although the values have increased under 3d simulation possibly due to the complexity of such problems at the free surface as mentioned above before reaching the inside of the front wall the wave crest undergoes a complicated process including flowing in through the perforated wall running up and being reflected by the back wall during this process a complicated free surface can be observed inside the wave dissipation chamber which causes difficulties for free surface capture 5 discussion from the preceding figure it can be found that the height of the front wall openings is equal to 0 037 m which remains unchanged in the 2d simulation as mentioned in section 4 2 2 slicing the 3d structure in this way will result in an overestimation of the porosity of the front wall because the vertical part of the perforated wall has been ignored furthermore k r appears to be sensitive to porosity especially when b l is in 0 12 0 21 therefore the effect of this overestimation on the numerical result is investigated in this section to sustain an identical front wall porosity the height of the pore of the 2d perforated wall needs to decrease in the following simulations a value of 0 025 m is adopted instead of 0 037 m which makes the porosity 0 2 this approximation still ignores the vertical part of the front wall hereafter the newly added 2d simulation is called the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation and the simulation without modifications is called the conventional 2d numerical simulation a comparison of k r obtained from the conventional 2d numerical simulation the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation the 3d numerical simulation and the experiment is shown in fig 27 from the figure it could be found that when b l 0 12 or b l 0 2 the values of k r obtained from the porosity equivalent numerical simulation are closed to but slightly smaller than those obtained from other approaches the value of b l for the minimum k r is 0 155 when the porosity equivalent structure is adopted this b l value is larger than that obtained from the conventional 2d simulation but identical to that obtained from 3d simulation this phenomenon indicates that the change tendency of k r is highly related to the porosity of the front wall when 0 12 b l 0 2 the porosity equivalent 2d structure could improve the result of the conventional 2d simulation a comparison of the k r values obtained from numerical simulations and the experiment is shown in fig 28 from the figure it can be found that the overall agreement of the conventional 2d simulation is better than that of the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation at most points however with respect to the distribution of the points it is obvious that the points calculated from the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation are more orderly distributed around a line parallel to y x the points calculated from the conventional 2d numerical simulation are disordered therefore in the present study it is logical for us to find that most differences 10 of 12 between the k r calculated from the conventional 2d numerical simulation and the experiment are approximately equal to 0 1 these almost consistent differences could be regarded as the effect of the vertical part of the front wall or the y directional contributions of the fluid fluid interaction making the numerical result smaller than the experimental one the values of d r calculated from the experimental and porosity equivalent 2d numerical data are collected in fig 29 compared to fig 26 significant improvements can be observed although the values at sensors 10 23 and 24 are still not good enough most values of d r fluctuate around 0 9 which is larger than the fluctuation point of 0 81 in fig 26 this overall improvement reveals that adopting the representative porosity of the structure helps obtain a better result that is more consistent with the experimental and 3d results 6 conclusions in this work a numerical toolbox based on openfoam is set up and used for the rans modeling of wave structure interactions of the jtcb the accuracy and effectiveness of the modules in this toolbox are verified in section 3 using a porosity dam break experiment and a total reflection numerical test then this numerical model is used to simulate an experiment carried out in dut in which a rock filled jtcb located on a trapezoidal rubble mound foundation was considered both 2d and 3d cases are simulated and the reflection coefficient velocity field and wave load are analyzed in detail the refined index of agreement is adopted to quantize the agreement between the numerical and experimental results good overall agreement has been obtained in the present paper the effect of 2d simplification is discussed via simulation with the modified 2d structures the main conclusions are listed as follows regarding the reflection coefficient it can be found that the k r value calculated by the conventional 2d numerical simulation does not match the experimental values very well therefore 3d numerical simulations are conducted for the sake of comparisons and good agreement between the experimental and 3d numerical results is observed the b l value calculated via conventional 2d numerical simulation when the minimum k r value occurs is different from that calculated from both the 3d numerical simulation and the experiment this phenomenon is partly due to the elimination of the vertical part of the front wall and partly due to the overestimation of the porosity of the front wall during conventional 2d simplification regarding the velocity field several numerical velocity sensors are adopted to give a clear description it has been observed that the velocity of the fluid will increase once propagating through the perforated wall due to the pressure drop after propagation through the perforated wall the flow will not move straight forward as a result of the back wall it will move toward the right top direction causing the run up an eddy is formed and keeps growing during this process part of the fluid will flow into the porous media inside the wave dissipation chamber under the effect of the eddy the velocity magnitude inside the porous media is very small which means it is effective for energy dissipation the 3d simulations provide an intuitive description on the interaction process while most 3d phenomena remain similar to those of the 2d simulation regarding the wave load both the 3d and 2d results are compared with the experimental data the moment at which the peak pressure occurs is recorded and used to evaluate the order and duration of the wave structure interaction it has been found that the peak values of the impacted pressure occur during the first half of the wave period followed by a sustained flow out process the d r value provides a quantitative description of the agreement between the numerical and experimental values as expected compared to the conventional 2d result the result calculated from 3d cases matches the experimental result better due to the lack of the vertical part of the front wall and y directional contributions the conventional 2d result is imperfect but acceptable for preliminary design if considering the lower simulation time required to improve the performance of 2d simulation a modified method for slicing the 3d structure is presented an identical porosity of the perforated front wall in the 2d cases is adopted which means that the height of the pore should be diminished during the 2d simplification of the structure a similar k r variety tendency that is identical to both the 3d numerical simulation and the experiment can be obtained with the porosity equivalent 2d structure regarding k r almost constant differences between the porosity equivalent 2d simulation and the experiment are observed this phenomenon can be regarded as the effect of the vertical part of the front wall or the y directional contributions which is inevitable for 2d simulations however significant improvements are also obtained in terms of wave load most values of d r of the wave load fluctuate around 0 9 when using porosity equivalent 2d structures which is an improvement compared to that calculated from the conventional 2d simulation therefore keeping the porosity unchanged during 2d simplification is recommended for numerical simulations of such perforated structures acknowledgements the study is supported by the nsfc shandong joint fund project u1706226 and the national natural science foundation of china 51779236

22552,in this study a wave generation boundary capable of absorbing secondary reflections is embedded in an openfoam based numerical toolbox to model the wave structure interactions of a jarlan type caisson breakwater jtcb numerical simulations of wave structure interactions of a jtcb have been compared to experimental data where the reflection coefficient the velocity field and the wave load of the jtcb are analyzed in detail it has been found that conventional two dimensional 2d simulation will underestimate the reflection coefficient especially when the value of the nondimensional wave dissipation chamber length is in the range 0 12 0 21 this underestimation of the reflection coefficient could be related to an overestimation of the porosity of the perforated wall considered in conventional 2d structure simplifications a porosity equivalent 2d structure whose porosity is the same as that of the three dimensional 3d structure is presented and shown to effectively avoid this problem in addition in terms of wave loads the agreement between the 2d simulation and the experiment has also been improved significantly using the porosity equivalent 2d structure additionally the interaction process including the run up on the back wall and the eddy formation process is described via the changes of the velocity field and the free surface relatively good overall agreement between the calculated values and the experimental values is observed indicating that this toolbox is useful and efficient for simulating wave structure interactions of this kind this study is expected to be useful to engineers concerned with the numerical modeling preliminary feasibility assessment and conceptual design of jtcbs keywords jarlan type caisson reflection coefficient velocity field wave load 2d simplification 1 introduction breakwaters are mainly used to protect harbor facilities and provide a calm basin for ships by reducing wave induced disturbances conventional vertical breakwaters which provide excellent shelter contain a traditional caisson on a rubble mound foundation however a large deadweight is needed for the stability of this conventional structure which can make a vertical breakwater an infeasible option due to economic or technical constraints moreover a conventional vertical breakwater results in a strong wave reflection which negatively impacts the safety of facilities and ships under these conditions jarlan 1961 proposed the basic concept of a perforated caisson breakwater which consists of a perforated front wall and a solid back wall separated by a wave dissipation chamber such perforated structures effectively reduce wave reflection and horizontal wave forces and help reduce the scour of the seabed in front of the breakwater liu and li 2011 since jarlan s proposal several researchers have introduced modifications to this type of perforated structure to improve the hydrodynamic performance of the jarlan type caisson breakwater jtcb elbisy 2017 physical modeling is a valuable and reliable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of the jtcb and many studies have been conducted with this type of modeling garrido and medina 2012 liu et al 2015 however because experimental studies are often expensive and time consuming the hydrodynamic parameters of structures such as reflection and transmission coefficient values are characterized for only a limited number of wave conditions and setups as a result multiple analytical solutions have been developed and successfully validated with experimental data most existing mathematical models are based on the potential theory which ignores the viscosity of the fluid the most significant part of the derivation step for perforated structures is handling the nonlinear condition of the perforated front wall generally flows are turbulent in regions close to the gaps of the perforated wall and the energy dissipation as well as the phase shift of wave motions can be represented by either linear or quadratic pressure drop conditions liu and li 2017 as mentioned above one widely used method of modeling the perforated front wall is the use of a porous effect parameter g yu 1995 i e the perforated wall is treated as a thin porous wall g is an empirical complex coefficient expressed as follows 1 g ε k δ f i s where δ is the thickness of the perforated front wall ε is the porosity of the front wall i 1 f is the linear resistance coefficient and s is the inertia coefficient which is related to the added mass coefficient c m sollitt and cross 1972 2 s 1 c m 1 ε ε the resistance coefficient f arises from a linearization of the velocity squared term associated with the head loss across the perforated wall and the evaluation of f requires an iterative procedure zhu and zhu 2010 however for problems of interactions between waves and perforated walls this iteration is not feasible which means that f is always calculated by the least squares method based on a series of model tests li et al 2006 in recent research liu and li 2016 indicated that the resistance coefficient f is mainly dependent on the keulegan carpenter kc number which is expressed as 3 k c j u t δ h l 2 d δ where u is the depth averaged value of the amplitude of the horizontal fluid velocity for the incident wave t h and l are the period height length of the incident wave respectively and d is the still water depth then the resistance coefficient f can be obtained by liu and li 2016 4 f 0 989 k c j 0 746 re j 150 2000 0 270 k c j 0 957 re j 0 6 1 8 10 5 where re j is the reynolds number for this kind of problem defined as 5 re j u δ ν h l δ 2 ν d t where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid for the inertia coefficient s under the condition of a thin perforated wall it is suitable to set the value of c m 0 rather than to 0 34 van gent 1995 which means s 1 once the porous effect parameter g has been calculated the reflection coefficient k r of a fully perforated jtcb can be defined as sahoo et al 2000 6 k r 1 g 1 i cot k b 1 g 1 i cot k b where k is the wave number and b is the wave dissipation length eq 6 is widely accepted and could provide a relatively good prediction for k r if there is a rubble mound in the wave dissipation chamber the situation becomes complicated because of the existence of evanescent waves the analytical solution of this problem can be obtained by the matching eigenfunction expansion method which is slightly complicated but feasible according to the results of isaacson et al 2000 liu et al 2007 and liu and faraci 2014 in general the analytical solutions of the jtcb has been fully developed and details of these solutions can be found in the review of huang et al 2011 however as the situation becomes complicated the analytical solution will also become complicated and it may not be possible to explicitly obtain the solution furthermore most theory analysis methods are derived under the condition of a 2d axis which neglects some 3d effects to disappear for example in the following analysis it could be observed that some values of k r calculated from the 2d cases are much smaller than those obtained by 3d cases and the existence of the vertical part of the front wall which is ignored in 2d models does affect critical parameters such as k r in fact the theoretical solution method is frequently used to provide a preliminary evaluation on the reflection performance of the jtcb in practical engineering such a method lacks the capacity for detailed description which provides a chance for the application of numerical models based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations rans equations keep the viscous item in the momentum equation and are suitable for simulating complex hydrodynamic phenomena in the field of coastal engineering one of the greatest advantages of numerical models based on rans equations is its intrinsic ability to capture the velocity and pressure fields in detail which especially in combination with physical scale model tests provides engineers with a clear understanding of the nature of the problem in the present study a numerical toolbox was developed to simulate interactions between waves and a jtcb considering the complex phenomenon of this type of problem and the advantages of the rans model this numerical model based on the open source cfd toolbox openfoam solves the problem of a two phase incompressible viscous fluid and the vof scheme hirt and nichols 1981 is employed to capture the free surface to investigate the processes of wave propagation through a perforated wall and energy dissipation a rock filled jtcb located on a trapezoidal rubble mound foundation was selected for simulation and the result is compared with both experimental data conducted at dalian university of technology dut xia 2017 and the analytical solution mentioned above several hydrodynamic processes have been analyzed and some recommendations are proposed the paper is organized as follows the numerical model is described in section 2 including the procedure of determining parameters section 3 consists of the verification of the numerical model comparisons between the experimental and numerical results as well as a detailed analysis of such problems are explored in section 4 further discussions are provided in section 5 the conclusions obtained in the present study are discussed in section 6 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equation 2 1 1 governing equations of the wave field the governing equations of the wave field are a

the governing equations are the volume averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes varans equations which contain the effect of porosity the volume average is adopted to variables of the rans equations eqs 7 9 and the new term brought by this operation is modeled by the drag force of the porous media these kinds of equations have been studied in detail for the past three decades and there are numerous publications on the topic del jesus et al 2012 higuera et al 2014a 2014b jacobsen et al 2015 jensen et al 2014a liu et al 1999 losada et al 2016 gave a comprehensive review of the modeling of water waves with porous coastal structures although there are still some fundamental problems that need to be solved relatively good results of such modeling methods could be obtained using the varans equations like the rans equations the varans equations for static porous media consist of the conservation of mass conservation of momentum and vof function advection equations higuera 2015 14 u 0 15

the present model kc p is the kc number for porous media flow which similar to eq 3 is defined as follows 22 k c p t o u m d 50 ϕ where t o is the oscillatory period and u m is the maximum oscillatory

other values such as 0 0 can be set for c m jensen et al 2014b comparing the standard rans equations and the varans equations mentioned above it can be concluded that i the two mass conservation equations are identical indicating that during the solving procedure no modifications are needed for the pressure equation and ii the major difference between the two coefficient matrices of velocity is a factor with a value of 1 ϕ which can also be said of the vof equations in openfoam with respect to the momentum equation this factor can be added to the velocity coefficient matrix explicitly higuera et al 2014a or through the built in member function addresistance of the porositymodel class jacobsen et al 2015 for the vof function this factor is added by modifying the solving function of the mules jasak 1996 algorithm i e explicitsolve 2 2 boundary conditions two kinds of boundary conditions are adopted during the simulation i the no slip condition for both the fixed jtcb and the other boundaries in the computational domain i e the condition for smooth solid walls and ii the wave generation boundary at the left side of the computational domain in this study a moving wall method which has been widely used in wave generation research kuai et al 2018 wu and hsiao 2018 is adopted for wave generation in the linear theory for a piston wave maker for monochromatic waves there is a linear relationship between the wave height and the stroke of the paddle 24 h s h s 4 sinh 2 k d 2 k d sinh 2 k d where hs is this linear relationship and s is the stroke of the wave maker based on this linear theory madsen 1971 presented the second order theory for regular wave generation with a surface elevation of 25 η x t h 2 cos k x ω t k h 2 16 2 cosh 2 k d cosh k d sinh 3 k d cos 2 k x ω t the movement of the wave paddle could be expressed as 26 x t s 2 sin ω t h 4 d n 1 3 4 sinh 2 k d n 1 2 sin ω t 27 n 1 1 2 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d as a result of the wave maker secondary reflection that occurs at the wave paddle is a major problem in both physical model tests and numerical simulations schaffer and klopman 2000 lengthening or widening the wave flume is one widely used traditional way to reduce the influence of secondary reflection however in a numerical model this traditional approach may result in a large number of calculations therefore the active absorption capability of secondary reflection is often required to provide better results at lower costs in the present model when generating waves additional motions are embedded into the wave generation boundary to absorb the secondary reflection waves impinging on it if u corr denotes the correct velocity of the active absorbing wave paddle the corresponding displacement in every time step δt is 28 x c o r r u c o r r δ t the sum of these displacements constitutes the final correction of the active absorbing wave maker thus the final displacement of the active absorbing wave paddle is the superposition of the normal displacement and the correction part wang et al 2018 29 x c o r r t x t u c o r r d t with 30 u c o r r ω h s η m η 0 ω is the circular frequency η m and η 0 in eq 30 are the measured and theoretical surface elevations at the wave paddle respectively which are updated each time step 2 3 turbulence closure a brief discussion of the turbulence closure of such problems is presented in this subsection it is widely accepted that the turbulence level could be quantified by the reynolds number therefore the reynolds number of such problems should be estimated before simulation regarding the interaction between waves and a jtcb the reynolds number re j and kc number kc j could be calculated by eq 5 and eq 3 respectively the thickness of the front wall of the jtcb adopted in the present study is 0 01 m thus the values of re j and kc j vary from 1095 to 1707 and from 10 95 to 23 9 regarding the interaction between waves and porous media the pore reynolds number dybbs and edwards 1984 can be defined as 31 re p u d 50 ϕ ν h l d 50 2 ϕ ν d t similarly according to eq 22 the kc number can be calculated as 32 k c p t o u m d 50 ϕ t u d 50 ϕ h l 2 d d 50 ϕ note that the pore reynolds number and the kc number are calculated via the depth averaged value of the amplitude of the horizontal fluid velocity of the incident wave and the oscillation velocity used in eq 32 is represented by the wave period as proposed by losada et al 2008 an alternative approach for kc p calculation that is derived from the shallow water theory which can be found in jacobsen et al 2015 values calculated from the present approach and the alternative approach are of the same order of magnitude in fact for wave problems the value of kc p will not cause significant differences as it is always much greater than 7 5 and located in the denominator position of eq 23 additionally the effect of kc p can be incorporated into the value of β 1 making it a matter of coefficient differences which may be the reason why kc p is missing in some publications hsu et al 2002 wu and hsiao 2013 the values of re p and kc p in the present study vary from 3128 to 4877 and from 21 72 to 47 42 according to burcharth and andersen 1995 when re p 300 a highly unsteady and chaotic i e fully turbulent flow regime has developed we find that for wave related problems the pore reynolds number is always greater than 300 the high reynolds numbers indicate that turbulence modeling is needed for such problems however for surface waves several widely used turbulence models have a tendency to severely overestimate turbulence levels which leads to excessive wave damping during wave propagations larsen and fuhrman 2018 therefore the turbulence model adopted in the present study is the recently presented buoyancy modified k omega model which could result in stable wave propagation without significant wave damping over the length of the wave flume devolder et al 2017 2018 detailed discussions can be found in section 3 3 verifications the sensitivity to the mesh refinement of the present model the selection of turbulence models and the active absorption capacity of the wave generation boundary are investigated in this section according to eça and hoekstra 2014 for cfd simulations of simple problems the discretization error ε ζ could be estimated by power series expansions 33 ε ζ ζ i ζ 0 q h i p ζ i represents any integral or other function of a local flow quantity ζ 0 is an estimation of the exact value q is a constant that needs to be determined h i is the typical grid size and p is the order of mesh convergence at least three meshes are required to calculate the three unknown variables in eq 33 when using this power series expansions method two assumptions should be satisfied i the three meshes must be asymptotic to guarantee that the leading term of power series expansion can sufficiently estimate the error and ii a single parameter h i can sufficiently describe the mesh satisfying these assumptions requires the grids to be geometrically similar i e the grid refinement ratio the ratio between the length and the height of a cell should be constant for different grids with all conditions satisfied the convergence of the meshes can also be estimated by the discriminating ratio roache 2009 34 r ζ r ζ m ζ m ζ c where the subscripts r m and c represent the refined medium and coarse mesh respectively substituting eq 33 into eq 34 we get 35 r h r h m p 1 h m h r p 1 h c h m p with the second assumption mentioned above i e h r h m h m h c eq 35 can be simplified to 36 log r p log h r h m it should be noted that only the discretization error estimation is adopted to investigate the mesh refinement sensitivity this is because i the present numerical model is mass conserved as a result of adopting the moving wall wave generation method and no wave damping terms ii all the grids share a similar rectangular shape identical aspect ratio without complex geometries these two reasons make the cases sufficient to use this estimation method according to the experiment which will be further discussed six wave conditions are selected and reproduced in the present simulation among these wave conditions the one with the largest wave steepness i e that with a 0 08 m wave height 1 0 s wave period and 0 4 m water depth is selected for verification fig 1 shows a sketch of the numerical wave tank nwt for verification the length of nwt is equal to 7 3 m which is quintuple the wave length the height of nwt is equal to 0 8 m five wave gauges wgs with positions in the x direction of 1 0 l 2 0 l 3 0 l 4 0 l and 5 0 l are labeled from 1 to 5 the wave generation boundary is in the left part of the nwt and the right boundary is treated as a vertical wall to obtain a total reflection three meshes labeled i ii and iii share the same background mesh and are refined asymptotically in the vicinity of the free surface from z 0 1 m to z 0 1 m the basic parameters of the three meshes are listed in table 1 the total computation time is 30t 30 0 s the initial time step is set to 0 001 s and it is adjusted automatically according to the maximum courant number which is set to 0 5 in the present simulation the time histories of the surface elevations at wgs 1 5 are shown in fig 2 the vertical and horizontal axes represent the nondimensional surface elevations η a η surface elevation a amplitude and nondimensional time respectively from the figure we could find that the free surface elevations of different meshes are almost coincident at each specific measure position which means a convergent result is obtained in addition the nondimensional surface elevations are approximately equal to 2 0 which means stable standing waves are obtained in the nwt even for a wave with the maximum wave steepness and the wave generation boundary has the capacity to absorb secondary reflection however slight phase lags of the signal calculated from mesh i can observed at x 4 0 l and 5 0 l indicating that mesh i may be not refined enough to quantitatively describe the convergence behavior the average wave height measured at wg 5 in the time range 10t 30t is calculated and adopted for convergence analysis wg 5 is adopted for the following reasons i there should be only standing waves observed at wg 5 making the exact value of the average wave height easy to obtained i e 0 16 m and ii in the following 2d and 3d cases the front wall of the jtcb is located at the position of wg 5 the parameters and the values used for convergence analysis are listed in table 2 all the relative errors calculated by ζ i and ζ e are smaller than 5 moreover the result of p 2 and r 0 25 represent the second order monotonic convergence of the mesh compared to mesh iii mesh ii obtains an almost identical average wave height with far fewer cells therefore mesh ii is selected for the following simulations a succinct verification of the selection of the turbulence model can be performed since the appropriate grid size has been ensured based on mesh ii two cases with different turbulence closure schemes are calculated the first case is performed with laminar flow and the other can is performed with the k ω model wilcox 1988 all surface elevations are listed in fig 3 from fig 3 it is evident that results of the laminar and buoyancy modified k omega model are coincident the signal of the standard k ω model is severely polluted because of both the wave decaying problem mentioned by larsen and fuhrman 2018 and the undesirable surface elevation at the wave generation boundary brought out by it this undesirable water level is used in eq 30 at each time step and will lead to a significant cumulative error on the motion of the wave generation boundary 4 validations 4 1 porous media flow a laconic validation of porous media flow is presented in this subsection a benchmark problem of a porous dam break experiment by liu et al 1999 is adopted and reproduced the 2d nwt is 0 89 m long and 0 4 m high a porous dam whose length and height are 0 29 m and 0 4 m is placed at the center of the nwt from x 0 3 m to x 0 59 m the mean size and porosity of the porous material are 0 0159 m and 0 49 respectively a reservoir is set at the left side of the computational domain and there is a gap 0 02 m between the reservoir and the porous dam two initial water levels high d 0 355 m and low d 0 136 m are adopted there is water with a height of 0 02 m at the bottom of the nwt at the first time step both the δx and δz values are set to 0 005 m for a total of 14 240 cells the total computation time for the two cases is 2 5 s and the time step is 0 001 s the comparisons of the numerical results for the high water level and the corresponding experimental data at different time steps are listed in fig 4 a the water rushes to the dam at the beginning of the simulation then a strong impact occurs and the water accumulates to form a small upward jet on the surface of the porous dam t 0 35 s over time the water flows out from the dam and combined with the action of the reflection from the right wall of the nwt forms a vortex t 1 55 s these phenomena are observed not only in the experiment but also in the numerical simulation the comparisons of the numerical results of the low water level and the corresponding experimental data at different time steps are listed in fig 4 b most of the phenomena of the low water level are the same as those of the high water level but there are no vortices in the former the overall agreement observed in fig 4 is good which means that the porous media flow in the present model is effective 4 2 interactions between waves and a jtcb 4 2 1 setup of the experiment and simulation a short but complete enough description of the experiment is presented here since papers about this experiment are wrote and published in chinese xia 2017 the experiment was conducted in dut with a glass walled wave tank that is 56 0 m long 0 7 m wide and 1 0 m high this experiment can be regarded as an extended version of the series of experiments by li et al 2006 liu et al 2006 and liu et al 2008 and the most significant difference is the existence of the rubble mound foundation figs 5 and 6 are the dimensional drawings of the jtcb and the experiment setup respectively the thickness of the front wall which is 35 0 m from the wave paddle of the jtcb is 0 01 m the porosity of the front wall is equal to 0 2 calculated from z 0 2 m to the top of the front wall the two values of the length of the wave dissipation chamber considered in the experiment are 0 15 m and 0 3 m the porosity of all porous materials used in the experiment is 0 42 the height of the rock core in the wave dissipation chamber is 0 1 m the average diameter of the porous material is approximately 0 012 m to measure wave loads there are various pressure sensors at the outer and inner parts of the front wall the bottom and the back wall details of the positions and numbers of these sensors can be found in fig 7 the experiment is conducted with a constant water depth of 0 4 m and the wave properties adopted in both the experiment and the following simulations can be found in table 3 wave heights of 0 06 m and 0 08 m are adopted which means that the nonlinearity h d values of the input wave are 0 15 and 0 20 respectively three wave periods with values of 1 0 s 1 2 s and 1 4 s are adopted which means that the wave steepness h l varies from 0 025 to 0 055 in numerical simulations the thickness of the front wall remains unchanged and a shorter nwt is used for 2d cases the length of the nwt is set to 5 0 l l 0 where l 0 1 0 m is the extra domain for the jtcb the front wall of the jtcb is located at x 5 0 l the reflection coefficient is calculated by the two point method goda and suzuki 1976 and another three wgs separated by gaps of 0 1 l are considered in the vicinity of wg 4 to obtain an accurate reflection coefficient in other words the reflection coefficient is the average value of the six results calculated by data from two of four wgs 4 6 7 and 8 and the gap between the two selected wgs varies from 0 1 l to 0 3 l a refinement is employed near the free surface and in the vicinity of the jtcb and as mentioned in section 3 the refined cell is 0 005 m in length and 0 0025 m in height mesh ii a sketch of the nwt for 2d simulations is shown in fig 8 the total computation time is 30 0 t the initial time step is 0 001 s and it adjusted automatically according to the maximum courant number with a value of 0 5 the time range for calculating the reflection coefficient is 20 0 t 30 0 t for 3d cases mesh i is adopted and the length of the nwt decreases to 3 0 l l 0 to diminish the grid number the width of the 3d nwt is 0 7 m as the jtcb in the experiment is also approximately equal to 0 7 m in width fig 9 is the 3d schematic diagram of the nwt only cases with b 0 3 m are reproduced via 3d simulation the total computation time is 15 0 t and other setups such as the initial time step are identical to those of the 2d cases the time range for calculating the reflection coefficient is 7 0 t 15 0 t general views of the computational mesh of both the 2d and 3d nwts are shown in fig 10 to quantize the agreement between the numerical and experimental values we use the refined index of agreement given by willmott et al 2012 this index is defined as 37 d r 1 m 1 m p m o m 2 m 1 m o m o m 1 m p m o m 2 m 1 m o m o 2 m 1 m o m o m 1 m p m o m 1 m 1 m p m o m 2 m 1 m o m o where p m and o m are calculated and experimental values respectively and o is the average value of o m this index varies from 1 0 to 1 0 and a value of d r 1 0 indicates a better agreement between the calculated and experimental results 4 2 2 reflection coefficient the reflection coefficient may be one of the most important factors considered by engineers during the design of jtcbs and other coastal structures as mentioned above theoretical formulas calculating k r under many forms of the jtcb have been fully developed and can be found in the review of huang et al 2011 however empirical formulas for k r estimation are typically obtained by the curve fitting method using experimental data during this analysis process evaluations of how factors affect the result are needed in the present experiment based on the experimental data an assumption was made in which the nondimensional height of the rubble mound foundation h m l the nondimensional length of the wave dissipation chamber b l and the relative water depth d l have nonlinear effects on the reflection coefficient while the wave steepness h l and the porosity of the front wall have linear effects on the reflection coefficient such an assumption for k r calculation was adopted by meringolo et al 2015 under this assumption an empirical k r formula whose correlation coefficient is 0 867 was proposed by xia 2017 via the method of the least squares curve fitting 38 k r 0 387 h m l 2 0 078 h m l 25 017 b l 2 9 114 b l 2 223 d l 2 1 076 d l 0 099 h l 0 025 ε 0 95 the height of the rubble mound foundation is a constant value of 0 1 m in the present paper other variables remain the same as those in the previous section fig 11 lists the k r values obtained from the 2d numerical simulations the theoretical formula eq 6 the empirical formula eq 38 and the experiment eq 6 is derived under the conditions of a fully perforated front wall and without any porous media the minimum k r could be found in the vicinity of b l 0 25 and k r becomes larger as b l decreases huang et al 2011 regarding the experimental value a similar tendency can be observed and the minimum value can be found at approximately b l 0 2 that is the b l value for the minimum value of k r decreases compared to eq 6 which is identical to what has been found by liu and li 2006 the k r value calculated by eq 38 has the same tendency as the experimental ones it should be noted that the k r values calculated by eq 38 are almost same at b l 0 155 and 0 205 which means that the minimum value of k r should be observed at approximately b l 0 17 regarding the 2d simulation the minimum k r value occurs at b l 0 12 which is not identical to the experimental results to determine why this difference exists several 3d cases are conducted as mentioned above only the case whose b l value is in the range 0 12 0 21 is simulated because the 2d result seems good with b l 0 12 a comparison of the values of k r obtained from the numerical simulation and the experiment is presented in fig 12 the dashed lines represent the 10 lines which are the limits usually assumed when dealing with reflection coefficients jacobsen et al 2015 lópez et al 2018 identical to fig 11 for the result of 2d simulations there are three points far from the error lines in fig 12 most of them have been corrected when using the 3d simulation the blue vectors point from the 2d result to the 3d result while another point is observed to be overcorrected the red vector points from the 2d result to the 3d result which indicates that the uncertainty of k r evaluation for such problems is partly due to the 2d simplification in which the vertical part of the front wall has been eliminated however the structure used in 2d simulations is obtained by directly slicing the 3d structure which may be appropriate for many structures except the jtcb for example the porosity of the front wall of the jtcb is 0 2 according to fig 10 b however the porosity switches to approximately 0 3 according to fig 10 a in other words slicing the structure directly leads to an overestimation of the porosity of the perforated wall this overestimation may be critical for k r prediction because the minimum value of k r seems to be sensitive to the porosity of the front wall which can be concluded from the experiment of liu et al 2007 details of this overestimation will be discussed in section 5 in general when b l 0 12 the 2d simulation can provide a sufficient estimation of k r 4 2 3 velocity field regarding the velocity field several velocity sensors are adopted in the numerical simulation the distribution of these sensors is listed in fig 13 v 1 is located outside of the jtcb while the other four sensors are located inside the jtcb by comparing the velocity values measured at v 1 and v 2 the changes of the velocity before and after wave propagation through the perforated wall can be clearly obtained sensors v 3 v 4 and v 5 from the top to the bottom in the z direction are located at the middle of the wave dissipation chamber in the x direction and v 5 is in the region of the porous media by comparing the velocity values measured at v 3 v 4 and v 5 the time histories of the velocity field inside the wave dissipation chamber can be obtained for the 3d simulations the sensors in fig 13 are in a slice whose normal vector is 0 1 0 the reference point for slicing is 0 0 43 0 making the slice go through the middle part of the wave dissipation chamber in this subsection most analyses are conducted based on the result of 2d simulations followed by a comparison between 2d and 3d results the horizontal velocity curves measured by velocity sensors v 1 and v 2 are shown in fig 14 the vertical and horizontal axes represent the horizontal velocity and the nondimensional time respectively it is evident that the horizontal velocity measured by v 2 is smaller than that measured by v 1 this horizontal velocity reduction becomes larger and the high order harmonic appears with the decrease of b l when b l is smaller than 0 12 obvious high order harmonics can be observed because a smaller b l will result in a stronger more immediate reflection which makes the run up process on the back wall occur instantly in other words after propagating through the perforated wall the jet flow does not have enough space to propagate horizontally and it moves upward before arriving the position of v 2 this phenomenon will be further discussed in the following analysis in addition no significant phase lags are observed not even when b l 0 063 and h 0 08 m fig 15 shows the vertical velocity curves measured by velocity sensors v 1 and v 2 similar but not identical to the horizontal velocity high order harmonics appear even if b l is greater than 0 12 however when b l is greater than 0 12 the high order harmonic is stable and the curve is periodic the high order harmonics become unstable with the decrease of b l which results in curves that are not periodic it should also be indicated that the zero position for vertical velocity fluctuation is always larger than 0 for v 1 while it is approximated to 0 for v 2 if we look back to fig 14 it can be found that the zero position for the horizontal velocity fluctuation is always smaller than 0 for both v 1 and v 2 in other words at most times the velocity vector in the vicinity of the nethermost pore points to the left top i e the motion state of the fluid in the vicinity of the nethermost pore of the front wall is flowing out the horizontal velocity curves measured by v 3 v 4 and v 5 are listed in fig 16 obviously the horizontal velocity magnitude measured inside the porous media is much smaller than those measured outside the zero position for the horizontal velocity fluctuation is always larger than 0 for v 3 while it is smaller than 0 for v 4 leading to a phenomenon of separation in fig 16 this separation becomes more apparent as b l decreases this separation phenomenon means that there must be an eddy inside the wave dissipation chamber some of the fluid will flow into the porous media under the effect of this eddy and this process enhances the wave energy dissipation fig 17 shows the vertical velocity curves measured by velocity sensors v 3 v 4 and v 5 the vertical velocity magnitudes measured by v 4 and v 5 are much less than that measured by v 3 it should be noted that when b l is smaller than 0 08 the zero position for vertical velocity fluctuation is always larger than 0 for v 3 which reveals that when the wave dissipation chamber is not long enough the jet fluid will move along the right top direction and then impact the back wall directly making the run up occur immediately this tendency weakens with the increase of b l snapshots of the velocity vector and the corresponding free surface at typical instants are listed in fig 18 the left and right parts of fig 18 are drawn by data obtained when b l 0 063 and 0 126 respectively the wave height is 0 06 m based on the figure and the preceding analysis the process of wave structure interaction can be described as follows at t t 24 71 the flow out process is finishing and another wave front reaches the front wall of the jtcb an eddy can be observed inside the wave dissipation chamber and the velocity vectors in the vicinity of the nether pore of the perforated wall is oriented toward the top left which is identical to the findings of figs 14 and 15 at t t 24 93 the fluid is flowing into the jtcb and the water level inside the wave dissipation chamber starts to rise the velocity magnitude becomes larger as a result of the pressure drop forming a jet flow the velocity vectors inside the wave dissipation chamber are oriented toward the top right which is identical to the findings of figs 16 and 17 for a smaller b l the jet flow will move along the top right direction with a larger elevation angle making the run up at the back wall occur immediately at t t 25 14 for b l 0 063 the run up process is finishing and the fluid will start to flow out for b l 0 126 the run up process is still in progress a new eddy starts to form inside the wave dissipation chamber as a result of the run down at t t 25 36 the flow out process starts while the eddy keeps growing most fluid goes into the porous media before leaving the wave dissipation chamber under the effect of the eddy at t t 25 57 most fluid flows out through the pore of the perforated wall and the next wave front will come soon it is worth noting that the fluid will move toward the top right direction and run up on the back wall once it flows into the wave dissipation chamber making the interaction of waves and porous media such as the rock core occur during the process of flowing out comparisons of the 2d and 3d velocity curves are shown in fig 19 only one case is presented because comparisons of other cases are similar it is evident that the x and z directional velocity components play a dominant role and that the y directional component is an accessory of them which is logical since no oblique waves are considered in the present simulation the overall agreement of the curves in fig 19 is relatively good in terms of frequency regarding the amplitude the most obvious difference can be observed for signals measured by v 3 because v 3 is close to the free surface and the free surface in the 3d simulation is more complicated than that in the 2d one in other words this difference will decrease as the distance of the sensor from the free surface increases which is why the agreement at v 4 is better fig 20 shows snapshots of the free surface at typical instants during one wave period at t t 7 71 the flow out process is finishing and a new wave is coming from the figure it can be found that the water level inside the wave dissipation chamber is slightly higher than that outside the free surface in front of the perforated wall is very complicated due to the interaction of the fluid that flows out from different wave dissipation chambers at t t 7 93 the wave crest arrives and the flow in process starts the water level outside the wave dissipation chamber is much higher than that inside at t t 8 14 most fluid has flowed into the wave dissipation chamber and impacted the back wall causing the run up which is identical to the phenomenon of fig 18 at t t 8 43 the fluid starts to flow out from the pore on the perforated wall and the next wave is coming this figure provides an intuitive description of the wave structure interaction process and from which we could conclude that most hydrodynamic processes here are similar to what we have observed for the 2d simulation 4 2 4 wave load substantial attention has been paid to the wave load of the jtcb especially in the structure design stage it is widely accepted that the total force can be evaluated by integrating the hydrodynamic pressure measured by pressure sensors huang et al 2011 therefore getting the hydrodynamic pressure with good accuracy is critical for both experiments and numerical simulations wave loads measured by sensors in the numerical simulation and experiment which adopted both 2d and 3d cases with h 0 08 m and b l 0 126 are shown in figs 21 25 horizontal and vertical wave loads are shown in figs 21 23 and figs 24 25 respectively the horizontal axis is the nondimensional time and the vertical axis is the wave load regarding the 3d result good overall agreement can be observed among the figures and most of the values of d r are greater than 0 9 among these results the numerical data measured by sensor 10 and sensor 24 do not match the experimental data very well for sensor 10 the numerical results are smaller than the experimental results the refined index of agreement is equal to 0 761 which is not perfect but acceptable because complicated phenomena such as wave breaking occur in the wave dissipation chamber before the reflected wave reaches the inside part of the front wall for sensor 24 the amplitude of the numerical curve is similar to that of the experimental curve while the zero position is slightly different this result could be improved by refining the mesh in the region of the rubble mound foundation compared with that of the 3d result the overall agreement of the 2d result is imperfect however the result could be acceptable for preliminary design considering the calculation time required for the 2d modeling additionally most d r values are larger than 0 7 regarding section 4 2 3 no phase lags are observed indicating that the existence of the vertical part of the front wall will not considerably affect the frequency of the wave load only relatively small high order contributions are observed causing a slightly different tendency of the amplitude of the 2d result if we record the moment that the peak pressure occurs in one wave period the order and duration of the wave structure interaction will be approximated taking the curve in the nondimensional time range 10 0 11 0 as an example in the first stage the wave crest impacts the outside of the front wall t t 10 0 fig 21 simultaneously the vertical load on the outside of the bottom reaches the peak value fig 25 in the second stage the wave crest passes through the front wall and impacts the back wall t t 10 25 fig 23 subsequently the vertical load on the inside part of the bottom reaches the peak value t t 10 25 fig 24 in the last stage the reflected wave crest moves backward and impacts the inside of the front wall and then it flows out from the wave dissipation chamber t t 10 40 all peak values of the impacted pressure occur during the first half of the wave period followed by a sustained flow out process the values of d r calculated from the experimental and numerical data are collected in fig 26 some sensors have been eliminated because no pressure is measured by them during the experiment from this figure we can find that the overall agreement is relative good compared to the 2d result obvious improvements can be observed for the 3d result most values of d r fluctuate in the vicinity of 0 81 and 0 92 for the 2d and 3d simulations respectively for 2d simulations the d r values at sensors 10 23 and 24 are not good enough for sensors 23 and 24 the d r values of the 3d simulations increase a lot mainly due to the lack of y directional contributions for sensor 10 some values are still not good enough although the values have increased under 3d simulation possibly due to the complexity of such problems at the free surface as mentioned above before reaching the inside of the front wall the wave crest undergoes a complicated process including flowing in through the perforated wall running up and being reflected by the back wall during this process a complicated free surface can be observed inside the wave dissipation chamber which causes difficulties for free surface capture 5 discussion from the preceding figure it can be found that the height of the front wall openings is equal to 0 037 m which remains unchanged in the 2d simulation as mentioned in section 4 2 2 slicing the 3d structure in this way will result in an overestimation of the porosity of the front wall because the vertical part of the perforated wall has been ignored furthermore k r appears to be sensitive to porosity especially when b l is in 0 12 0 21 therefore the effect of this overestimation on the numerical result is investigated in this section to sustain an identical front wall porosity the height of the pore of the 2d perforated wall needs to decrease in the following simulations a value of 0 025 m is adopted instead of 0 037 m which makes the porosity 0 2 this approximation still ignores the vertical part of the front wall hereafter the newly added 2d simulation is called the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation and the simulation without modifications is called the conventional 2d numerical simulation a comparison of k r obtained from the conventional 2d numerical simulation the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation the 3d numerical simulation and the experiment is shown in fig 27 from the figure it could be found that when b l 0 12 or b l 0 2 the values of k r obtained from the porosity equivalent numerical simulation are closed to but slightly smaller than those obtained from other approaches the value of b l for the minimum k r is 0 155 when the porosity equivalent structure is adopted this b l value is larger than that obtained from the conventional 2d simulation but identical to that obtained from 3d simulation this phenomenon indicates that the change tendency of k r is highly related to the porosity of the front wall when 0 12 b l 0 2 the porosity equivalent 2d structure could improve the result of the conventional 2d simulation a comparison of the k r values obtained from numerical simulations and the experiment is shown in fig 28 from the figure it can be found that the overall agreement of the conventional 2d simulation is better than that of the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation at most points however with respect to the distribution of the points it is obvious that the points calculated from the porosity equivalent 2d numerical simulation are more orderly distributed around a line parallel to y x the points calculated from the conventional 2d numerical simulation are disordered therefore in the present study it is logical for us to find that most differences 10 of 12 between the k r calculated from the conventional 2d numerical simulation and the experiment are approximately equal to 0 1 these almost consistent differences could be regarded as the effect of the vertical part of the front wall or the y directional contributions of the fluid fluid interaction making the numerical result smaller than the experimental one the values of d r calculated from the experimental and porosity equivalent 2d numerical data are collected in fig 29 compared to fig 26 significant improvements can be observed although the values at sensors 10 23 and 24 are still not good enough most values of d r fluctuate around 0 9 which is larger than the fluctuation point of 0 81 in fig 26 this overall improvement reveals that adopting the representative porosity of the structure helps obtain a better result that is more consistent with the experimental and 3d results 6 conclusions in this work a numerical toolbox based on openfoam is set up and used for the rans modeling of wave structure interactions of the jtcb the accuracy and effectiveness of the modules in this toolbox are verified in section 3 using a porosity dam break experiment and a total reflection numerical test then this numerical model is used to simulate an experiment carried out in dut in which a rock filled jtcb located on a trapezoidal rubble mound foundation was considered both 2d and 3d cases are simulated and the reflection coefficient velocity field and wave load are analyzed in detail the refined index of agreement is adopted to quantize the agreement between the numerical and experimental results good overall agreement has been obtained in the present paper the effect of 2d simplification is discussed via simulation with the modified 2d structures the main conclusions are listed as follows regarding the reflection coefficient it can be found that the k r value calculated by the conventional 2d numerical simulation does not match the experimental values very well therefore 3d numerical simulations are conducted for the sake of comparisons and good agreement between the experimental and 3d numerical results is observed the b l value calculated via conventional 2d numerical simulation when the minimum k r value occurs is different from that calculated from both the 3d numerical simulation and the experiment this phenomenon is partly due to the elimination of the vertical part of the front wall and partly due to the overestimation of the porosity of the front wall during conventional 2d simplification regarding the velocity field several numerical velocity sensors are adopted to give a clear description it has been observed that the velocity of the fluid will increase once propagating through the perforated wall due to the pressure drop after propagation through the perforated wall the flow will not move straight forward as a result of the back wall it will move toward the right top direction causing the run up an eddy is formed and keeps growing during this process part of the fluid will flow into the porous media inside the wave dissipation chamber under the effect of the eddy the velocity magnitude inside the porous media is very small which means it is effective for energy dissipation the 3d simulations provide an intuitive description on the interaction process while most 3d phenomena remain similar to those of the 2d simulation regarding the wave load both the 3d and 2d results are compared with the experimental data the moment at which the peak pressure occurs is recorded and used to evaluate the order and duration of the wave structure interaction it has been found that the peak values of the impacted pressure occur during the first half of the wave period followed by a sustained flow out process the d r value provides a quantitative description of the agreement between the numerical and experimental values as expected compared to the conventional 2d result the result calculated from 3d cases matches the experimental result better due to the lack of the vertical part of the front wall and y directional contributions the conventional 2d result is imperfect but acceptable for preliminary design if considering the lower simulation time required to improve the performance of 2d simulation a modified method for slicing the 3d structure is presented an identical porosity of the perforated front wall in the 2d cases is adopted which means that the height of the pore should be diminished during the 2d simplification of the structure a similar k r variety tendency that is identical to both the 3d numerical simulation and the experiment can be obtained with the porosity equivalent 2d structure regarding k r almost constant differences between the porosity equivalent 2d simulation and the experiment are observed this phenomenon can be regarded as the effect of the vertical part of the front wall or the y directional contributions which is inevitable for 2d simulations however significant improvements are also obtained in terms of wave load most values of d r of the wave load fluctuate around 0 9 when using porosity equivalent 2d structures which is an improvement compared to that calculated from the conventional 2d simulation therefore keeping the porosity unchanged during 2d simplification is recommended for numerical simulations of such perforated structures acknowledgements the study is supported by the nsfc shandong joint fund project u1706226 and the national natural science foundation of china 51779236

22553,offshore wind turbine installation schedule risk analysis is a complex task especially in taiwan due to the fact that involves huge amount of uncertainties such as typhoons high winds etc which have high dependency on the project activities as a result of this there is insufficient data for analysis and thus leading to a delay in the successful execution of the project this study developed the fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation fbn mcs to model uncertainties having impact on the project duration of offshore wind turbine installation and also to find the correlation between the risks and project duration fuzzy sets theory fst were used to define the membership functions for each risk with the help of experts survey the bayesian network bn was applied to find the dependency relationship between the risk factors affecting the installation identified through literatures and experts monte carlo simulation mcs model then evaluated the dependent posterior probabilities generated from the bn as independent variables to find their correlation and determine the total project the proposed model was tested on taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project taiwan to assess its applicability and the results proved to address the study objectives keywords project scheduling offshore wind turbine fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation 1 introduction for the past decades wind energy has gained a lot of attention around the world and has become alternatives to the conventional use of fossil fuels coal or nuclear energy which has two major drawbacks they are non renewable and they increase the greenhouse effect through the release of carbon dioxide rodrigues et al 2015 countries such as taiwan highly depend on imported energy where 97 99 provides power supply for the country on the other hand the island has a huge advantage when it comes to offshore wind turbine development due to the taiwan strait and its rich annual strong winds government of taiwan announced an incentive program demonstration incentive program in 2012 to facilitate the realization of 4 6 offshore wind demonstration pilot by 2015 and reach 600 mw capacity by 2020 and 3 000 mw by 2030 taiwan generations corporation tgc is one of the private companies that won the grant scheme in 2013 with the scope of changhua offshore pilot project copp 2 turbines in 2015 and fuhai offshore windfarm 28 turbines in 2020 the state owned taiwan power company tpc also identified fang yuan changhua county and aims at installing offshore wind energy capacity of 320 mw by 2020 1 5 gw by 2025 and 3 gw by 2030 taiwan is very determined in making the country not to depend on other countries for energy however it faces a lot of challenges posed by severe weather conditions such as typhoons lack of suitable subsea construction capabilities such as vessel coordination and construction scheduling leading them to seek for foreign assistance the island has two winds that blow annually which are the northeast monsoon september to march and the southwest monsoon april to august offshore wind turbine owt installation activities such as the erection of tower of wind turbine and cable laying wiring in tower nacelle are highly affected by the impact of wind during the period of northeast monsoon because of its high level of wind guo et al 2017 waves in changhua sea area are heavily influenced by wind and there is an 80 chance that the significant wave height is below 1m from april to september which is considered to be the only safe period for installation violent storms such as typhoons pass nearby and in most cases hit taiwan directly each year thus increasing the uncertainty and risk in offshore wind project development kao and pearre 2017 the uncertainties such as weather conditions sea conditions and limitations in offshore wind generation technologies can have serious impact for the installation process of offshore wind turbines which requires some analysis conventional probability theories are used to address uncertainties of random outcomes such as the bayesian networks belief networks bns which allows experts and non experts to directly express qualitative relationship of the probabilistic dependencies among risk factors however it is usually difficult for the experts to precisely and constantly express their knowledge as probability distribution leading to insufficient data also the model is unable to deal with imprecise uncertain data arizaga et al 2007 uncertainties are not always random i e they often have vagueness included in the expert provided information fuzzy sets theory fst is able to handle these imprecisions vagueness and subjectivity related to linguistic variables however it has a limitation of determining the dependency relationship among risk factors ren et al 2009 due to insufficient and vague knowledge of uncertainties presented in taiwan s offshore wind demonstration pilot it is recommended to develop a model which considers these uncertainties the fuzzy bayesian inference introduced by viertl 1987 extended the conventional bayesian inference which uses the fuzzy bayesian network fbn to graphically represent expert knowledge on the state variables and model the variables that are random and imprecise by using bayesian statistics the algorithm however relies on repeated evaluation of the posterior distribution which becomes a computation burden as it requires a large number of simulations rajabi 2016 there exists a correlation between risk factors and the project activities when they are influenced by the same risk factor which increases the variability of the path duration wang and demsetz 2000 the fbn model is also unable to solve this problem numerical estimation techniques such as monte carlo simulation mcs would be very effective in assessing the dependent posterior probabilities of the independent variables risk factors generated through the fbn model the mcs is used to simulate the total duration project in order to determine the probability of completion of the project considering risk factors of each activity therefore this study proposes the fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation fbn mcs to evaluate the impact of random and imprecise uncertainties on the schedule of offshore wind turbine installation capturing the correlation between the risk factors and the project schedule duration 2 literature review 2 1 project schedule risks in offshore wind turbine installation offshore wind turbine installation scheduling is a challenge for engineers project managers due to the fact that the task activities are highly dependent on risk factors for example the activity of vessels such as the transportation of preassembled components from the port to the installation site requires a sea with low wave speed vis and ursavas 2016 nacelle and blades require still air and the assembly of the blades requires nearly calm weather scholz reiter et al 2011 literatures showed that most of the studies about offshore wind turbines are mainly pivoted around the maintenance and operation phases little effort has been made on the installation phase researchers such as uraz 2011 created a time wise model for the transportation and installation process of offshore wind turbines in order to figure out the effect of different parameters on the overall duration however there was no consideration given to uncertainties and disruptions during the installation scholz reiter et al 2011 established a mathematical model using mixed integer linear programming milp to calculate the optimal installation schedule and lutjen and karimi 2012 developed an approach for offshore scheduling which integrated the port inventory control and supply of the wind turbines but both literatures were unable to capture the uncertain weather conditions which directly affects the project the factors having huge impacts during the installation of offshore wind turbines were reviewed from various literatures the summary is shown in table 1 with the name of authors and their publication years 2 2 offshore wind turbine installation the framework engineering and design of offshore wind turbines depends solely on weather and sea conditions such as wind waves heavy rainfall tide etc which provides renewable energy sources that are inexhaustible cheap clean and eco friendly the size and weight of the wind turbine components vary with the electrical capacity of the turbine the rotor dimensions and the selection of blade hub and nacelle material and equipment kaiser et al 2012 it is therefore important to take note of these characteristics when analyzing uncertainties during the installation process as it can have a direct or indirect impact on the project activities there are five installation concepts which were developed to reduce the amount of time spent on offshore activities in order to fit the installation work within the time windows uraz 2011 installation concepts were developed to reduce the amount of time spent on offshore activities in order to fit the installation work within the time windows uraz 2011 the installation configurations are based on carrying the components preassembled at the port pre assembled to the installation site due to inadequate work place a transport vessel with enough deck area and a large crane capacity ahn et al 2016 recommended that the number of assembled components or generator parts should be reduced as lifts are risky due to wind speed impact 2 3 fuzzy bayesian network fbn fuzzy bayesian network fbn is basically incorporating principles of bayesian statistics with fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets theory the model is able to make estimates and evaluate the random and vague or imprecise posterior probabilities and is able to model the risk factor s relationships a comparison between the results of fbn and bn addressed by zareia et al 2019 stated especially in critically analysis of root events shows the outperformance of fbn in providing more detailed transparent and realistic results it was demonstrated that fbn can address the limitations of bn and fst while taking advantage of the both methods in process safety assessment it is therefore expected to provide a more robust tool for knowledge elicitation and probabilistic safety assessment under uncertainty in process systems fbn model has been increasingly used for risk assessment javadi et al 2017 on roof fall risk analysis in underground coal mines islam et al 2017 on risk analysis in power plant projects a fbn based approach for safety risk analysis of tunnel induced pipeline damage was developed zhang et al 2016 aiming to provide support for safety assurance of existing pipelines adjacent to tunneling excavation 2 3 1 fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets theory fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets theory is used to describe vagueness which is based on experts judgements and experiences guo 2000 zegordi 2012 turnbull and omenzetter 2017 it dictates that a fuzzy subset ã on the universe of discourse x is defined as 1 μ ã x 0 1 where each element of x can be any real value within an interval of 0 and 1 known as the degree of membership μ or membership value and is characterized by a membership function μ ã x the α cuts of ã are interval numbers which contains all the values of real numbers that have a membership grade in a given fuzzy number x greater than or equal to the specified value of α the relation is defined as 2 ã α x r μ a x α where α 0 1 membership function graphically identifies fuzzy sets which come in different shapes the triangular membership function tmf shown in fig 1 is mostly employed due to its simplicity and accuracy in transforming crisps numbers to fuzzy numbers ross 2000 defuzzification of the fuzzy membership functions transforms the fuzzy membership function to crisp values using methods such as the center of area coa cheng and ko 2006 2 3 2 bayesian network bn a bayesian networks bns are graphical representation of risk factors define by the directed acyclic graph dag and conditional probability tables phan et al 2016 it is able to estimate the dependency relationship between risk factors using the cause and consequence relationships generated through a qualitative data since bayesian approaches are capable of considering continuous variables in a discrete format it is possible to conduct the inference of more complicated stochastic relationships among random variables in the network i e each variable may have more values than true or false such as different level of storm conditions and not all the dependencies have to be deterministic recent research has applied bn to reliability assessment and predicting optimum design point of the mooring system abaei et al 2018 moreover the application of bn makes it possible to make probability updating and dynamic probability estimations such a novel combination successfully overcomes the limitations of using either the traditional bn model alone or copulas with other quantitative risk analysis approaches guo et al 2019 2 4 monte carlo simulation mcs monte carlo simulation mcs is a powerful quantitative risk analysis technique where variables are sampled at random from the input probability distributions raychaudhuri 2008 each set of samples is called iteration and the resulting outcome from that sample is recorded hundreds or thousands of times of simulation runs are made bouayed 2016 and the result is a probability distribution of possible outcomes which are combined to estimate the total project duration it also has the ability to estimate the correlation of dependency between two or more variables 3 model construction 3 1 fbn mcs model architecture this study fused the merits of fuzzy set theory fst bayesian network bn and monte carlo simulation mcs to develop the fbn mcs model for solving maritime engineering issues fuzzy statistics method was applied to deal with the vagueness and uncertainties of the qualitative factors fbn integrated fuzzy set theory with bayesian network was used to graphically represent expert knowledge on the state variables and model the variables that are random and imprecise by using bayesian statistics mcs an effective method in assessing the dependent posterior probabilities of the independent variables risk factors generated through the fbn model was applied to simulate the total duration project in order to determine the probability of completion of the project considering risk factors of each activity fig 2 shows a detailed flowchart of two major processes of the model which provides basis for correlated schedule risk analysis framework the methodology behind the proposed model of this research is explained in a stepwise manner in the following sections four commercial software were used for the realization of the fbn mcs model microsoft excel helped in calculating the fuzzy membership grades experts then assigned these membership grades to each risk according to how they are correlated with the project for the bn inferencing through netica norsys software corporation microsoft project 2016 microsoft corporation entered the project tasks and allowed the calculation of the total project duration risk version 7 5 industrial edition palisade corporation is an add in to monte carlo simulation mcs which enabled to evaluate the schedule risks 3 2 fbn model construction process 3 2 1 identify offshore wind turbine installation activities offshore wind turbines installation scheduling is a daunting task due to highly dependency on weather sea and material risks which have impacts on its activities such as transportation and lifting of the turbine components the project activities in this study were collected from various literatures journal articles books etc used to determine the total project schedule duration when impacted by risks fig 3 shows the work breakdown structure wbs of offshore wind turbine installation project 3 2 2 estimate project duration the identified activities in wbs were used to develop the schedule network using critical path method cpm the network illustrates the predecessors and successors of the activities the activities durations were estimated based on the literatures and interviews with the experts from taiwan power company taipower the project duration was calculated and the critical and non critical activities of the network were identified and used to avoid temporary risks the details of network and durations will be displayed and described in the case study of the following chapter 3 2 3 identify risk factors to plan and schedule an offshore wind turbines installation is a daunting task this is because it is highly dependent on weather sea and material risks which have impacts on its activities from the literatures that were reviewed according to the literature review 12 risk factors were identified wind speed wind force and wind direction are all under the influence of wind therefore they will be categorized as wind and the same goes for the wave as a result the number of major risk factors will be reduced to 7 the identified 7 major risk factors w1 w2 s1 s2 s3 and m1 m2 and 3 sub risk factors b1 b2 and b3 are highlighted in fig 4 3 2 4 establish a bayesian network bn a conventional bayesian network or simply bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph based on bayes theorem for reasoning under uncertainty majeed and khan 2019 a bayesian network bn is an extensively used graphical structure that encodes probabilistic dependencies among a collection of variables of interest the bns are acyclic graphs where the nodes signifying the variables are linked to each other by arcs that indicate causal or dependent interactions among the connected nodes if a causative probabilistic relationship exists among variables of interest then the nodes are linked together by a direct arc a conditional probability table cpt is allotted to all nodes to signify conditional interactions among the nodes connected sunday et al 2017 the upper part of fig 5 shows a directed acyclic graph dag which serves as a representation for the dependency relationship between risk factors of offshore wind turbine installation the nodes in the graph represent the risk factors and arrows links represent dependencies or causal influences between the risks the root nodes are w1 w2 and m1 having marginal prior probabilities assigned to them from the experts intermediate nodes are s1 s2 s3 m2 b1 b2 and b3 possessing conditional probability tables cpts which are tables of probability of an events happening hypothesis given that other events have already occurred evidence and finally nodes c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 are the leaf nodes which are nodes that have no child node s i e no other node depends on the aforementioned nodes 3 2 5 assign risks on affected project activities during the installation of offshore wind turbines one or more risks can directly or indirectly have impacts on the project activities which might lead to a delay of the completion time expert s knowledge is sought to assign risks generated through the bayesian network model on each affected project activity shown in the lower part of fig 5 this process was done using the risk version 7 5 industrial edition palisade corporation which has an add in to monte carlo simulation mcs and enables the evaluation of schedule risks 3 2 6 identify membership grades fuzzy statistics method is used to design a questionnaire for obtaining the membership functions of each risk factor based on the questionnaire survey membership grades functions which are real values within an interval of 0 and 1 within a set the membership grade can be known as the degree of membership μ or membership value and is characterized by a membership function μ ã x for each of the risk factors the degrees of occurrence of 5 levels were defined as level 1 very low occurrence level 2 low occurrence level 3 medium occurrence level 4 high occurrence and level 5 very high occurrence regarded as the fuzzy subsets furthermore the experts will be asked to assign degrees of relationship where each of them are divided into 2 subsets which are defined as barely correlated bc ranging from 0 to 2 somewhat correlated sc ranging from 2 to 4 fairly correlated fc ranging from 4 to 6 highly correlated hc ranging from 6 to 8 or extremely correlated ec ranging from 8 to 10 taking the material shortage unavailability as an example the returned questionnaire from expert 1 is given in fig 6 showing the degrees of occurrence and relationships in the figure the expert considered the occurrence of material shortage unavailability level 1 very low having the relationships of bc and sc degree then the expert drew a bar covering the first four grids the mean value and times of drawing by the experts for each of the degrees of relationship were recorded along with calculation of the related frequency shown in table 2 in the same manner the related frequencies of the other risk factors were obtained the membership functions given in fig 7 can be drawn based on the related frequencies the membership grade at every occurrence level can be calculated using equation 3 3 μ l j μ k i 1 n y i n where l j is the occurrence level j of attributes μ k is the correlated status μ l j μ k is the membership grade l j while μ k y i is the relative frequency of l j and n is the number of division for each correlated status μ k the membership grades are given as 4 μ μ k μ l 1 μ k μ l 2 μ k μ l 3 μ k μ l 4 μ k μ l 5 μ k taking the material shortage unavailability as an example the membership grades of fuzzy sets were μ bc 0 79 0 26 0 00 0 00 0 00 μ sc 0 45 0 85 0 21 0 04 0 00 μ fc 0 04 0 39 0 77 0 56 0 17 μ hc 0 00 0 03 0 47 0 87 0 64 μ ec 0 00 0 00 0 04 0 35 0 88 to develop the membership grades of bc degree for the material shortage unavailability the occurrence probability was ranged from 0 to 100 with the membership grades of levels l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 corresponding to the values 20 40 60 80 100 respectively a value of zero was set for 0 and 100 with applicable linear interpolation shown in fig 8 3 2 7 defuzzify defuzzification is the process of estimating the value of the dependent variable based on the resulting fuzzy set after applying the fuzzy inference rule to deffizify each fuzzy membership function the center of area coa cheng and ko 2006 method was used given as 5 x i 1 n a i x i i 1 n a i the membership functions were divided into sub areas as illustrated in fig 8 and the data is shown in table 3 where a i is the total area of the triangle and x i is the x distance of the whole triangle the membership functions were divided into sub areas and were averaged to determine the center of area coa and then multiplied together to calculate the final defuzzified using equation 5 3 2 8 estimate bayesian network posterior probabilities prior and conditional probabilities are assigned for all nodes using the conditional probability tables i e tables representing the probability of possible outcomes of a variable when other variables are known bayesian inference rule was applied in order to determine the dependent posterior probabilities which are defined by these three important terms conditional probability probability of an event happening hypothesis given that another event has already occurred evidence see fig 9 a joint probability probability of two or more intersection events occurring see fig 9 b it can be expressed as the product of marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities using conditional independence relationships it is given as 6 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i parents x i 7 p m1 s3 w1 b1 c2 p c2 m1 b1 p b1 s3 w1 p m1 p s3 p w1 marginal probability probability of any single event occurring unconditioned on any other event s it can be computed from joint probabilities by summing out the unwanted events for example 8 p m 1 m 1 i c 1 i p m 1 m 1 i c 1 c 1 j bayes theorem also known as bayes rule describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence for example the probability of events m1 and c1 happening p m1 c1 using fig 9 a is the product of the probability of m1 p m1 and the probability of c1 given that m1 has occurred p c1 m1 therefore the probability of m1 given c1 is 9 bayesian network has an advantage over other expert assessment models due to the fact that it considers the relationship between the risk factors 3 3 mcs model construction process 3 3 1 define probability distributions monte carlo simulation mcs model uses probability distributions such as normal lognormal triangular beta pert pert etc to represent uncertainty depending on the range of values assigned the lognormal distribution is a form of normal distribution where the mean and standard deviation variables represent the logarithm in bayesian statistics the scalar magnitude or uncertainty is expressed as in that case a negative value does not have physical meaning lognormal distribution is able to solve this problem since negative values of the logarithm are tolerated meaning only that the uncertainty is less than one 3 3 2 random sample independent risk occurrences the mcs model generates large set of randomly generated numbers using the uncertain independent posterior variables i e w1 w2 and m1 from the bn model the independent variables were transformed into lognormal distributions to be able to be sampled by mcs depending on the number of iterations each simulation run gave values sampled from the lognormal distributions the mean values of each of the independent risk occurrence were used as evidence for the bn model 3 3 3 infer dependent risks using independent risks the sampled independent risk occurrences were used as evidence in the bn model to assess the dependent risks occurrences each conditional probability table of the independent nodes were fed with these new evidences they were then compiled to produce new dependent posterior probabilities the posterior probabilities were sent to the mcs model for further evaluation 3 3 4 random sample dependent risk occurrences the mcs model uses these probabilities to generate randomly generated numbers i e the rest of the nodes also the dependent variables were transformed into lognormal distributions the probability distributions were assigned with number of iterations and after simulation runs the mean values were produced and recorded 3 3 5 create a risk register risk registers are used to identify assess and manage risks to acceptable levels it is used as a management tool by project managers for monitoring risk management processes inputs for the risk register in this study were obtained through experts to identify the risks that have potential impact s on the total project schedule duration the details of risk register table will be displayed and described in the case study of the following chapter 3 3 6 evaluate risk impacts on affected project activities schedule risk analysis was conducted through the mcs add in model to determine the risks that have impact on the project schedule first the project s activities tasks from the microsoft project were imported in microsoft excel with the mcs add in these activities were assigned with risk functions to become the input variables for mcs to randomly sample the occurrences from the risk register were then mapped onto the affected project activities or tasks with the probability distributions and risk register the mcs model was able to run a simulation thereby estimating the total project duration when the risk events occur 3 3 7 determine correlation when project activities are influenced by the same factor it increases the variability of the path duration and neglecting it would affect the mean parameter correlations are a statistical measures applied when these risk s have an impact on the duration schedule e g spearman rank correlation analysis was used to calculate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables i e between 1 and 1 3 3 8 interpret results the monte carlo simulation result shows graph distributions such as the probability density function pdf and the cumulative distribution function cdf representing the model s output i e total project duration the cdf plot helps to interpret the range of variability of the output i e whether the project is being above or below the actual project time the sensitivity analysis was performed to know how the input variables affected the output value and which inputs are the most critical ones this can assist project managers to prioritize which risk factor to concentrate on 4 case study and model application 4 1 taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project the taiwan power company taipower is taiwan s state owned utility power industry which produces green energy and wind power energy was one of the alternatives used to minimize the high dependency of the island s coal fired and nuclear powers since taiwan is a densely populated country with nearly two thirds of its land mountainous it makes land based wind power sites limited therefore the ocean became new area to utilize island s abundant wind resources changhua was chosen for offshore wind development due to relatively flat area and wind energy resources the utility company was awarded offshore wind demonstration incentive program in 2013 to increase sustainable energy production in the country the program requires installing two turbines as test models taipower s scope of the demonstration wind farm to be commissioned in june 2020 is 18 30 turbines the capacity of these wind turbines is 108 mw 110 mw with a unit capacity of 3 6 mw 6 0 mw which should be installed on a water depth of 15 26 m fig 10 shows the location map of taipower s offshore wind farm phase 1 project 4 2 data collection the historical case data collected for the 22 offshore wind turbines were from the following central weather bureau cwb taiwan offshore wind generation phase i project coastal utilization management manual taipower company limited status and prospects of taipower s offshore wind power taipower company limited also data collected for this research was based on literatures 1997 2017 and the remaining from experts knowledge seven decision makers with 10 years experience in risk analysis were interviewed through questionnaires judgments were made on 10 identified risk events and 191 project activities these questionnaires were used to calculate the membership grades for the risk events prior and conditional probability relationships were assigned by the experts between the identified risks in the bayesian network bn model through the questionnaires shown in fig 5 this study then used equations 6 9 to calculate the posterior probabilities and created a risk registry in microsoft excel which includes the risks their occurrences and schedule impact this registry was used to map the risks impacts on the affected project activities to know the risk inputs that might cause project delay 4 2 1 installation plan taipower planned to install its 22 offshore wind turbine units 7 2 8 km off fang yuan township changhua county most typhoons hit taiwan strait with an average wind speed of 25 32 m s and few for average wind speed of 33 m s considering the wind turbine units that can stand typhoon with wind speed of 33 m s a 5 0 mw capacity was chosen to be the main case for the project the proposed turbines will be composed of a downwind configuration which reduces wind loading by keeping the rotor oriented in such a way that it is not subjected to crosswinds even during shutdown due to strong gusts 4 2 2 transportation concepts for the offshore wind turbine installations towfp1p will be installed in a region that is sensitive to risks therefore the site location of the wind farm should be selected based on their resistance to wind and a period when it s safe for crane operations the installation concepts are related to the vessel size distance from port to site size of the turbine components and the lifting capacity of the onboard crane of the vessel which requires special attention when choosing the method of configuration currently the pre assembled rotor r2t in fig 11 is the development trend for offshore wind farms in europe which towfp1p wants to adopt r2t comprises of the hub and three blades which are assembled at the port the tower comes in two pieces with the nacelle placed on the same boat separately the time to install each wind turbine component sole depends on the wind speed limitations weight liftings peed of the crane and the experience of the engineer 4 3 fbn model application process 4 3 1 identify offshore wind turbine installation activities the identified owt installation activities specify the tasks needed to be done for the successful execution taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project towfp1p it requires a sufficient detail to estimate the time needed to complete them the main inputs are the scope consisting of the approved project scope statements and the work breakdown structure as mentioned in the previous sections towfp1p proposed the 5 mw capacity for the changhua project in that case the r2t configuration on a seajack vessel which can carry up to two wind turbines at a time from the port to the offshore wind farm site were identified as the suitable way of installing all the twenty two wind turbines on time 4 3 2 estimate project duration towfp1p schedule estimation was a complex task due to so many repeated activities involved fig 12 shows the detailed network of the first wind turbine installation in this case study 22 wind turbines are sequentially and repetitively required for installations the total estimated duration for the project was 848 days 4 3 3 identify risk factors the identified risks generated through returned experts survey illustrated in table 4 were applied on the installation activities of towfp1p this is a very useful step in this study because it helped to spot the potential risks that have potential impact on the total project duration 4 3 4 establish a bayesian network bn the bayesian network bn was constructed based on the identified risk factors above and the deffuzified membership grades in table 5 experts assigned relationships shown in fig 5 and probabilities using the defuzzified values to the root w1 w2 m1 intermediate m2 s1 s2 s3 b1 b2 b3 and leaf nodes c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 a case file was created consisting of 192 conditional probability table inputs in order to link it with the bayesian network software netica for evaluation 4 3 5 assign risks on affected project activities experts were asked to assign the 15 risks on the affected wind turbine project activities the same assignment as in fig 5 was used for taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project s activities since it has the same activities but with 22 wind turbines this time this step plays a vital role in project schedule risk assessment as they assist in determining the critical risk impacts on the project schedule duration in other words project managers or engineers are helped to focus on risks that might lead to a project schedule delay 4 3 6 identify membership grades the membership grades of each risk were determined by using the same steps in section 3 2 6 figs 7 and 13 illustrate the degree of occurrence and relationships from the returned questionnaire of expert 1 on the risk material shortage unavailability the membership grades at every occurrence level were summarized in table 5 4 3 7 deffuzify the coa method employed in this study generates a value that is the center of area of combined membership grades and takes into account the area of the union of the fuzzy sets the values in table 6 were calculated using equation 5 4 3 8 estimate bayesian posterior probabilities the following steps show how the bayesian network from the 192 case file were compiled or evaluated using the defuzzified probabilities modify the conditional probability tables cpts for example fig 14 shows the cpt for the risk node rainfall 4 4 mcs model application process 4 4 1 define probability distributions the lognormal distribution was applied in the mcs for the posterior probabilities generated through the fuzzy bayesian network model using microsoft excel with the monte carlo simulation add in software 4 4 2 random sample independent risk occurrences the independent probability distributions were randomly sampled in order to produce evidence for the dependent variables each individual risk was sampled with 1000 iterations after simulation run the data was collected and then averaged to be used later in determining the dependent variables 4 4 3 infer dependent risks using independent risks the averaged independent risks were returned back to the fbn model to evaluate the dependent posterior probabilities the same procedure as described in section 3 was applied 4 4 4 random sample dependent risk occurrences the dependent probability distributions generated through the independent random variables was also randomly sampled just as the individual risk the newly generated dependent risks were also sampled with 1000 iterations after simulation run the data were collected and then averaged 4 4 5 create a risk register the risk registers in table 7 was established to identify the potential risks in towfp1p in order to track the potential issues that can derail the intended outcomes it includes all information about each identified risk and their impacts on the project schedule this mechanism can be used by project managers put some mitigation measures in place in order to avoid project delays inputs for the risk register were obtained through experts to identify the risks that have potential impact s on the total project schedule so that mechanisms can be used by project managers put some mitigation measures in place in order to avoid project delays 4 4 6 evaluate risk impacts on affected project activities after each simulation run the days added from the schedule impacts are mapped onto the project activities that might be uncertain to complete on time which are highlighted in table 8 the project s activities extracted from the microsoft project was imported in microsoft excel with the mcs add in the activities were assigned with risk functions to become the input variables for mcs to randomly sample the occurrences from the risk register were then mapped onto the affected project activities or tasks with the probability distributions and risk register the mcs model was able to run a simulation thereby estimating the total project duration when the risk events occur 4 4 7 determine correlation fig 16 shows the coefficient values of the influencing factors on the output results i e the total project duration the result explained that heavy rainfall typhoon is more sensitive on the project duration it has a positive correlation coefficient of 0 57 i e the probability of heavy rainfall increasing will also increase the project duration by 0 57 4 4 8 interpret results the initial estimated duration for taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project installation was 848 days the probability density function pdf in fig 17 shows the relationship between the total project s outcome of an event and its frequency of occurrence the normal distribution statistics presented that the project will be finished with min value of 847 25 days max of 1007 65 days and mean 912 33 days with a standard deviation of 27 40 days this implies that when risk events are inherent with the project activities the uncertainty of the project was described by cumulative distribution function cdf shown in fig 18 which shows that there is 51 0 that the total duration of project will be delayed and 0 1 that it will be on time or below 4 4 9 crashed project schedule according to the simulation results in fig 18 the project will take 912 33 days to finish which makes it impossible for the project manager or general contractor to complete the project on time without crashing the project schedule in order to complete the project within 848 days the number of day s spent on wind turbine test and inspection which were 130 and 190 days respectively were crashed to 100 and 120 days respectively based on expert s optimistic estimation of the aforementioned project activities to finish within the expected days the crashed project schedule reduced to a total duration of 778 days another simulation was run for the new project duration to estimate the project completing within 848 days or below that the results in fig 19 shows a pdf with cdf overlay which illustrates that the project will be finished within 848 days at the probability of 63 5 5 conclusions the island of taiwan is faced with series of natural disasters such as floods typhoons etc which poses a threat to offshore wind installation furthermore the country is new to offshore wind development therefore there is limited data available to conduct risk analysis in this study fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation fbn mcs was developed to provide means of solving these challenges the model proved to address the impacts of random and imprecise uncertainties on the schedule of offshore wind turbine installation when data is limited also the correlation of risks on the total project duration the fuzzy bayesian network fbn was able to incorporate insufficient data and uncertainties vague and random presented in the schedule of taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project monte carlo simulation mcs assessed the dependent posterior probabilities of the independent variables risk factors generated through the fbn model and included correlation among the influencing factors this helped in determining the probability of completion of the project considering risks the simulation results illustrate that the project will finish within 848 days at a probability of 63 5 it shows a min value of 777 61 days max of 939 45 days and mean 838 65 days with a standard deviation of 26 50 days this aforementioned model was applied on an offshore wind turbine installation project taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project to assess its applicability it would be also beneficial to investigate the accuracy of this model by applying them on different construction projects such as buildings bridges tunneling etc where uncertainty and data limitation are usually existent in order to improve the results

22553,offshore wind turbine installation schedule risk analysis is a complex task especially in taiwan due to the fact that involves huge amount of uncertainties such as typhoons high winds etc which have high dependency on the project activities as a result of this there is insufficient data for analysis and thus leading to a delay in the successful execution of the project this study developed the fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation fbn mcs to model uncertainties having impact on the project duration of offshore wind turbine installation and also to find the correlation between the risks and project duration fuzzy sets theory fst were used to define the membership functions for each risk with the help of experts survey the bayesian network bn was applied to find the dependency relationship between the risk factors affecting the installation identified through literatures and experts monte carlo simulation mcs model then evaluated the dependent posterior probabilities generated from the bn as independent variables to find their correlation and determine the total project the proposed model was tested on taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project taiwan to assess its applicability and the results proved to address the study objectives keywords project scheduling offshore wind turbine fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation 1 introduction for the past decades wind energy has gained a lot of attention around the world and has become alternatives to the conventional use of fossil fuels coal or nuclear energy which has two major drawbacks they are non renewable and they increase the greenhouse effect through the release of carbon dioxide rodrigues et al 2015 countries such as taiwan highly depend on imported energy where 97 99 provides power supply for the country on the other hand the island has a huge advantage when it comes to offshore wind turbine development due to the taiwan strait and its rich annual strong winds government of taiwan announced an incentive program demonstration incentive program in 2012 to facilitate the realization of 4 6 offshore wind demonstration pilot by 2015 and reach 600 mw capacity by 2020 and 3 000 mw by 2030 taiwan generations corporation tgc is one of the private companies that won the grant scheme in 2013 with the scope of changhua offshore pilot project copp 2 turbines in 2015 and fuhai offshore windfarm 28 turbines in 2020 the state owned taiwan power company tpc also identified fang yuan changhua county and aims at installing offshore wind energy capacity of 320 mw by 2020 1 5 gw by 2025 and 3 gw by 2030 taiwan is very determined in making the country not to depend on other countries for energy however it faces a lot of challenges posed by severe weather conditions such as typhoons lack of suitable subsea construction capabilities such as vessel coordination and construction scheduling leading them to seek for foreign assistance the island has two winds that blow annually which are the northeast monsoon september to march and the southwest monsoon april to august offshore wind turbine owt installation activities such as the erection of tower of wind turbine and cable laying wiring in tower nacelle are highly affected by the impact of wind during the period of northeast monsoon because of its high level of wind guo et al 2017 waves in changhua sea area are heavily influenced by wind and there is an 80 chance that the significant wave height is below 1m from april to september which is considered to be the only safe period for installation violent storms such as typhoons pass nearby and in most cases hit taiwan directly each year thus increasing the uncertainty and risk in offshore wind project development kao and pearre 2017 the uncertainties such as weather conditions sea conditions and limitations in offshore wind generation technologies can have serious impact for the installation process of offshore wind turbines which requires some analysis conventional probability theories are used to address uncertainties of random outcomes such as the bayesian networks belief networks bns which allows experts and non experts to directly express qualitative relationship of the probabilistic dependencies among risk factors however it is usually difficult for the experts to precisely and constantly express their knowledge as probability distribution leading to insufficient data also the model is unable to deal with imprecise uncertain data arizaga et al 2007 uncertainties are not always random i e they often have vagueness included in the expert provided information fuzzy sets theory fst is able to handle these imprecisions vagueness and subjectivity related to linguistic variables however it has a limitation of determining the dependency relationship among risk factors ren et al 2009 due to insufficient and vague knowledge of uncertainties presented in taiwan s offshore wind demonstration pilot it is recommended to develop a model which considers these uncertainties the fuzzy bayesian inference introduced by viertl 1987 extended the conventional bayesian inference which uses the fuzzy bayesian network fbn to graphically represent expert knowledge on the state variables and model the variables that are random and imprecise by using bayesian statistics the algorithm however relies on repeated evaluation of the posterior distribution which becomes a computation burden as it requires a large number of simulations rajabi 2016 there exists a correlation between risk factors and the project activities when they are influenced by the same risk factor which increases the variability of the path duration wang and demsetz 2000 the fbn model is also unable to solve this problem numerical estimation techniques such as monte carlo simulation mcs would be very effective in assessing the dependent posterior probabilities of the independent variables risk factors generated through the fbn model the mcs is used to simulate the total duration project in order to determine the probability of completion of the project considering risk factors of each activity therefore this study proposes the fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation fbn mcs to evaluate the impact of random and imprecise uncertainties on the schedule of offshore wind turbine installation capturing the correlation between the risk factors and the project schedule duration 2 literature review 2 1 project schedule risks in offshore wind turbine installation offshore wind turbine installation scheduling is a challenge for engineers project managers due to the fact that the task activities are highly dependent on risk factors for example the activity of vessels such as the transportation of preassembled components from the port to the installation site requires a sea with low wave speed vis and ursavas 2016 nacelle and blades require still air and the assembly of the blades requires nearly calm weather scholz reiter et al 2011 literatures showed that most of the studies about offshore wind turbines are mainly pivoted around the maintenance and operation phases little effort has been made on the installation phase researchers such as uraz 2011 created a time wise model for the transportation and installation process of offshore wind turbines in order to figure out the effect of different parameters on the overall duration however there was no consideration given to uncertainties and disruptions during the installation scholz reiter et al 2011 established a mathematical model using mixed integer linear programming milp to calculate the optimal installation schedule and lutjen and karimi 2012 developed an approach for offshore scheduling which integrated the port inventory control and supply of the wind turbines but both literatures were unable to capture the uncertain weather conditions which directly affects the project the factors having huge impacts during the installation of offshore wind turbines were reviewed from various literatures the summary is shown in table 1 with the name of authors and their publication years 2 2 offshore wind turbine installation the framework engineering and design of offshore wind turbines depends solely on weather and sea conditions such as wind waves heavy rainfall tide etc which provides renewable energy sources that are inexhaustible cheap clean and eco friendly the size and weight of the wind turbine components vary with the electrical capacity of the turbine the rotor dimensions and the selection of blade hub and nacelle material and equipment kaiser et al 2012 it is therefore important to take note of these characteristics when analyzing uncertainties during the installation process as it can have a direct or indirect impact on the project activities there are five installation concepts which were developed to reduce the amount of time spent on offshore activities in order to fit the installation work within the time windows uraz 2011 installation concepts were developed to reduce the amount of time spent on offshore activities in order to fit the installation work within the time windows uraz 2011 the installation configurations are based on carrying the components preassembled at the port pre assembled to the installation site due to inadequate work place a transport vessel with enough deck area and a large crane capacity ahn et al 2016 recommended that the number of assembled components or generator parts should be reduced as lifts are risky due to wind speed impact 2 3 fuzzy bayesian network fbn fuzzy bayesian network fbn is basically incorporating principles of bayesian statistics with fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets theory the model is able to make estimates and evaluate the random and vague or imprecise posterior probabilities and is able to model the risk factor s relationships a comparison between the results of fbn and bn addressed by zareia et al 2019 stated especially in critically analysis of root events shows the outperformance of fbn in providing more detailed transparent and realistic results it was demonstrated that fbn can address the limitations of bn and fst while taking advantage of the both methods in process safety assessment it is therefore expected to provide a more robust tool for knowledge elicitation and probabilistic safety assessment under uncertainty in process systems fbn model has been increasingly used for risk assessment javadi et al 2017 on roof fall risk analysis in underground coal mines islam et al 2017 on risk analysis in power plant projects a fbn based approach for safety risk analysis of tunnel induced pipeline damage was developed zhang et al 2016 aiming to provide support for safety assurance of existing pipelines adjacent to tunneling excavation 2 3 1 fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets theory fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets theory is used to describe vagueness which is based on experts judgements and experiences guo 2000 zegordi 2012 turnbull and omenzetter 2017 it dictates that a fuzzy subset ã on the universe of discourse x is defined as 1 μ ã x 0 1 where each element of x can be any real value within an interval of 0 and 1 known as the degree of membership μ or membership value and is characterized by a membership function μ ã x the α cuts of ã are interval numbers which contains all the values of real numbers that have a membership grade in a given fuzzy number x greater than or equal to the specified value of α the relation is defined as 2 ã α x r μ a x α where α 0 1 membership function graphically identifies fuzzy sets which come in different shapes the triangular membership function tmf shown in fig 1 is mostly employed due to its simplicity and accuracy in transforming crisps numbers to fuzzy numbers ross 2000 defuzzification of the fuzzy membership functions transforms the fuzzy membership function to crisp values using methods such as the center of area coa cheng and ko 2006 2 3 2 bayesian network bn a bayesian networks bns are graphical representation of risk factors define by the directed acyclic graph dag and conditional probability tables phan et al 2016 it is able to estimate the dependency relationship between risk factors using the cause and consequence relationships generated through a qualitative data since bayesian approaches are capable of considering continuous variables in a discrete format it is possible to conduct the inference of more complicated stochastic relationships among random variables in the network i e each variable may have more values than true or false such as different level of storm conditions and not all the dependencies have to be deterministic recent research has applied bn to reliability assessment and predicting optimum design point of the mooring system abaei et al 2018 moreover the application of bn makes it possible to make probability updating and dynamic probability estimations such a novel combination successfully overcomes the limitations of using either the traditional bn model alone or copulas with other quantitative risk analysis approaches guo et al 2019 2 4 monte carlo simulation mcs monte carlo simulation mcs is a powerful quantitative risk analysis technique where variables are sampled at random from the input probability distributions raychaudhuri 2008 each set of samples is called iteration and the resulting outcome from that sample is recorded hundreds or thousands of times of simulation runs are made bouayed 2016 and the result is a probability distribution of possible outcomes which are combined to estimate the total project duration it also has the ability to estimate the correlation of dependency between two or more variables 3 model construction 3 1 fbn mcs model architecture this study fused the merits of fuzzy set theory fst bayesian network bn and monte carlo simulation mcs to develop the fbn mcs model for solving maritime engineering issues fuzzy statistics method was applied to deal with the vagueness and uncertainties of the qualitative factors fbn integrated fuzzy set theory with bayesian network was used to graphically represent expert knowledge on the state variables and model the variables that are random and imprecise by using bayesian statistics mcs an effective method in assessing the dependent posterior probabilities of the independent variables risk factors generated through the fbn model was applied to simulate the total duration project in order to determine the probability of completion of the project considering risk factors of each activity fig 2 shows a detailed flowchart of two major processes of the model which provides basis for correlated schedule risk analysis framework the methodology behind the proposed model of this research is explained in a stepwise manner in the following sections four commercial software were used for the realization of the fbn mcs model microsoft excel helped in calculating the fuzzy membership grades experts then assigned these membership grades to each risk according to how they are correlated with the project for the bn inferencing through netica norsys software corporation microsoft project 2016 microsoft corporation entered the project tasks and allowed the calculation of the total project duration risk version 7 5 industrial edition palisade corporation is an add in to monte carlo simulation mcs which enabled to evaluate the schedule risks 3 2 fbn model construction process 3 2 1 identify offshore wind turbine installation activities offshore wind turbines installation scheduling is a daunting task due to highly dependency on weather sea and material risks which have impacts on its activities such as transportation and lifting of the turbine components the project activities in this study were collected from various literatures journal articles books etc used to determine the total project schedule duration when impacted by risks fig 3 shows the work breakdown structure wbs of offshore wind turbine installation project 3 2 2 estimate project duration the identified activities in wbs were used to develop the schedule network using critical path method cpm the network illustrates the predecessors and successors of the activities the activities durations were estimated based on the literatures and interviews with the experts from taiwan power company taipower the project duration was calculated and the critical and non critical activities of the network were identified and used to avoid temporary risks the details of network and durations will be displayed and described in the case study of the following chapter 3 2 3 identify risk factors to plan and schedule an offshore wind turbines installation is a daunting task this is because it is highly dependent on weather sea and material risks which have impacts on its activities from the literatures that were reviewed according to the literature review 12 risk factors were identified wind speed wind force and wind direction are all under the influence of wind therefore they will be categorized as wind and the same goes for the wave as a result the number of major risk factors will be reduced to 7 the identified 7 major risk factors w1 w2 s1 s2 s3 and m1 m2 and 3 sub risk factors b1 b2 and b3 are highlighted in fig 4 3 2 4 establish a bayesian network bn a conventional bayesian network or simply bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph based on bayes theorem for reasoning under uncertainty majeed and khan 2019 a bayesian network bn is an extensively used graphical structure that encodes probabilistic dependencies among a collection of variables of interest the bns are acyclic graphs where the nodes signifying the variables are linked to each other by arcs that indicate causal or dependent interactions among the connected nodes if a causative probabilistic relationship exists among variables of interest then the nodes are linked together by a direct arc a conditional probability table cpt is allotted to all nodes to signify conditional interactions among the nodes connected sunday et al 2017 the upper part of fig 5 shows a directed acyclic graph dag which serves as a representation for the dependency relationship between risk factors of offshore wind turbine installation the nodes in the graph represent the risk factors and arrows links represent dependencies or causal influences between the risks the root nodes are w1 w2 and m1 having marginal prior probabilities assigned to them from the experts intermediate nodes are s1 s2 s3 m2 b1 b2 and b3 possessing conditional probability tables cpts which are tables of probability of an events happening hypothesis given that other events have already occurred evidence and finally nodes c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 are the leaf nodes which are nodes that have no child node s i e no other node depends on the aforementioned nodes 3 2 5 assign risks on affected project activities during the installation of offshore wind turbines one or more risks can directly or indirectly have impacts on the project activities which might lead to a delay of the completion time expert s knowledge is sought to assign risks generated through the bayesian network model on each affected project activity shown in the lower part of fig 5 this process was done using the risk version 7 5 industrial edition palisade corporation which has an add in to monte carlo simulation mcs and enables the evaluation of schedule risks 3 2 6 identify membership grades fuzzy statistics method is used to design a questionnaire for obtaining the membership functions of each risk factor based on the questionnaire survey membership grades functions which are real values within an interval of 0 and 1 within a set the membership grade can be known as the degree of membership μ or membership value and is characterized by a membership function μ ã x for each of the risk factors the degrees of occurrence of 5 levels were defined as level 1 very low occurrence level 2 low occurrence level 3 medium occurrence level 4 high occurrence and level 5 very high occurrence regarded as the fuzzy subsets furthermore the experts will be asked to assign degrees of relationship where each of them are divided into 2 subsets which are defined as barely correlated bc ranging from 0 to 2 somewhat correlated sc ranging from 2 to 4 fairly correlated fc ranging from 4 to 6 highly correlated hc ranging from 6 to 8 or extremely correlated ec ranging from 8 to 10 taking the material shortage unavailability as an example the returned questionnaire from expert 1 is given in fig 6 showing the degrees of occurrence and relationships in the figure the expert considered the occurrence of material shortage unavailability level 1 very low having the relationships of bc and sc degree then the expert drew a bar covering the first four grids the mean value and times of drawing by the experts for each of the degrees of relationship were recorded along with calculation of the related frequency shown in table 2 in the same manner the related frequencies of the other risk factors were obtained the membership functions given in fig 7 can be drawn based on the related frequencies the membership grade at every occurrence level can be calculated using equation 3 3 μ l j μ k i 1 n y i n where l j is the occurrence level j of attributes μ k is the correlated status μ l j μ k is the membership grade l j while μ k y i is the relative frequency of l j and n is the number of division for each correlated status μ k the membership grades are given as 4 μ μ k μ l 1 μ k μ l 2 μ k μ l 3 μ k μ l 4 μ k μ l 5 μ k taking the material shortage unavailability as an example the membership grades of fuzzy sets were μ bc 0 79 0 26 0 00 0 00 0 00 μ sc 0 45 0 85 0 21 0 04 0 00 μ fc 0 04 0 39 0 77 0 56 0 17 μ hc 0 00 0 03 0 47 0 87 0 64 μ ec 0 00 0 00 0 04 0 35 0 88 to develop the membership grades of bc degree for the material shortage unavailability the occurrence probability was ranged from 0 to 100 with the membership grades of levels l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 corresponding to the values 20 40 60 80 100 respectively a value of zero was set for 0 and 100 with applicable linear interpolation shown in fig 8 3 2 7 defuzzify defuzzification is the process of estimating the value of the dependent variable based on the resulting fuzzy set after applying the fuzzy inference rule to deffizify each fuzzy membership function the center of area coa cheng and ko 2006 method was used given as 5 x i 1 n a i x i i 1 n a i the membership functions were divided into sub areas as illustrated in fig 8 and the data is shown in table 3 where a i is the total area of the triangle and x i is the x distance of the whole triangle the membership functions were divided into sub areas and were averaged to determine the center of area coa and then multiplied together to calculate the final defuzzified using equation 5 3 2 8 estimate bayesian network posterior probabilities prior and conditional probabilities are assigned for all nodes using the conditional probability tables i e tables representing the probability of possible outcomes of a variable when other variables are known bayesian inference rule was applied in order to determine the dependent posterior probabilities which are defined by these three important terms conditional probability probability of an event happening hypothesis given that another event has already occurred evidence see fig 9 a joint probability probability of two or more intersection events occurring see fig 9 b it can be expressed as the product of marginal probabilities and conditional probabilities using conditional independence relationships it is given as 6 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i parents x i 7 p m1 s3 w1 b1 c2 p c2 m1 b1 p b1 s3 w1 p m1 p s3 p w1 marginal probability probability of any single event occurring unconditioned on any other event s it can be computed from joint probabilities by summing out the unwanted events for example 8 p m 1 m 1 i c 1 i p m 1 m 1 i c 1 c 1 j bayes theorem also known as bayes rule describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence for example the probability of events m1 and c1 happening p m1 c1 using fig 9 a is the product of the probability of m1 p m1 and the probability of c1 given that m1 has occurred p c1 m1 therefore the probability of m1 given c1 is 9 bayesian network has an advantage over other expert assessment models due to the fact that it considers the relationship between the risk factors 3 3 mcs model construction process 3 3 1 define probability distributions monte carlo simulation mcs model uses probability distributions such as normal lognormal triangular beta pert pert etc to represent uncertainty depending on the range of values assigned the lognormal distribution is a form of normal distribution where the mean and standard deviation variables represent the logarithm in bayesian statistics the scalar magnitude or uncertainty is expressed as in that case a negative value does not have physical meaning lognormal distribution is able to solve this problem since negative values of the logarithm are tolerated meaning only that the uncertainty is less than one 3 3 2 random sample independent risk occurrences the mcs model generates large set of randomly generated numbers using the uncertain independent posterior variables i e w1 w2 and m1 from the bn model the independent variables were transformed into lognormal distributions to be able to be sampled by mcs depending on the number of iterations each simulation run gave values sampled from the lognormal distributions the mean values of each of the independent risk occurrence were used as evidence for the bn model 3 3 3 infer dependent risks using independent risks the sampled independent risk occurrences were used as evidence in the bn model to assess the dependent risks occurrences each conditional probability table of the independent nodes were fed with these new evidences they were then compiled to produce new dependent posterior probabilities the posterior probabilities were sent to the mcs model for further evaluation 3 3 4 random sample dependent risk occurrences the mcs model uses these probabilities to generate randomly generated numbers i e the rest of the nodes also the dependent variables were transformed into lognormal distributions the probability distributions were assigned with number of iterations and after simulation runs the mean values were produced and recorded 3 3 5 create a risk register risk registers are used to identify assess and manage risks to acceptable levels it is used as a management tool by project managers for monitoring risk management processes inputs for the risk register in this study were obtained through experts to identify the risks that have potential impact s on the total project schedule duration the details of risk register table will be displayed and described in the case study of the following chapter 3 3 6 evaluate risk impacts on affected project activities schedule risk analysis was conducted through the mcs add in model to determine the risks that have impact on the project schedule first the project s activities tasks from the microsoft project were imported in microsoft excel with the mcs add in these activities were assigned with risk functions to become the input variables for mcs to randomly sample the occurrences from the risk register were then mapped onto the affected project activities or tasks with the probability distributions and risk register the mcs model was able to run a simulation thereby estimating the total project duration when the risk events occur 3 3 7 determine correlation when project activities are influenced by the same factor it increases the variability of the path duration and neglecting it would affect the mean parameter correlations are a statistical measures applied when these risk s have an impact on the duration schedule e g spearman rank correlation analysis was used to calculate the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables i e between 1 and 1 3 3 8 interpret results the monte carlo simulation result shows graph distributions such as the probability density function pdf and the cumulative distribution function cdf representing the model s output i e total project duration the cdf plot helps to interpret the range of variability of the output i e whether the project is being above or below the actual project time the sensitivity analysis was performed to know how the input variables affected the output value and which inputs are the most critical ones this can assist project managers to prioritize which risk factor to concentrate on 4 case study and model application 4 1 taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project the taiwan power company taipower is taiwan s state owned utility power industry which produces green energy and wind power energy was one of the alternatives used to minimize the high dependency of the island s coal fired and nuclear powers since taiwan is a densely populated country with nearly two thirds of its land mountainous it makes land based wind power sites limited therefore the ocean became new area to utilize island s abundant wind resources changhua was chosen for offshore wind development due to relatively flat area and wind energy resources the utility company was awarded offshore wind demonstration incentive program in 2013 to increase sustainable energy production in the country the program requires installing two turbines as test models taipower s scope of the demonstration wind farm to be commissioned in june 2020 is 18 30 turbines the capacity of these wind turbines is 108 mw 110 mw with a unit capacity of 3 6 mw 6 0 mw which should be installed on a water depth of 15 26 m fig 10 shows the location map of taipower s offshore wind farm phase 1 project 4 2 data collection the historical case data collected for the 22 offshore wind turbines were from the following central weather bureau cwb taiwan offshore wind generation phase i project coastal utilization management manual taipower company limited status and prospects of taipower s offshore wind power taipower company limited also data collected for this research was based on literatures 1997 2017 and the remaining from experts knowledge seven decision makers with 10 years experience in risk analysis were interviewed through questionnaires judgments were made on 10 identified risk events and 191 project activities these questionnaires were used to calculate the membership grades for the risk events prior and conditional probability relationships were assigned by the experts between the identified risks in the bayesian network bn model through the questionnaires shown in fig 5 this study then used equations 6 9 to calculate the posterior probabilities and created a risk registry in microsoft excel which includes the risks their occurrences and schedule impact this registry was used to map the risks impacts on the affected project activities to know the risk inputs that might cause project delay 4 2 1 installation plan taipower planned to install its 22 offshore wind turbine units 7 2 8 km off fang yuan township changhua county most typhoons hit taiwan strait with an average wind speed of 25 32 m s and few for average wind speed of 33 m s considering the wind turbine units that can stand typhoon with wind speed of 33 m s a 5 0 mw capacity was chosen to be the main case for the project the proposed turbines will be composed of a downwind configuration which reduces wind loading by keeping the rotor oriented in such a way that it is not subjected to crosswinds even during shutdown due to strong gusts 4 2 2 transportation concepts for the offshore wind turbine installations towfp1p will be installed in a region that is sensitive to risks therefore the site location of the wind farm should be selected based on their resistance to wind and a period when it s safe for crane operations the installation concepts are related to the vessel size distance from port to site size of the turbine components and the lifting capacity of the onboard crane of the vessel which requires special attention when choosing the method of configuration currently the pre assembled rotor r2t in fig 11 is the development trend for offshore wind farms in europe which towfp1p wants to adopt r2t comprises of the hub and three blades which are assembled at the port the tower comes in two pieces with the nacelle placed on the same boat separately the time to install each wind turbine component sole depends on the wind speed limitations weight liftings peed of the crane and the experience of the engineer 4 3 fbn model application process 4 3 1 identify offshore wind turbine installation activities the identified owt installation activities specify the tasks needed to be done for the successful execution taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project towfp1p it requires a sufficient detail to estimate the time needed to complete them the main inputs are the scope consisting of the approved project scope statements and the work breakdown structure as mentioned in the previous sections towfp1p proposed the 5 mw capacity for the changhua project in that case the r2t configuration on a seajack vessel which can carry up to two wind turbines at a time from the port to the offshore wind farm site were identified as the suitable way of installing all the twenty two wind turbines on time 4 3 2 estimate project duration towfp1p schedule estimation was a complex task due to so many repeated activities involved fig 12 shows the detailed network of the first wind turbine installation in this case study 22 wind turbines are sequentially and repetitively required for installations the total estimated duration for the project was 848 days 4 3 3 identify risk factors the identified risks generated through returned experts survey illustrated in table 4 were applied on the installation activities of towfp1p this is a very useful step in this study because it helped to spot the potential risks that have potential impact on the total project duration 4 3 4 establish a bayesian network bn the bayesian network bn was constructed based on the identified risk factors above and the deffuzified membership grades in table 5 experts assigned relationships shown in fig 5 and probabilities using the defuzzified values to the root w1 w2 m1 intermediate m2 s1 s2 s3 b1 b2 b3 and leaf nodes c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 a case file was created consisting of 192 conditional probability table inputs in order to link it with the bayesian network software netica for evaluation 4 3 5 assign risks on affected project activities experts were asked to assign the 15 risks on the affected wind turbine project activities the same assignment as in fig 5 was used for taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project s activities since it has the same activities but with 22 wind turbines this time this step plays a vital role in project schedule risk assessment as they assist in determining the critical risk impacts on the project schedule duration in other words project managers or engineers are helped to focus on risks that might lead to a project schedule delay 4 3 6 identify membership grades the membership grades of each risk were determined by using the same steps in section 3 2 6 figs 7 and 13 illustrate the degree of occurrence and relationships from the returned questionnaire of expert 1 on the risk material shortage unavailability the membership grades at every occurrence level were summarized in table 5 4 3 7 deffuzify the coa method employed in this study generates a value that is the center of area of combined membership grades and takes into account the area of the union of the fuzzy sets the values in table 6 were calculated using equation 5 4 3 8 estimate bayesian posterior probabilities the following steps show how the bayesian network from the 192 case file were compiled or evaluated using the defuzzified probabilities modify the conditional probability tables cpts for example fig 14 shows the cpt for the risk node rainfall 4 4 mcs model application process 4 4 1 define probability distributions the lognormal distribution was applied in the mcs for the posterior probabilities generated through the fuzzy bayesian network model using microsoft excel with the monte carlo simulation add in software 4 4 2 random sample independent risk occurrences the independent probability distributions were randomly sampled in order to produce evidence for the dependent variables each individual risk was sampled with 1000 iterations after simulation run the data was collected and then averaged to be used later in determining the dependent variables 4 4 3 infer dependent risks using independent risks the averaged independent risks were returned back to the fbn model to evaluate the dependent posterior probabilities the same procedure as described in section 3 was applied 4 4 4 random sample dependent risk occurrences the dependent probability distributions generated through the independent random variables was also randomly sampled just as the individual risk the newly generated dependent risks were also sampled with 1000 iterations after simulation run the data were collected and then averaged 4 4 5 create a risk register the risk registers in table 7 was established to identify the potential risks in towfp1p in order to track the potential issues that can derail the intended outcomes it includes all information about each identified risk and their impacts on the project schedule this mechanism can be used by project managers put some mitigation measures in place in order to avoid project delays inputs for the risk register were obtained through experts to identify the risks that have potential impact s on the total project schedule so that mechanisms can be used by project managers put some mitigation measures in place in order to avoid project delays 4 4 6 evaluate risk impacts on affected project activities after each simulation run the days added from the schedule impacts are mapped onto the project activities that might be uncertain to complete on time which are highlighted in table 8 the project s activities extracted from the microsoft project was imported in microsoft excel with the mcs add in the activities were assigned with risk functions to become the input variables for mcs to randomly sample the occurrences from the risk register were then mapped onto the affected project activities or tasks with the probability distributions and risk register the mcs model was able to run a simulation thereby estimating the total project duration when the risk events occur 4 4 7 determine correlation fig 16 shows the coefficient values of the influencing factors on the output results i e the total project duration the result explained that heavy rainfall typhoon is more sensitive on the project duration it has a positive correlation coefficient of 0 57 i e the probability of heavy rainfall increasing will also increase the project duration by 0 57 4 4 8 interpret results the initial estimated duration for taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project installation was 848 days the probability density function pdf in fig 17 shows the relationship between the total project s outcome of an event and its frequency of occurrence the normal distribution statistics presented that the project will be finished with min value of 847 25 days max of 1007 65 days and mean 912 33 days with a standard deviation of 27 40 days this implies that when risk events are inherent with the project activities the uncertainty of the project was described by cumulative distribution function cdf shown in fig 18 which shows that there is 51 0 that the total duration of project will be delayed and 0 1 that it will be on time or below 4 4 9 crashed project schedule according to the simulation results in fig 18 the project will take 912 33 days to finish which makes it impossible for the project manager or general contractor to complete the project on time without crashing the project schedule in order to complete the project within 848 days the number of day s spent on wind turbine test and inspection which were 130 and 190 days respectively were crashed to 100 and 120 days respectively based on expert s optimistic estimation of the aforementioned project activities to finish within the expected days the crashed project schedule reduced to a total duration of 778 days another simulation was run for the new project duration to estimate the project completing within 848 days or below that the results in fig 19 shows a pdf with cdf overlay which illustrates that the project will be finished within 848 days at the probability of 63 5 5 conclusions the island of taiwan is faced with series of natural disasters such as floods typhoons etc which poses a threat to offshore wind installation furthermore the country is new to offshore wind development therefore there is limited data available to conduct risk analysis in this study fuzzy bayesian network monte carlo simulation fbn mcs was developed to provide means of solving these challenges the model proved to address the impacts of random and imprecise uncertainties on the schedule of offshore wind turbine installation when data is limited also the correlation of risks on the total project duration the fuzzy bayesian network fbn was able to incorporate insufficient data and uncertainties vague and random presented in the schedule of taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project monte carlo simulation mcs assessed the dependent posterior probabilities of the independent variables risk factors generated through the fbn model and included correlation among the influencing factors this helped in determining the probability of completion of the project considering risks the simulation results illustrate that the project will finish within 848 days at a probability of 63 5 it shows a min value of 777 61 days max of 939 45 days and mean 838 65 days with a standard deviation of 26 50 days this aforementioned model was applied on an offshore wind turbine installation project taipower offshore wind farm phase 1 project to assess its applicability it would be also beneficial to investigate the accuracy of this model by applying them on different construction projects such as buildings bridges tunneling etc where uncertainty and data limitation are usually existent in order to improve the results

in position by mooring lines are designed for protecting offshore structures from wave impact and providing a relatively peace sea region compared with fixed breakwaters built near the shore fbs are suitable in deep seas region if the motions are assumed to be two dimensional 2d they will move in three degrees of freedom dofs named surge heave and pitch several types of fbs have been proposed i e the box type the pontoon type the frame type the mat type the tethered floating type the horizontal plate type and other types dai et al 2018 box type fbs have been investigated extensively owing to its simple geometry whose wave attenuation mechanism is to reflect the incident waves as well as change the wave energy into the fluid internal energy through the damping of the structure and the flow turbulence in the past few decades many researchers have paid efforts to improve the performance of the box type fbs theoretical formulae were derived to predict the wave transmitted coefficient among which the most widely used formula was proposed by macagno 1953 based on the linear wave theory in this formula zero motion of fb no green water on top of the deck and constant water depth conditions were assumed during the last few decades williams et al 2000 studied the performance of two long box type fbs arranged side by side in which the 2d potential flow theory was adopted hong et al 2002 investigated the hydro elastic responses of a pontoon type structure which was considered to be a fb and allowed water passes through its opening then the performance of a submerged box type fb held by vertical and inclined mooring lines was studied by rahman et al 2006 who employed a 2d numerical model based on the volume of the fluid vof method and the navier stokes n s governing equations to investigate the wave breaking and vortices as the wave passes the fb diamantoulaki et al 2008 examined the effectiveness of a flexible fb under linear monochromatic incident waves in the frequency domain the hydro elastic responses and hydrodynamic interactions of two large floating fuel storage modules placed side by side with the presence of fbs were then studied by tay et al 2009 who adopted the linear wave theory during the modeling more importantly wang c m et al 2010 studied the performance of box type fbs under different load conditions and pointed out that the effectiveness of the fbs depends significantly on their width mooring systems and incident wave angles innovatively wang and sun 2010 proposed a porous fb with novel configurations and experimentally studied the its performance loukogeorgaki et al 2014 assessed the response of a fb under the action of the regular as well as irregular waves the examined fb consisted of floating modules connected with flexible connectors and moored to seabed by mooring chains it was concluded that the shape density and immersion depth of the fb mooring system and wave conditions are important parameters to affect the performance of box type fbs meringolo et al 2015 applied an enhanced sph model to simulate the interactions between regular waves with fully and partially perforated breakwaters and studied the dynamic pressures acting on the breakwaters and the wave reflections are studied in which the solid boundary technique of the fixed ghost particles based on interpolation nodes located within the fluid domain is extended to a multiple node method which decrease the cpu time cost in heavy sph simulations ren et al 2017 applied smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to simulate the interactions between the wave and a moored fb in which parametric analysis was implemented including density of the fb initial immersion depth of the deck as well as the ratio of box length to wave length reaching to similar conclusions as loukogeorgaki et al 2014 the work mentioned above mainly focus on the box type fbs but great performance and economics are hard to be reached at the same time in order to overcome this difficulty neelamani and rajendran 2002 proposed a type fb and carried out water tank experiments then gesraha 2006 proposed a new type fb with two thin side boards protruding vertically downward which is referred herein as π type wang et al 2015 studied the wave dissipation efficiency of a new curtain type flexible floating breakwater cffb by experiments in which a floating plate structure was set on the breakwater and it was found to be effective for improving the performance of cffb this indicates that the horizontal board can suppress the wave particle motions in the vertical direction same as the conclusion in the study by dai et al 2018 duan et al 2017 examined a f type fb based on linear potential flow theory the reflected transmitted and dissipated wave coefficients were studied most recently zhang et al 2018 designed a l type fb and compared its performance with that of the π fbs in which a finite volume solver was applied to run the numerical simulations it was found that for box type fbs the most direct way to improve the performance is adding protruding plates on the corners of the fb furthermore a new winged fb is proposed and the hydrodynamic performance were examined at last they concluded that changing the shape of the protruding plate can greatly enhance the box type fbs however where to add the protruding plates to provide the best performance of the winged fbs is still not clear with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd and the computer capability a number of numerical simulations based on n s equations were carried out to investigate the turbulence of the flow involved in the strong nonlinear wave structure interactions rahman et al 2006 used n s equation together with vof methods to do the simulations about the wave structure interactions the motions of the floating structures under different types of waves were examined and it was found that the computing model based on vof methods is feasible and shows good agreements with the experiments peng et al 2013 applied the immersed boundary method ibm proposed by peskin 1972 to deal with the inclined moored submerged fbs the motions of the fb and the water surface profile were studied to validate the numerical model however the numerical models mentioned above are based on eulerian method which have difficulties in dealing with the structures with complex geometries in this paper a winged box type fb is proposed sph method is adopted to run the simulations the effectiveness in wave attenuation of proposed winged box type fbs are calculated and compared with that of non winged ones through examining the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d in addition the motions of the fb and the velocity fields of the surrounding water are analyzed to clarify the mechanism of the wave attenuation furthermore the effectiveness of each protruding plate is examined this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the sph theory is presented as well as the equations of mooring system after that the validations of the sph mooring model using two experiments is presented in section 3 section 4 numerically examines the dynamic motions of the floating body as well as the wave attenuations the optimization of the distribution of the winged plates is also carried out in section 4 2 numerical method weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph model becker and teschner 2007 is used here which is greatly improved recently e g antuono et al 2010 aristodemo et al 2017 meringolo et al 2017 coupling with a mooring system solver based on lumped mass theory the developed sph mooring coupling codes will be validated against two existing experiments in section 3 and used to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the proposed winged fbs in section 4 n s equations are used to describe the dynamics of the fluids when dealing with the fluid driven moored floating bodies the hydrodynamic forces acting on the floating body are evaluated by summing up the interaction forces on the boundary particles from the neighboring fluid particles the reaction forces of mooring system are computed using lumped mass model then the motions of the moored fb can be determined using the newton s second law of motion the details of the numerical method are presented in the following subsections 2 1 sph governing equations sph is a meshless lagragian method with a highlight of easily treating complex geometries including the free surface of the water and the fluid solid interface which discretizes a continuum into a set of material particles the discretized n s equations are locally integrated at the location of each particle recently sph has been more and more widely applied in ocean engineering to solve a variety of nonlinear problems including dam breaking e g crespo et al 2008 yang et al 2016 xu 2016 wave slamming e g rui et al 2012 gotoh and khayyer 2016 liquid sloshing e g shao et al 2012 and wave structure interaction e g liu et al 2013 verbrugghe et al 2018 the motions of the fluid particles are governed by a momentum equation and a mass continuity equation becker and teschner 2007 as follows 1 d v d t 1 ρ p g m o m e n t u m e q u a t i o n 2 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b c o n t i n u i t y e q u a t i o n where g is the gravitational acceleration v denotes the velocity of the particles p represents the pressure at the position of the target particle m is the mass of the particle w means the smoothed kernel function whose expression is in eq 6 in the above equations the subscript a denotes the target particle and b denotes the neighboring particles within the support domain of the target particle in wcsph a state equation is used in which small changes in density result in large changes in pressure hence forcing the flow to be almost incompressible following the work of monaghan 1992 the relationship between the pressure and the density follows the expression 3 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 in which γ 7 b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 is the reference density and c 0 is the speed of sound which can be calculated by the following expression 4 c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 here c 0 should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity keeping the density variations within less than 1 and therefore not introducing major deviations from an incompressible approach artificial viscosity is used to replace the real viscosity of fluid and simulate a viscous flow substituting the artificial viscosity into the momentum equation then the formulation of eq 1 becomes 5 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a π a b a w a b g where w a b is the smoothed kernel function a quantic kernel suggested by wendland 1995 is adopted 6 w r h α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 w h e n 0 q 2 in which q r h represents the non dimensional distance between the target particle and the neighboring ones r denotes the real distance between them and h denotes the smoothed length α d 7 4 π h 2 when the simulation is two dimensional fig 1 shows the support domain of quantic kernel function in which k n h is the radius of support domain and k n 2 the real viscosity of fluid is neglected and an artificial viscosity term π a b is added in eq 5 to ensure the stability of numerical integration as well as provide a shear and bulk viscosity following monaghan 1992 the expression of π a b is 7 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b w h e n v a b r a b 0 0 w h e n v a b r a b 0 where v a b v a v b and r a b r a r b with v k and r k being the position and velocity of the particle k respectively μ a b h v a b r a b r a b 2 η 2 c a b 0 5 c a c b is the mean speed of sound η 2 0 01 h 2 and α is a coefficient needing to be tuned in order to introduce a proper dissipation in this paper α 0 01 is used following the work by altomare et al 2015 2 2 boundary condition of sph dynamic boundary condition dbc is used to treat the fluid solid boundaries dalrymple and knio 2001 this approach treats boundary particles satisfying the same equations as fluid particles however they do not move due to the forces exerted on them instead they remain either fixed or moved by an imposed motion function when a fluid particle approaches a set of boundary particles and the distance between boundary particles and fluid particles becomes smaller than twice the smoothing length the density of the affected boundary particles will increases resulting in a pressure increase in return a repulsive force is exerted on the fluid particle due to the pressure in the momentum equation as eq 1 using dbc there is no need to add a program to solve boundary conditions and it is easy to make regular or irregular motions for boundaries the fluid boundary interactions can be calculated inside the main loops which makes it easy to be applied during gpu acceleration 2 3 fluid driven floating body by assuming that the body is rigid the motions of the floating body can be described by newton s second law fig 1 shows the sketch of a fluid driven floating body the net force on each boundary particles is computed according to the sum of the contributions from all surrounding fluid particles based on the designated kernel function and the smoothed length therefore each boundary particle k experiences a force per unit mass by f k a s u r r o u n d i n g f k a where f k a is the force per unit mass exerted by the fluid particles a on the boundary particle k which is given by m k f k a m a f a k then the linear and angular equations of motion are written as follows 8 m d v d t k b o u n d a r y m k f k 9 i a d ω d t k ε b o u n d a r y m k r k r 0 f k in which m is the mass of the object i a is the moment of inertia v presents the linear velocity ω is the angular velocity and r 0 is the center of mass eqs 8 and 9 are integrated in each time step to predict the velocity of the floating body then the velocity of every particles in floating body can be updated using the following equation 10 v k v ω r k r 0 where v k is the velocity of particle k in the next time step the position of the particles in the floating body changes at the velocity of v k 2 4 passive wave absorption a damping zone is implemented as passive wave absorption system where the velocity of the particles reduces at each time step according to their locations but using quadratic decay rather than exponential in this way the velocity is modified following 11 v v 0 1 δ t β x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 where v 0 is the initial velocity of the particle i v is the final velocity δ t is the time step x is the position of the particle x 0 and x 1 are the initial and final position of the damping zone respectively the coefficient β modifies the reduction that is applied to the velocity 2 5 lumped mass approach a lumped mass approach is applied to calculate the cable dynamics the details of this approach can be referred in the study by hall and goupee 2015 the mooring chains or cables are divided into n evenly sized line segments connecting n 1 nodes as sketched in fig 2 a the index starts at the anchor with the node numbered as 0 and ends at the fairlead with the node numbered as n the cable segment between nodes i and i 1 is numbered as i 1 2 the forces on the cable contains buoyancy forces internal axial stiffness damping forces weight hydrodynamic forces determined form morison s equations as well as the forces from the contact with the seabed as illustrated in fig 2 b the net buoyancy of each segment i 1 2 is 12 w i 1 2 π 4 d 2 l ρ ρ c a b l e g where ρ 1 0 10 3 k g m 3 is the water density and g 9 8 m s 2 is the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity this force is evenly distributed among the two connecting nodes giving the net buoyancy at node i in vector form as 13 w i 1 2 w i 1 2 w i 1 2 e in which e is a unit vector in the positive z direction the tension in cable segment is 14 t i 1 2 e π 4 d 2 1 l 1 r i 1 r i r i 1 r i where e denotes the young s modulus d is the diameter of the mooring cable and l represents the length of a cable segment the tension force s direction at node i is defined as pointing from node i to node i 1 and this force is applied only if there is positive tension r i 1 r i l the internal damping force which is an important contributor to numerical stability is determined as follows 15 c i 1 2 c i n t π 4 d 2 ε i 1 2 r i 1 r i r i 1 r i 16 ε i 1 2 1 r i 1 r i l x i 1 x i x i 1 x i y i 1 y i y i 1 y i z i 1 z i z i 1 z i the first step is to resolve the relative fluid velocities and accelerations over the node points into the transverse and tangential components the transverse hydrodynamics loads on the cable are calculated using morison s equations treating the cable as a slender cylindrical structure the transverse drag force applied to node i is 17 d p i 1 2 ρ c d n d l r i q i q i r i r i q i q i r i in which c d n is the transverse drag coefficient q i is the tangential direction which can be calculated as 18 q i r i 1 r i r i 1 r i similarly tangential drag force can be calculated as 19 d q i 1 2 ρ c d t d l r i q i q i r i q i q i where c d t is the tangential drag coefficient the added mass force in the transverse direction is 20 a p i r i ρ c a n π 4 d 2 l r i q i q i r i in which c a n is the added mass coefficient in the transverse direction and a p i is the corresponding transverse added mass matrix similarly tangential added mass force can be calculated as 21 a q i r i ρ c a t π 4 d 2 l r i q i q i where c a t is the tangential added mass coefficient in the lumped mass formulations the mass of one cable segment is discretized into pointed mass at each node the mass matrix for node i can be expressed as m i π 4 d 2 l ρ c a b l e i where i is the identity matrix then the whole equation of the motion for each node can is 22 m i a i r i t i 1 2 t i 1 2 c i 1 2 c i 1 2 w i b i d p i d q i these are then solved using a constant time step second order runge kutta integration algorithm 2 6 coupled sph mooring model the codes consists of three main parts i e generation of the neighbor list computation of forces between particles and the updating of the physical quantities at the next time step the sph code and the mooring system solver is compiled to be a dynamically linked library the coupling between the sph model and lumped mass mooring model follows a loose coupling arrangement as defined in the work of jonkman 2013 for details in each time step of sph the hydrodynamic loads on the floating body are calculated then sph transmits the position and velocity to the mooring model followed by the solution of the fairlead kinematics and the mooring line motions finally the resulted mooring forces are transmitted back to the sph model and the motions of the floating body are solved fig 3 shows the flow chart of the whole program 2 7 representative parameters in the present sph the time step size δt in sph is approximately 2 10 3 s and the resulted courant friedrichs lewy cfl number is 0 2 the distance of the particles d p equals to 0 01 m and the smoothed length h is set to be 1 5d p symplectic algorithm as well as the quantic kernel function is adopted artificial viscosity is used to replace the real viscosity for ensuring the integration stability and providing shear and bulk viscosity in the mooring system the diameter d and mass per unit length m l of the mooring line are 0 001 m and 0 001 kg m 1 respectively so that the total gravity and the hydrodynamic forces of the mooring chains are negligibly smaller than the net buoyancy of the modeled fb furthermore to prevent the mooring lines from stretching a large cable stiffness k c a b l e 1 10 6 n m 1 is used the coefficients c an 1 0 c at 1 0 10 6 c dn 1 6 and c dt 0 05 have been tried and show the best performance the time step size for modeling the dynamics of the mooring lines δt m equals to 2 10 5 s to improve the computational effectiveness the codes is running using gpu acceleration based on cuda toolkits the gpu applied in this study is nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti the representative parameters and the computing device configurations are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 validations of the sph model in this section the sph mooring coupling codes are validated against two test cases the first one is a freely floating body and the second one is a moored box type fb 3 1 freely floating body a numerical simulation of wave interaction with a freely floating body following the work by ren et al 2015 is adopted a sketch of the experiment setup is shown in fig 4 a the flume is 23 m long and 0 44 m wide with an initial water depth of 0 4 m a piston type wavemaker is set at one side of the flume and a wave absorber is placed on the other side a freely floating rectangle box is located in the middle of the flume with a density of 500 kg m 3 the width of the fb b is 0 3 m and the height of the fb h f is 0 15 m a total of 2 cm gap is in between the lateral sides of the box and the sidewalls of the flume so this case can be seen as 2d the body can move freely in three dofs as surge heave and pitch numerical geometry in sph simulation is the same as the experimental ones as shown in fig 4 b a reference coordinate whose origin is located at the centroid of the floating body whose x positive right wards z positive up wards and rotation positive counter clockwise a piston type wave maker is located at the left side of the flume to generate regular waves with a period of t a 1 2 s and a height of h a 0 10 m on the other side a wave absorber of 2 0 m is adopted to decrease the effects of the reflected waves a total number of 63598 particles including 1524 fixed boundary particles 200 moving particles 558 floating particles and 61316 fluid particles are involved the motions of the floating box are depicted in fig 5 the heave motion δ z and the pitch motion θ show simple harmonic oscillations with the same period of incoming wave the surge motion δ x presents not only a simple harmonic but also a drift motion in the wave propagating direction due to the existence of the drift force which also makes the heave and pitch motions asymmetry about the equilibrium position i e the positive displacement of δ x is greater than that of negative direction the counter clockwise rotation is greater than that of clockwise as observed in fig 5 that the velocity of drift motion in sph simulation is slightly smaller than that in experiment generally speaking sph results shows good agreements with the experimental data and the numerical sph data by ren et al 2015 and can be used to simulate the interaction between the waves and floating bodies 3 2 moored box type fb the sph mooring coupling codes are further validated through the experiments by peng et al 2013 about the interaction between the waves and a fb the experiments were carried out in a 2d wave flume the wave tank is 30 m long 0 7 m wide and 0 9 m deep as shown in fig 6 a a piston type wave maker is installed at one side of the wave flume on the other side a wave absorber made of rubble mound was used to reduce the effects of reflected waves a box type fb of b 0 4 m h f 0 15 m and with a density of 700 kg m 3 is located at about halfway between the wave maker and the wave absorber the mooring system consists of four chains which are carefully arranged to ensure a good symmetry along x and y directions the fb is anchored to the bottom with a 60 inclination at the initial moment the immersion depth of the fb d 1 is 0 102 m the water surface elevations near the fb are recorded using four wave gauges 1 4 as shown in fig 6 a gauge 1 and gauge 2 are installed 1 95 m and 1 2 m away from the fb at the seaside respectively while gauge 3 and gauge 4 are installed 1 2 m and 1 65 m away from the fb at the leeside respectively fig 6 b shows the sketch of the numerical wave tank in this validation case same as that in the experiment the mass center of the fb is located at 0 0 0 102 m the mass and moment of inertia are 42 kg and 0 638 kg m2 respectively in addition a piston type wave maker is set at the left side of the flume to generate two regular waves i e one is with t b1 0 8 s and h b1 0 033 m and the other is with t b2 1 0 s and h b2 0 046 m the length of the damping zone is 2 3 m a total number of 42368 particles including 868 fixed boundary particles 200 moving particles 744 floating particles and 40556 fluid particles are involved in this simulation smaller than that of 48222 particles in the work by ren et al 2017 the computational time for running a simulation up to 20s is about 21 min with the gpu card mentioned in section 2 6 and is more effective than that of 20s 7h using an intel core i7 4790 cpu 3 5 ghz which indicates the improvement in decreasing computational time cost using gpu acceleration in sph no experimental results showed in the work of peng et al 2013 for the motions when t b1 0 8 s therefore only the motions of the fb between numerical and experimental results for t b2 1 0 s are compared as shown in fig 7 little discrepancy is found in the motions of heave and pitch components it can be seen that the motions of moored fbs are more complicated than that of freely floating bodies surge and pitch components move in the same phase and a half cycle faster than heave owing to the drift force the surge and pitch motions are asymmetric about the equilibrium position the displacement in positive x and rotation in counter clockwise are greater than that in the opposite direction as for the heave motion because the elongation of the mooring chains is negligible due to large axial stiffness the highest position in z direction is the initial position when the wave peaks act on the fb it moves down and right first then comes back to the equilibrium position on the other hand when the wave troughs act on the fb it moves down and left first then comes back to the equilibrium position again this is the reason why there are two troughs and crests in heave component during one period even the secondary troughs in heave component of sph results are a little flatter than that of experiment we can generally say that the sph mooring coupling codes show satisfactory agreements with experiments for the fb motions fig 8 shows the time series of the wave surface elevations at gauges 1 4 at the seaside the water surface profiles are synchronous whose period is the same as that of the incoming wave reflected waves produced at the left side of the fb are strengthened at the seaside from fig 8 it can be seen also that wave height at gauge 2 is 1 22 times as high as the incoming wave when t b1 0 8 s at the leeside the wave amplitude decreases sharply because of the wave energy attenuation by the fb the water surface shows a nonlinear profile with steepened wave crests and flattened wave troughs at the leeside which can also be identified in sph results when t b2 1 0 s the results show that the propagation waves break over the fb at the leeside wave decomposition takes place and higher harmonics are generated but complex wave profile with double crests on the leeward is not reproduced adequately the secondary peaks and troughs are smaller than that of experimental results it maybe resulted from that the artificial viscosity introducing bigger damping force to generate higher harmonics as mentioned in the work of ren et al 2017 overall sph results show good comparison with the experimental ones and the sph mooring coupling codes is reliable to be used in the simulations of the interactions between waves and moored fbs 4 simulations and optimizations of winged fbs in this section by adding protruding plates on the corners of a box type fb a new type of winged box type fbs is proposed and a series of numerical simulations are carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of the proposed fb the effects of each plate are studied systematically by examining the motions of the fb and the surrounding flow fields at last the best locations of the protruding plates are identified at different wave conditions 4 1 case settings the sketch of the winged box type fb with 8 plates is shown in fig 9 the density of fluid and fb water depth immersion depth and mooring configurations are kept as same as those in section 3 2 eight protruding plates numbering from 1 to 8 are added at each corner in both horizontal and vertical directions following the work by zhang et al 2018 the length of the protruding plates is set to 0 25 times the width of fb and thickness t f is set to be 0 02 m the characteristic wave periods t i are set in between 0 8 s and 1 6 s and the corresponding frequencies f i is from 0 625 hz to 1 25 hz the simulated wave height h i is 1 30 of the wave length λ i the simulated load conditions lcs are summarized in table 3 in the simulations the incident waves and reflected waves resonate with each other generating a standing wave at the seaside therefore the distance between at the wavemaker and the center of fb is tuned and at last set to be 1 78 times as long as λ i in each lc all protruding plates are homogenous and have the same property with the fb and for each lc both winged fb and non winged fb are calculated simultaneously the particles as well as the properties of the mooring lines used in these simulations are same as those in the validation case of a moored box type fb in section 3 2 4 2 numerical results fig 10 shows the comparison of water elevations at gauge3 and gauge4 the graphics on the left hand side is the time series of water elevations and the ones on the right hand side is the corresponding results in the frequency domain determined by fast fourier transformation fft it can be observed that the wave decomposition occurs on the leeside of the fb and higher harmonics are generated due to the wave breaking on the deck of the non winged fb in lc2 it is clear that the protruding plates can eliminate high frequency harmonics effectively however in lc3 and lc4 the wave amplitudes of the main low frequency harmonic are nearly the same no matter the winged plated is added or no but for the winged fb the amplitudes of the high frequency harmonics are less than that of non winged one indicating that the protruding plates reduce wave decomposition at the leeside the motions of the fb for winged and non winged ones are shown in fig 11 the results in lcs1 4 are all plotted to make a comparison of motions clearly from fig 11 it can be seen that the motions of the fb becomes more violent as the period of the wave increases but this growth shows a converging trend due to the existence of the mooring system as increasing the height of the wave the incoming wave energy and the drift forces acting on the fb become larger as a result the gap between the negative and positive motions for surge and pitch turns to be more obvious it is important that the motions of winged fb is much smaller than that of non winged one which should be due to the large added mass and resistant forces provided by the protruding plates therefore it can be imagined that the protruding plates can reduce the reflected wave coefficient k r significantly for winged and non winged fbs in lcs1 4 the velocity fields at different time instants are depicted in fig 12 15 respectively where the positions of the fbs and the mooring lines are also shown the red dashed circles indicate the energetic vortices it can been seen that when the incident waves interact with the fbs the flow fields around the fbs will generate a series of vortices which occur and propagate mainly at the lower corners of the fbs from fig 13 it can be seen that very few vortices are generated at the leeside when the shape of fb is a simply box but for winged fb more energetic vortices occur due to the disturbance to the flow from the protruding plates 5 and 6 it is interesting that almost all vortices are generate at the lower corner or the lower plates the upper corner of non winged fb and the plates 1 4 in the winged fb show little contributions in the vortices generation further comparing the velocity fields of the winged and non winged fbs it can be seen that the flow around the non winged fb is more smooth and steady than that around the winged fb which is very turbulent due to the interaction between the plates and the waves considering that the turbulence is the main source dissipating the wave energy into internal energy it can be imagined that the protruding plates can effectively increase the dissipated wave coefficient k d furthermore it is important to point out that the generated vortices are more obvious in high frequency lcs lc1 lc2 whereas there is almost no vortex generated in lc3 and lc4 no matter the plates are added or no in order to examine the performance of the proposed fb in a more quantitative way the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d will be investigated further k r represents the ratio of reflected wave height to the incident wave height k t is the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incident wave height and k d represents the energy proportion converted to interval energy due to the energy conservation of the incoming wave a balanced relationship can be setup based on the first order wave theory after the transitional period the incoming wave energy will either be reflected transmitted or dissipated into heat 23 e i n e r e t e d in which e in is the incoming wave energy e r and e t present the reflected wave energy and transmitted wave energy respectively dividing e i n on both sides of the equation following the relationship of wave energy and wave height e h 2 we can reach to 24 k r 2 k t 2 k d 2 1 the reflected wave heights at the seaside are computed using the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 fast fourier transform fft is adopted to analyze the synthetic waves at the leeside then k r k t and k d can be determined it can be seen from fig 16 a that k r increases as the frequency or b λ increases and the winged fb shows better performance than non winged one in reflecting wave energy after the introduction of the plates the reflected wave coefficients increase 11 92 at wave frequency 0 625 hz and 17 39 at wave frequency 1 25 hz different with the fixed breakwaters which almost reflects all incoming wave energy the reflected wave coefficient of fb is affected by the motions of the breakwater therefore the increasing in reflected wave coefficient is also the indication of the decreasing of the fb motions from fig 16 b it can be seen that k t decreases as the frequency or b λ increases the winged fb shows better performance in wave attenuation than non winged one the transmitted wave coefficients decrease 5 96 at wave frequency 0 625 hz and 50 4 and at wave frequency 1 25 hz for low frequency condition like lc4 the performance of the box type fb is limited and it can be said that small size box type fbs are transparent additionally adding protruding plates does not show obvious improvement at the low frequency lc on the contrary for the higher frequency conditions like lc1 the value of b λ is small enough therefore protruding plates can improve the performance of the fb greatly moreover the wave heights of main frequency harmonics are greatly reduced by protruding plates therefore we can safely say that the advantages of protruding plates are obvious based on a well designed box type fb for k d as shown in fig 16 c it can be found that the winged fb dissipates more wave energy and the dissipated wave coefficient increases as the frequency increases it is due to the fact that more vortices and turbulence around the protruding plates increase the dissipated wave energy meanwhile the flow path becomes longer when the vortices pass by the winged fb overall the motions of the winged fb are smaller than that of non winged one owing to larger added mass provided by the protruding plates which can also disturb the water flow when interact with waves as a result generating more vortices to dissipate more wave energy therefore the winged fb has larger reflected wave coefficient and dissipated wave coefficient smaller transmitted wave coefficient than the non winged one showing a great improvement for box type fbs 4 3 numerical simulations with seven winged fbs in this section the effects of single one protruding plate are studied by simulating the same lcs listed in table 3 but with one protruding plate removed from eight winged fb each time there are eight new shapes of winged fb as shown in table 4 and totally 32 simulations are run the results are compared with that of eight winged fb and the best locations to add protruding plates are identified for different lcs fig 17 shows the comparison of transmitted wave coefficient for eight winged and seven winged fbs the horizontal axis in fig 17 represents the reduction percentage of transmitted wave coefficient when one of the plates is removed positive value means it is useful and negative value means it is harmful it can be seen that the plate has different effects at different frequency when frequency is 1 25 hz plate 1 and 4 are important to improve the wave attenuation performance of winged fb and the others is harmful when frequency is 1 0 hz plate 1 2 5 6 and 7 are useful for frequency 0 76 hz plate 1 2 5 6 7 and 8 are useful and for frequency 0 625 hz they are 2 5 6 7 and 8 it can be observed that plate 3 is always harmful for the winged fb from fig 12 15 we cannot find not any vortices around plate 3 and when the fb interact with waves with harmonic motions in surge and pitch components it features like a paddle type wavemaker generating waves on the leeside of the fb it should be the reason of the harmfulness of plate 3 the histogram of fig 17 is useful to identify where to add protruding plates according to local distributed wave periods and distributed wave heights figs 18 and 19 shows the comparison of reflected and dissipated wave coefficient for eight winged and seven winged fbs respectively assuming that the smaller the k t and the bigger the k r and k d the better the wave attenuation performance positive value means it is harmful and negative value means it is useful which is contrary with fig 17 it can be seen that plate 2 and 5 are always harmful and plate 8 is always useful in enhancing the reflected waves in the studied cases as well plate 3 and 4 are always harmful and plate 2 5 and 7 are always useful in enhancing the dissipate wave energy for winged fb from figs 12 15 it is found that most vortices occur around plate 5 and 7 which maybe the reason of benefits of plate 5 and 7 5 conclusions in this paper sph method is adopted and lumped mass approach is coupled with the sph model a sph mooring coupling code is developed which is greatly improved by implementing gpu acceleration based on cuda toolkits the motions of fb and velocity fields of fluid around the fb are also studied to understand the effects of protruding plates the best locations to add the protruding plates are identified in the end the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the sph mooring coupling codes are validated against two existing experiments and gets good agreements which means that the codes are robust enough to simulate interactions between waves and moored floating structures 2 a winged fb with eight plates is proposed for low frequency wave conditions wave decompositions are generated on the leeside of the fb protruding plates are effective for reducing wave decomposition and wave energy of higher frequency components 3 when fluid move upward at the seaside vortices rotate in clockwise and when fluid move downward vortices rotate in contour clockwise interestingly vortices are mainly around the lower corner or plates more vortices will occur due to the spoiler of protruding plates 4 winged fb has larger reflected wave coefficient and dissipated wave coefficient smaller transmitted wave coefficient than the non winged one showing a great improvement for box type fbs 5 for different lcs one protruding plate may show different effects for fb importantly it is not always true to improve the performance of a fb by adding protruding plates the vertical protruding plate at the top leeside corner is found to be always

in position by mooring lines are designed for protecting offshore structures from wave impact and providing a relatively peace sea region compared with fixed breakwaters built near the shore fbs are suitable in deep seas region if the motions are assumed to be two dimensional 2d they will move in three degrees of freedom dofs named surge heave and pitch several types of fbs have been proposed i e the box type the pontoon type the frame type the mat type the tethered floating type the horizontal plate type and other types dai et al 2018 box type fbs have been investigated extensively owing to its simple geometry whose wave attenuation mechanism is to reflect the incident waves as well as change the wave energy into the fluid internal energy through the damping of the structure and the flow turbulence in the past few decades many researchers have paid efforts to improve the performance of the box type fbs theoretical formulae were derived to predict the wave transmitted coefficient among which the most widely used formula was proposed by macagno 1953 based on the linear wave theory in this formula zero motion of fb no green water on top of the deck and constant water depth conditions were assumed during the last few decades williams et al 2000 studied the performance of two long box type fbs arranged side by side in which the 2d potential flow theory was adopted hong et al 2002 investigated the hydro elastic responses of a pontoon type structure which was considered to be a fb and allowed water passes through its opening then the performance of a submerged box type fb held by vertical and inclined mooring lines was studied by rahman et al 2006 who employed a 2d numerical model based on the volume of the fluid vof method and the navier stokes n s governing equations to investigate the wave breaking and vortices as the wave passes the fb diamantoulaki et al 2008 examined the effectiveness of a flexible fb under linear monochromatic incident waves in the frequency domain the hydro elastic responses and hydrodynamic interactions of two large floating fuel storage modules placed side by side with the presence of fbs were then studied by tay et al 2009 who adopted the linear wave theory during the modeling more importantly wang c m et al 2010 studied the performance of box type fbs under different load conditions and pointed out that the effectiveness of the fbs depends significantly on their width mooring systems and incident wave angles innovatively wang and sun 2010 proposed a porous fb with novel configurations and experimentally studied the its performance loukogeorgaki et al 2014 assessed the response of a fb under the action of the regular as well as irregular waves the examined fb consisted of floating modules connected with flexible connectors and moored to seabed by mooring chains it was concluded that the shape density and immersion depth of the fb mooring system and wave conditions are important parameters to affect the performance of box type fbs meringolo et al 2015 applied an enhanced sph model to simulate the interactions between regular waves with fully and partially perforated breakwaters and studied the dynamic pressures acting on the breakwaters and the wave reflections are studied in which the solid boundary technique of the fixed ghost particles based on interpolation nodes located within the fluid domain is extended to a multiple node method which decrease the cpu time cost in heavy sph simulations ren et al 2017 applied smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to simulate the interactions between the wave and a moored fb in which parametric analysis was implemented including density of the fb initial immersion depth of the deck as well as the ratio of box length to wave length reaching to similar conclusions as loukogeorgaki et al 2014 the work mentioned above mainly focus on the box type fbs but great performance and economics are hard to be reached at the same time in order to overcome this difficulty neelamani and rajendran 2002 proposed a type fb and carried out water tank experiments then gesraha 2006 proposed a new type fb with two thin side boards protruding vertically downward which is referred herein as π type wang et al 2015 studied the wave dissipation efficiency of a new curtain type flexible floating breakwater cffb by experiments in which a floating plate structure was set on the breakwater and it was found to be effective for improving the performance of cffb this indicates that the horizontal board can suppress the wave particle motions in the vertical direction same as the conclusion in the study by dai et al 2018 duan et al 2017 examined a f type fb based on linear potential flow theory the reflected transmitted and dissipated wave coefficients were studied most recently zhang et al 2018 designed a l type fb and compared its performance with that of the π fbs in which a finite volume solver was applied to run the numerical simulations it was found that for box type fbs the most direct way to improve the performance is adding protruding plates on the corners of the fb furthermore a new winged fb is proposed and the hydrodynamic performance were examined at last they concluded that changing the shape of the protruding plate can greatly enhance the box type fbs however where to add the protruding plates to provide the best performance of the winged fbs is still not clear with the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd and the computer capability a number of numerical simulations based on n s equations were carried out to investigate the turbulence of the flow involved in the strong nonlinear wave structure interactions rahman et al 2006 used n s equation together with vof methods to do the simulations about the wave structure interactions the motions of the floating structures under different types of waves were examined and it was found that the computing model based on vof methods is feasible and shows good agreements with the experiments peng et al 2013 applied the immersed boundary method ibm proposed by peskin 1972 to deal with the inclined moored submerged fbs the motions of the fb and the water surface profile were studied to validate the numerical model however the numerical models mentioned above are based on eulerian method which have difficulties in dealing with the structures with complex geometries in this paper a winged box type fb is proposed sph method is adopted to run the simulations the effectiveness in wave attenuation of proposed winged box type fbs are calculated and compared with that of non winged ones through examining the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d in addition the motions of the fb and the velocity fields of the surrounding water are analyzed to clarify the mechanism of the wave attenuation furthermore the effectiveness of each protruding plate is examined this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the sph theory is presented as well as the equations of mooring system after that the validations of the sph mooring model using two experiments is presented in section 3 section 4 numerically examines the dynamic motions of the floating body as well as the wave attenuations the optimization of the distribution of the winged plates is also carried out in section 4 2 numerical method weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics wcsph model becker and teschner 2007 is used here which is greatly improved recently e g antuono et al 2010 aristodemo et al 2017 meringolo et al 2017 coupling with a mooring system solver based on lumped mass theory the developed sph mooring coupling codes will be validated against two existing experiments in section 3 and used to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the proposed winged fbs in section 4 n s equations are used to describe the dynamics of the fluids when dealing with the fluid driven moored floating bodies the hydrodynamic forces acting on the floating body are evaluated by summing up the interaction forces on the boundary particles from the neighboring fluid particles the reaction forces of mooring system are computed using lumped mass model then the motions of the moored fb can be determined using the newton s second law of motion the details of the numerical method are presented in the following subsections 2 1 sph governing equations sph is a meshless lagragian method with a highlight of easily treating complex geometries including the free surface of the water and the fluid solid interface which discretizes a continuum into a set of material particles the discretized n s equations are locally integrated at the location of each particle recently sph has been more and more widely applied in ocean engineering to solve a variety of nonlinear problems including dam breaking e g crespo et al 2008 yang et al 2016 xu 2016 wave slamming e g rui et al 2012 gotoh and khayyer 2016 liquid sloshing e g shao et al 2012 and wave structure interaction e g liu et al 2013 verbrugghe et al 2018 the motions of the fluid particles are governed by a momentum equation and a mass continuity equation becker and teschner 2007 as follows 1 d v d t 1 ρ p g m o m e n t u m e q u a t i o n 2 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b c o n t i n u i t y e q u a t i o n where g is the gravitational acceleration v denotes the velocity of the particles p represents the pressure at the position of the target particle m is the mass of the particle w means the smoothed kernel function whose expression is in eq 6 in the above equations the subscript a denotes the target particle and b denotes the neighboring particles within the support domain of the target particle in wcsph a state equation is used in which small changes in density result in large changes in pressure hence forcing the flow to be almost incompressible following the work of monaghan 1992 the relationship between the pressure and the density follows the expression 3 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 in which γ 7 b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 is the reference density and c 0 is the speed of sound which can be calculated by the following expression 4 c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 here c 0 should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity keeping the density variations within less than 1 and therefore not introducing major deviations from an incompressible approach artificial viscosity is used to replace the real viscosity of fluid and simulate a viscous flow substituting the artificial viscosity into the momentum equation then the formulation of eq 1 becomes 5 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a π a b a w a b g where w a b is the smoothed kernel function a quantic kernel suggested by wendland 1995 is adopted 6 w r h α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 w h e n 0 q 2 in which q r h represents the non dimensional distance between the target particle and the neighboring ones r denotes the real distance between them and h denotes the smoothed length α d 7 4 π h 2 when the simulation is two dimensional fig 1 shows the support domain of quantic kernel function in which k n h is the radius of support domain and k n 2 the real viscosity of fluid is neglected and an artificial viscosity term π a b is added in eq 5 to ensure the stability of numerical integration as well as provide a shear and bulk viscosity following monaghan 1992 the expression of π a b is 7 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b w h e n v a b r a b 0 0 w h e n v a b r a b 0 where v a b v a v b and r a b r a r b with v k and r k being the position and velocity of the particle k respectively μ a b h v a b r a b r a b 2 η 2 c a b 0 5 c a c b is the mean speed of sound η 2 0 01 h 2 and α is a coefficient needing to be tuned in order to introduce a proper dissipation in this paper α 0 01 is used following the work by altomare et al 2015 2 2 boundary condition of sph dynamic boundary condition dbc is used to treat the fluid solid boundaries dalrymple and knio 2001 this approach treats boundary particles satisfying the same equations as fluid particles however they do not move due to the forces exerted on them instead they remain either fixed or moved by an imposed motion function when a fluid particle approaches a set of boundary particles and the distance between boundary particles and fluid particles becomes smaller than twice the smoothing length the density of the affected boundary particles will increases resulting in a pressure increase in return a repulsive force is exerted on the fluid particle due to the pressure in the momentum equation as eq 1 using dbc there is no need to add a program to solve boundary conditions and it is easy to make regular or irregular motions for boundaries the fluid boundary interactions can be calculated inside the main loops which makes it easy to be applied during gpu acceleration 2 3 fluid driven floating body by assuming that the body is rigid the motions of the floating body can be described by newton s second law fig 1 shows the sketch of a fluid driven floating body the net force on each boundary particles is computed according to the sum of the contributions from all surrounding fluid particles based on the designated kernel function and the smoothed length therefore each boundary particle k experiences a force per unit mass by f k a s u r r o u n d i n g f k a where f k a is the force per unit mass exerted by the fluid particles a on the boundary particle k which is given by m k f k a m a f a k then the linear and angular equations of motion are written as follows 8 m d v d t k b o u n d a r y m k f k 9 i a d ω d t k ε b o u n d a r y m k r k r 0 f k in which m is the mass of the object i a is the moment of inertia v presents the linear velocity ω is the angular velocity and r 0 is the center of mass eqs 8 and 9 are integrated in each time step to predict the velocity of the floating body then the velocity of every particles in floating body can be updated using the following equation 10 v k v ω r k r 0 where v k is the velocity of particle k in the next time step the position of the particles in the floating body changes at the velocity of v k 2 4 passive wave absorption a damping zone is implemented as passive wave absorption system where the velocity of the particles reduces at each time step according to their locations but using quadratic decay rather than exponential in this way the velocity is modified following 11 v v 0 1 δ t β x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 where v 0 is the initial velocity of the particle i v is the final velocity δ t is the time step x is the position of the particle x 0 and x 1 are the initial and final position of the damping zone respectively the coefficient β modifies the reduction that is applied to the velocity 2 5 lumped mass approach a lumped mass approach is applied to calculate the cable dynamics the details of this approach can be referred in the study by hall and goupee 2015 the mooring chains or cables are divided into n evenly sized line segments connecting n 1 nodes as sketched in fig 2 a the index starts at the anchor with the node numbered as 0 and ends at the fairlead with the node numbered as n the cable segment between nodes i and i 1 is numbered as i 1 2 the forces on the cable contains buoyancy forces internal axial stiffness damping forces weight hydrodynamic forces determined form morison s equations as well as the forces from the contact with the seabed as illustrated in fig 2 b the net buoyancy of each segment i 1 2 is 12 w i 1 2 π 4 d 2 l ρ ρ c a b l e g where ρ 1 0 10 3 k g m 3 is the water density and g 9 8 m s 2 is the magnitude of acceleration due to gravity this force is evenly distributed among the two connecting nodes giving the net buoyancy at node i in vector form as 13 w i 1 2 w i 1 2 w i 1 2 e in which e is a unit vector in the positive z direction the tension in cable segment is 14 t i 1 2 e π 4 d 2 1 l 1 r i 1 r i r i 1 r i where e denotes the young s modulus d is the diameter of the mooring cable and l represents the length of a cable segment the tension force s direction at node i is defined as pointing from node i to node i 1 and this force is applied only if there is positive tension r i 1 r i l the internal damping force which is an important contributor to numerical stability is determined as follows 15 c i 1 2 c i n t π 4 d 2 ε i 1 2 r i 1 r i r i 1 r i 16 ε i 1 2 1 r i 1 r i l x i 1 x i x i 1 x i y i 1 y i y i 1 y i z i 1 z i z i 1 z i the first step is to resolve the relative fluid velocities and accelerations over the node points into the transverse and tangential components the transverse hydrodynamics loads on the cable are calculated using morison s equations treating the cable as a slender cylindrical structure the transverse drag force applied to node i is 17 d p i 1 2 ρ c d n d l r i q i q i r i r i q i q i r i in which c d n is the transverse drag coefficient q i is the tangential direction which can be calculated as 18 q i r i 1 r i r i 1 r i similarly tangential drag force can be calculated as 19 d q i 1 2 ρ c d t d l r i q i q i r i q i q i where c d t is the tangential drag coefficient the added mass force in the transverse direction is 20 a p i r i ρ c a n π 4 d 2 l r i q i q i r i in which c a n is the added mass coefficient in the transverse direction and a p i is the corresponding transverse added mass matrix similarly tangential added mass force can be calculated as 21 a q i r i ρ c a t π 4 d 2 l r i q i q i where c a t is the tangential added mass coefficient in the lumped mass formulations the mass of one cable segment is discretized into pointed mass at each node the mass matrix for node i can be expressed as m i π 4 d 2 l ρ c a b l e i where i is the identity matrix then the whole equation of the motion for each node can is 22 m i a i r i t i 1 2 t i 1 2 c i 1 2 c i 1 2 w i b i d p i d q i these are then solved using a constant time step second order runge kutta integration algorithm 2 6 coupled sph mooring model the codes consists of three main parts i e generation of the neighbor list computation of forces between particles and the updating of the physical quantities at the next time step the sph code and the mooring system solver is compiled to be a dynamically linked library the coupling between the sph model and lumped mass mooring model follows a loose coupling arrangement as defined in the work of jonkman 2013 for details in each time step of sph the hydrodynamic loads on the floating body are calculated then sph transmits the position and velocity to the mooring model followed by the solution of the fairlead kinematics and the mooring line motions finally the resulted mooring forces are transmitted back to the sph model and the motions of the floating body are solved fig 3 shows the flow chart of the whole program 2 7 representative parameters in the present sph the time step size δt in sph is approximately 2 10 3 s and the resulted courant friedrichs lewy cfl number is 0 2 the distance of the particles d p equals to 0 01 m and the smoothed length h is set to be 1 5d p symplectic algorithm as well as the quantic kernel function is adopted artificial viscosity is used to replace the real viscosity for ensuring the integration stability and providing shear and bulk viscosity in the mooring system the diameter d and mass per unit length m l of the mooring line are 0 001 m and 0 001 kg m 1 respectively so that the total gravity and the hydrodynamic forces of the mooring chains are negligibly smaller than the net buoyancy of the modeled fb furthermore to prevent the mooring lines from stretching a large cable stiffness k c a b l e 1 10 6 n m 1 is used the coefficients c an 1 0 c at 1 0 10 6 c dn 1 6 and c dt 0 05 have been tried and show the best performance the time step size for modeling the dynamics of the mooring lines δt m equals to 2 10 5 s to improve the computational effectiveness the codes is running using gpu acceleration based on cuda toolkits the gpu applied in this study is nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti the representative parameters and the computing device configurations are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively 3 validations of the sph model in this section the sph mooring coupling codes are validated against two test cases the first one is a freely floating body and the second one is a moored box type fb 3 1 freely floating body a numerical simulation of wave interaction with a freely floating body following the work by ren et al 2015 is adopted a sketch of the experiment setup is shown in fig 4 a the flume is 23 m long and 0 44 m wide with an initial water depth of 0 4 m a piston type wavemaker is set at one side of the flume and a wave absorber is placed on the other side a freely floating rectangle box is located in the middle of the flume with a density of 500 kg m 3 the width of the fb b is 0 3 m and the height of the fb h f is 0 15 m a total of 2 cm gap is in between the lateral sides of the box and the sidewalls of the flume so this case can be seen as 2d the body can move freely in three dofs as surge heave and pitch numerical geometry in sph simulation is the same as the experimental ones as shown in fig 4 b a reference coordinate whose origin is located at the centroid of the floating body whose x positive right wards z positive up wards and rotation positive counter clockwise a piston type wave maker is located at the left side of the flume to generate regular waves with a period of t a 1 2 s and a height of h a 0 10 m on the other side a wave absorber of 2 0 m is adopted to decrease the effects of the reflected waves a total number of 63598 particles including 1524 fixed boundary particles 200 moving particles 558 floating particles and 61316 fluid particles are involved the motions of the floating box are depicted in fig 5 the heave motion δ z and the pitch motion θ show simple harmonic oscillations with the same period of incoming wave the surge motion δ x presents not only a simple harmonic but also a drift motion in the wave propagating direction due to the existence of the drift force which also makes the heave and pitch motions asymmetry about the equilibrium position i e the positive displacement of δ x is greater than that of negative direction the counter clockwise rotation is greater than that of clockwise as observed in fig 5 that the velocity of drift motion in sph simulation is slightly smaller than that in experiment generally speaking sph results shows good agreements with the experimental data and the numerical sph data by ren et al 2015 and can be used to simulate the interaction between the waves and floating bodies 3 2 moored box type fb the sph mooring coupling codes are further validated through the experiments by peng et al 2013 about the interaction between the waves and a fb the experiments were carried out in a 2d wave flume the wave tank is 30 m long 0 7 m wide and 0 9 m deep as shown in fig 6 a a piston type wave maker is installed at one side of the wave flume on the other side a wave absorber made of rubble mound was used to reduce the effects of reflected waves a box type fb of b 0 4 m h f 0 15 m and with a density of 700 kg m 3 is located at about halfway between the wave maker and the wave absorber the mooring system consists of four chains which are carefully arranged to ensure a good symmetry along x and y directions the fb is anchored to the bottom with a 60 inclination at the initial moment the immersion depth of the fb d 1 is 0 102 m the water surface elevations near the fb are recorded using four wave gauges 1 4 as shown in fig 6 a gauge 1 and gauge 2 are installed 1 95 m and 1 2 m away from the fb at the seaside respectively while gauge 3 and gauge 4 are installed 1 2 m and 1 65 m away from the fb at the leeside respectively fig 6 b shows the sketch of the numerical wave tank in this validation case same as that in the experiment the mass center of the fb is located at 0 0 0 102 m the mass and moment of inertia are 42 kg and 0 638 kg m2 respectively in addition a piston type wave maker is set at the left side of the flume to generate two regular waves i e one is with t b1 0 8 s and h b1 0 033 m and the other is with t b2 1 0 s and h b2 0 046 m the length of the damping zone is 2 3 m a total number of 42368 particles including 868 fixed boundary particles 200 moving particles 744 floating particles and 40556 fluid particles are involved in this simulation smaller than that of 48222 particles in the work by ren et al 2017 the computational time for running a simulation up to 20s is about 21 min with the gpu card mentioned in section 2 6 and is more effective than that of 20s 7h using an intel core i7 4790 cpu 3 5 ghz which indicates the improvement in decreasing computational time cost using gpu acceleration in sph no experimental results showed in the work of peng et al 2013 for the motions when t b1 0 8 s therefore only the motions of the fb between numerical and experimental results for t b2 1 0 s are compared as shown in fig 7 little discrepancy is found in the motions of heave and pitch components it can be seen that the motions of moored fbs are more complicated than that of freely floating bodies surge and pitch components move in the same phase and a half cycle faster than heave owing to the drift force the surge and pitch motions are asymmetric about the equilibrium position the displacement in positive x and rotation in counter clockwise are greater than that in the opposite direction as for the heave motion because the elongation of the mooring chains is negligible due to large axial stiffness the highest position in z direction is the initial position when the wave peaks act on the fb it moves down and right first then comes back to the equilibrium position on the other hand when the wave troughs act on the fb it moves down and left first then comes back to the equilibrium position again this is the reason why there are two troughs and crests in heave component during one period even the secondary troughs in heave component of sph results are a little flatter than that of experiment we can generally say that the sph mooring coupling codes show satisfactory agreements with experiments for the fb motions fig 8 shows the time series of the wave surface elevations at gauges 1 4 at the seaside the water surface profiles are synchronous whose period is the same as that of the incoming wave reflected waves produced at the left side of the fb are strengthened at the seaside from fig 8 it can be seen also that wave height at gauge 2 is 1 22 times as high as the incoming wave when t b1 0 8 s at the leeside the wave amplitude decreases sharply because of the wave energy attenuation by the fb the water surface shows a nonlinear profile with steepened wave crests and flattened wave troughs at the leeside which can also be identified in sph results when t b2 1 0 s the results show that the propagation waves break over the fb at the leeside wave decomposition takes place and higher harmonics are generated but complex wave profile with double crests on the leeward is not reproduced adequately the secondary peaks and troughs are smaller than that of experimental results it maybe resulted from that the artificial viscosity introducing bigger damping force to generate higher harmonics as mentioned in the work of ren et al 2017 overall sph results show good comparison with the experimental ones and the sph mooring coupling codes is reliable to be used in the simulations of the interactions between waves and moored fbs 4 simulations and optimizations of winged fbs in this section by adding protruding plates on the corners of a box type fb a new type of winged box type fbs is proposed and a series of numerical simulations are carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of the proposed fb the effects of each plate are studied systematically by examining the motions of the fb and the surrounding flow fields at last the best locations of the protruding plates are identified at different wave conditions 4 1 case settings the sketch of the winged box type fb with 8 plates is shown in fig 9 the density of fluid and fb water depth immersion depth and mooring configurations are kept as same as those in section 3 2 eight protruding plates numbering from 1 to 8 are added at each corner in both horizontal and vertical directions following the work by zhang et al 2018 the length of the protruding plates is set to 0 25 times the width of fb and thickness t f is set to be 0 02 m the characteristic wave periods t i are set in between 0 8 s and 1 6 s and the corresponding frequencies f i is from 0 625 hz to 1 25 hz the simulated wave height h i is 1 30 of the wave length λ i the simulated load conditions lcs are summarized in table 3 in the simulations the incident waves and reflected waves resonate with each other generating a standing wave at the seaside therefore the distance between at the wavemaker and the center of fb is tuned and at last set to be 1 78 times as long as λ i in each lc all protruding plates are homogenous and have the same property with the fb and for each lc both winged fb and non winged fb are calculated simultaneously the particles as well as the properties of the mooring lines used in these simulations are same as those in the validation case of a moored box type fb in section 3 2 4 2 numerical results fig 10 shows the comparison of water elevations at gauge3 and gauge4 the graphics on the left hand side is the time series of water elevations and the ones on the right hand side is the corresponding results in the frequency domain determined by fast fourier transformation fft it can be observed that the wave decomposition occurs on the leeside of the fb and higher harmonics are generated due to the wave breaking on the deck of the non winged fb in lc2 it is clear that the protruding plates can eliminate high frequency harmonics effectively however in lc3 and lc4 the wave amplitudes of the main low frequency harmonic are nearly the same no matter the winged plated is added or no but for the winged fb the amplitudes of the high frequency harmonics are less than that of non winged one indicating that the protruding plates reduce wave decomposition at the leeside the motions of the fb for winged and non winged ones are shown in fig 11 the results in lcs1 4 are all plotted to make a comparison of motions clearly from fig 11 it can be seen that the motions of the fb becomes more violent as the period of the wave increases but this growth shows a converging trend due to the existence of the mooring system as increasing the height of the wave the incoming wave energy and the drift forces acting on the fb become larger as a result the gap between the negative and positive motions for surge and pitch turns to be more obvious it is important that the motions of winged fb is much smaller than that of non winged one which should be due to the large added mass and resistant forces provided by the protruding plates therefore it can be imagined that the protruding plates can reduce the reflected wave coefficient k r significantly for winged and non winged fbs in lcs1 4 the velocity fields at different time instants are depicted in fig 12 15 respectively where the positions of the fbs and the mooring lines are also shown the red dashed circles indicate the energetic vortices it can been seen that when the incident waves interact with the fbs the flow fields around the fbs will generate a series of vortices which occur and propagate mainly at the lower corners of the fbs from fig 13 it can be seen that very few vortices are generated at the leeside when the shape of fb is a simply box but for winged fb more energetic vortices occur due to the disturbance to the flow from the protruding plates 5 and 6 it is interesting that almost all vortices are generate at the lower corner or the lower plates the upper corner of non winged fb and the plates 1 4 in the winged fb show little contributions in the vortices generation further comparing the velocity fields of the winged and non winged fbs it can be seen that the flow around the non winged fb is more smooth and steady than that around the winged fb which is very turbulent due to the interaction between the plates and the waves considering that the turbulence is the main source dissipating the wave energy into internal energy it can be imagined that the protruding plates can effectively increase the dissipated wave coefficient k d furthermore it is important to point out that the generated vortices are more obvious in high frequency lcs lc1 lc2 whereas there is almost no vortex generated in lc3 and lc4 no matter the plates are added or no in order to examine the performance of the proposed fb in a more quantitative way the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d will be investigated further k r represents the ratio of reflected wave height to the incident wave height k t is the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incident wave height and k d represents the energy proportion converted to interval energy due to the energy conservation of the incoming wave a balanced relationship can be setup based on the first order wave theory after the transitional period the incoming wave energy will either be reflected transmitted or dissipated into heat 23 e i n e r e t e d in which e in is the incoming wave energy e r and e t present the reflected wave energy and transmitted wave energy respectively dividing e i n on both sides of the equation following the relationship of wave energy and wave height e h 2 we can reach to 24 k r 2 k t 2 k d 2 1 the reflected wave heights at the seaside are computed using the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 fast fourier transform fft is adopted to analyze the synthetic waves at the leeside then k r k t and k d can be determined it can be seen from fig 16 a that k r increases as the frequency or b λ increases and the winged fb shows better performance than non winged one in reflecting wave energy after the introduction of the plates the reflected wave coefficients increase 11 92 at wave frequency 0 625 hz and 17 39 at wave frequency 1 25 hz different with the fixed breakwaters which almost reflects all incoming wave energy the reflected wave coefficient of fb is affected by the motions of the breakwater therefore the increasing in reflected wave coefficient is also the indication of the decreasing of the fb motions from fig 16 b it can be seen that k t decreases as the frequency or b λ increases the winged fb shows better performance in wave attenuation than non winged one the transmitted wave coefficients decrease 5 96 at wave frequency 0 625 hz and 50 4 and at wave frequency 1 25 hz for low frequency condition like lc4 the performance of the box type fb is limited and it can be said that small size box type fbs are transparent additionally adding protruding plates does not show obvious improvement at the low frequency lc on the contrary for the higher frequency conditions like lc1 the value of b λ is small enough therefore protruding plates can improve the performance of the fb greatly moreover the wave heights of main frequency harmonics are greatly reduced by protruding plates therefore we can safely say that the advantages of protruding plates are obvious based on a well designed box type fb for k d as shown in fig 16 c it can be found that the winged fb dissipates more wave energy and the dissipated wave coefficient increases as the frequency increases it is due to the fact that more vortices and turbulence around the protruding plates increase the dissipated wave energy meanwhile the flow path becomes longer when the vortices pass by the winged fb overall the motions of the winged fb are smaller than that of non winged one owing to larger added mass provided by the protruding plates which can also disturb the water flow when interact with waves as a result generating more vortices to dissipate more wave energy therefore the winged fb has larger reflected wave coefficient and dissipated wave coefficient smaller transmitted wave coefficient than the non winged one showing a great improvement for box type fbs 4 3 numerical simulations with seven winged fbs in this section the effects of single one protruding plate are studied by simulating the same lcs listed in table 3 but with one protruding plate removed from eight winged fb each time there are eight new shapes of winged fb as shown in table 4 and totally 32 simulations are run the results are compared with that of eight winged fb and the best locations to add protruding plates are identified for different lcs fig 17 shows the comparison of transmitted wave coefficient for eight winged and seven winged fbs the horizontal axis in fig 17 represents the reduction percentage of transmitted wave coefficient when one of the plates is removed positive value means it is useful and negative value means it is harmful it can be seen that the plate has different effects at different frequency when frequency is 1 25 hz plate 1 and 4 are important to improve the wave attenuation performance of winged fb and the others is harmful when frequency is 1 0 hz plate 1 2 5 6 and 7 are useful for frequency 0 76 hz plate 1 2 5 6 7 and 8 are useful and for frequency 0 625 hz they are 2 5 6 7 and 8 it can be observed that plate 3 is always harmful for the winged fb from fig 12 15 we cannot find not any vortices around plate 3 and when the fb interact with waves with harmonic motions in surge and pitch components it features like a paddle type wavemaker generating waves on the leeside of the fb it should be the reason of the harmfulness of plate 3 the histogram of fig 17 is useful to identify where to add protruding plates according to local distributed wave periods and distributed wave heights figs 18 and 19 shows the comparison of reflected and dissipated wave coefficient for eight winged and seven winged fbs respectively assuming that the smaller the k t and the bigger the k r and k d the better the wave attenuation performance positive value means it is harmful and negative value means it is useful which is contrary with fig 17 it can be seen that plate 2 and 5 are always harmful and plate 8 is always useful in enhancing the reflected waves in the studied cases as well plate 3 and 4 are always harmful and plate 2 5 and 7 are always useful in enhancing the dissipate wave energy for winged fb from figs 12 15 it is found that most vortices occur around plate 5 and 7 which maybe the reason of benefits of plate 5 and 7 5 conclusions in this paper sph method is adopted and lumped mass approach is coupled with the sph model a sph mooring coupling code is developed which is greatly improved by implementing gpu acceleration based on cuda toolkits the motions of fb and velocity fields of fluid around the fb are also studied to understand the effects of protruding plates the best locations to add the protruding plates are identified in the end the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the sph mooring coupling codes are validated against two existing experiments and gets good agreements which means that the codes are robust enough to simulate interactions between waves and moored floating structures 2 a winged fb with eight plates is proposed for low frequency wave conditions wave decompositions are generated on the leeside of the fb protruding plates are effective for reducing wave decomposition and wave energy of higher frequency components 3 when fluid move upward at the seaside vortices rotate in clockwise and when fluid move downward vortices rotate in contour clockwise interestingly vortices are mainly around the lower corner or plates more vortices will occur due to the spoiler of protruding plates 4 winged fb has larger reflected wave coefficient and dissipated wave coefficient smaller transmitted wave coefficient than the non winged one showing a great improvement for box type fbs 5 for different lcs one protruding plate may show different effects for fb importantly it is not always true to improve the performance of a fb by adding protruding plates the vertical protruding plate at the top leeside corner is found to be always harmful acknowledgement the study is funded by national key research and development plan of china 2016yfe0127900 the national natural science foundation of china of china 51608220
