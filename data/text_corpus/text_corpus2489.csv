popularity due to its unique benefits including notable therapeutic effects limited side effects and low cost 2 the production of tcm wastewater is typically high due to various processing activities such as extraction decoction washing and preparation carried out in tcm factories 3 5 the constituents of tcm wastewater are intricate and can be categorized into two groups based on solubility the insoluble residue and sediment and the water soluble components mainly comprising of celluloses polysaccharides and pharmaceutically active compounds phacs additionally tcm wastewater has distinct features such as a high concentration of pollutants heavy sediment unstable biodegradability and hazardous substances 4 7 as a result of strict environmental regulations tcm wastewater must be treated appropriately to minimize pollution before discharge pudilan xiaoyan oral liquid pdl is a renowned tcm formula comprising taraxacum mongolicum hand mazz tmhm scutellaria baicalensis georgi sbg corydalis bungeana turcz cbt and isatis indigotica fort iif 8 pdl is a widely used tcm prescription with anti viral and anti inflammatory functions 9 commonly used to treat respiratory diseases such as mumps pharyngitis acute tonsillitis and bronchitis 10 in china pdl as a nonprescription oral solution has been implemented in clinics for decades the sales volume of pdl in 2018 was 3 195 billion renminbi rmb chinese currency and it is estimated that the pdl wastewater generated is about 10 000 tons the conventional treatment method for tcm wastewater is mainly biochemical 11 12 however pdl wastewater contains many antiviral and anti inflammatory components such as baicalin especially the wastewater generated during refining and separation processes some pdl wastewater is diluted tens of times and then treated biochemically the presence of baicalin can easily cause microbial inactivation resulting in low processing efficiency moreover as an organic micro pollutant mp if not treated adequately the release of baicalin could lead to water body pollution 13 15 additionally baicalin has various pharmacological activities including antitumor antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and has broad clinical applications 16 18 therefore methods for separating and purifying baicalin from pdl wastewater align with the concept of resource recovery and should be studied in depth membrane technology has gained significant attention in the field of water and wastewater treatment due to its high separation efficiency low energy consumption and ability to selectively separate target compounds without causing secondary pollution 19 22 recent studies have highlighted the potential benefits of membrane based integrated processes in treating wastewater for example li et al demonstrated the effectiveness of an ultrafiltration membrane distillation uf md hybrid system in recovering water from synthesized tcm wastewater 23 24 similarly perez et al proposed a uf reverse

attention from scholars in recent years 26 29 with many studies focusing on the recovery of liposoluble compounds from olive oil processing wastewater 30 33 for example sygouni et al utilized uf nanofiltration nf and ro to treat olive mill wastewater omw recovering 225 mg l total phenolic content in the ro concentrate 34 however the phenols in these studies were liposoluble and were enriched through phase separation processes in contrast tcm wastewater is a complex system in which phacs are dissolved along with many impurities such as polysaccharides and proteins which are difficult to separate specifically the wastewater from the production of pdl has a high cod content exceeding 1 106 mg l and is rich in baicalin exceeding 12 mg ml hence finding a method to remove pollutants from pdl wastewater while recovering baicalin is of significance to the best of our knowledge the recovery of phacs from tcm wastewater by membrane process has not been reported yet in this study we aimed to investigate the feasibility of an integrated uf uf nf process for recovering high purity baicalin from pdl wastewater the proposed approach involved a two stage uf process for enriching the phacs in pdl wastewater followed by an nf step to further reduce cod finally the baicalin was purified via an acid precipitation method and its structure was identified using 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectra it

parameters were predicted using the hermia model 39 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the pdl wastewater table 2 presents the composition of pdl wastewater the data reveals that the wastewater contained a high concentration of cod 124 380 mg l and total solids ts 83 g l which is hundreds of times higher than domestic wastewater the wastewater also contained a substantial amount of total sugars reducing sugars pectins proteins and phacs tables 2 and 3 the total sugar content in pdl wastewater accounted for approximately 30 of the solid content among the phacs baicalin had the highest concentration at 16 70 mg ml it has been reported that baicalin had a specific anti biodegradation effect 41 42 therefore appropriate experimental procedures should be developed to recover baicalin before biochemical treatment a membrane based integration process for the treatment of pdl wastewater is presented in fig 1 with the aim of recovering baicalin the procedure comprises of two uf steps and one nf step in the first uf process a suitable uf membrane is used to remove insoluble impurities and some macromolecular components while phacs and small solutes can easily pass through the membrane in the second uf step phacs and small molecular components are separated finally in the third nf step the content of small molecular components is further reduced 3 2 the first uf process the primary purpose of the first uf process is to eliminate insoluble impurities so as to maximize the transmission of baicalin based phacs therefore the uf membrane with high flux low pollution potential and low baicalin rejection rate is more appropriate for the initial treatment of pdl wastewater 3 2 1 effect of membrane mwco it is widely recognized that mwco data reflects the pore size of membranes when they are prepared by the same manufacturer 43 in order to investigate the effect of membrane mwco on pdl wastewater treatment commercial pes membranes with mwcos of 100 k 50 k 30 k 20 k and 10 k were selected as shown in fig 2a during the initial stage the flux decreased rapidly which was attributed to membrane fouling and concentration polarization cp subsequently the permeation flux decreased slightly and reached a steady state 44 45 the resistances in series model of fig 2b shows that the resistance distribution of different uf membranes was consistent with the main membrane resistance being r cp the ratio of r cp r t for the different mwco membranes ranged from 75 24 to 87 43 this was likely due to the high cod content of the feed solution and the lower shear force of dead end filtration compared to cross flows 46 in addition hermia s model was applied to explain the fouling mechanism of each uf membrane and it was found that the fouling mechanism for all membranes were cake formation table 4 this was likely due to the high pectin content in the pdl wastewater table 2 which made it more prone to forming a cake layer on the membrane surface 47 among the membranes tested pes100k and pes50k had higher flux and lower pollution a uf membrane with a low rejection rate of phacs was appropriate for the first treatment step of pdl the rejection rate of phacs increased with a decrease in membrane pore size fig 3 notably the pes100k and pes50k membranes which had larger pore sizes allowed more components to pass through resulting in baicalin rejection rates of 37 96 and 38 83 respectively additionally the pes50k membrane exhibited the highest permeability to wogonin and cichoric acid despite the significant disparity between the phacs molecular weight and the membranes mwco the high retention rate of phacs was primarily attributed to two factors firstly during filtration fouling layers obstructed the membrane pores resulting in phacs adsorption and reduced phacs permeability secondly the presence of cp also hindered phacs permeability 48 49 notably cp was the primary fouling resistance factor fig 2 and decreased with increasing pore size in conclusion the pes50k membrane exhibited higher flux lower pollution resistance and lower phacs retention compared to other membranes since the study focused on recovering baicalin from wastewater the 50 kda uf membrane was deemed more suitable for the first uf step 3 2 2 effect of membrane material in order to investigate the influence of different membrane materials on the treatment of pdl wastewater pdl wastewater was treated by five selected uf membranes with the same mwco of 50 kda as depicted in fig 4 the cellulose acetate ca membrane which possesses a hydrophilic surface exhibited consistent flux and low pollution resistance r ef r if generally hydrophilic membranes are more resistant to fouling often exhibiting reversible fouling which can be easily mitigated through cleaning 50 51 the cake formation model fitted well for each membrane s flux indicating that the foulants tend to form a cake layer leading to a reduction in flux as shown in fig 5 the rejection of phacs by ps membranes was significantly higher it was due to the severe cp and membrane fouling that hindered the penetration of organic matter conversely the ca membrane exhibited lower retention of phacs potentially due to its hydrophilic surface which can impede pollutant adsorption and allow for easier phacs passage through the membrane the rejection of baicalin by the ca membrane was 30 94 which was lower than that of other membranes in a summary the ca membrane demonstrated proficient organic matter removal and high phacs permeability furthermore the different phacs displayed varying rejection rates likely due to their respective charges specifically fig 6 displayed a linear correlation between the charge and the rejection rate the main foulants in the wastewater were negatively charged as phacs with a greater negative charge were less prone to be absorbed by the fouling layer leading to a lower rejection rate these findings were consistent with the results reported by zhang et al 52 in summary the ca membrane exhibited superior characteristics including high flux low pollution and a high degree of baicalin permeability specifically the ca50k membrane was deemed suitable for use as the first uf membrane for the treatment of pdl wastewater it is important to note however that the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand cod by the ca50k membrane was relatively low this suggests that the initial uf permeate may still contain a significant amount of organic matter thus necessitating further treatment 3 3 the second uf process 3 3 1 effect of secondary uf process the effluent of the first uf process was used as feed water for this purpose five types of uf membranes namely pes20k pes10k pes5k rc1k and pa1k were chosen the experimental results indicated that the increase in molecular mwcos of the uf membranes led to a significant improvement in the permeate flux fig 7a the higher flux observed for rc1k compared to pa1k could potentially be attributed to the difference in membrane hydrophilicity 53 baicalin and wogonoside were almost completely rejected by the pes5k membrane fig 7c although the cod retention rate was not substantial pes5k could effectively separate baicalin and certain pollutants therefore the pes5k membrane was more suitable for our purpose owing to its adequate retention of cod and protein high rejection of baicalin and high flux further investigation will be conducted in section 3 3 2 to unravel the specific mechanisms responsible for the high rejection of baicalin 3 3 2 discussion on the rejection rates of phacs in the second uf process the high rejection rate of phacs observed in pes5k membranes was unexpected possible causes for this observation were discussed firstly the self assembly of flavonoid glycosides such as baicalin with other substances led to the formation of molecular complexes these molecular complexes posed a challenge for passing through the membrane thereby contributing to the high rejection of phacs 54 59 secondly the retention of macromolecular substances led to the formation of a second layer that absorbed phacs and increased their retention 56 60 thirdly the increase in entropy via the adsorption of solute on the membrane surface was a significant driver of solute adsorption water molecules at the surface were replaced by solutes leading to the adsorption of hydrophobic materials 61 current research has shown that uf can remove amounts of cod 62 63 however our study found that proteins and phacs were almost entirely removed but around 50 of the organic matter was still present in the secondary effluents the solid content of the permeate of pes5k is 40 45 mg ml 48 62 of the original pdl solution pdl wastewater comprised approximately 30 reducing sugar 15 macromolecular substances pectin and protein and 20 phacs table 2 some researchers have concluded that some wastewater mainly comprises small sugar molecules instead of macromolecules 64 therefore further treatment of two stage uf effluents is necessary 3 4 nf process the wastewater effluents generated by the two step uf process were subjected to further treatment using nf technology to mitigate the cod levels nf270 and dl membranes were selected the permeation flux of nf270 was marginally higher than dl with a value of 0 53 lmh bar 1 fig 8a similar to previous studies no irreversible fouling of the membrane was observed fig 8b and its permeation flux could be reinstated with ease via standard cleaning procedures 65 66 despite the better retention rates observed with nf270 both the nf270 and dl membranes failed to achieve sufficient cod retention this deficiency could be attributed to the pdl wastewater having a higher cod content than the other in others investigations the untreated influent s cod content ranged from 200 to 2000 mg l with nf achieving a cod removal efficiency of about 90 29 67 70 in contrast the uf uf nf process employed in this study only yielded a cod removal rate of approximately 60 furthermore the removal of toc was also satisfactory 63 table s1 the wogonoside and wogonin were not detected in the nf270 membrane effluents while 0 09 mg ml cichoric acid and 0 13 mg ml baicalin still existed it has been reported that certain low molecular weight mw bioactive compounds were not entirely retained by the nf membrane e g phenolic compounds organic acids and oligosaccharides 71 75 the variability of steric hindrance hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic screening led to different retention rates 76 77 and the cod content of permeate was 48 773 mg l table 5 which could be attributed to the cake enhanced cp 48 71 77 79 the fouling layers in the system restricted back diffusion and created a concentration gradient across the membrane accelerating the permeation rate and reducing the removal rate this deficiency in cod rejection underscores the complexity of tcm wastewater composition compared to the two step uf the nf process resulted in an increase in cod removal from 45 72 to 60 79 the ca50k and pes5k membranes were effective in removing noxious components that are prone to cause water eutrophication however the data indicated that some of the cod remained difficult to remove by filtration consisting mainly of sugars and alcohols to address this issue a membrane bioreactor mbr or md 23 24 could be implemented the mbr system in our laboratory has been running for a year and will be reported later 3 5 purification and structural identification of baicalin from phacs baicalin possesses acidity due to its specific number of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 80 82 this property renders baicalin solubility decreases under ph 2 fig s2 which makes it separable from other phacs in the present study the ph of the second step uf retentate was adjusted to 1 0 1 3 1 5 1 7 and 2 0 respectively to precipitate baicalin precipitates were repeatedly rinsed with pure water and 95 ethanol to remove impurities and then dried to constant weight it was observed that the ph significantly affected the yield and purity of baicalin the low ph of 1 0 resulted in a low yield of baicalin possibly due to the formation of salts and the re dissolution of baicalin on the other hand incomplete acid precipitation was the reason for the low yield of baicalin observed at ph 2 0 the purity of baicalin exceeded 89 in all cases based on the yield and purity considerations the optimum ph for baicalin precipitation was found to be 1 7 fig 9 the chemical structure of the yellow powder was identified by 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectrums fig s3 the spectrums were analyzed and data were basically consistent with the references 83 85 it was identified as baicalin 3 6 comparison between the two stage uf and a single uf processes to validate the necessity of the two stage uf process a comparison was made between the two stage uf and the single stage uf fig 10 in the single stage uf the permeate flux was observed to be lower and it exhibited a more severe membrane fouling resulting in a 3 6 times higher resistance as compared to the two stage uf additionally the effluent produced by the single stage uf had a higher cod content moreover when the recovery method was kept constant the purity of baicalin obtained through the single stage uf was only 40 53 in contrast the first stage uf carried out by ca50k effectively removed a portion of the impurities leading to a higher purity of baicalin despite the relatively complex operational procedures of the two stage uf it was observed to be more efficient in recovering baicalin exhibiting higher flux and lesser fouling as compared to the single stage uf the observed recovery of baicalin however was inadequate this is primarily attributed to the equal amounts of permeate and retentate 150 ml utilized for each filtration the recovery of baicalin could be increased to 26 15 by adjusting the amounts of ca50k s permeate from 150 ml to 250 ml in addition pretreatment operations can be carried out to significantly improve the yield of baicalin 4 conclusion the findings of the study demonstrated the efficacy of the combination process for the treatment of pdl wastewater in the recovery of baicalin in the first uf stage ca50k was selected as a suitable uf membrane which was able to remove insoluble impurities and organic substances while phacs could easily pass through as a secondary uf pes5k showed better retention of baicalin a simple acid precipitation method was employed to isolate baicalin resulting in a yield of 26 15 with a purity of 93 24 the structure was identified through 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectrums notably due to the high cod of pdl wastewater nf did not exhibit satisfactory removal rates the effluents cod by nf was 48 850 mg ml indicating the need for further treatment the present study successfully recovered high purity baicalin from pdl wastewater which holds significant referential value for the recycling

parameters were predicted using the hermia model 39 40 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the pdl wastewater table 2 presents the composition of pdl wastewater the data reveals that the wastewater contained a high concentration of cod 124 380 mg l and total solids ts 83 g l which is hundreds of times higher than domestic wastewater the wastewater also contained a substantial amount of total sugars reducing sugars pectins proteins and phacs tables 2 and 3 the total sugar content in pdl wastewater accounted for approximately 30 of the solid content among the phacs baicalin had the highest concentration at 16 70 mg ml it has been reported that baicalin had a specific anti biodegradation effect 41 42 therefore appropriate experimental procedures should be developed to recover baicalin before biochemical treatment a membrane based integration process for the treatment of pdl wastewater is presented in fig 1 with the aim of recovering baicalin the procedure comprises of two uf steps and one nf step in the first uf process a suitable uf membrane is used to remove insoluble impurities and some macromolecular components while phacs and small solutes can easily pass through the membrane in the second uf step phacs and small molecular components are separated finally in the third nf step the content of small molecular components is further reduced 3 2 the first uf process the primary purpose of the first uf process is to eliminate insoluble impurities so as to maximize the transmission of baicalin based phacs therefore the uf membrane with high flux low pollution potential and low baicalin rejection rate is more appropriate for the initial treatment of pdl wastewater 3 2 1 effect of membrane mwco it is widely recognized that mwco data reflects the pore size of membranes when they are prepared by the same manufacturer 43 in order to investigate the effect of membrane mwco on pdl wastewater treatment commercial pes membranes with mwcos of 100 k 50 k 30 k 20 k and 10 k were selected as shown in fig 2a during the initial stage the flux decreased rapidly which was attributed to membrane fouling and concentration polarization cp subsequently the permeation flux decreased slightly and reached a steady state 44 45 the resistances in series model of fig 2b shows that the resistance distribution of different uf membranes was consistent with the main membrane resistance being r cp the ratio of r cp r t for the different mwco membranes ranged from 75 24 to 87 43 this was likely due to the high cod content of the feed solution and the lower shear force of dead end filtration compared to cross flows 46 in addition hermia s model was applied to explain the fouling mechanism of each uf membrane and it was found that the fouling mechanism for all membranes were cake formation table 4 this was likely due to the high pectin content in the pdl wastewater table 2 which made it more prone to forming a cake layer on the membrane surface 47 among the membranes tested pes100k and pes50k had higher flux and lower pollution a uf membrane with a low rejection rate of phacs was appropriate for the first treatment step of pdl the rejection rate of phacs increased with a decrease in membrane pore size fig 3 notably the pes100k and pes50k membranes which had larger pore sizes allowed more components to pass through resulting in baicalin rejection rates of 37 96 and 38 83 respectively additionally the pes50k membrane exhibited the highest permeability to wogonin and cichoric acid despite the significant disparity between the phacs molecular weight and the membranes mwco the high retention rate of phacs was primarily attributed to two factors firstly during filtration fouling layers obstructed the membrane pores resulting in phacs adsorption and reduced phacs permeability secondly the presence of cp also hindered phacs permeability 48 49 notably cp was the primary fouling resistance factor fig 2 and decreased with increasing pore size in conclusion the pes50k membrane exhibited higher flux lower pollution resistance and lower phacs retention compared to other membranes since the study focused on recovering baicalin from wastewater the 50 kda uf membrane was deemed more suitable for the first uf step 3 2 2 effect of membrane material in order to investigate the influence of different membrane materials on the treatment of pdl wastewater pdl wastewater was treated by five selected uf membranes with the same mwco of 50 kda as depicted in fig 4 the cellulose acetate ca membrane which possesses a hydrophilic surface exhibited consistent flux and low pollution resistance r ef r if generally hydrophilic membranes are more resistant to fouling often exhibiting reversible fouling which can be easily mitigated through cleaning 50 51 the cake formation model fitted well for each membrane s flux indicating that the foulants tend to form a cake layer leading to a reduction in flux as shown in fig 5 the rejection of phacs by ps membranes was significantly higher it was due to the severe cp and membrane fouling that hindered the penetration of organic matter conversely the ca membrane exhibited lower retention of phacs potentially due to its hydrophilic surface which can impede pollutant adsorption and allow for easier phacs passage through the membrane the rejection of baicalin by the ca membrane was 30 94 which was lower than that of other membranes in a summary the ca membrane demonstrated proficient organic matter removal and high phacs permeability furthermore the different phacs displayed varying rejection rates likely due to their respective charges specifically fig 6 displayed a linear correlation between the charge and the rejection rate the main foulants in the wastewater were negatively charged as phacs with a greater negative charge were less prone to be absorbed by the fouling layer leading to a lower rejection rate these findings were consistent with the results reported by zhang et al 52 in summary the ca membrane exhibited superior characteristics including high flux low pollution and a high degree of baicalin permeability specifically the ca50k membrane was deemed suitable for use as the first uf membrane for the treatment of pdl wastewater it is important to note however that the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand cod by the ca50k membrane was relatively low this suggests that the initial uf permeate may still contain a significant amount of organic matter thus necessitating further treatment 3 3 the second uf process 3 3 1 effect of secondary uf process the effluent of the first uf process was used as feed water for this purpose five types of uf membranes namely pes20k pes10k pes5k rc1k and pa1k were chosen the experimental results indicated that the increase in molecular mwcos of the uf membranes led to a significant improvement in the permeate flux fig 7a the higher flux observed for rc1k compared to pa1k could potentially be attributed to the difference in membrane hydrophilicity 53 baicalin and wogonoside were almost completely rejected by the pes5k membrane fig 7c although the cod retention rate was not substantial pes5k could effectively separate baicalin and certain pollutants therefore the pes5k membrane was more suitable for our purpose owing to its adequate retention of cod and protein high rejection of baicalin and high flux further investigation will be conducted in section 3 3 2 to unravel the specific mechanisms responsible for the high rejection of baicalin 3 3 2 discussion on the rejection rates of phacs in the second uf process the high rejection rate of phacs observed in pes5k membranes was unexpected possible causes for this observation were discussed firstly the self assembly of flavonoid glycosides such as baicalin with other substances led to the formation of molecular complexes these molecular complexes posed a challenge for passing through the membrane thereby contributing to the high rejection of phacs 54 59 secondly the retention of macromolecular substances led to the formation of a second layer that absorbed phacs and increased their retention 56 60 thirdly the increase in entropy via the adsorption of solute on the membrane surface was a significant driver of solute adsorption water molecules at the surface were replaced by solutes leading to the adsorption of hydrophobic materials 61 current research has shown that uf can remove amounts of cod 62 63 however our study found that proteins and phacs were almost entirely removed but around 50 of the organic matter was still present in the secondary effluents the solid content of the permeate of pes5k is 40 45 mg ml 48 62 of the original pdl solution pdl wastewater comprised approximately 30 reducing sugar 15 macromolecular substances pectin and protein and 20 phacs table 2 some researchers have concluded that some wastewater mainly comprises small sugar molecules instead of macromolecules 64 therefore further treatment of two stage uf effluents is necessary 3 4 nf process the wastewater effluents generated by the two step uf process were subjected to further treatment using nf technology to mitigate the cod levels nf270 and dl membranes were selected the permeation flux of nf270 was marginally higher than dl with a value of 0 53 lmh bar 1 fig 8a similar to previous studies no irreversible fouling of the membrane was observed fig 8b and its permeation flux could be reinstated with ease via standard cleaning procedures 65 66 despite the better retention rates observed with nf270 both the nf270 and dl membranes failed to achieve sufficient cod retention this deficiency could be attributed to the pdl wastewater having a higher cod content than the other in others investigations the untreated influent s cod content ranged from 200 to 2000 mg l with nf achieving a cod removal efficiency of about 90 29 67 70 in contrast the uf uf nf process employed in this study only yielded a cod removal rate of approximately 60 furthermore the removal of toc was also satisfactory 63 table s1 the wogonoside and wogonin were not detected in the nf270 membrane effluents while 0 09 mg ml cichoric acid and 0 13 mg ml baicalin still existed it has been reported that certain low molecular weight mw bioactive compounds were not entirely retained by the nf membrane e g phenolic compounds organic acids and oligosaccharides 71 75 the variability of steric hindrance hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic screening led to different retention rates 76 77 and the cod content of permeate was 48 773 mg l table 5 which could be attributed to the cake enhanced cp 48 71 77 79 the fouling layers in the system restricted back diffusion and created a concentration gradient across the membrane accelerating the permeation rate and reducing the removal rate this deficiency in cod rejection underscores the complexity of tcm wastewater composition compared to the two step uf the nf process resulted in an increase in cod removal from 45 72 to 60 79 the ca50k and pes5k membranes were effective in removing noxious components that are prone to cause water eutrophication however the data indicated that some of the cod remained difficult to remove by filtration consisting mainly of sugars and alcohols to address this issue a membrane bioreactor mbr or md 23 24 could be implemented the mbr system in our laboratory has been running for a year and will be reported later 3 5 purification and structural identification of baicalin from phacs baicalin possesses acidity due to its specific number of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxyl groups 80 82 this property renders baicalin solubility decreases under ph 2 fig s2 which makes it separable from other phacs in the present study the ph of the second step uf retentate was adjusted to 1 0 1 3 1 5 1 7 and 2 0 respectively to precipitate baicalin precipitates were repeatedly rinsed with pure water and 95 ethanol to remove impurities and then dried to constant weight it was observed that the ph significantly affected the yield and purity of baicalin the low ph of 1 0 resulted in a low yield of baicalin possibly due to the formation of salts and the re dissolution of baicalin on the other hand incomplete acid precipitation was the reason for the low yield of baicalin observed at ph 2 0 the purity of baicalin exceeded 89 in all cases based on the yield and purity considerations the optimum ph for baicalin precipitation was found to be 1 7 fig 9 the chemical structure of the yellow powder was identified by 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectrums fig s3 the spectrums were analyzed and data were basically consistent with the references 83 85 it was identified as baicalin 3 6 comparison between the two stage uf and a single uf processes to validate the necessity of the two stage uf process a comparison was made between the two stage uf and the single stage uf fig 10 in the single stage uf the permeate flux was observed to be lower and it exhibited a more severe membrane fouling resulting in a 3 6 times higher resistance as compared to the two stage uf additionally the effluent produced by the single stage uf had a higher cod content moreover when the recovery method was kept constant the purity of baicalin obtained through the single stage uf was only 40 53 in contrast the first stage uf carried out by ca50k effectively removed a portion of the impurities leading to a higher purity of baicalin despite the relatively complex operational procedures of the two stage uf it was observed to be more efficient in recovering baicalin exhibiting higher flux and lesser fouling as compared to the single stage uf the observed recovery of baicalin however was inadequate this is primarily attributed to the equal amounts of permeate and retentate 150 ml utilized for each filtration the recovery of baicalin could be increased to 26 15 by adjusting the amounts of ca50k s permeate from 150 ml to 250 ml in addition pretreatment operations can be carried out to significantly improve the yield of baicalin 4 conclusion the findings of the study demonstrated the efficacy of the combination process for the treatment of pdl wastewater in the recovery of baicalin in the first uf stage ca50k was selected as a suitable uf membrane which was able to remove insoluble impurities and organic substances while phacs could easily pass through as a secondary uf pes5k showed better retention of baicalin a simple acid precipitation method was employed to isolate baicalin resulting in a yield of 26 15 with a purity of 93 24 the structure was identified through 1h nmr and 13c nmr spectrums notably due to the high cod of pdl wastewater nf did not exhibit satisfactory removal rates the effluents cod by nf was 48 850 mg ml indicating the need for further treatment the present study successfully recovered high purity baicalin from pdl wastewater which holds significant referential value for the recycling

12446,it is well documented that after the water has been treated in the treatment plant the quality of drinking water is degraded during transport to consumers inside the drinking water distribution system dwds one of the critical reasons for altering drinking water quality is the biofilm detached from the pipe wall to the bulk water in this paper the effects of hydraulic conditions such as flow velocity and flow direction on the biofilm were investigated the results show that compared with other flow conditions the biofilm is the thickest 267 4 Î¼m and the adhesion force is the lowest under the fluctuant flow velocity the fluctuant flow velocity increased the relative abundance of sphingobium and blastomonas decreased the relative abundance of dechloromonas and sediminibacterium the sphingobium with strong environmental adaptability and metabolic capacity could accelerate the growth of biofilm under fluctuant flow velocity conditions the abundance of functional genes that could reflect microbial metabolic capacity in the biofilm under fluctuant flow velocity conditions is significantly higher than that under other hydraulic conditions the total number of bacteria in the biofilm under reverse flow conditions was 31 48 32 01 and 47 97 71 38 lower than that under low and high flow conditions respectively indicating that the shear force generated by the reverse flow had resulted in biofilm detachment this study improved our understanding of the influence of different hydraulic conditions on biofilms in the dwds and helped us understand how to operate the dwds without causing additional biofilm detachment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords drinking water distribution system biofilm fluctuant flow velocity adhesion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a drinking water distribution system dwds is a critical infrastructure for delivering drinking water from treatment plants to consumers 1 often resulting in worsening water quality during the transportation process the problem of turbidity 2 3 discoloration 4 5 microbial risk opportunistic pathogens 6 7 taste and odor issues 8 increases the health risk significantly the biofilm that grows in the inner pipe wall is one of the critical reasons causing the above water quality problems 2 9 10 at low levels microorganisms from the treated water entered the dwds could dissociate the organic nutrients secrete extracellular polymer eps and attach to the pipe walls to form biofilm 11 12 within the biofilm microorganisms are wrapped by eps to create a relatively stable microenvironment and conducive to the continued growth and proliferation of microorganisms 13 14 more than 90 of the total biomass can be found in biofilms with only 5 of the biomass freely suspended in the bulk water 15 research showed that the growth and detachment of biofilm could lead directly to the deterioration of water quality 16 17 biofilm metabolism would corrode metal pipes through microbiological corrosion especially when bacteria such as iron oxidising bacteria iron reducing bacteria sulphur oxidising bacteria and sulphate reducing bacteria were in the biofilm when the biofilm and corrosion products detach from the pipe wall it will increase turbidity and cause discoloration in the bulk water 18 19 streptomyces and actinomycetes in biofilms could produce geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol by degrading organic material which causing taste and odor problems 8 biofilm also provided a place for the growth of opportunistic pathogens 6 20 the dwds often experience hydrodynamic fluctuations such as stagnant flow and change in flow velocities which affects the formation dynamic behavior and population characteristics of biofilm 21 22 increasing the flow velocity promotes the proliferation of bacteria in the biofilm during the formation stage 23 biofilms developed under low flow velocities show a less cohesive structure and detach readily when the hydraulic conditions change 24 higher flow velocities produced less porous but denser biofilm because of the more secretion of eps 2 25 it will increase the density and cohesion of the biofilm and make it less prone to detachment 26 biofilm would slough off when the hydraulic shear force exerted by flow velocity is greater than the adhesion 27 28 a shear force of approximately 100 kpa can remove biofilms larger than 200 Î¼m3 29 in addition there are significant differences in the community structure of biofilms grown at different flow velocities the flow velocity screens for the dominant bacteria and functional gene expression which result in different concentrations of eps in the biofilm it further affects the adhesion of biofilms 30 31 however most simulation experiments are conducted at constant flow velocities 32 34 which differs from the actual operating conditions of dwds due to the dynamic change in water consumption the opening and closing of pipeline valves etc the flow velocity and flow direction in the dwds are changing 35 the dynamic behavior of biofilm in fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow velocity is seldom investigated 16srrna high throughput sequencing is used chiefly for microbial community species diversity analysis and microbial metabolic function prediction can also be carried out 36 the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust uses evolutionary modelling to predict the function of water microorganisms from 16s data and a reference genome database 36 37 it provides a new way to analyze microbial functions and has achieved good results compared to metagenomic picrust has a lower cost and in some cases outperforms the metagenomes measured at particularly shallow sampling depths picrust recaptured most of the variation in gene content obtained by metagenomic sequencing using only a few hundred 16s sequences 38 previous research showed that picrust recaptures key findings from the human microbiome project and predicts metagenomes across in a broad range of host associated and environmental samples 38 for example the picrust was applied to predict the genes related to the sulphate reducing function of microorganisms in seafloor sediments 39 the relatively activity analysis of eps biosynthesis enzymes glycosyltransferase and asparagine synthase in biofilm of wastewater treatment process 40 to assess microbial community common metabolic capabilities in antarctic lakes 41 the inferred ability of the soil microbial community to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 42 therefore the picrusts method can accurately determine the functional gene expression and metabolism of the biofilm in the drinking water distribution system that provide a data base for the reasons for changes in biofilm status under environmental impact in this study the typical biofilm annular reactor bar was modified and used to determine the effect of different hydraulic conditions on biofilm detached from the dwds to further clarify how the fluctuant flow velocity and flow direction affect biofilm thickness and adhesion force compared to constant flow velocity the calculation method of biofilm adhesion force is established and the biofilm composition microbial community structure and functional gene in the biofilm were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental facility and hydraulic conditions as shown in fig s1 to simulate the automatic change of flow velocity with time the converted biofilm annular reactor bar was designed and improved a peristaltic pump bt100l baoding china and an automatic control system were added to provide reverse flow conditions during the operation the peristaltic pump provided the working driving force which let the water in the inlet tank enter the bar reactor the diameter of the bar reactor is 200 mm and the height is 240 mm the outer diameter of the water inlet outlet is 10 mm the stirring paddle in the bar reactor drives the water flow rotated to simulate the flow velocity in the dwds biofilm was grown on ductile iron coupons a material representative of drinking water distribution systems whose size was 50 mm 25 mm 2 mm twelve coupons were distributed in the middle of bar the ingredients of the coupons were fe 92 77 c 4 02 si 2 33 mn 0 40 s 0 07 p 0 08 mg 0 2 ti 0 03 cr 0 025 cu 0 03 v 0 035

time relay pulse controller and servo motor driver the feed water was from drinking tap water in tianjin ph 6 9 7 2 dissolved oxygen 5 1 5 6 mg l total organic carbon 2 47 2 72 n 5 values as shown in fig s2 and eq s1 a total of five hydraulic conditions were evaluated based on the flow velocity data of the online monitoring equipment for the drinking water distribution system in a city of fujian province china five hydraulic conditions include low flow velocity lfv 0 20 m s high flow velocity hfv 1 00 m s fluctuant flow velocity ffv 0 20 m s 1 h converted to 1 00 m s 1 h reverse low flow

grown in coupons over 60 days under the flow velocity of 0 20 m s the biofilm samples were analyzed at 0 h 12 h 24 h 3 d 7 d 14 d and 21 d under five hydraulic conditions the biofilm was scraped from coupons into 30 ml sterilized phosphate buffered saline pbs the biofilm suspension was for bacteria counting directly transfer the sample to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 15 min then filter the supernatant in the centrifuge tube with a 0 45 Î¼m microporous membrane for the detection of extracellular proteins epr and exopolysaccharides epo the anthrone sulfuric acid colorimetric method was used to measure the concentration of epo in biofilms and the lowry method was used to measure the concentration of epr in biofilms 43 the 25 ml biofilm suspension filtered through 0 22 Î¼m

miseq platform illumina san diego usa according to the standard protocols by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 4 calculation of biofilm adhesion force it was assumed that the critical shear force for the biofilm detached into bulk water was equal to the biofilm adhesion force under the same shear force generated by the flow velocity the more biofilm separated the lower the biofilm adhesion force at unit area and unit time 46 according to the calculation formula in viscous fluid mechanics the shear force applied to the biofilm on the surface of the coupon is as follows 1 Ï 2 Î¼ r 1 2 Ï 1 r 2 2 r 1 2 where the r1 is the radius of the stirring paddle m r2 is the distance between the sampling coupon and the central axis of the stirring paddle m Ï is the friction

celsius 2 5 statistical analysis the imaging was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm710 carl zeiss germany to analyze the biofilm thickness and structure throughout the stained biofilm sample under 40 objective lenses and analyzed with zen 2012 blue edition confocal software carl zeiss germany before the microscope the extracellular proteins were stained with 100 0 Î¼l fluorescein 5 isothiocyanate fitc at 1 mg ml the exopolysaccharides were stained with 100 0 Î¼l concanavalin a tetramethylrhodamine con a at 0 25 mg ml the dead cells were stained with 100 0 Î¼l propidium iodide pi at 0 1 mg ml samples were washed with phosphate buffered saline to remove excess dye after each staining step 47 heterotrophic plate count hpc was used to calculate the total number of bacteria in biofilm and bulk water which was enumerated by a spread plating method on r2a agar 48 49 after the biofilm detached into the bulk water a 200 ml biofilm suspension was filtered through the 0 22 Î¼m nitrocellulose membrane a high precision electronic balance accuracy 10 4 g was used to measure the weight of the nitrocellulose membrane filter and the nitrocellulose membrane filter without biofilm and the difference obtained was the dry weight of the detached biofilm the picrust analysis is based on the on line analysis platform http picrust github io picrust the specific operation includes standardising otu abundance and comparing the green gene id corresponding to otu with the kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway database annotation finally the different database function prediction information was obtained 38 3 results 3 1 biofilm thickness detection the shear force generated by the flow directly affects the physical form of the biofilm and different flow velocities have different effects on the biofilm the stained biofilm was photographed by a clsm to analyze the thickness and composition of the biofilm under different flow conditions as shown in fig 1 the biofilm thicknesses under low flow velocity lfv high flow velocity hfv fluctuant flow velocity ffv reverse low flow velocity r lfv and reverse high flow velocity r hfv are 226 9 Î¼m 176 0 Î¼m 267 4 Î¼m 206 1 Î¼m and 172 5 Î¼m respectively among them the thickest biofilm was at the fluctuant flow velocity condition which was 17 84 and 51 93 thicker than that under low and high flow velocity respectively biofilm thickness was minimal at high flow velocity because an enormous shear force is generated to make the biofilm detach and inhibit its growth while under the condition of fluctuant flow velocity in the process of switching between high and low flow velocity the high flow velocity brings more nutrients to the biofilm and the low flow velocity with lower hydraulic shear force provides space for the biofilm to grow that s why the biofilm is the thickest under fluctuant flow velocity the biofilm thickness under the reverse low flow velocity is 10 07 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition it indicated that the reverse flow shear force leads to the biofilm being detached as shown in fig s3 the average fluorescence intensities of exopolysaccharides extracellular proteins and dead cells in the biofilm after staining were calculated as shown in fig 2 a 1 b 1 c 1 under the fluctuant flow velocity the average fluorescence intensity of exopolysaccharide is significantly greater than that under other hydraulic conditions which indicates that the fluctuant flow velocity promotes the secretion of exopolysaccharide to survive in an unfavorable living environment it can be seen from fig 2 a 3 b 3 c 3 there are more dead cells in the biofilm under the condition of fluctuant flow velocity therefore through the analysis of biofilm thickness the average fluorescence intensity of eps and the average fluorescence intensity of the dead cell we know that fluctuant flow velocity promotes biofilm growth and reverse flow will lead to biofilm detachment however whether the biofilm overgrows under fluctuant hydraulic conditions is easier to separate still needs further analysis it is necessary to calculate the biofilm adhesion force under different hydraulic conditions 3 2 adhesion calculation in this study the different levels of velocities 0 1 m s 0 2 m s 0 4 m s 0 6 m s 0 8 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s 1 4 m s and the correlation coefficient between the amount of biofilm detached detached biofilm dry weight total number of bacteria eps and biofilm adhesion force were calculated as shown in fig 3 a c the correlation coefficient between the detached biofilm dry weight and the biofilm adhesion force is 0 4939 the correlation coefficient between the total number of bacteria and the biofilm adhesion force is 0 9568 the correlation coefficients between the detached exopolysaccharides epo concentration extracellular proteins epr concentration the sum of epo and epr concentration and biofilm adhesion force were 0 5548 0 7636 and 0 8029 respectively by comparison the correlation coefficient between the total number of bacteria and the biofilm adhesion force was the highest so it was used to calculate the biofilm adhesion force 3 3 effects of different flow conditions on biofilm composition and biofilm adhesion force to analyze the effect of hydraulic conditions on the biofilm composition and adhesion force the total number of bacteria the concentration of extracellular proteins and exopolysaccharides in the biofilm were analyzed as shown in fig 4 a compared with the initial stage 0 h the total number of bacteria under low flow velocity condition high flow velocity condition fluctuant flow velocity condition reverse low flow velocity condition reverse high flow velocity condition decreased by 59 26 64 64 82 15 18 68 and 34 34 at 12 h due to the biofilm detached from 12 h to 24 h due to the proliferation of bacteria the total number of bacteria increased from 1 75 105 cfu cm2 to 2 36 106 cfu cm2 under the high flow condition the total number of bacteria under low flow velocity condition fluctuant flow velocity condition reverse low flow velocity condition and reverse high flow velocity condition was 66 35 85 83 17 68 and 51 24 of the high flow velocity condition at 24 h respectively it was the high flow velocity that brought more nutrients and accelerated the proliferation of bacteria in the biofilm in the range of 0 24 h biofilm growth was in a fluctuant phase after three days the total number of bacteria in the biofilm was 2 23 106 3 43 106 cfu cm2 under the fluctuant flow velocity condition which was 6 64 94 38 and 16 87 67 73 higher than the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively at this time the biofilm has entered a period of dynamic stability and the growth of biofilms is limited under fixed flow velocity conditions the shear force generated by high flow velocity conditions forces the biofilm to detach and inhibits the attachment of microorganisms under the influence of low flow velocity conditions biofilms are in a slow growth process mainly due to a lower nutrient transport rate into the biofilm s interior however under the fluctuant flow velocity condition the top layer of the biofilm is continuously reset to provide nutrients for the proliferation of bacteria inside the biofilm which is more conducive to the growth and renewal of the biofilm after 24 h the total number of bacteria in the biofilm under the reverse high flow velocity condition is 47 97 71 38 lower than that under the high flow velocity condition under the reverse low flow velocity condition after seven days the total number of bacteria was 31 48 32 01 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition which indicated that the shear force generated by the reverse flow would cause the biofilm to detach it is consistent with the above mentioned biofilm thickness detection results eps is an essential component of the biofilm which can encapsulate bacteria to form a three dimensional structure with mechanical stability 50 51 the main components of eps are extracellular proteins and exopolysaccharides accounting for 75 89 of the total ingredients in addition to nucleic acids lipids phospholipids and humic substances etc 12 as shown in fig 4 b compared with the low flow velocity and fluctuant flow velocity conditions the high flow velocity promoted the secretion of exopolysaccharides still the concentration of extracellular proteins did not increase significantly because under the condition of high flow velocity microorganisms will secrete more eps which makes the structure of the biofilm more compact and stable to adapt to changes in the external environment 52 53 after about three days the extracellular protein concentration entered a dynamic stable period the maximum concentration under the low flow velocity condition was 3 68 Î¼g ml 86 42 30 17 65 93 and 82 37 higher than that under high flow velocity condition fluctuant flow velocity condition reverse low flow velocity condition and reverse high flow velocity condition it was that the biofilm is not easy to detach under low flow velocity and the extracellular protein is more easily secreted under stable hydraulic conditions the concentration of exopolysaccharide directly affects the adhesion of biofilms as shown in fig 4 c the concentration of exopolysaccharide began to increase under the condition of fluctuant flow velocity after seven days and reached a maximum of 2 64 Î¼g cm2 at 21 d the concentration of exopolysaccharide was 172 07 and 17 97 higher than those under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively the concentration of exopolysaccharide under the reverse high flow velocity condition and reverse low flow velocity condition was 47 29 and 36 57 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions respectively therefore not only high flow velocity will promote the secretion of biofilm exopolysaccharides but also other unstable hydraulic conditions such as fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow will promote the secretion of exopolysaccharides and strengthen the biofilm adhesion to cope with the change of growth environment as shown in fig 4 d the biofilm adhesion force is slightly different under low flow velocity high flow velocity and fluctuant flow velocity at 12 h but after 24 h the biofilm adhesion force changed significantly under the three hydraulic conditions and the biofilm adhesion force increased rapidly under high flow velocity conditions this value increased from 1 50 n m2 to 13 18 n m2 and the adhesion value is the highest it was that in the early stage of the system operation the biofilms detached a lot and the remaining biofilms have high shear resistance the adhesion is the lowest under fluctuant flow velocity which is 0 60 n m2 at 24 h 21 d the biofilm adhesion under the fluctuant flow velocity was 10 06 88 24 and 25 17 95 45 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition and the high flow velocity condition respectively the above results show that the biofilm adhesion is the lowest under the fluctuant flow velocity and biofilm is easier to detach and cause bulk water contamination to further explain the difference in biofilm adhesion under different flow conditions the bacterial community structure and function genes were analyzed 3 4 effects of different flow conditions on bacterial community structure in biofilms in this study the bacterial community structure in biofilm at 21 days was tested their total dna was purified amplified using 16s rrna primers and sequenced the biofilm s dominant bacteria at the phylum level and genus level were analyzed as shown in fig s4 the dominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria 88 35 94 18 bacteroidota 3 97 8 34 and firmicutes 1 12 3 39 the rest are actinobacteriota gemmatimonadota wps 2 acidobacteriota verrucomicrobiota cyanobacteria planctomycetota among them the relative abundance of proteobacteria under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was the highest with a value of 94 18 which was 5 83 and 2 93 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions at the same time the bacteroidota was 3 97 under the fluctuant flow velocity which was 3 48 and 0 91 lower than that under low and high flow velocity conditions under the fluctuant flow velocity the proliferation of the dominant phyla proteobacteria was promoted but the proliferation of bacteroidota was inhibited proteobacteria are generally the main dominant flora of biofilms in dwds because of their strong environmental adaptability 54 the relative abundance of proteobacteria under reverse low flow conditions was 0 64 higher than that under low flow velocity conditions and 2 26 lower than that under high flow velocity conditions the relative abundance of bacteroidota under reverse low flow velocity condition was 0 89 higher than that under the low flow velocity condition and 3 46 higher than that under the high flow velocity condition the relative abundance of proteobacteria under reverse high flow conditions is 2 71 lower than that under low flow conditions and 0 15 lower than that under high flow conditions which indicates that the reverse flow has a minor effect on the dominant bacterial proteobacteria and bacteroidota compared with the change in flow velocity because of the reverse flow causes the biofilm to detach directly and affects the bacterial community structure as shown in fig 5 a at the genus level the dominant bacteria are mainly dechloromonas 30 04 48 73 sphingobium 8 69 27 42 acidovorax 8 90 19 17 sediminibacterium 3 86 8 20 blastomonas 1 32 4 33 the relative abundance of dechloromonas belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity was the lowest with a value of 30 04 which was 14 15 and 18 69 lower than that under the low and high flow conditions respectively the relative abundance of the sphingobium belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 27 42 which was 13 10 and 7 47 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively the relative abundance of the acidovorax belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 17 86 which was 0 62 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition and 8 96 higher than under the high flow velocity condition the relative abundance of blastomonas belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 4 33 which was 2 95 and 3 01 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively the relative abundance of the sediminibacterium belonging to the bacteroidota phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 3 86 which was 3 50 and 0 97 lower than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively compared with the fixed low and high flow velocity conditions the relative abundances of dechloromonas and sediminibacterium decreased under fluctuant flow velocity conditions but the relative abundances of sphingobium and blastomonas increased under reverse flow condition the relative abundance of sphingobium under reverse high flow condition was 5 62 lower than that under high flow velocity conditions and the relative abundance of sphingobium under reverse low flow velocity condition was 10 27 lower than that under low flow velocity condition the relative abundance of blastomonas under reverse high flow velocity conditions was 1 87 higher than that under high flow velocity conditions and the relative abundance of blastomonas under reverse low flow velocity conditions was 1 24 higher than under low flow velocity conditions in the dwds compared with constant flow velocity fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow will affect the succession of the dominant bacterial community as shown in fig 5 b considering beta diversity the principal component analysis pcoa of the biofilm microbial community was analyzed 55 the two axes of the pcoa plot describe the results of significant difference p 0 05 between the fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow velocity on the first axis of pcoa there was a significant difference p 0 05 between the fluctuant flow velocity and low high flow velocity on the second axis of pcoa as shown in fig 5 c the differential analysis on the otu classification level wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 was calculated under five flow conditions 56 there were significant differences under the influence of low flow velocity and high flow velocity fig 5c rhombus nodes which mainly included the genus candidatus otu 110 and flavobacterium otu 88 there were significant differences under the influence of high flow velocity and fluctuant flow velocity fig 5c square nodes mainly including genus flavobacterium otu 183 chryseobacterium otu 144 and candidatus otu 110 there were significant differences under the influence of the low flow velocity and reverse low flow velocity fig 5c parallelogram nodes mainly including genus sediminibacterium otu 51 brevundimonas otu 113 and terrimonas otu 134 there were significant differences under the influence of fluctuant flow velocity and reverse high flow velocity fig 5c triangular nodes mainly including genus dechloromonas otu 96 sediminibacterium otu 51 bosea otu 116 and hyphomicrobium otu 13 the change in hydraulic conditions affects the succession of dominant bacteria in the biofilm the reason is that the changing shear force generated by the fluctuant flow velocity and the reverse flow makes the biofilm detached which directly affects the microbial community structure in the biofilm 57 on the other hand hydraulic conditions affect the behavior of microorganisms regulating themselves to screen the dominant genera further changing the biofilm structure to adapt to the unfavorable external environment 52 58 3 5 predictive analysis of function genes under different flow conditions in this study 16s rna sequencing data was used to predict the gene functions by picrust based on the kegg the kegg database is a large scale knowledge base for systematically analyzing gene functions and linking functional information which includes various metabolic pathways synthetic pathways membrane transport signal transmission cell cycle and disease related pathways pathway level 1 includes metabolism cellular processes organismal systems environmental information processing and more detailed gene functions that can be analyzed at pathway level 3 as shown in fig 6 the abundance of the function gene carbon metabolism cm in metabolism that reflects the transformation of carbon from nutrients into biomass under fluctuant hydraulic condition was 10 16 and 14 23 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions the abundance of the gene biosynthesis of amino acids baa which reflected the essential substances constituting protein under fluctuant hydraulic condition was 6 86 and 12 51 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions the abundance of the function gene amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism asnsm reflecting microbial carbohydrate metabolism under fluctuant hydraulic condition was 15 52 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions and 12 34 the abundances of function genes protein digestion and absorption pda in organic systems under fluctuant hydraulic condition which can reflect the ability of microorganisms to digest and absorb nutrients and proteins was 44 61 and 26 07 higher than that under low and high flow velocity condition the abundance of absorbed function genes carbohydrate digestion and absorption cda reflecting the ability of microorganisms to digest carbohydrates under fluctuant hydraulic conditions were 81 16 and 34 32 higher than under low and high flow velocity conditions the microbial metabolism under fluctuant hydraulic conditions was more potent than that under low and high flow velocity conditions which was more conducive to bacterial proliferation and accelerated growth it is consistent with the detection of the total number of bacteria and the biofilm thickness the function gene apoptosis apo which can reflect cell apoptosis also had the highest abundance under fluctuant hydraulic conditions indicating that the microbial generation was replaced quickly it was also the reason for the highest fluorescence intensity of apoptotic cells in the clsm detection at the same time the abundance of the function gene biofilm formation in cellular processes under fluctuant flow velocity conditions was significantly higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions the function genes of the bacterial secretion system bss in environmental information processing reflecting the ability of bacteria to secrete extracellular polymers under fluctuant hydraulic conditions were 26 75 and 27 01 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions the abundance of function gene bss under reverse low flow velocity was 6 41 lower than that under low flow velocity conditions and the abundance of function gene bss under reverse high flow velocity was 11 78 lower than that under high flow velocity conditions it was found that the reverse flow promoted the detached of biofilm resulting in the decrease of the abundance of functional genes on the 21st day the total number of bacteria in the biofilm under fluctuating flow velocity conditions was more than that under low and high flow velocity conditions it is consistent with the abundance of function genes cm baa bf v bf p and bss which reflects the high metabolic capacity of microorganisms therefore from the picrust analysis we know that the abundance of functional genes that can reflect the metabolic capacity of microorganisms under fluctuant hydraulic conditions is significantly higher than that under other hydraulic conditions the expression of such function genes promotes biofilm metabolism and further affects biofilm composition 4 discussion compared with previous simulation studies of constant flow velocity this study revealed the effect of fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow on the biofilm in the dwds the above experimental results show that the biofilm thickness under the fluctuant flow velocity condition is significantly higher than that under other conditions and its value is 267 4 Î¼m at this time the biofilm adhesion force is the lowest in fact the constant high flow velocity will reduce the thickness of the biofilm from 300 Î¼m to 100 Î¼m when increased from 2 to 9 pa 59 on the one hand the water flow can transport nutrients and oxygen to the biofilm which promotes the proliferation of microorganisms and enhance eps secretion in response to environmental stress caused by high flow velocity for mechanical protection 50 60 on the contrary the concentration of proteins mainly affects the stiffness of the biofilms a previous study showed that protein rich regions on the surface of lactobacillus johnsonii bacteria were stiffer than polysaccharide rich regions 61 stiffer biofilms may be more stable against shear stress and little detachment therefore in this study the protein concentration under low flow velocity condition was higher than that under fluctuating flow velocity condition and the amount of biofilm detachment was also lower than that under fluctuant flow velocity condition on the other hand the water flow will have a scouring effect on the biofilm the higher the flow velocity the higher the shear force will be when the shear force exceeds the biofilm adhesion force the biofilm will detach and inhibit the growth of the biofilm 59 62 under the fluctuant flow velocity the biofilm obtains intermittent growth and the top layer of the biofilm is constantly reset 59 fluctuating flow conditions could be divided into a high flow velocity period and a low flow velocity period during the high flow velocity period high shear force makes the top layer of biofilm detach which ensures the transport of nutrients to the interior of the biofilm 63 the biofilm grows quickly under less environmental stress under the low flow velocity period the top layer detached during the high flow velocity period and growth during the low flow velocity period biofilms have also been proposed to respond to shear stress flow velocity by regulating metabolic pathways and become stronger 64 the succession of dominant bacteria and the expression of functional genes further explain how fluctuant water conditions affect biofilm thickness and adhesion force biofilm detached significantly reduced the relative abundance of the dominant bacteria genera dechloromonas acidovorax and sediminibacterium the relative abundance of sphingobium and blastomonas with hydrophobicity under fluctuant hydraulic condition increase could promote the adsorption and degradation of hydrophobic organic matter by bacteria and improve the environmental adaptability and metabolic capacity of biofilm 65 sphingobium has been shown to secrete exopolysaccharides which are the major component of microbial biofilms 66 this study also observed the same results moreover the microorganisms had higher metabolic capacity under fluctuant flow velocity conditions because the abundance of metabolic function genes was significantly higher than that under other hydraulic conditions the action of the function genes of the bacterial secretion system promotes the secretion of extracellular polymers which are the main substances in the biofilm more extracellular polymers lead to an increase in the thickness of the biofilm when the biofilm grows thicker the transport process of nutrients into the biofilm will be hindered 67 bacteria in the inner layer of biofilm are more prone to apoptosis due to nutrient deficiency which cause the biofilm adhesion decreases and the biofilm is easier to detach 68 69 as our experimental results also shows that under high metabolic capacity the functional gene apoptosis which reflects cell apoptosis maintains a high abundance therefore the shear force generated by different flow conditions in the dwds significantly affects the growth and detachment of the biofilm 5 conclusions in this study the biofilm composition and characteristics were studied under fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow velocity to explore the effect of hydraulic conditions on biofilm detachment under the fluctuant flow condition the biofilm is easier to detach due to the lowest biofilm adhesion force the relative abundance of sphingobium with strong environmental adaptability and metabolic capacity also increased leading to accelerate the growth of biofilm and increase the thickness of biofilm the abundance of functional genes analysis also shows that the highest metabolic capacity of microorganisms in biofilm under this condition while under reverse flow condition the biofilm detaches duo to the shear force therefore the different flow conditions significantly affect the growth and detachment of the biofilm through a different mechanism and we can improve the water quality by regulating the hydraulic condition of the drinking water distribution system declaration of

12446,it is well documented that after the water has been treated in the treatment plant the quality of drinking water is degraded during transport to consumers inside the drinking water distribution system dwds one of the critical reasons for altering drinking water quality is the biofilm detached from the pipe wall to the bulk water in this paper the effects of hydraulic conditions such as flow velocity and flow direction on the biofilm were investigated the results show that compared with other flow conditions the biofilm is the thickest 267 4 Î¼m and the adhesion force is the lowest under the fluctuant flow velocity the fluctuant flow velocity increased the relative abundance of sphingobium and blastomonas decreased the relative abundance of dechloromonas and sediminibacterium the sphingobium with strong environmental adaptability and metabolic capacity could accelerate the growth of biofilm under fluctuant flow velocity conditions the abundance of functional genes that could reflect microbial metabolic capacity in the biofilm under fluctuant flow velocity conditions is significantly higher than that under other hydraulic conditions the total number of bacteria in the biofilm under reverse flow conditions was 31 48 32 01 and 47 97 71 38 lower than that under low and high flow conditions respectively indicating that the shear force generated by the reverse flow had resulted in biofilm detachment this study improved our understanding of the influence of different hydraulic conditions on biofilms in the dwds and helped us understand how to operate the dwds without causing additional biofilm detachment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords drinking water distribution system biofilm fluctuant flow velocity adhesion data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a drinking water distribution system dwds is a critical infrastructure for delivering drinking water from treatment plants to consumers 1 often resulting in worsening water quality during the transportation process the problem of turbidity 2 3 discoloration 4 5 microbial risk opportunistic pathogens 6 7 taste and odor issues 8 increases the health risk significantly the biofilm that grows in the inner pipe wall is one of the critical reasons causing the above water quality problems 2 9 10 at low levels microorganisms from the treated water entered the dwds could dissociate the organic nutrients secrete extracellular polymer eps and attach to the pipe walls to form biofilm 11 12 within the biofilm microorganisms are wrapped by eps to create a relatively stable microenvironment and conducive to the continued growth and proliferation of microorganisms 13 14 more than 90 of the total biomass can be found in biofilms with only 5 of the biomass freely suspended in the bulk water 15 research showed that the growth and detachment of biofilm could lead directly to the deterioration of water quality 16 17 biofilm metabolism would corrode metal pipes through microbiological corrosion especially when bacteria such as iron oxidising bacteria iron reducing bacteria sulphur oxidising bacteria and sulphate reducing bacteria were in the biofilm when the biofilm and corrosion products detach from the pipe wall it will increase turbidity and cause discoloration in the bulk water 18 19 streptomyces and actinomycetes in biofilms could produce geosmin and 2 methylisoborneol by degrading organic material which causing taste and odor problems 8 biofilm also provided a place for the growth of opportunistic pathogens 6 20 the dwds often experience hydrodynamic fluctuations such as stagnant flow and change in flow velocities which affects the formation dynamic behavior and population characteristics of biofilm 21 22 increasing the flow velocity promotes the proliferation of bacteria in the biofilm during the formation stage 23 biofilms developed under low flow velocities show a less cohesive structure and detach readily when the hydraulic conditions change 24 higher flow velocities produced less porous but denser biofilm because of the more secretion of eps 2 25 it will increase the density and cohesion of the biofilm and make it less prone to detachment 26 biofilm would slough off when the hydraulic shear force exerted by flow velocity is greater than the adhesion 27 28 a shear force of approximately 100 kpa can remove biofilms larger than 200 Î¼m3 29 in addition there are significant differences in the community structure of biofilms grown at different flow velocities the flow velocity screens for the dominant bacteria and functional gene expression which result in different concentrations of eps in the biofilm it further affects the adhesion of biofilms 30 31 however most simulation experiments are conducted at constant flow velocities 32 34 which differs from the actual operating conditions of dwds due to the dynamic change in water consumption the opening and closing of pipeline valves etc the flow velocity and flow direction in the dwds are changing 35 the dynamic behavior of biofilm in fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow velocity is seldom investigated 16srrna high throughput sequencing is used chiefly for microbial community species diversity analysis and microbial metabolic function prediction can also be carried out 36 the phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust uses evolutionary modelling to predict the function of water microorganisms from 16s data and a reference genome database 36 37 it provides a new way to analyze microbial functions and has achieved good results compared to metagenomic picrust has a lower cost and in some cases outperforms the metagenomes measured at particularly shallow sampling depths picrust recaptured most of the variation in gene content obtained by metagenomic sequencing using only a few hundred 16s sequences 38 previous research showed that picrust recaptures key findings from the human microbiome project and predicts metagenomes across in a broad range of host associated and environmental samples 38 for example the picrust was applied to predict the genes related to the sulphate reducing function of microorganisms in seafloor sediments 39 the relatively activity analysis of eps biosynthesis enzymes glycosyltransferase and asparagine synthase in biofilm of wastewater treatment process 40 to assess microbial community common metabolic capabilities in antarctic lakes 41 the inferred ability of the soil microbial community to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 42 therefore the picrusts method can accurately determine the functional gene expression and metabolism of the biofilm in the drinking water distribution system that provide a data base for the reasons for changes in biofilm status under environmental impact in this study the typical biofilm annular reactor bar was modified and used to determine the effect of different hydraulic conditions on biofilm detached from the dwds to further clarify how the fluctuant flow velocity and flow direction affect biofilm thickness and adhesion force compared to constant flow velocity the calculation method of biofilm adhesion force is established and the biofilm composition microbial community structure and functional gene in the biofilm were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental facility and hydraulic conditions as shown in fig s1 to simulate the automatic change of flow velocity with time the converted biofilm annular reactor bar was designed and improved a peristaltic pump bt100l baoding china and an automatic control system were added to provide reverse flow conditions during the operation the peristaltic pump provided the working driving force which let the water in the inlet tank enter the bar reactor the diameter of the bar reactor is 200 mm and the height is 240 mm the outer diameter of the water inlet outlet is 10 mm the stirring paddle in the bar reactor drives the water flow rotated to simulate the flow velocity in the dwds biofilm was grown on ductile iron coupons a material representative of drinking water distribution systems whose size was 50 mm 25 mm 2 mm twelve coupons were distributed in the middle of bar the ingredients of the coupons were fe 92 77 c 4 02 si 2 33 mn 0 40 s 0 07 p 0 08 mg 0 2 ti 0 03 cr 0 025 cu 0 03 v 0 035

time relay pulse controller and servo motor driver the feed water was from drinking tap water in tianjin ph 6 9 7 2 dissolved oxygen 5 1 5 6 mg l total organic carbon 2 47 2 72 n 5 values as shown in fig s2 and eq s1 a total of five hydraulic conditions were evaluated based on the flow velocity data of the online monitoring equipment for the drinking water distribution system in a city of fujian

grown in coupons over 60 days under the flow velocity of 0 20 m s the biofilm samples were analyzed at 0 h 12 h 24 h 3 d 7 d 14 d and 21 d under five hydraulic conditions the biofilm was scraped from coupons into 30 ml sterilized phosphate buffered saline pbs the biofilm suspension was for bacteria counting directly transfer the sample to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 15 min then filter the supernatant in the centrifuge tube with a 0 45 Î¼m microporous membrane for the detection of extracellular proteins epr and exopolysaccharides epo the anthrone sulfuric acid colorimetric method was used to measure the concentration of epo in biofilms and the lowry method was used to measure the concentration of epr in biofilms 43 the 25 ml biofilm suspension filtered through 0 22 Î¼m

miseq platform illumina san diego usa according to the standard protocols by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china 2 4 calculation of biofilm adhesion force it was assumed that the critical shear force for the biofilm detached into bulk water was equal to the biofilm adhesion force under the same shear force generated by the flow velocity the more biofilm separated the lower the biofilm adhesion force at unit area and unit time 46 according to the calculation formula in viscous fluid mechanics the shear force applied to the biofilm on the surface of the coupon is as follows 1 Ï 2 Î¼ r 1 2 Ï 1 r 2 2 r 1 2 where the r1 is the radius of the stirring paddle m r2 is the distance between the sampling coupon and the central axis of the stirring paddle m Ï is the friction

celsius 2 5 statistical analysis the imaging was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm lsm710 carl zeiss germany to analyze the biofilm thickness and structure throughout the stained biofilm sample under 40 objective lenses and analyzed with zen 2012 blue edition confocal software carl zeiss germany before the microscope the extracellular proteins were stained with 100 0 Î¼l fluorescein 5 isothiocyanate fitc at 1 mg ml the exopolysaccharides were stained with 100 0 Î¼l concanavalin a tetramethylrhodamine con a at 0 25 mg ml the dead cells were stained with 100 0 Î¼l propidium iodide pi at 0 1 mg ml samples were washed with phosphate buffered saline to remove excess dye after each staining step 47 heterotrophic plate count hpc was used to calculate the total number of bacteria in biofilm and bulk water which was enumerated by a spread plating method on r2a agar 48 49 after the biofilm detached into the bulk water a 200 ml biofilm suspension was filtered through the 0 22 Î¼m nitrocellulose membrane a high precision electronic balance accuracy 10 4 g was used to measure the weight of the nitrocellulose membrane filter and the nitrocellulose membrane filter without biofilm and the difference obtained was the dry weight of the detached biofilm the picrust analysis is based on the on line analysis platform http picrust github io picrust the specific operation includes standardising otu abundance and comparing the green gene id corresponding to otu with the kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway database annotation finally the different database function prediction information was obtained 38 3 results 3 1 biofilm thickness detection the shear force generated by the flow directly affects the physical form of the biofilm and different flow velocities have different effects on the biofilm the stained biofilm was photographed by a clsm to analyze the thickness and composition of the biofilm under different flow conditions as shown in fig 1 the biofilm thicknesses under low flow velocity lfv high flow velocity hfv fluctuant flow velocity ffv reverse low flow velocity r lfv and reverse high flow velocity r hfv are 226 9 Î¼m 176 0 Î¼m 267 4 Î¼m 206 1 Î¼m and 172 5 Î¼m respectively among them the thickest biofilm was at the fluctuant flow velocity condition which was 17 84 and 51 93 thicker than that under low and high flow velocity respectively biofilm thickness was minimal at high flow velocity because an enormous shear force is generated to make the biofilm detach and inhibit its growth while under the condition of fluctuant flow velocity in the process of switching between high and low flow velocity the high flow velocity brings more nutrients to the biofilm and the low flow velocity with lower hydraulic shear force provides space for the biofilm to grow that s why the biofilm is the thickest under fluctuant flow velocity the biofilm thickness under the reverse low flow velocity is 10 07 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition it indicated that the reverse flow shear force leads to the biofilm being detached as shown in fig s3 the average fluorescence intensities of exopolysaccharides extracellular proteins and dead cells in the biofilm after staining were calculated as shown in fig 2 a 1 b 1 c 1 under the fluctuant flow velocity the average fluorescence intensity of exopolysaccharide is significantly greater than that under other hydraulic conditions which indicates that the fluctuant flow velocity promotes the secretion of exopolysaccharide to survive in an unfavorable living environment it can be seen from fig 2 a 3 b 3 c 3 there are more dead cells in the biofilm under the condition of fluctuant flow velocity therefore through the analysis of biofilm thickness the average fluorescence intensity of eps and the average fluorescence intensity of the dead cell we know that fluctuant flow velocity promotes biofilm growth and reverse flow will lead to biofilm detachment however whether the biofilm overgrows under fluctuant hydraulic conditions is easier to separate still needs further analysis it is necessary to calculate the biofilm adhesion force under different hydraulic conditions 3 2 adhesion calculation in this study the different levels of velocities 0 1 m s 0 2 m s 0 4 m s 0 6 m s 0 8 m s 1 0 m s 1 2 m s 1 4 m s and the correlation coefficient between the amount of biofilm detached detached biofilm dry weight total number of bacteria eps and biofilm adhesion force were calculated as shown in fig 3 a c the correlation coefficient between the detached biofilm dry weight and the biofilm adhesion force is 0 4939 the correlation coefficient between the total number of bacteria and the biofilm adhesion force is 0 9568 the correlation coefficients between the detached exopolysaccharides epo concentration extracellular proteins epr concentration the sum of epo and epr concentration and biofilm adhesion force were 0 5548 0 7636 and 0 8029 respectively by comparison the correlation coefficient between the total number of bacteria and the biofilm adhesion force was the highest so it was used to calculate the biofilm adhesion force 3 3 effects of different flow conditions on biofilm composition and biofilm adhesion force to analyze the effect of hydraulic conditions on the biofilm composition and adhesion force the total number of bacteria the concentration of extracellular proteins and exopolysaccharides in the biofilm were analyzed as shown in fig 4 a compared with the initial stage 0 h the total number of bacteria under low flow velocity condition high flow velocity condition fluctuant flow velocity condition reverse low flow velocity condition reverse high flow velocity condition decreased by 59 26 64 64 82 15 18 68 and 34 34 at 12 h due to the biofilm detached from 12 h to 24 h due to the proliferation of bacteria the total number of bacteria increased from 1 75 105 cfu cm2 to 2 36 106 cfu cm2 under the high flow condition the total number of bacteria under low flow velocity condition fluctuant flow velocity condition reverse low flow velocity condition and reverse high flow velocity condition was 66 35 85 83 17 68 and 51 24 of the high flow velocity condition at 24 h respectively it was the high flow velocity that brought more nutrients and accelerated the proliferation of bacteria in the biofilm in the range of 0 24 h biofilm growth was in a fluctuant phase after three days the total number of bacteria in the biofilm was 2 23 106 3 43 106 cfu cm2 under the fluctuant flow velocity condition which was 6 64 94 38 and 16 87 67 73 higher than the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively at this time the biofilm has entered a period of dynamic stability and the growth of biofilms is limited under fixed flow velocity conditions the shear force generated by high flow velocity conditions forces the biofilm to detach and inhibits the attachment of microorganisms under the influence of low flow velocity conditions biofilms are in a slow growth process mainly due to a lower nutrient transport rate into the biofilm s interior however under the fluctuant flow velocity condition the top layer of the biofilm is continuously reset to provide nutrients for the proliferation of bacteria inside the biofilm which is more conducive to the growth and renewal of the biofilm after 24 h the total number of bacteria in the biofilm under the reverse high flow velocity condition is 47 97 71 38 lower than that under the high flow velocity condition under the reverse low flow velocity condition after seven days the total number of bacteria was 31 48 32 01 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition which indicated that the shear force generated by the reverse flow would cause the biofilm to detach it is consistent with the above mentioned biofilm thickness detection results eps is an essential component of the biofilm which can encapsulate bacteria to form a three dimensional structure with mechanical stability 50 51 the main components of eps are extracellular proteins and exopolysaccharides accounting for 75 89 of the total ingredients in addition to nucleic acids lipids phospholipids and humic substances etc 12 as shown in fig 4 b compared with the low flow velocity and fluctuant flow velocity conditions the high flow velocity promoted the secretion of exopolysaccharides still the concentration of extracellular proteins did not increase significantly because under the condition of high flow velocity microorganisms will secrete more eps which makes the structure of the biofilm more compact and stable to adapt to changes in the external environment 52 53 after about three days the extracellular protein concentration entered a dynamic stable period the maximum concentration under the low flow velocity condition was 3 68 Î¼g ml 86 42 30 17 65 93 and 82 37 higher than that under high flow velocity condition fluctuant flow velocity condition reverse low flow velocity condition and reverse high flow velocity condition it was that the biofilm is not easy to detach under low flow velocity and the extracellular protein is more easily secreted under stable hydraulic conditions the concentration of exopolysaccharide directly affects the adhesion of biofilms as shown in fig 4 c the concentration of exopolysaccharide began to increase under the condition of fluctuant flow velocity after seven days and reached a maximum of 2 64 Î¼g cm2 at 21 d the concentration of exopolysaccharide was 172 07 and 17 97 higher than those under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively the concentration of exopolysaccharide under the reverse high flow velocity condition and reverse low flow velocity condition was 47 29 and 36 57 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions respectively therefore not only high flow velocity will promote the secretion of biofilm exopolysaccharides but also other unstable hydraulic conditions such as fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow will promote the secretion of exopolysaccharides and strengthen the biofilm adhesion to cope with the change of growth environment as shown in fig 4 d the biofilm adhesion force is slightly different under low flow velocity high flow velocity and fluctuant flow velocity at 12 h but after 24 h the biofilm adhesion force changed significantly under the three hydraulic conditions and the biofilm adhesion force increased rapidly under high flow velocity conditions this value increased from 1 50 n m2 to 13 18 n m2 and the adhesion value is the highest it was that in the early stage of the system operation the biofilms detached a lot and the remaining biofilms have high shear resistance the adhesion is the lowest under fluctuant flow velocity which is 0 60 n m2 at 24 h 21 d the biofilm adhesion under the fluctuant flow velocity was 10 06 88 24 and 25 17 95 45 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition and the high flow velocity condition respectively the above results show that the biofilm adhesion is the lowest under the fluctuant flow velocity and biofilm is easier to detach and cause bulk water contamination to further explain the difference in biofilm adhesion under different flow conditions the bacterial community structure and function genes were analyzed 3 4 effects of different flow conditions on bacterial community structure in biofilms in this study the bacterial community structure in biofilm at 21 days was tested their total dna was purified amplified using 16s rrna primers and sequenced the biofilm s dominant bacteria at the phylum level and genus level were analyzed as shown in fig s4 the dominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria 88 35 94 18 bacteroidota 3 97 8 34 and firmicutes 1 12 3 39 the rest are actinobacteriota gemmatimonadota wps 2 acidobacteriota verrucomicrobiota cyanobacteria planctomycetota among them the relative abundance of proteobacteria under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was the highest with a value of 94 18 which was 5 83 and 2 93 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions at the same time the bacteroidota was 3 97 under the fluctuant flow velocity which was 3 48 and 0 91 lower than that under low and high flow velocity conditions under the fluctuant flow velocity the proliferation of the dominant phyla proteobacteria was promoted but the proliferation of bacteroidota was inhibited proteobacteria are generally the main dominant flora of biofilms in dwds because of their strong environmental adaptability 54 the relative abundance of proteobacteria under reverse low flow conditions was 0 64 higher than that under low flow velocity conditions and 2 26 lower than that under high flow velocity conditions the relative abundance of bacteroidota under reverse low flow velocity condition was 0 89 higher than that under the low flow velocity condition and 3 46 higher than that under the high flow velocity condition the relative abundance of proteobacteria under reverse high flow conditions is 2 71 lower than that under low flow conditions and 0 15 lower than that under high flow conditions which indicates that the reverse flow has a minor effect on the dominant bacterial proteobacteria and bacteroidota compared with the change in flow velocity because of the reverse flow causes the biofilm to detach directly and affects the bacterial community structure as shown in fig 5 a at the genus level the dominant bacteria are mainly dechloromonas 30 04 48 73 sphingobium 8 69 27 42 acidovorax 8 90 19 17 sediminibacterium 3 86 8 20 blastomonas 1 32 4 33 the relative abundance of dechloromonas belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity was the lowest with a value of 30 04 which was 14 15 and 18 69 lower than that under the low and high flow conditions respectively the relative abundance of the sphingobium belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 27 42 which was 13 10 and 7 47 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively the relative abundance of the acidovorax belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 17 86 which was 0 62 lower than that under the low flow velocity condition and 8 96 higher than under the high flow velocity condition the relative abundance of blastomonas belonging to the proteobacteria phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 4 33 which was 2 95 and 3 01 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively the relative abundance of the sediminibacterium belonging to the bacteroidota phylum under the fluctuant flow velocity condition was 3 86 which was 3 50 and 0 97 lower than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions respectively compared with the fixed low and high flow velocity conditions the relative abundances of dechloromonas and sediminibacterium decreased under fluctuant flow velocity conditions but the relative abundances of sphingobium and blastomonas increased under reverse flow condition the relative abundance of sphingobium under reverse high flow condition was 5 62 lower than that under high flow velocity conditions and the relative abundance of sphingobium under reverse low flow velocity condition was 10 27 lower than that under low flow velocity condition the relative abundance of blastomonas under reverse high flow velocity conditions was 1 87 higher than that under high flow velocity conditions and the relative abundance of blastomonas under reverse low flow velocity conditions was 1 24 higher than under low flow velocity conditions in the dwds compared with constant flow velocity fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow will affect the succession of the dominant bacterial community as shown in fig 5 b considering beta diversity the principal component analysis pcoa of the biofilm microbial community was analyzed 55 the two axes of the pcoa plot describe the results of significant difference p 0 05 between the fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow velocity on the first axis of pcoa there was a significant difference p 0 05 between the fluctuant flow velocity and low high flow velocity on the second axis of pcoa as shown in fig 5 c the differential analysis on the otu classification level wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 05 was calculated under five flow conditions 56 there were significant differences under the influence of low flow velocity and high flow velocity fig 5c rhombus nodes which mainly included the genus candidatus otu 110 and flavobacterium otu 88 there were significant differences under the influence of high flow velocity and fluctuant flow velocity fig 5c square nodes mainly including genus flavobacterium otu 183 chryseobacterium otu 144 and candidatus otu 110 there were significant differences under the influence of the low flow velocity and reverse low flow velocity fig 5c parallelogram nodes mainly including genus sediminibacterium otu 51 brevundimonas otu 113 and terrimonas otu 134 there were significant differences under the influence of fluctuant flow velocity and reverse high flow velocity fig 5c triangular nodes mainly including genus dechloromonas otu 96 sediminibacterium otu 51 bosea otu 116 and hyphomicrobium otu 13 the change in hydraulic conditions affects the succession of dominant bacteria in the biofilm the reason is that the changing shear force generated by the fluctuant flow velocity and the reverse flow makes the biofilm detached which directly affects the microbial community structure in the biofilm 57 on the other hand hydraulic conditions affect the behavior of microorganisms regulating themselves to screen the dominant genera further changing the biofilm structure to adapt to the unfavorable external environment 52 58 3 5 predictive analysis of function genes under different flow conditions in this study 16s rna sequencing data was used to predict the gene functions by picrust based on the kegg the kegg database is a large scale knowledge base for systematically analyzing gene functions and linking functional information which includes various metabolic pathways synthetic pathways membrane transport signal transmission cell cycle and disease related pathways pathway level 1 includes metabolism cellular processes organismal systems environmental information processing and more detailed gene functions that can be analyzed at pathway level 3 as shown in fig 6 the abundance of the function gene carbon metabolism cm in metabolism that reflects the transformation of carbon from nutrients into biomass under fluctuant hydraulic condition was 10 16 and 14 23 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions the abundance of the gene biosynthesis of amino acids baa which reflected the essential substances constituting protein under fluctuant hydraulic condition was 6 86 and 12 51 higher than that under the low and high flow velocity conditions the abundance of the function gene amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism asnsm reflecting microbial carbohydrate metabolism under fluctuant hydraulic condition was 15 52 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions and 12 34 the abundances of function genes protein digestion and absorption pda in organic systems under fluctuant hydraulic condition which can reflect the ability of microorganisms to digest and absorb nutrients and proteins was 44 61 and 26 07 higher than that under low and high flow velocity condition the abundance of absorbed function genes carbohydrate digestion and absorption cda reflecting the ability of microorganisms to digest carbohydrates under fluctuant hydraulic conditions were 81 16 and 34 32 higher than under low and high flow velocity conditions the microbial metabolism under fluctuant hydraulic conditions was more potent than that under low and high flow velocity conditions which was more conducive to bacterial proliferation and accelerated growth it is consistent with the detection of the total number of bacteria and the biofilm thickness the function gene apoptosis apo which can reflect cell apoptosis also had the highest abundance under fluctuant hydraulic conditions indicating that the microbial generation was replaced quickly it was also the reason for the highest fluorescence intensity of apoptotic cells in the clsm detection at the same time the abundance of the function gene biofilm formation in cellular processes under fluctuant flow velocity conditions was significantly higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions the function genes of the bacterial secretion system bss in environmental information processing reflecting the ability of bacteria to secrete extracellular polymers under fluctuant hydraulic conditions were 26 75 and 27 01 higher than that under low and high flow velocity conditions the abundance of function gene bss under reverse low flow velocity was 6 41 lower than that under low flow velocity conditions and the abundance of function gene bss under reverse high flow velocity was 11 78 lower than that under high flow velocity conditions it was found that the reverse flow promoted the detached of biofilm resulting in the decrease of the abundance of functional genes on the 21st day the total number of bacteria in the biofilm under fluctuating flow velocity conditions was more than that under low and high flow velocity conditions it is consistent with the abundance of function genes cm baa bf v bf p and bss which reflects the high metabolic capacity of microorganisms therefore from the picrust analysis we know that the abundance of functional genes that can reflect the metabolic capacity of microorganisms under fluctuant hydraulic conditions is significantly higher than that under other hydraulic conditions the expression of such function genes promotes biofilm metabolism and further affects biofilm composition 4 discussion compared with previous simulation studies of constant flow velocity this study revealed the effect of fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow on the biofilm in the dwds the above experimental results show that the biofilm thickness under the fluctuant flow velocity condition is significantly higher than that under other conditions and its value is 267 4 Î¼m at this time the biofilm adhesion force is the lowest in fact the constant high flow velocity will reduce the thickness of the biofilm from 300 Î¼m to 100 Î¼m when increased from 2 to 9 pa 59 on the one hand the water flow can transport nutrients and oxygen to the biofilm which promotes the proliferation of microorganisms and enhance eps secretion in response to environmental stress caused by high flow velocity for mechanical protection 50 60 on the contrary the concentration of proteins mainly affects the stiffness of the biofilms a previous study showed that protein rich regions on the surface of lactobacillus johnsonii bacteria were stiffer than polysaccharide rich regions 61 stiffer biofilms may be more stable against shear stress and little detachment therefore in this study the protein concentration under low flow velocity condition was higher than that under fluctuating flow velocity condition and the amount of biofilm detachment was also lower than that under fluctuant flow velocity condition on the other hand the water flow will have a scouring effect on the biofilm the higher the flow velocity the higher the shear force will be when the shear force exceeds the biofilm adhesion force the biofilm will detach and inhibit the growth of the biofilm 59 62 under the fluctuant flow velocity the biofilm obtains intermittent growth and the top layer of the biofilm is constantly reset 59 fluctuating flow conditions could be divided into a high flow velocity period and a low flow velocity period during the high flow velocity period high shear force makes the top layer of biofilm detach which ensures the transport of nutrients to the interior of the biofilm 63 the biofilm grows quickly under less environmental stress under the low flow velocity period the top layer detached during the high flow velocity period and growth during the low flow velocity period biofilms have also been proposed to respond to shear stress flow velocity by regulating metabolic pathways and become stronger 64 the succession of dominant bacteria and the expression of functional genes further explain how fluctuant water conditions affect biofilm thickness and adhesion force biofilm detached significantly reduced the relative abundance of the dominant bacteria genera dechloromonas acidovorax and sediminibacterium the relative abundance of sphingobium and blastomonas with hydrophobicity under fluctuant hydraulic condition increase could promote the adsorption and degradation of hydrophobic organic matter by bacteria and improve the environmental adaptability and metabolic capacity of biofilm 65 sphingobium has been shown to secrete exopolysaccharides which are the major component of microbial biofilms 66 this study also observed the same results moreover the microorganisms had higher metabolic capacity under fluctuant flow velocity conditions because the abundance of metabolic function genes was significantly higher than that under other hydraulic conditions the action of the function genes of the bacterial secretion system promotes the secretion of extracellular polymers which are the main substances in the biofilm more extracellular polymers lead to an increase in the thickness of the biofilm when the biofilm grows thicker the transport process of nutrients into the biofilm will be hindered 67 bacteria in the inner layer of biofilm are more prone to apoptosis due to nutrient deficiency which cause the biofilm adhesion decreases and the biofilm is easier to detach 68 69 as our experimental results also shows that under high metabolic capacity the functional gene apoptosis which reflects cell apoptosis maintains a high abundance therefore the shear force generated by different flow conditions in the dwds significantly affects the growth and detachment of the biofilm 5 conclusions in this study the biofilm composition and characteristics were studied under fluctuant flow velocity and reverse flow velocity to explore the effect of hydraulic conditions on biofilm detachment under the fluctuant flow condition the biofilm is easier to detach due to the lowest biofilm adhesion force the relative abundance of sphingobium with strong environmental adaptability and metabolic capacity also increased leading to accelerate the growth of biofilm and increase the thickness of biofilm the abundance of functional genes analysis also shows that the highest metabolic capacity of microorganisms in biofilm under this condition while under reverse flow condition the biofilm detaches duo to the shear force therefore the different flow conditions significantly affect the growth and detachment of the biofilm through a different mechanism and we can improve the water quality by regulating the hydraulic condition of the drinking water distribution system declaration of

12447,the issue of black and smelly water bodies has been important for urban management and ecological restoration by submerged macrophytes is an effective technology to prevent and control black and smelly water bodies this study selected vallisneria natans ceratophyllum demersum and potamogeton malainus to restore black and smelly water bodies based on the removal performance of chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn the influence of biological community was evaluated by different planting structure of submerged macrophytes and high throughput dna sequencing so as to study the relationship of microorganism and submerged macrophyte the experiment results showed that the removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n and tn of submerged macrophytes could reach 89 4 92 7 94 9 and 92 8 respectively and vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus yielded the best results for water restoration sequencing showed that proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were the common dominant phyla while microbial community composition at genus level varied among different planting patterns pearson correlation analysis revealed that proteobacteri and bacteroidetes positively correlated with the removal efficiency of pollutants these results suggest that mixed submerged macrophytes improve water quality better than monotype and affect the microbial diversity and composition graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords submerged macrophytes black and smelly water bodies plant microbial synergistic effect microbial community structure functional bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as urbanization progresses the concentration of various pollutants in urban water environments such as eutrophication organic matter metals and toxic substances has been increasing black and smelly water bodies have emerged in numerous countries posing one of the most significant water environmental challenges globally 1 3 black smelly water bodies are characterized by high chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations a large amount of organic matter and nitrogen n and phosphorus p elements can lead to a decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in water which in turn triggers black odor in water bodies 4 8 black and smelly water bodies have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and humans so purifying the water quality of black and smelly water bodies has become a particularly urgent environmental issue 9 phytoremediation is an essential technique for achieving sustainable remediation of black and malodorous water 10 submerged macrophytes are the primary producers of lakes and play a crucial role in the improvement of water quality by preventing sediment resuspension removing suspended particles from the water and increasing the absorption of nutrients primarily n and p from the surrounding environment 11 13 additionally they increase the do concentration through photosynthesis thus improving the black and malodorous situation in rivers by facilitating the transport of oxygen to the plant roots and providing sufficient oxygen for microorganisms in the root zone submerged macrophytes with their distinct leaf structures are widely utilized in lake restoration to manage aquatic plant populations via techniques such as submerged phytoremediation oxidation ponds and ecological floating island technologies 14 therefore submerged macrophyte restoration is a potential approach to restoring aquatic ecosystems by focusing on establishing effective communities of submerged macrophytes however previous studies on submerged macrophytes aimed at improving the quality of aquatic ecosystems and the mechanism of restoration enhancement remains unclear particularly the synergistic effect of the microbial community on submerged macrophyte restoration microorganisms can biodegrade and transform nutrients promote biogeochemical cycles and play an important role in maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems 15 16 the extensive leaf surfaces of submerged macrophytes provide various bacterial habitats 17 18 and the epiphytic bacteria residing on biofilms attached to these macrophytes play crucial roles in nutrient metabolism in aquatic ecosystems 19 21 the presence of bacteria on submerged macrophytes leads to complex interactions such as nutrient competition and host selection between epiphytic and planktonic microorganisms 22 24 and several studies have demonstrated that the community structure of epiphytic bacteria is comparable to that of planktonic bacteria 25 26 in addition environmental characteristics such as temperature tp and do in water have been shown to significantly impact bacterial populations in both epiphytic and planktonic characteristics 27 specifically the presence of macrophytes in aquatic habitats modifies the horizontal and vertical heterogeneity of the aquatic environment thereby altering microbial communities 28 29 besides the nutrients and oxygen released by submerged macrophytes promote the growth of bacterial populations 30 which in turn benefit the macrophytes by increasing carbon dioxide levels and enhancing elements cycling 22 furthermore the distinctive physical and chemical properties of biofilms on various plant species can account for the host specificity of epiphytic bacteria 25 high throughput sequencing technology has been frequently used to study the characteristics of bacterial communities in water environments 31 32 in summary the cooperation of microbial communities and submerged macrophytes has been influencing the pollutant removal performance and as submerged macrophytes spread and the environment changes the evaluation of epiphytic bacteria s compositions and roles is needed although previous studies have investigated the use of submerged macrophytes for the restoration of black and smelly water bodies 33 as well as the response of microbial communities to submerged macrophytes 34 35 most restoration experiments have been small scale indoor tests furthermore there has been little attention given to the effects of mixed planting patterns on the restoration efficacy of black and smelly water bodies as well as their impact on the diversity and composition of microbial communities in order to evaluate the correlation of microorganisms and submerged macrophytes in restoring black and smelly water bodies this study conducted pilot scale experiments to restore black and smelly water bodies and evaluated the removal performance of cod tp nh4 n and tn of different planting patterns in addition because the bacterial community plays a crucial role in the ecological restoration of aquatic ecosystems we employed high throughput dna sequencing analysis to investigate the bacterial colonization of selected submerged macrophytes vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus and ceratophyllum demersum to assess the structural impact of these bacteria on submerged macrophyte restoration we hypothesized that the presence of submerged macrophytes will have a positive impact on water quality by optimizing the microbial community structure influencing nutrient cycling and affecting oxygen availability furthermore we predicted that the composition and structure of microbial communities in water bodies with different submerged macrophyte planting structures will exhibit significant differences influenced by plant microbe interactions nutrient availability and do levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and sampling the pilot scale experiment of 700 m2 was performed in baiyun lake guangzhou city china the experimental area was divided into 5 subareas labeled as zones 1 to 5 fig 1 to reduce adjacency influences zones 1 3 and 5 were used before the experiment operation the water quality in the experiment area was adjusted to cod 25 86 mg l tp 0 18 0 76 mg l and tn 1 28 8 45 mg l herein after calles as inferior class v standard the dissolved solution of chemicals was evenly spread into the experimental area to adjust the concentration of the experimental water subsequently the concentrations were measured at different locations to confirm the effectiveness of the dosing seedlings of vallisneria natans vn potamogeton malainus pm and ceratophyllum demersum cd were planted in zones 1 3 and 5 respectively and 3 groups of experiment with submerged macrophytes during growing period were performed subsequently the experiment of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period was conducted for 7 consecutive days the densities of vn pm and cd were 62 plants m2 20 plants m2 and 62 plants m2 respectively the low density of pm was attributed to its inability to survive under relatively high water temperatures in august 27 c 31 5 c bacterial sequencing was conducted on bacterial sequencing samples of vallisneria natans ceratophyllum demersum and potamogeton malainus labeled as wvn wcd and wpm respectively in order to evaluate the cooperative effect of different submerged macrophytes group 1 vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus vnpm group 2 ceratophyllum demersum vallisneria natans vncd and group 3 potamogeton malainus ceratophyllum demersum pmcd were planted in zones 1 3 and 5 respectively after the experiments with monotype submerged macrophytes were completed as mentioned above at the beginning of this experiment the water quality in the test area was adjusted to inferior class v standard as mentioned above and analyzed the water quality for 7 consecutive days followed by bacteria sequencing for sampling method 3 samples were collected from each zone and the average value of water quality in sampling points were selected for bacteria sequencing analysis water samples from 3 water quality sampling points were mixed 2 2 chemicals to regulate the concentration of cod a ratio of 1 3 of potassium hydrogen phthalate c8h5o4k and glucose c6h12o6 was employed for the regulation of tn concentration ammonia chloride nh4cl was used while monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 was used to regulate tp concentration further information regarding the chemicals used is provided in table s1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis cod concentration was determined by digestion spectrophotometry the concentration of nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry the concentration of tn was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry with an alkaline potassium persulfate digestion the tp concentration was detected using the digestion ascorbic acid method for specific experimental procedures refer to water analysis handbook by hach 36 one way anova was used to analyze the significance of the differences in pollutant removal efficiencies among different submerged macrophytes or submerged macrophyte groups bonferroni and tamhane s t2 methods were selected as test methods for the significance of the difference between two samples for homogeneity of variances and non homogeneity of variances with a significance level of p 0 05 2 3 2 microbial sequencing analysis genomic dna of collected samples was extracted according to the instructions of the dna extraction kit the integrity and purity of dna were detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration of dna was evaluated by thermo nanodrop one 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 were used as primers to amplify the v4 region of bacteria with 16s rrna gene the pcr amplification process is as follows 5 min at 94 c for initialization 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 c for denaturation 30 s annealing at 52 c 30 s extension at 72 c then followed by 10 min at 72 c for final elongation pe250 sequencing was performed on the constructed amplicon library using illumina nova 6000 platform for the analysis of bacterial sequencing the sequences were divided into different operational taxonomic units otus according to their similarities the cluster analysis of otus was carried out using uparse method in order to investigate the species abundance and diversity of microbial communities in the samples chao1 index and simpson index were calculated for each sample based on the otu abundance table nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on otu level and bray curtis distance algorithm were applied to evaluate the differences in microbial community composition among different samples the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between functional microbes and pollutant removal efficiencies as well as the relationship between dominant microbes and environmental factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality profiles in the growing period the do profile during the growing period is shown in fig 2 a during the early growing period the do concentration increased in the area with submerged macrophytes during the latter growing period the do concentration of cd was relatively stable while the do concentrations of vn and pm were significantly reduced the overall do range was at a high concentration level of 7 86 13 87 mg l which ensured sufficient oxygen for bacterial nitrification thereby contributing to the effective removal of nh4 n 37 the cod profile during the growing period is shown in fig 2 b c the final cod concentrations of the 3 submerged macrophytes were 19 mg l in the early growing period during the latter growing period the cod concentration of vn pm and cd decreased significantly with removal efficiencies of 56 1 58 5 and 77 8 respectively previous studies have shown that aquatic macrophytes can effectively remove organic pollutants from water by stimulating the activity of microorganisms transforming pollutants into simpler compound tissues combined with plants metabolizing pollutants and so on 38 the tp profile during the growing period is presented in fig 1 d e the tp concentration of vn pm and cd decreased significantly with average removal efficiencies of 68 4 57 1 and 56 6 respectively the average tp removal efficiency of vn was significantly higher than that of pm and cd aquatic plants attract microbial communities to the rhizosphere by releasing various organic compounds 38 and microorganisms act as mineralizers of organophosphorus through biommineralization and biochemical mineralization 39 the rhizosphere absorption of submerged macrophytes can promote p cycling and facilitate the removal of tp from the water 40 the nh4 n profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the growing period is depicted in fig 2 f g the results show that the nh4 n concentrations of vn pm and cd were finally 0 28 mg l and the average removal efficiencies were 74 3 50 6 and 36 1 respectively it is worth noting that the nh4 n concentration of pm decreased slightly in the latter growing period which may be due to the low initial concentration during the growing period of monotype submerged macrophytes the tn profile is shown in fig 2 h i the tn removal efficiencies of 3 submerged macrophytes were stable and the average tn removal efficiencies of vn pm and cd were 71 1 58 7 and 45 9 respectively aquatic plants remove n from water by two main mechanisms first plants absorb n directly second plants transport oxygen to the roots through photosynthesis creating a favorable environment for nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria including aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions 41 42 malondialdehyde mda is a cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation while catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod are important antioxidant enzymes in plant antioxidant stress 43 the increase of concentrations of pollutants cod tn nh4 n and tp causes stress to submerged macrophytes leading to lipid peroxidation indicated by mda which in turn stimulates antioxidant enzymes cat pod and sod to perform physiological regulation thereby affecting the removal capacity of submerged macrophytes for pollutants 44 the initial concentration of pollutants varied greatly among the 3 experiments resulting in different levels of physiological regulation of submerged macrophytes which could account for the significant difference in the removal efficiency of pollutants among the 3 experiments in summary the ranking of the average removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n tn by the 3 submerged macrophytes is shown in table s2 the comprehensive ranking of the average removal efficiency of vn was the highest the removal effects of cod tp and nh4 n among the 3 submerged macrophytes were not significantly different p 0 05 however the tn removal effect of vn was significantly higher than that of cd p 0 05 while the difference between pm and the other 2 submerged macrophytes was not significant p 0 05 the absorption and utilization of nutrients by submerged macrophytes mainly occur through their leaves 45 the abundant roots of submerged macrophytes can promote the removal of n and p by rhizosphere microorganisms 46 the larger the root surface area of aquatic plants the larger the storage of n and p which is conducive to the removal of n and p in water 47 thus vallisneria natans obtained better comprehensive water purification capacity during the growing period experiment which could be attributed to its abundant roots and largest leaf area 3 2 water quality profiles in the mature period 3 2 1 water quality profiles of monotype submerged macrophytes the do profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period is shown in fig 3 a with do concentrations ranging between 2 80 and 5 46 mg l throughout the experimental period the cod profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period is illustrated in fig 3 b at the beginning of the experiment the cod concentration of each submerged macrophyte treatment showed a downward trend and slightly increased at 5d by the end of the experiment the cod concentrations of vn pm and cd were 19 70 mg l 13 83 mg l and 13 90 mg l respectively this increase can be attributed to the degradation of cod by bacteria present in the aquatic plant rhizosphere as reported previously 48 the tp profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period is shown in fig 3 c at the beginning of the experiment tp concentration of each submerged macrophyte showed a downward trend and stabilized after 2 3 days by the end of the experiment the tp concentrations of all submerged macrophytes were 0 08 mg l with removal efficiencies of 86 2 80 0 and 79 5 respectively the nh4 n and tn profiles of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period are shown in fig 2 d and e respectively submerged macrophytes can affect the n cycle to reduce the n content in water as studied previously 49 the concentrations of nh4 n and tn of vn continued to decrease while the concentrations of nh4 n and tn of pm and cd showed a decreasing trend and stabilized after 4 days the final nh4 n and tn concentrations of the 3 submerged macrophytes were below 0 42 mg l and 1 06 mg l respectively it is worth noting that submerged macrophytes have the potential to permanently remove n and p from polluted water systems through harvesting 50 the ranking of the average removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n tn by the 3 submerged macrophytes is shown in table s3 compared with the growing period the differences between the 3 submerged macrophytes in removing cod tp and nh4 n in the mature period were still not significant p 0 05 similarly the difference in tn removal efficiency between vn and the other two submerged macrophytes was not significant p 0 05 despite this the overall average removal efficiency of vn was marginally higher indicating that vallisneria natans remained the most effective submerged macrophyte for water purification during the mature period similar to the growing period 3 2 2 water quality profiles of mixed submerged macrophytes the do profile of mixed submerged macrophytes during the mature period is shown in fig 4 a the do of the vncd demonstrated a decreasing trend while the do of the vnpm and pmcd fluctuated continuously after 2 days there was no significant difference in do concentration among the three groups the cod and tp profiles of mixed submerged macrophytes during the mature period are shown in fig 4 b and c respectively the cod and tp concentrations in each group exhibited a sharp decrease within 2 to 3 days plants can use plant enzymes such as oxygenase and dehalogenase to degrade organic pollutants in water and thus reduce cod concentration 51 since plants lack active transporters these organic pollutants are taken in through passive absorption 52 the average cod removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 77 6 71 4 and 68 5 respectively similarly the average tp removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 89 0 82 9 and 87 4 respectively furthermore the nh4 n and tn profiles of mixed submerged macrophytes during the mature period are shown in fig 4 d e the concentrations of nh4 n and tn in each group decreased sharply on the 2nd day the average nh4 n removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 92 2 80 2 and 82 6 respectively while the average tn removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 90 9 79 7 and 77 5 respectively the high nh4 n removal efficiencies observed in the study can be mainly attributed to the combined effects of direct uptake by submerged macrophytes and a nitrogen transformation by microbial communities 31 submerged macrophytes can directly uptake nh4 n from the water as a primary n source for their growth and metabolism besides the root systems of submerged macrophytes create a favorable environment for the growth of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria nitrifying bacteria convert nh4 n to nitrite no2 and subsequently to nitrate no3 through the process of nitrification denitrifying bacteria then convert nitrate into gaseous nitrogen n2 which is released into the atmosphere this microbial n transformation process helps reduce nh4 n levels in the water the ranking of the average removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n tn by 3 submerged macrophytes groups is shown in table s4 the comprehensive removal efficiency of vnpm ranked the highest the cod removal effect of vnpm was significantly higher than that of pmcd p 0 05 whereas there was no significant difference between vncd and the other two groups p 0 05 the removal effect of nh4 n and tn of vnpm was significantly better than that of the other 2 groups p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in tp removal efficiency among the 3 mixed submerged macrophyte groups p 0 05 in light of these findings the submerged macrophytes group with better water purification capacity was the combination of vallisneria natans and potamogeton malainus comparing water quality changes between the optimal results of monotype submerged macrophytes experiment and mixed submerged macrophyte experiment during the mature period compared with vn the cod tp nh4 n and tn concentrations in vnpm decreased at a faster rate with a steeper decline the final and average removal efficiencies of cod tp nh4 n and tn were consistently higher in vnpm than in vn indicating that the combination of vallisneria natans and potamogeton malaianus represents the macrophyte planting structure with the most effective water purification capacity research studies have established that multi species submerged macrophytes are more effective in water purification than monotype plants due to their ability to adapt to changes in nutrient and climatic conditions which in turn helps maintain a stable water ecosystem 53 55 different submerged macrophytes have unique functions and different combinations of these macrophytes can play varying roles in aquatic environments 56 vallisneria natans was identified as the optimal species in the monotype submerged macrophytes experiment and the addition of other submerged macrophytes on the basis of vn may contributed to the establishment of a stable large submerged plant community and further improved water purification additionally substances released from within submerged macrophytes can regulate or select bacteria in the surrounding water and physical barriers and host selectivity can contribute to the differentiation of planktonic bacterial communities between different submerged macrophytes 24 microorganisms play an important role in mineralization of organic matter nitrification and denitrification of n and transformation of p 39 different combinations of submerged macrophytes may complement their specific functional microbial communities so it is necessary to study the characteristics of microbial communities under different planting structures of submerged macrophytes 3 3 microbial community characteristics 3 3 1 distribution and alpha diversity previous research has highlighted the importance of environmental and nutritional conditions in influencing the diversity and composition of microbial communities in water environments 34 57 factors such as dissolved organic matter inorganic carbon n p temperature and aquatic plant evolution have been found to be particularly relevant 29 58 59 as shown in table 1 for monotype submerged macrophytes the average chao1 index was 910 8 the chao1 indexes of wpm and wcd were relatively higher than that of wvn while the chao1 indexes of wpm and wcd were similar the simpson index values of 3 submerged macrophytes were close indicating that the microbial diversities in the water around 3 submerged macrophytes were similar for mixed submerged macrophytes the chao1 and simpson indices of vnpm and vncd were close to those of monotype submerged macrophytes while the chao1 index of vnpm and vncd was 70 39 and 73 72 higher than that of pmcd and the simpson index of vnpm and vncd was 68 10 and 68 59 lower than that of pmcd suggesting that the combination of potamogeton malainus and ceratophyllum demersum significantly reduced the abundance of microbial species and diversity of microbial communities 3 3 2 community composition of bacteria as shown in fig 5 a b the dominant phyla of 6 samples were proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria these dominant phytoplankton phyla of submerged macrophytes were mostly consistent with those found in other studies table 2 proteobacteria are the main phyla found in aquatic ecosystems 60 61 and they are dominant under multiple environmental conditions 62 in addition to pmcd verrucomicrobia was also one of the dominant phyla in the other samples in the monotype submerged macrophyte experiment the relative abundance of dominant bacteria was similar among the different submerged macrophytes however in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment the relative abundance of dominant bacteria varied significantly among the different submerged macrophyte groups as shown in fig 5 c d for monotype submerged macrophyte the dominant genera of 3 submerged macrophytes were hgci clade cyanobium pcc 6307 cl500 29 marine group polynucleobacter sediminibacterium dinghuibacter hydrogenophaga fukun57 and fluviicola and the relative abundance of dominant genera among the 3 submerged macrophytes was similar in the mixed submerged macrophytes experiment the common dominant bacteria genera of 3 submerged macrophyte groups were hgci clade cyanobium pcc 6307 pseudomonas cl500 29 marine group and cupriavidus the hgci clade belongs to actinobacteria and is a typical freshwater bacterial genus 63 while cyanobium pcc 6307 and cl500 29 marine group are also abundant in freshwater 64 66 the dominant genera differed obviously from previous studies with only pseudomonas being a common dominant genus table 2 the differences in plant type and environmental conditions may be the main causes of variation the relative abundance of pseudomonas and cupriavidus was higher in vncd and pmcd while the relative abundance of hgci clade and dinghuibacter was higher in vnpm the abundance of pseudomonas increased markedly after mixed planting of submerged macrophytes indicating that mixed planting of submerged macrophytes may affect the environment and increase the abundance of pseudomonas in the water previous studies have shown that plants actively select specific microbiomes and that certain bacteria opportunistically colonize available ecological niches leading to changes in plant associated bacterial communities 67 68 furthermore the specificity of litters and secretions of different plants contributes to the composition and differentiation of the microbial community 69 70 while plant litter has contrasting and specific effects on microbial community 71 besides the concentrations of ammonium ion nh4 and no3 are important factors affecting the abundance of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria with competition existing between these two microbial groups 75 the composition of bacterial communities may be related to changes in nh4 and tn concentrations 72 74 the impacts of environmental factors on dominant microbes were subjected to pearson correlation analysis and the results are displayed in fig 6 the abundance of each dominant microbes exhibits strong correlations with 0 to 2 environmental factors indicating substantial variations in the limiting environmental factors for these microbes and changes in nutrient concentrations may lead to alterations in microbial community composition pseudomonas demonstrates a negative correlation with tp but a positive correlation with tn pseudomonas has been identified as the major genus of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and plays an important role in the mineralization of p 72 75 many strains of pseudomonas have also been shown to possess aerobic denitrification capability 73 the cl500 29 marine group is negatively correlated with nh4 n concentrations proteobacteria bacteroidetes hgci clade and dinghuibacter exhibit negative correlations with tn while actinobacteria show positive correlations with tn previous studies have shown that the abundance of actinobacteria is significantly positively correlated with the n content in the environment 76 possibly because actinobacteria contain spore forming and gram positive taxa some of which can survive under high nitrogen conditions 77 some gene patterns of hgci clade match important global n cycling pathways 78 such as denitrification and n fixation while dinghuibacter is involved in the coordinated metabolism of n 79 this finding suggests that tn concentration indeed has a greater influence on the structure of microbial communities in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment the initial concentration of nh4 n and tn in the vnpm group was nearly twice that of the other groups which may be one of the reasons for the differences in their microbial communities the relationship between do and mostly dominant microbes is relatively weak with a few displaying a distinct positive correlation fig 6 although the relationship between do and dominant microorganisms is relatively weak in this study it is worth noting that do levels can still impact the growth and activity of microbes in aquatic environments 33 80 do affects the removal efficiency of organic matter and is also an important factor in nitrification and denitrification processes 81 cod displays a moderate positive or negative correlation with each dominant microbes this indicates that the correlation between cod and microbial community was not significant which is the same as the results of previous study 74 nevertheless changes in the quality of organic carbon in water may affect microbial abundance 82 nmds was employed to discern dissimilarities in the community composition of samples as shown in fig s1 a b the results revealed conspicuous variances in bacterial composition among the 3 submerged macrophytes in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment the dissimilarities in bacterial composition among the three groups of submerged macrophytes were more apparent than those in the monotype submerged macrophyte experiments this phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that submerged plants discharge specific chemicals that induce host specific microbial communities as noted in previous studies 83 3 3 3 predicted function of microbial community the water purification function of the dominant bacteria at the phylum level was investigated pearson correlation coefficient of microbial and pollutant removal efficiency was calculated and the results were shown in table 3 proteobacteri contains a variety of bacteria which are capable of removing organic matter n and p 84 pearson correlation analyses revealed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 between proteobacteria and the final removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn with correlation coefficients of 0 83 and 0 88 respectively actinobacteria includes bacteria associated with anaerobic ammoxidation 86 bacteroidetes is linked to the degradation of organic matter p removal 87 88 and n removal 89 cyanobacteria which possess n fixation properties and can perform photosynthesis have been found to enhance the degradation of pollutants in water 90 firmicutes and chloroflexi are dominant bacteria in the process of anaerobic denitrification 91 acidobacteria is the dominant phylum responsible for biological p removal and has been reported to have functions in n fixation and biological denitrification 92 93 nitrospirae encompasses both nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria 94 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes had a strong positive correlation with the final removal efficiencies of tn r 0 91 and nh4 n r 0 75 while planctomycetes and nitrospirae had a moderate positive correlation with the final removal efficiency of nh4 n r 0 48 r 0 42 the majority of the dominant bacterial phyla associated with submerged macrophytes exhibited the ability to degrade water pollutants and played significant roles in n and p removal in this study the study also explored the potential water purification function of dominant bacterial genera terrimonas had a strong positive correlation with the final removal efficiency of nh4 n r 0 86 and tn r 0 95 in this study previous studies have shown that novosphingobium and terrimonas are aerobic denitrification bacteria contributing to denitrification 95 96 hydrogenophaga a genus of denitrifying bacteria has been shown to remove n and p 97 it exhibited moderate positive correlations with the final removal efficiency of nh4 n r 0 62 and tn r 0 44 pseudomonas a genus positively correlated with tp removal efficiency has been identified as a main contributor to tp removal 84 98 additionally pseudomonas plays a critical role in reducing the bloom of cyanobacteria in eutrophic water 99 sphingomonas is capable of degrading organic compounds containing p 100 both pseudomonas and sphingomonas demonstrated a strong positive correlation with the final removal rate of tp r 0 93 r 0 92 suggesting that these bacteria may play a vital role in tp removal the relative abundance of functional bacteria related to water purification was summarized table 4 in the monotype submerged macrophytes experiment the relative abundance of n and p removal functional bacteria of vallisneria natans was 2 70 which was higher than the relative abundance of the other 2 submerged macrophytes the removal of n and p by submerged macrophytes primarily depends on direct plant absorption physical action and the coordination of microorganisms 101 better performance of vallisneria natans in water purification capacity in monotype submerged macrophytes experiment may be related to the higher abundance of microbes involving in the n and p removals in the mixed submerged macrophytes experiment the highest relative abundance of bacteria involved in n and p removals was observed in pmcd followed by vncd the functional bacteria with the highest relative abundance in pmcd 65 4 and vncd 23 7 was pseudomonas apart from pseudomonas the relative abundances of other functional bacteria in vnpm vncd and pmcd were 2 14 1 29 and 0 98 respectively as the water purification effect of vnpm was the best in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment it is possible that the denitrification and p removal effect of pseudomonas may be limited while other microbes with n and p removal capacities may play a more significant role 4 conclusions and recommendations mixed planting can better restore black and smelly water ecology by leveraging submerged macrophytes varying growth characteristics to absorb pollutants and alter microbial population traits the sequencing results showed that bacteria proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were the dominant species and the composition of microbial communities at the genus level was different among different planting patterns with a relative increase in the abundance of functional microbes observed under mixed planting overall the presence of submerged macrophytes and their planting patterns could influence the diversity and composition of microbial communities during the restoration of black and smelly water bodies based on the findings of this study it is recommended that native species be selected for restoration taking into account the local conditions such as pollutant concentration water depth and light conditions among others in order to form diverse and stable communities additionally vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus is recommended for the restoration of black smelly water bodies followed by vallisneria natans but the survival rate of potamogeton malainus is low in the case of high water temperatures 30 c making it necessary to pay attention to whether the water temperature is suitable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12447,the issue of black and smelly water bodies has been important for urban management and ecological restoration by submerged macrophytes is an effective technology to prevent and control black and smelly water bodies this study selected vallisneria natans ceratophyllum demersum and potamogeton malainus to restore black and smelly water bodies based on the removal performance of chemical oxygen demand cod total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn the influence of biological community was evaluated by different planting structure of submerged macrophytes and high throughput dna sequencing so as to study the relationship of microorganism and submerged macrophyte the experiment results showed that the removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n and tn of submerged macrophytes could reach 89 4 92 7 94 9 and 92 8 respectively and vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus yielded the best results for water restoration sequencing showed that proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were the common dominant phyla while microbial community composition at genus level varied among different planting patterns pearson correlation analysis revealed that proteobacteri and bacteroidetes positively correlated with the removal efficiency of pollutants these results suggest that mixed submerged macrophytes improve water quality better than monotype and affect the microbial diversity and composition graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords submerged macrophytes black and smelly water bodies plant microbial synergistic effect microbial community structure functional bacteria data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as urbanization progresses the concentration of various pollutants in urban water environments such as eutrophication organic matter metals and toxic substances has been increasing black and smelly water bodies have emerged in numerous countries posing one of the most significant water environmental challenges globally 1 3 black smelly water bodies are characterized by high chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn concentrations a large amount of organic matter and nitrogen n and phosphorus p elements can lead to a decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in water which in turn triggers black odor in water bodies 4 8 black and smelly water bodies have adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and humans so purifying the water quality of black and smelly water bodies has become a particularly urgent environmental issue 9 phytoremediation is an essential technique for achieving sustainable remediation of black and malodorous water 10 submerged macrophytes are the primary producers of lakes and play a crucial role in the improvement of water quality by preventing sediment resuspension removing suspended particles from the water and increasing the absorption of nutrients primarily n and p from the surrounding environment 11 13 additionally they increase the do concentration through photosynthesis thus improving the black and malodorous situation in rivers by facilitating the transport of oxygen to the plant roots and providing sufficient oxygen for microorganisms in the root zone submerged macrophytes with their distinct leaf structures are widely utilized in lake restoration to manage aquatic plant populations via techniques such as submerged phytoremediation oxidation ponds and ecological floating island technologies 14 therefore submerged macrophyte restoration is a potential approach to restoring aquatic ecosystems by focusing on establishing effective communities of submerged macrophytes however previous studies on submerged macrophytes aimed at improving the quality of aquatic ecosystems and the mechanism of restoration enhancement remains unclear particularly the synergistic effect of the microbial community on submerged macrophyte restoration microorganisms can biodegrade and transform nutrients promote biogeochemical cycles and play an important role in maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems 15 16 the extensive leaf surfaces of submerged macrophytes provide various bacterial habitats 17 18 and the epiphytic bacteria residing on biofilms attached to these macrophytes play crucial roles in nutrient metabolism in aquatic ecosystems 19 21 the presence of bacteria on submerged macrophytes leads to complex interactions such as nutrient competition and host selection between epiphytic and planktonic microorganisms 22 24 and several studies have demonstrated that the community structure of epiphytic bacteria is comparable to that of planktonic bacteria 25 26 in addition environmental characteristics such as temperature tp and do in water have been shown to significantly impact bacterial populations in both epiphytic and planktonic characteristics 27 specifically the presence of macrophytes in aquatic habitats modifies the horizontal and vertical heterogeneity of the aquatic environment thereby altering microbial communities 28 29 besides the nutrients and oxygen released by submerged macrophytes promote the growth of bacterial populations 30 which in turn benefit the macrophytes by increasing carbon dioxide levels and enhancing elements cycling 22 furthermore the distinctive physical and chemical properties of biofilms on various plant species can account for the host specificity of epiphytic bacteria 25 high throughput sequencing technology has been frequently used to study the characteristics of bacterial communities in water environments 31 32 in summary the cooperation of microbial communities and submerged macrophytes has been influencing the pollutant removal performance and as submerged macrophytes spread and the environment changes the evaluation of epiphytic bacteria s compositions and roles is needed although previous studies have investigated the use of submerged macrophytes for the restoration of black and smelly water bodies 33 as well as the response of microbial communities to submerged macrophytes 34 35 most restoration experiments have been small scale indoor tests furthermore there has been little attention given to the effects of mixed planting patterns on the restoration efficacy of black and smelly water bodies as well as their impact on the diversity and composition of microbial communities in order to evaluate the correlation of microorganisms and submerged macrophytes in restoring black and smelly water bodies this study conducted pilot scale experiments to restore black and smelly water bodies and evaluated the removal performance of cod tp nh4 n and tn of different planting patterns in addition because the bacterial community plays a crucial role in the ecological restoration of aquatic ecosystems we employed high throughput dna sequencing analysis to investigate the bacterial colonization of selected submerged macrophytes vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus and ceratophyllum demersum to assess the structural impact of these bacteria on submerged macrophyte restoration we hypothesized that the presence of submerged macrophytes will have a positive impact on water quality by optimizing the microbial community structure influencing nutrient cycling and affecting oxygen availability furthermore we predicted that the composition and structure of microbial communities in water bodies with different submerged macrophyte planting structures will exhibit significant differences influenced by plant microbe interactions nutrient availability and do levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and sampling the pilot scale experiment of 700 m2 was performed in baiyun lake guangzhou city china the experimental area was divided into 5 subareas labeled as zones 1 to 5 fig 1 to reduce adjacency influences zones 1 3 and 5 were used before the experiment operation the water quality in the experiment area was adjusted to cod 25 86 mg l tp 0 18 0 76 mg l and tn 1 28 8 45 mg l herein after calles as inferior class v standard the dissolved solution of chemicals was evenly spread into the experimental area to adjust the concentration of the experimental water subsequently the concentrations were measured at different locations to confirm the effectiveness of the dosing seedlings of vallisneria natans vn potamogeton malainus pm and ceratophyllum demersum cd were planted in zones 1 3 and 5 respectively and 3 groups of experiment with submerged macrophytes during growing period were performed subsequently the experiment of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period was conducted for 7 consecutive days the densities of vn pm and cd were 62 plants m2 20 plants m2 and 62 plants m2 respectively the low density of pm was attributed to its inability to survive under relatively high water temperatures in august 27 c 31 5 c bacterial sequencing was conducted on bacterial sequencing samples of vallisneria natans ceratophyllum demersum and potamogeton malainus labeled as wvn wcd and wpm respectively in order to evaluate the cooperative effect of different submerged macrophytes group 1 vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus vnpm group 2 ceratophyllum demersum vallisneria natans vncd and group 3 potamogeton malainus ceratophyllum demersum pmcd were planted in zones 1 3 and 5 respectively after the experiments with monotype submerged macrophytes were completed as mentioned above at the beginning of this experiment the water quality in the test area was adjusted to inferior class v standard as mentioned above and analyzed the water quality for 7 consecutive days followed by bacteria sequencing for sampling method 3 samples were collected from each zone and the average value of water quality in sampling points were selected for bacteria sequencing analysis water samples from 3 water quality sampling points were mixed 2 2 chemicals to regulate the concentration of cod a ratio of 1 3 of potassium hydrogen phthalate c8h5o4k and glucose c6h12o6 was employed for the regulation of tn concentration ammonia chloride nh4cl was used while monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 was used to regulate tp concentration further information regarding the chemicals used is provided in table s1 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analysis cod concentration was determined by digestion spectrophotometry the concentration of nh4 n was determined by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry the concentration of tn was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry with an alkaline potassium persulfate digestion the tp concentration was detected using the digestion ascorbic acid method for specific experimental procedures refer to water analysis handbook by hach 36 one way anova was used to analyze the significance of the differences in pollutant removal efficiencies among different submerged macrophytes or submerged macrophyte groups bonferroni and tamhane s t2 methods were selected as test methods for the significance of the difference between two samples for homogeneity of variances and non homogeneity of variances with a significance level of p 0 05 2 3 2 microbial sequencing analysis genomic dna of collected samples was extracted according to the instructions of the dna extraction kit the integrity and purity of dna were detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration of dna was evaluated by thermo nanodrop one 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacnngggtatctaat 3 were used as primers to amplify the v4 region of bacteria with 16s rrna gene the pcr amplification process is as follows 5 min at 94 c for initialization 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 c for denaturation 30 s annealing at 52 c 30 s extension at 72 c then followed by 10 min at 72 c for final elongation pe250 sequencing was performed on the constructed amplicon library using illumina nova 6000 platform for the analysis of bacterial sequencing the sequences were divided into different operational taxonomic units otus according to their similarities the cluster analysis of otus was carried out using uparse method in order to investigate the species abundance and diversity of microbial communities in the samples chao1 index and simpson index were calculated for each sample based on the otu abundance table nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds based on otu level and bray curtis distance algorithm were applied to evaluate the differences in microbial community composition among different samples the pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between functional microbes and pollutant removal efficiencies as well as the relationship between dominant microbes and environmental factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality profiles in the growing period the do profile during the growing period is shown in fig 2 a during the early growing period the do concentration increased in the area with submerged macrophytes during the latter growing period the do concentration of cd was relatively stable while the do concentrations of vn and pm were significantly reduced the overall do range was at a high concentration level of 7 86 13 87 mg l which ensured sufficient oxygen for bacterial nitrification thereby contributing to the effective removal of nh4 n 37 the cod profile during the growing period is shown in fig 2 b c the final cod concentrations of the 3 submerged macrophytes were 19 mg l in the early growing period during the latter growing period the cod concentration of vn pm and cd decreased significantly with removal efficiencies of 56 1 58 5 and 77 8 respectively previous studies have shown that aquatic macrophytes can effectively remove organic pollutants from water by stimulating the activity of microorganisms transforming pollutants into simpler compound tissues combined with plants metabolizing pollutants and so on 38 the tp profile during the growing period is presented in fig 1 d e the tp concentration of vn pm and cd decreased significantly with average removal efficiencies of 68 4 57 1 and 56 6 respectively the average tp removal efficiency of vn was significantly higher than that of pm and cd aquatic plants attract microbial communities to the rhizosphere by releasing various organic compounds 38 and microorganisms act as mineralizers of organophosphorus through biommineralization and biochemical mineralization 39 the rhizosphere absorption of submerged macrophytes can promote p cycling and facilitate the removal of tp from the water 40 the nh4 n profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the growing period is depicted in fig 2 f g the results show that the nh4 n concentrations of vn pm and cd were finally 0 28 mg l and the average removal efficiencies were 74 3 50 6 and 36 1 respectively it is worth noting that the nh4 n concentration of pm decreased slightly in the latter growing period which may be due to the low initial concentration during the growing period of monotype submerged macrophytes the tn profile is shown in fig 2 h i the tn removal efficiencies of 3 submerged macrophytes were stable and the average tn removal efficiencies of vn pm and cd were 71 1 58 7 and 45 9 respectively aquatic plants remove n from water by two main mechanisms first plants absorb n directly second plants transport oxygen to the roots through photosynthesis creating a favorable environment for nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria including aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions 41 42 malondialdehyde mda is a cytotoxic product of lipid peroxidation while catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod are important antioxidant enzymes in plant antioxidant stress 43 the increase of concentrations of pollutants cod tn nh4 n and tp causes stress to submerged macrophytes leading to lipid peroxidation indicated by mda which in turn stimulates antioxidant enzymes cat pod and sod to perform physiological regulation thereby affecting the removal capacity of submerged macrophytes for pollutants 44 the initial concentration of pollutants varied greatly among the 3 experiments resulting in different levels of physiological regulation of submerged macrophytes which could account for the significant difference in the removal efficiency of pollutants among the 3 experiments in summary the ranking of the average removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n tn by the 3 submerged macrophytes is shown in table s2 the comprehensive ranking of the average removal efficiency of vn was the highest the removal effects of cod tp and nh4 n among the 3 submerged macrophytes were not significantly different p 0 05 however the tn removal effect of vn was significantly higher than that of cd p 0 05 while the difference between pm and the other 2 submerged macrophytes was not significant p 0 05 the absorption and utilization of nutrients by submerged macrophytes mainly occur through their leaves 45 the abundant roots of submerged macrophytes can promote the removal of n and p by rhizosphere microorganisms 46 the larger the root surface area of aquatic plants the larger the storage of n and p which is conducive to the removal of n and p in water 47 thus vallisneria natans obtained better comprehensive water purification capacity during the growing period experiment which could be attributed to its abundant roots and largest leaf area 3 2 water quality profiles in the mature period 3 2 1 water quality profiles of monotype submerged macrophytes the do profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period is shown in fig 3 a with do concentrations ranging between 2 80 and 5 46 mg l throughout the experimental period the cod profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period is illustrated in fig 3 b at the beginning of the experiment the cod concentration of each submerged macrophyte treatment showed a downward trend and slightly increased at 5d by the end of the experiment the cod concentrations of vn pm and cd were 19 70 mg l 13 83 mg l and 13 90 mg l respectively this increase can be attributed to the degradation of cod by bacteria present in the aquatic plant rhizosphere as reported previously 48 the tp profile of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period is shown in fig 3 c at the beginning of the experiment tp concentration of each submerged macrophyte showed a downward trend and stabilized after 2 3 days by the end of the experiment the tp concentrations of all submerged macrophytes were 0 08 mg l with removal efficiencies of 86 2 80 0 and 79 5 respectively the nh4 n and tn profiles of monotype submerged macrophytes during the mature period are shown in fig 2 d and e respectively submerged macrophytes can affect the n cycle to reduce the n content in water as studied previously 49 the concentrations of nh4 n and tn of vn continued to decrease while the concentrations of nh4 n and tn of pm and cd showed a decreasing trend and stabilized after 4 days the final nh4 n and tn concentrations of the 3 submerged macrophytes were below 0 42 mg l and 1 06 mg l respectively it is worth noting that submerged macrophytes have the potential to permanently remove n and p from polluted water systems through harvesting 50 the ranking of the average removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n tn by the 3 submerged macrophytes is shown in table s3 compared with the growing period the differences between the 3 submerged macrophytes in removing cod tp and nh4 n in the mature period were still not significant p 0 05 similarly the difference in tn removal efficiency between vn and the other two submerged macrophytes was not significant p 0 05 despite this the overall average removal efficiency of vn was marginally higher indicating that vallisneria natans remained the most effective submerged macrophyte for water purification during the mature period similar to the growing period 3 2 2 water quality profiles of mixed submerged macrophytes the do profile of mixed submerged macrophytes during the mature period is shown in fig 4 a the do of the vncd demonstrated a decreasing trend while the do of the vnpm and pmcd fluctuated continuously after 2 days there was no significant difference in do concentration among the three groups the cod and tp profiles of mixed submerged macrophytes during the mature period are shown in fig 4 b and c respectively the cod and tp concentrations in each group exhibited a sharp decrease within 2 to 3 days plants can use plant enzymes such as oxygenase and dehalogenase to degrade organic pollutants in water and thus reduce cod concentration 51 since plants lack active transporters these organic pollutants are taken in through passive absorption 52 the average cod removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 77 6 71 4 and 68 5 respectively similarly the average tp removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 89 0 82 9 and 87 4 respectively furthermore the nh4 n and tn profiles of mixed submerged macrophytes during the mature period are shown in fig 4 d e the concentrations of nh4 n and tn in each group decreased sharply on the 2nd day the average nh4 n removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 92 2 80 2 and 82 6 respectively while the average tn removal efficiencies of vnpm vncd and pmcd were 90 9 79 7 and 77 5 respectively the high nh4 n removal efficiencies observed in the study can be mainly attributed to the combined effects of direct uptake by submerged macrophytes and a nitrogen transformation by microbial communities 31 submerged macrophytes can directly uptake nh4 n from the water as a primary n source for their growth and metabolism besides the root systems of submerged macrophytes create a favorable environment for the growth of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria nitrifying bacteria convert nh4 n to nitrite no2 and subsequently to nitrate no3 through the process of nitrification denitrifying bacteria then convert nitrate into gaseous nitrogen n2 which is released into the atmosphere this microbial n transformation process helps reduce nh4 n levels in the water the ranking of the average removal efficiency of cod tp nh4 n tn by 3 submerged macrophytes groups is shown in table s4 the comprehensive removal efficiency of vnpm ranked the highest the cod removal effect of vnpm was significantly higher than that of pmcd p 0 05 whereas there was no significant difference between vncd and the other two groups p 0 05 the removal effect of nh4 n and tn of vnpm was significantly better than that of the other 2 groups p 0 05 however there was no significant difference in tp removal efficiency among the 3 mixed submerged macrophyte groups p 0 05 in light of these findings the submerged macrophytes group with better water purification capacity was the combination of vallisneria natans and potamogeton malainus comparing water quality changes between the optimal results of monotype submerged macrophytes experiment and mixed submerged macrophyte experiment during the mature period compared with vn the cod tp nh4 n and tn concentrations in vnpm decreased at a faster rate with a steeper decline the final and average removal efficiencies of cod tp nh4 n and tn were consistently higher in vnpm than in vn indicating that the combination of vallisneria natans and potamogeton malaianus represents the macrophyte planting structure with the most effective water purification capacity research studies have established that multi species submerged macrophytes are more effective in water purification than monotype plants due to their ability to adapt to changes in nutrient and climatic conditions which in turn helps maintain a stable water ecosystem 53 55 different submerged macrophytes have unique functions and different combinations of these macrophytes can play varying roles in aquatic environments 56 vallisneria natans was identified as the optimal species in the monotype submerged macrophytes experiment and the addition of other submerged macrophytes on the basis of vn may contributed to the establishment of a stable large submerged plant community and further improved water purification additionally substances released from within submerged macrophytes can regulate or select bacteria in the surrounding water and physical barriers and host selectivity can contribute to the differentiation of planktonic bacterial communities between different submerged macrophytes 24 microorganisms play an important role in mineralization of organic matter nitrification and denitrification of n and transformation of p 39 different combinations of submerged macrophytes may complement their specific functional microbial communities so it is necessary to study the characteristics of microbial communities under different planting structures of submerged macrophytes 3 3 microbial community characteristics 3 3 1 distribution and alpha diversity previous research has highlighted the importance of environmental and nutritional conditions in influencing the diversity and composition of microbial communities in water environments 34 57 factors such as dissolved organic matter inorganic carbon n p temperature and aquatic plant evolution have been found to be particularly relevant 29 58 59 as shown in table 1 for monotype submerged macrophytes the average chao1 index was 910 8 the chao1 indexes of wpm and wcd were relatively higher than that of wvn while the chao1 indexes of wpm and wcd were similar the simpson index values of 3 submerged macrophytes were close indicating that the microbial diversities in the water around 3 submerged macrophytes were similar for mixed submerged macrophytes the chao1 and simpson indices of vnpm and vncd were close to those of monotype submerged macrophytes while the chao1 index of vnpm and vncd was 70 39 and 73 72 higher than that of pmcd and the simpson index of vnpm and vncd was 68 10 and 68 59 lower than that of pmcd suggesting that the combination of potamogeton malainus and ceratophyllum demersum significantly reduced the abundance of microbial species and diversity of microbial communities 3 3 2 community composition of bacteria as shown in fig 5 a b the dominant phyla of 6 samples were proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria these dominant phytoplankton phyla of submerged macrophytes were mostly consistent with those found in other studies table 2 proteobacteria are the main phyla found in aquatic ecosystems 60 61 and they are dominant under multiple environmental conditions 62 in addition to pmcd verrucomicrobia was also one of the dominant phyla in the other samples in the monotype submerged macrophyte experiment the relative abundance of dominant bacteria was similar among the different submerged macrophytes however in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment the relative abundance of dominant bacteria varied significantly among the different submerged macrophyte groups as shown in fig 5 c d for monotype submerged macrophyte the dominant genera of 3 submerged macrophytes were hgci clade cyanobium pcc 6307 cl500 29 marine group polynucleobacter sediminibacterium dinghuibacter hydrogenophaga fukun57 and fluviicola and the relative abundance of dominant genera among the 3 submerged macrophytes was similar in the mixed submerged macrophytes experiment the common dominant bacteria genera of 3 submerged macrophyte groups were hgci clade cyanobium pcc 6307 pseudomonas cl500 29 marine group and cupriavidus the hgci clade belongs to actinobacteria and is a typical freshwater bacterial genus 63 while cyanobium pcc 6307 and cl500 29 marine group are also abundant in freshwater 64 66 the dominant genera differed obviously from previous studies with only pseudomonas being a common dominant genus table 2 the differences in plant type and environmental conditions may be the main causes of variation the relative abundance of pseudomonas and cupriavidus was higher in vncd and pmcd while the relative abundance of hgci clade and dinghuibacter was higher in vnpm the abundance of pseudomonas increased markedly after mixed planting of submerged macrophytes indicating that mixed planting of submerged macrophytes may affect the environment and increase the abundance of pseudomonas in the water previous studies have shown that plants actively select specific microbiomes and that certain bacteria opportunistically colonize available ecological niches leading to changes in plant associated bacterial communities 67 68 furthermore the specificity of litters and secretions of different plants contributes to the composition and differentiation of the microbial community 69 70 while plant litter has contrasting and specific effects on microbial community 71 besides the concentrations of ammonium ion nh4 and no3 are important factors affecting the abundance of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria with competition existing between these two microbial groups 75 the composition of bacterial communities may be related to changes in nh4 and tn concentrations 72 74 the impacts of environmental factors on dominant microbes were subjected to pearson correlation analysis and the results are displayed in fig 6 the abundance of each dominant microbes exhibits strong correlations with 0 to 2 environmental factors indicating substantial variations in the limiting environmental factors for these microbes and changes in nutrient concentrations may lead to alterations in microbial community composition pseudomonas demonstrates a negative correlation with tp but a positive correlation with tn pseudomonas has been identified as the major genus of phosphorus solubilizing bacteria and plays an important role in the mineralization of p 72 75 many strains of pseudomonas have also been shown to possess aerobic denitrification capability 73 the cl500 29 marine group is negatively correlated with nh4 n concentrations proteobacteria bacteroidetes hgci clade and dinghuibacter exhibit negative correlations with tn while actinobacteria show positive correlations with tn previous studies have shown that the abundance of actinobacteria is significantly positively correlated with the n content in the environment 76 possibly because actinobacteria contain spore forming and gram positive taxa some of which can survive under high nitrogen conditions 77 some gene patterns of hgci clade match important global n cycling pathways 78 such as denitrification and n fixation while dinghuibacter is involved in the coordinated metabolism of n 79 this finding suggests that tn concentration indeed has a greater influence on the structure of microbial communities in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment the initial concentration of nh4 n and tn in the vnpm group was nearly twice that of the other groups which may be one of the reasons for the differences in their microbial communities the relationship between do and mostly dominant microbes is relatively weak with a few displaying a distinct positive correlation fig 6 although the relationship between do and dominant microorganisms is relatively weak in this study it is worth noting that do levels can still impact the growth and activity of microbes in aquatic environments 33 80 do affects the removal efficiency of organic matter and is also an important factor in nitrification and denitrification processes 81 cod displays a moderate positive or negative correlation with each dominant microbes this indicates that the correlation between cod and microbial community was not significant which is the same as the results of previous study 74 nevertheless changes in the quality of organic carbon in water may affect microbial abundance 82 nmds was employed to discern dissimilarities in the community composition of samples as shown in fig s1 a b the results revealed conspicuous variances in bacterial composition among the 3 submerged macrophytes in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment the dissimilarities in bacterial composition among the three groups of submerged macrophytes were more apparent than those in the monotype submerged macrophyte experiments this phenomenon may be attributed to the fact that submerged plants discharge specific chemicals that induce host specific microbial communities as noted in previous studies 83 3 3 3 predicted function of microbial community the water purification function of the dominant bacteria at the phylum level was investigated pearson correlation coefficient of microbial and pollutant removal efficiency was calculated and the results were shown in table 3 proteobacteri contains a variety of bacteria which are capable of removing organic matter n and p 84 pearson correlation analyses revealed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 between proteobacteria and the final removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn with correlation coefficients of 0 83 and 0 88 respectively actinobacteria includes bacteria associated with anaerobic ammoxidation 86 bacteroidetes is linked to the degradation of organic matter p removal 87 88 and n removal 89 cyanobacteria which possess n fixation properties and can perform photosynthesis have been found to enhance the degradation of pollutants in water 90 firmicutes and chloroflexi are dominant bacteria in the process of anaerobic denitrification 91 acidobacteria is the dominant phylum responsible for biological p removal and has been reported to have functions in n fixation and biological denitrification 92 93 nitrospirae encompasses both nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria 94 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes had a strong positive correlation with the final removal efficiencies of tn r 0 91 and nh4 n r 0 75 while planctomycetes and nitrospirae had a moderate positive correlation with the final removal efficiency of nh4 n r 0 48 r 0 42 the majority of the dominant bacterial phyla associated with submerged macrophytes exhibited the ability to degrade water pollutants and played significant roles in n and p removal in this study the study also explored the potential water purification function of dominant bacterial genera terrimonas had a strong positive correlation with the final removal efficiency of nh4 n r 0 86 and tn r 0 95 in this study previous studies have shown that novosphingobium and terrimonas are aerobic denitrification bacteria contributing to denitrification 95 96 hydrogenophaga a genus of denitrifying bacteria has been shown to remove n and p 97 it exhibited moderate positive correlations with the final removal efficiency of nh4 n r 0 62 and tn r 0 44 pseudomonas a genus positively correlated with tp removal efficiency has been identified as a main contributor to tp removal 84 98 additionally pseudomonas plays a critical role in reducing the bloom of cyanobacteria in eutrophic water 99 sphingomonas is capable of degrading organic compounds containing p 100 both pseudomonas and sphingomonas demonstrated a strong positive correlation with the final removal rate of tp r 0 93 r 0 92 suggesting that these bacteria may play a vital role in tp removal the relative abundance of functional bacteria related to water purification was summarized table 4 in the monotype submerged macrophytes experiment the relative abundance of n and p removal functional bacteria of vallisneria natans was 2 70 which was higher than the relative abundance of the other 2 submerged macrophytes the removal of n and p by submerged macrophytes primarily depends on direct plant absorption physical action and the coordination of microorganisms 101 better performance of vallisneria natans in water purification capacity in monotype submerged macrophytes experiment may be related to the higher abundance of microbes involving in the n and p removals in the mixed submerged macrophytes experiment the highest relative abundance of bacteria involved in n and p removals was observed in pmcd followed by vncd the functional bacteria with the highest relative abundance in pmcd 65 4 and vncd 23 7 was pseudomonas apart from pseudomonas the relative abundances of other functional bacteria in vnpm vncd and pmcd were 2 14 1 29 and 0 98 respectively as the water purification effect of vnpm was the best in the mixed submerged macrophyte experiment it is possible that the denitrification and p removal effect of pseudomonas may be limited while other microbes with n and p removal capacities may play a more significant role 4 conclusions and recommendations mixed planting can better restore black and smelly water ecology by leveraging submerged macrophytes varying growth characteristics to absorb pollutants and alter microbial population traits the sequencing results showed that bacteria proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes and cyanobacteria were the dominant species and the composition of microbial communities at the genus level was different among different planting patterns with a relative increase in the abundance of functional microbes observed under mixed planting overall the presence of submerged macrophytes and their planting patterns could influence the diversity and composition of microbial communities during the restoration of black and smelly water bodies based on the findings of this study it is recommended that native species be selected for restoration taking into account the local conditions such as pollutant concentration water depth and light conditions among others in order to form diverse and stable communities additionally vallisneria natans potamogeton malainus is recommended for the restoration of black smelly water bodies followed by vallisneria natans but the survival rate of potamogeton malainus is low in the case of high water temperatures 30 c making it necessary to pay attention to whether the water temperature is suitable declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12448,the objective of this work is to develop an advanced adsorption process to continuously recover and remove boron from brines firstly the adsorption and desorption performances of boron on the commercially available n methylglucamine resin d403 resin are evaluated then the cyclic adsorption and desorption process is investigated experimentally in the fixed bed adsorber for boron recovery from brine it is confirmed that the cyclic process involves five steps such as boron recovery from brine water washing 1 to remove the retained brine boron desorption to obtain boron rich solution water washing 2 to recover the retained hcl solution and resin regeneration for the reuse furthermore the seven column simulated moving bed smb process with four zones is designed and investigated experimentally experimental results demonstrate that boron can be recovered continuously from brine in adsorption zone and boron rich solution is obtained continuously in desorption zone when the inlet brine contains a low boron content for example 296 5 mg l most boron in brine can be recovered by the seven column smb unit with 96 8 boron adsorption efficiency and the discharged brine contains 8 77 mg l boron approximately meeting the environmental protection requirement for the limitation of boron emission therefore the simultaneous recovery and removal of boron from brine can be achieved by the proposed multicolumn smb process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords boron recovery from brine boron adsorption n methylglucamine resin fixed bed adsorption multicolumn smb process data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction boron is an important micronutrient for plants humans and animals in the appropriate amount but excess amount would cause adverse effect the world health organization who recommends the limited boron concentration in drinking water as 2 4 mg l and in irrigation water 5 mg l 1 in the other side boron and its compounds play an important role in modern industry widely used in electronics chemical pharmaceutical nuclear industry glass ceramics etc 2 4 recently it is found that boron is also the potential candidate for production of liquid fuels anti cancer or other drugs and advanced energy materials 2 therefore both removal and recovery of boron from the boron containing solutions are more significant it achieves two goals 2 as a preventive mode to meet the regulation of drinking water and to protect boron sensitive agricultural crops and as a productive mode to recover boron from salt lake brine seawater and geothermal water used as a raw material in industrial production with the overmining of ores and the regulation of environmental pollution salt lake brine seawater and geothermal water containing plenty of boron with huge reserves have become the valuable resources according to statistics boron resources in brines account for about 50 of the boron reserves in the world the extraction cost of boron from the concentrated brines is estimated 30 to 50 less than that from the mined ores therefore the development of the cleaner and more efficient boron recovery methods from brines is significant which satisfies the necessities of maintaining sustainable supply of boron and minimizing environmental risks 2 4 5 in the past two decades the removal and recovery of boron from boron containing solutions have been investigated widely 2 14 and a lot of conventional and advanced technologies have been developed including precipitation solvent extraction membrane processes ion exchange adsorption electrodialysis etc state of the art reviews for the removal and recovery of boron can be found in the literatures 2 14 solvent extraction is a promising method particularly applicable to boron recovery from high boron content solution 2 15 17 membrane processes for boron recovery have gained more attention owing to the advantages of no chemical addition little sludge production and ease operation 2 more recently the bipolar membrane electrodialysis process is developed for boron recovery from boron containing solution without addition of solvent and the similar electrochemical methods have been documented as the sustainable and clean process 2 3 6 8 up to now most of the current studies focus on boron removal and very few studies focus on boron recovery more emphasis on boron recovery also is needed to minimize waste and promote sustainability 2 brines with the abundant reserves are complex in compositions containing 59 elements such as li b k na mg ca cs br and rb etc moreover brines have a low content of boron high contents of alkaline metals and alkaline earth metals that results in high extraction cost and energy consumption for boron recovery from brine for the low grade boron recovery from brines the environmentally friendly adsorption method has potential predominance owing to the high selectivity of sorbents for boron component in brine through the efforts of many scientists a number of sorbents have been prepared and applied for the removal and recovery of boron 10 18 57 including the chelating resins activated carbon fly ash and industrial waste materials natural materials oxides and hydroxides etc among them the chelating resins are the important sorbents for the removal and recovery of boron from brines and aqueous solutions most synthesized chelating resins available on the market have a macroporous polystyrene matrix attached with the n methylglucamine functional group such as ira743 resin amberlite crb01 resin and crb02 resin diaion bsr 1 resin dowex d403 resin china these chelating resins have the adjacent hydroxyl groups with a high selectivity to borate ions in brines based on the complexation adsorption mechanism recently the development in new chelating resins and fibers with large capacity high selectivity and high sorption rate have received great interest for the removal and recovery boron from natural waters wastewater and brines 10 18 27 because of the limitation of boron resources the boron recovery from salt lake brine desalination seawater and geothermal water is becoming correspondingly important and the research and development in this area is urgently needed at present most researches focus on the development of the advanced sorbents 18 61 and there are few researches on the cycle adsorption desorption process for the boron continuous recovery from brine therefore the aim of this work is to develop the continuous boron recovery process from brine using the commercially available n methylglucamine resin d403 resin as boron sorbent experiments with the batch adsorber single packed column and seven column unit are performed for boron recovery from brine here the seven column unit is operated by the simulated moving bed smb mode which has not been reported before for the boron continuous recovery from brine the feasibility and effectiveness of the seven column smb process will be evaluated through experiments in the laboratory scale 2 materials and method 2 1 resins and brines reagents lithium chloride monohydrate licl h2o ar 99 0 calcium chloride anhydrous cacl2 ar 96 0 hydrochloric acid hcl gr 36 0 38 0 wt sodium hydroxide naoh ar 95 0 were purchased from shanghai titan co ltd china potassium chloride kcl ar 99 5 sodium chloride nacl cp 99 5 magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o ar 98 0 boric acid b oh 3 ar 99 0 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized water was used for the preparation of aqueous solutions all chemical reagents were used as received d403 resin was the commercially available chelating resin with special n methylglucamine functional group which was purchased from jiangsu suqing water treatment engineering group co ltd china the particle size of d403 resin was in the range of 0 3 mm 1 27 mm water content was 46 56 weight percentage and its density was 770 g l before experiments the resins needed the pretreatment through washing with 1 mol l hcl solution and 1 mol l naoh solution respectively to remove the impurities then the treated resins were washed with water until ph value in the washing solution near neutral ready for experiments two kinds of brines were used for experiments the low salinity brine was prepared in the laboratory with the typical composition of about 1000 mg l for each cation na k li ca2 mg2 and 200 mg l 1000 mg l for boron the high salinity brine was from qarhan salt lake china which was concentrated through sunlight evaporation with the typically chemical composition of 1218 1 mg l of na 39 9 mg l of k 29 1 mg l of li 67 1 mg l of ca2 12 564 4 mg l of mg2 200 mg l of b and ph 6 58 2 2 experiment of batch adsorber the boron adsorption amount on resins was measured by the static experiments typically the wet resins about 2 g 5 g were added into 100 ml solution with initial boron concentration in a range of 100 mg l 1000 mg l in a conical flask then the bottle was placed in an incubator with 150 rpm shaking rate at the given temperature for 4 h after adsorption resins were collected through filtration and the boron concentration in the supernatant liquid was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes for the experiments to evaluate the effect of ph value on the boron adsorption amount of resins the ph value in the aqueous solution was adjusted initially in the range of 3 0 12 0 by the appropriate addition of hcl or naoh solution to evaluate the boron selectivity of resins brine with the equivalent weight for boron and each cation about 1000 mg l for na k li mg2 ca2 and b respectively was used for the competitive adsorption experiment typically 5 g wet resins were added into 100 ml brine in a conical flask then the bottle was placed in an incubator with 150 rpm shaking rate at 298 k for 4 h after adsorption the resins were collected through filtration and the concentrations of cations and boron in the supernatant liquid were analyzed by icp aes the recyclability of resins was evaluated through the cyclic adsorption desorption experiment for ten times at the adsorption step 5 g wet resins were added into 100 ml brine with about 500 mg l boron in a conical flask then the bottle was placed in an incubator with 150 rpm shaking rate at 298 k for 4 h after adsorption the resins were collected by filtration and the boron concentration in the supernatant liquid was analyzed by icp aes at the desorption step the collected resins were regenerated by 0 5 m hcl 100 ml for 1 h then washed with deionized water until neutral ph value for the next cyclic experiment the boron adsorption rate on resins was measured in a batch adsorber with stirring and temperature was controlled by a constant temperature bath typically 5 g wet resins were immersed in 100 ml brine with different boron concentration in a batch adsorber at the given adsorption interval a little amount of supernatant liquid was taken out for the analysis of boron content by icp aes according to the measured data in the static experiments the boron adsorption amount q b per gram of resins boron adsorption efficiency from brines in batch adsorber r b were calculated by eqs 1 2 1 q b c b 0 c b t v m 2 r b c b 0 c b t c b 0 100 where c b 0 mg l was the boron initial concentration in brine c b t mg l was the boron concentration in brine at t time v l was brine volume and m g was resin amount 2 3 fixed bed experiment a fixed bed adsorber was used to recover boron from brine as shown in fig 1a the fixed bed adsorber was packed with 60 ml resins 300 mm packed height and 16 mm packed diameter 46 g weight of resins circulating water from the thermostat was used to control the constant temperature in the fixed bed adsorber the inlet flow rate of the feed solution to the packed column was controlled by a metering pump and the feed solutions included brine water hcl solution naoh solution nacl solution the composition of the effluent solution from the fixed bed in each step was analyzed by icp aes there were five steps in a cyclic process for the boron recovery from brine by the fixed bed adsorber including boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration as shown in fig 1b the function of each step was described as follows 1 at the boron adsorption step the brine passed through the resins packed column where boron was preferentially adsorbed by resins and the effluent solution was with a low content boron 2 at the water washing 1 step some water was input to remove the retained brine 3 at the boron desorption step the adsorbed boron on resins was desorbed through inputting hcl solution and the boron rich solution was obtained from the outlet of the fixed bed 4 at the water washing 2 step the retained hcl solution in the packed column was recovered through water washing 5 at the resin regeneration step naoh solution and nacl solution were input to the fixed bed respectively to regenerate the amine functional groups of resins for the cyclic use during each step the effluent solution from the packed column was collected to analyze the composition of sample by icp aes the deionized water was used at two water washing steps the concentration of hcl solution was in the range of 0 1 mol l 0 5 mol l and 0 5 mol l naoh solution and 1 mol l nacl solution were used for the resin regeneration the operation temperature was 298 k the boron adsorption amount on the packed resins q b mg g was calculated by eq 3 the boron adsorption efficiency from brine r b was calculated by eq 4 and the boron desorption efficiency d b was calculated by eq 5 3 q b v 0 v a c b 0 c b v dv m 4 r b v 0 v a c b 0 c b v dv c b 0 v a 100 5 d b v 0 v b c b v dv mq b 100 where c b 0 mg l was the boron concentration in brine c b v mg l was the outflow boron concentration from the packed column with v l volume of effluent solution m g was the amount of the packed resins and v a and v b were the total volume from adsorption step and desorption step respectively 2 4 multicolumn simulated moving bed experiment as shown in fig 1b it needed five steps in one cyclic process for boron recovery from brine by one fixed bed adsorber where the packed column went on in turn boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration steps so it was difficult to continuously recover boron from brine using one column to achieve the boron continuous recovery from brine multicolumn operation unit was required here we designed the seven column four zone simulated moving bed smb process where the four zones correspond to the five steps in the fixed bed adsorber respectively as shown in fig 2a namely as boron adsorption zone i with two tandem columns water washing 1 zone ii with two tandem columns boron desorption zone iii with two tandem columns water washing 2 and resin regeneration zone iv together with one column both water washing 2 step and resin regeneration step were arranged into the zone iv together with one column due to the shorter operation time at each step according to the simulated moving bed smb operation mode seven packed columns in fig 2a did not move during the cyclic operation but the input and output stream ports were switched synchronously from one column to next column along the fluid flow direction resulting in the first column in each zone would be shifted into the next zone after each switch with the input and output stream ports frequently switching each column would go in the different operation zone for example column 1 going on boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration in turn then recycle operation as shown in fig 2a table 1 also listed the operating sequences for each packed column in the seven column smb unit at one smb cycle the packed column took on the different role in each operation zone in adsorption zone i brine passed through column 1and column 2 boron component was adsorbed by d403 resins and the effluent solution from column 2 was discharged after boron adsorption column 1 was shifted into water washing 1 zone ii at next switch at the same time in water washing 1 zone ii water passed through column 6 and column 7 to remove the retained brine and the effluent solution from column 7 was discharged after water washing column 6 was shifted into boron desorption zone iii at next switch in boron desorption zone iii 0 3 m hcl passed through column 4 and column 5 to desorb boron from d403 resins and the boron rich solution was obtained at the outlet of column 5 after desorption column 4 was shifted into water washing 2 and resin transformation zone iv at next switch in water washing 2 and resin regeneration zone iv three streams passed through column 3 in turn during one switch interval firstly water inlet to column 3 to recover the retained acid then 0 15 m naoh passing through column 3 to regenerate the amine functional groups of resins following the inlet of 0 5 m nacl to remove free oh ions in the packed column going into the boron adsorption zone i at next switch in the laboratory the seven column smb unit was set up as shown in fig 2b seven columns were packed with d403 resins at the same packed size for each column packed diameter 20 mm packed height 145 mm 45 ml resins four metering pumps were adopted for inlet of brine tbp2h02f type no hcl solution tbp5002f type no water tbp2h02 type no and naoh solution and nacl solution tbp5002 type no respectively which were made by tauto biotech company in china the fully automatic control valves airtac company 2klh030 06 open type and 2lh 06 close type were installed at the inlet and output ports of each column which were controlled by a home made computer control platform based on the experimental data obtained in single column we might select the initial experimental conditions of smb process with these initial experimental conditions we did some trial and error runs on d403 resins packed seven column smb unit to correct the operating conditions as listed in table 2 in this work we should test the feasibility of the proposed smb process for boron continuous recovery from brine with different boron content such as exp 1 with 516 1 mg l of boron exp 2 with 428 7 mg l of boron exp 3 with 296 5 mg l of boron because of the limitation of the experimental installation conditions we were not yet able to directly use the high salinity brine in the smb equipment all the smb experiments were carried out in laboratory for boron continuous recovery from the low salinity brine one switch time was set as 20 min for the inlet and output stream ports shifting and one smb cycle period for seven columns was 140 min it needed to take eight smb cycles reaching the stable state of the experimental system then we started to sample and analyze the contents of boron and cations the selection of experimental conditions was not stringent in this work in future work more systematic optimal design for the boron recovery smb process would be needed such as by adopting the model based design approach based on adsorption and mass transfer parameters of boron and other components moreover the tested brine mainly contained cl ions so the acidic desorption solution was selected as the diluted hcl solution avoiding the other acidic anions into salt lake brines to produce pollution 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption and desorption performance of boron on n methylglucamine resin boron presents two states in aqueous solution boric acid b oh 3 and borate ion b oh 4 where b oh 3 can accept oh ion to form b oh 4 following a reversible reaction 6 b oh 3 h 2 o b oh 4 h the contents of two boron components in aqueous solution are dependent on ph value of solution as shown in fig 3 which are calculated based on the equilibrium constant of eq 6 58 59 with a lower ph value acidic solution boric acid dominates while at alkaline condition borate ion dominates in aqueous solution when d403 resin is used to recover boron from aqueous solution the adjacent double hydroxyl groups of resin form preferentially the complexation reaction with borate ions as shown in fig 4a with the adsorption of borate ions boric acids will go on hydrolysis to produce borate ions for adsorption based on the reversible reaction of eq 6 and the released h ions in eq 6 will be neutralized by the amine functional group of resin because there is not the complexation reaction between boron acid and the n methylglucamine resin the complexed borate compound on resin can be desorbed in the form of boron acid through the immersion of hcl solution fig 4b shows the infrared spectrums of d403 resin before adsorption after adsorption and after desorption of boron there are some characteristic peaks at 856 2 cm 1 1045 2 cm 1 1085 7 cm 1 1463 7 cm 1 1633 4 cm 1 2935 2 cm 1 3401 8 cm 1 wavenumbers for the original d403 resin before boron adsorption however the obvious difference for the vibration peak at 1045 2 cm 1 can be found before and after adsorption desorption of boron on d403 resin during boron adsorption the vibration peak at 1045 2 cm 1 disappears and one new vibration peak at 964 2 cm 1 is formed which means the formation of one new complex when borate ion is adsorbed on the surface of d403 resin after boron desorption by hcl solution the vibration peak at 964 2 cm 1 disappears and the vibration peak at 1045 2 cm 1 appears again the boron adsorption and desorption behaviors of d403 resin are evaluated through the static experiments and the experimental results are shown in fig 5a e the experimental data in fig 5a illustrate that d403 resin has a high boron adsorption amount in the ph value range of 4 10 reaching 9 mg g and the adsorbed boron can be desorbed at the strong acidic solution ph value 1 the adsorption mechanism is that the adjacent double hydroxyl group of d403 resin form preferentially the complexation reaction with borate ion the complexation adsorption involves the dissociation of oh ion from the functional group of resin and the strong alkaline solution ph 10 is unfavorable to the dissociation of oh ion resulting in the decrease of the boron adsorption amount as shown in fig 5a the boron adsorption process belongs to the chemisorption so the boron equilibrium adsorption amount increases with increasing temperature as shown in fig 5b the boron equilibrium adsorption isotherm can be represented using langmuir isotherm equation with an acceptable accuracy as shown in fig 5b with solid lines the model parameters ka and qm in the langmuir equation q e q m k a c e 1 k a c e are estimated as 0 048 l mg and 8 88 mg g at 298 k 0 041 l mg and 9 31 mg g at 318 k 0 041 l mg and 9 62 mg g at 338 k respectively the complexation adsorption of borate ion has a high selectivity as shown in fig 5c and the adsorption amounts of other metal ions on d403 resin are small the adsorption sites on the surface of d403 resins for metal cations and borate ion are different so the effect of metal cations on the adsorption amount of boron on d403 resin is weak moreover d403 resin has the good boron adsorption kinetics and the fast adsorption rate about 60 min reaching one saturation adsorption amount as shown in fig 5d in addition the cyclic adsorption brine with 500 mg l of boron 4 h and desorption 1 mol l hcl 1 h static experiment is carried out to evaluate the stability of d403 resin and the experimental results in fig 5e illustrate the d403 resin having the good stability for the repeated use 3 2 cyclic adsorption and desorption process for boron recovery from brine in the fixed bed adsorber through the assessment of adsorption and desorption performances of boron on d403 resin in the batch adsorber it is found that the commercially available boron chelating resin d403 resin has the excellent performance for the boron removal and recovery from the aqueous solution then we investigate further the boron recovery from brine in the fixed bed adsorber packed with d403 resins the cyclic adsorption and desorption process for boron recovery from brine in a fixed bed is designed with five operation steps including â  boron adsorption â¡ water washing 1 â¢ boron desorption â£ water washing 2 â¤ resin regeneration as shown in fig 1b the operation conditions in each step are investigated experimentally then the experimental demonstration is performed to evaluate the stability and efficiency of the cyclic process 1 breakthrough curve of boron from the fixed bed adsorber brines with different boron content 205 1 mg l 490 8 mg l 978 5 mg l and at different flowrate 3 ml min 6 ml min 10 ml min pass through the fixed bed and the boron breakthrough curves are measured at the outlet of the packed column as shown in fig 6a b the effect of boron content in brine on the breakthrough curve is shown in fig 6a at 10 ml min flowrate the experimental results illustrate the effect of boron content is more obvious the higher the boron content the earlier the boron breakthrough from the fixed bed based on the breakthrough curves the boron adsorption amounts on the packed resins are calculated as 7 76 mg g with 54 0 boron adsorption efficiency from brine containing 205 1 mg l boron 8 23 mg g with 42 5 boron adsorption efficiency from brine containing 490 8 mg l boron 9 77 mg g with 38 0 boron adsorption efficiency from brine containing 978 5 mg l boron respectively the effect of brine flowrate on the breakthrough curve is shown in fig 6b where brine with 490 8 mg l of boron passes through the fixed bed at three different inlet flowrates 3 ml min 6 ml min 10 ml min respectively the experimental results show the effect of brine flowrate mainly on the shape of breakthrough curve and the effect on the treated brine amount is not obvious due to the fast adsorption rate of boron on d403 resin when the brine flowrate is very fast for example 10 ml min there occurs the effect of the mass transfer resistance resulting in an earlier breakthrough according to the breakthrough curves it is estimated that boron adsorption amount on the packed resins is 7 65 mg g with 61 1 boron adsorption efficiency for 3 ml min 7 64 mg g with 55 2 boron adsorption efficiency with for 6 ml min 8 23 mg g with 42 6 boron adsorption efficiency for 10 ml min respectively because single fixed bed is packed with 60 ml d403 resins 46 g weight the total amount of boron removed by a single column is calculated as 351 44 g 378 58 g from brine with 490 8 mg l of boron at 3 ml min 10 ml min flowrate 2 water washing 1 to remove the retained brine in the packed column after boron recovery from brine the fixed bed will go on water washing step to remove the retained brine in the column in order to reduce the contents of impurities in the boron rich solution obtained at the desorption step the water washing mode is to inlet water from the bottom of the packed column after the boron adsorption from brine inputting 10 ml min brine with 490 8 mg l of boron for 150 min 10 ml min water is input the fixed bed and the effluent curves are shown in fig 7 it is found that the retained cations such as k na ca2 mg2 in the packed column can be washed out and water consumption amount is about 180 ml 3 bed volumes 3 boron desorption behavior in fixed bed by hcl solution after water washing to remove the retained brine in the column hcl solution is input into the fixed bed to desorb the adsorbed boron on resins and the boron rich solution is obtained from the outlet of the column both hcl concentration and flowrate are the key operation conditions fig 8a shows the effect of the hcl concentration on the desorption efficiency of boron where the hcl solution with 0 1 mol l 0 3 mol l 0 5 mol l and 1 mol l hcl respectively is inlet to the fixed bed at 5 ml min flowrate the boron adsorption and water washing 1 are carried out using the same operation conditions before boron desorption 10 ml min brine with 490 8 mg l of boron for 150 min 10 ml min water for 20 min the boron desorption efficiency reaches 96 9 99 7 98 7 and 98 2 respectively the adsorbed boron is desorbed easily the boron desorption efficiency also reaches 96 9 even if we input 0 1 mol l hcl solution then the effect of the inlet flowrate of 0 5 mol l hcl solution is tested as shown in fig 8b where 3 ml min 5 ml min and 7 ml min are adopted respectively the desorption efficiency reaches 97 0 3 ml min 100 5 ml min 99 6 7 ml min and the boron content in the relative effluent solution reaches 902 6 mg l 856 3 mg l and 703 2 mg l respectively and the obtained boron rich solutions contain a little amount of other cations 4 water washing 2 and resin regeneration after the boron desorption from the packed column water is inlet to recover the retained acid solution in the fixed bed because the amine functional group of resin is with h type after boron desorption by the hcl solution it needs to be regenerated as oh type through the immersion of naoh solution ready for the repeated use the resin regeneration method is after the second water washing at 10 ml min for 15 min to recover the retained hcl solution 0 5 m naoh at 5 ml min flowrate is inlet to the packed column for 10 min to regenerate the amine functional group of d403 resin then passing through 1 m nacl solution at 5 ml min about 30 min to remove the free oh ions until ph as 7 9 in the effluent solution after regeneration of d403 resins the fixed bed is reused to recover boron from brine with the same operation conditions as the first cycle and the boron breakthrough curves at the first cycle and at the second cycle are compared in fig 9 it is found that two breakthrough curves almost are in agreement with each other 5 experimental demonstration for boron recovery from brine by the cyclic adsorption and desorption process in the fixed bed the cyclic experiment is done with the following conditions for boron recovery from brine by one fixed bed with d403 resins â  at boron adsorption step inlet brine with at 10 ml min 120 min to recover boron from brine by the d403 resin packed column â¡ at water washing 1 step inlet water at 10 ml min 20 min to remove the retained brine â¢ at boron desorption step inlet 0 5 mol l hcl solution at 5 ml min 80 min to obtain the boron rich solution â£ at water washing 2 step inlet water at 10 ml min 15 min to recover the retained acid â¤ at resin regeneration step inlet 0 5 m naoh at 5 ml min 10 min following 1 m nacl solution at 5 ml min 30 min fig 10a shows the boron effluent curves from the fixed bed during the first cycle and the tenth cycle two effluent curves are in agreement with each other and other experiments are also consistent as shown in fig 10b the tested brine contains 498 6 mg l of boron and 1000 mg l for each cation li na k ca2 and mg2 through the adsorption and desorption steps in the fixed bed the obtained boron rich solution contains 690 3 mg l of boron and the other cation contents 20 0 mg l in the first cycle boron adsorption efficiency from brine reaches 58 5 boron desorption efficiency is 93 6 boron adsorption amount on the packed resins is 7 65 mg g after multicycles the same results can also be obtained as listed in table 3 in the tenth cycle the obtained boron rich solution contains 679 4 mg l of boron boron adsorption efficiency from brine reaches 57 1 boron desorption efficiency is 92 8 boron adsorption amount on the packed resins is 7 59 mg g 3 3 effect of brine salinity for boron recovery from brine by the fixed bed adsorber in the above mentioned experiments the tested brine is with a low salinity where each cation content is set as 1000 mg l li na k ca2 and mg2 in the brine the boron adsorption performance of d403 resin in a high salinity brine will be evaluated where brine is from qaerhan salt lake china with the typical chemical composition of 29 1 mg l of li 1218 1 mg l of na 39 9 mg l of k 67 1 mg l of ca2 12 564 4 mg l of mg2 200 mg l of boron ph 6 58 fig 11 shows the effect of brine salinity on boron adsorption kinetics of d403 resin where both the high salinity brine and the low salinity brine are tested in the batch experiments with the same initial boron concentration in brine and the same operation conditions 4 g 500 ml 200 mg l of boron in brine experimental results in fig 11 confirm that d403 resin has the good salt tolerance and the high salinity in brine does not result in the obvious decrease of the boron adsorption amount since the high cation contents in brine do not affect the complexation adsorption of borate ion however there occurs the mass transfer resistance for diffusion of borate ion into the surface of d403 resin for the complexation adsorption in the high salinity brine a relative slower adsorption rate at the intimal adsorption stage 60 min is found as shown in fig 11 furthermore we compare the boron breakthrough and elution curves in the fixed bed for boron recovery from the high salinity brine and the low salinity brine at the same operation conditions for example brine contained about 200 mg l of boron at 20 ml min for 100 min adsorption water washing at 20 ml min for 20 min and 0 5 mol l hcl desorption at 10 ml min for 60 min as shown in fig 12 fixed bed is packed with 120 ml d403 resins 30 mm diameter 170 mm packed height it is found that boron breakthroughs early when the high salinity brine passes through the fixed bed due to the mass transfer resistance but the adsorption amount and desorption amount per gram resins for the given operation periods are almost the same for two brines as listed in table 4 so the effect of the brine salinity is weak on the complexation adsorption of borate ion and d403 resin is applicable to boron recovery from brine at a large scale 3 4 boron continuous recovery from brine by seven column smb process the above mentioned experimental results in fixed bed adsorber demonstrate that the cyclic process for boron recovery from brine needs five steps when one packed column is adopted the boron recovery from brine is discontinuous owing to this column completing the five steps independently during one cyclic operation to realize the continuous extraction of boron from brine the seven column smb process is adopted to recover continuously boron from brine in adsorption zone i and to obtain continuously boron rich solution in desorption zone iii because it needs to take more than eight smb cycles reaching the stable state of the experimental system and the consumption amounts of brine water 0 3 m hcl solution are large for each experiment here three group of experiments are carried out to validate the feasibility of the seven column smb process for boron continuous recovery from brine with boron content as 516 1 mg l in exp 1 428 7 mg l in exp 2 296 5 mg l in exp 3 the initial operation conditions in adsorption water washing 1 and desorption zones are designed approximately according to the above mentioned experimental conditions in the fixed bed adsorber however it is used two tandem columns in adsorption zone water washing 1 zone and desorption zone respectively theses operation conditions are corrected by the trial and error runs on smb unit before the formal experiment as listed in table 2 fig 13 shows the effluent curves from the d403 resins packed columns in adsorption zone i and in desorption zone iii in one smb cycle operation period after the system reaching stabile state 8 cycles where brine contains a higher boron content in exp 1 typically as 516 06 mg l according to the experimental results in fig 13a the boron adsorption efficiency reaches 89 0 water washing removes most of the retained cations and the obtained boron rich solution in desorption zone contains a little amount of cations na k ca2 mg3 as shown in fig 13b and table 5 the effective separation of boron and cations in brine is achieved by the seven column smb process and the boron desorption efficiency reaches 98 7 for the mass balance of boron over four zones boron contents are measured in brine 516 06 mg l effluent solution from zone i 55 25 mg l from zone ii 107 20 mg l from zone iii 463 63 mg l and from zone iv 5 mg l the boron loss rate in water washing zone is estimated as 16 61 due to the retained brine in the column and the consumption amount of 0 3 m hcl solution per gram of boron product is 2 16 l g based on the measured data when the input brine contains a relatively low boron content such as 428 7 mg l in exp 2 the boron adsorption efficiency in adsorption zone i increases to 92 18 and the boron content in the effluent solution from adsorption zone i can be reduced as 33 51 mg l as shown in fig 14a but the boron content of the outflow brine exceeds the discharge standard not meeting the environmental protection requirement in desorption zone the boron rich solution with 417 11 mg l of boron and small amounts of cations is obtained and the boron desorption efficiency reaches 98 65 as shown in fig 14b and table 5 once again this group of experiment also demonstrates that the continuous extraction of boron from brine can be achieved by the seven column smb process for the mass balance of boron over the seven column unit the average boron contents in each zone are brine 428 7 mg l effluent solutions in zone i 33 51 mg l in zone ii 71 2 mg l in zone iii 417 11 mg l in zone iv 5 67 mg l the boron loss rate in water washing zone is estimated as 13 28 due to the retained brine in the column and the consumption amount of 0 3 m hcl solution per gram of boron product is 2 39 l g based on the measured data when the input brine contains 296 5 mg l of boron in exp 3 most boron can be recovered by the seven column four zone smb process the boron adsorption efficiency reaches 96 8 and the discharged brine contain a little amount of boron 8 77 mg l meeting the environmental protection requirement as shown in fig 15a at the same time the boron rich solution containing 326 6 mg l of boron with a little amount of cations is obtained and the boron desorption efficiency reaches 99 5 in the desorption zone as shown in fig 15b and table 5 therefore the continuous and simultaneous recovery and removal of boron from brine also can be achieved with the developed multicolumn smb process for the mass balance of boron over the seven column unit boron concentrations are measured in brine 296 5 mg l effluent solution in zone i 8 77 mg l in zone ii 29 13 mg l in zone iii 326 60 mg l in zone iv 3 59 mg l the boron loss rate in water washing zone is calculated as 7 86 and the consumption amount of 0 3 m hcl solution per gram of boron product is 3 0 l g based on the measured data in this work three group of experiments are carried out for boron continuous recovery from brine in the set up seven column smb unit with the same flowrates where boron content in brine is different including 516 1 mg l in exp 1 428 7 mg l in exp 2 296 5 mg l in exp 3 as listed in table 2 with the same flowrates in the smb process the boron loss in zone i can be reduced when boron content in brine decreases for example brine containing 516 06 mg l of boron used in exp 1 with 89 0 adsorption efficiency and 11 0 boron loss brine containing 428 7 mg l of boron used in exp 2 with 92 18 adsorption efficiency and 7 82 boron loss brine containing 296 5 mg l of boron used in exp 3 with 96 8 adsorption efficiency and 3 2 boron loss as listed in table 5 the boron loss in zone ii is caused by the retained brine in the packed column which is almost the same between the seven column smb process and single fixed bed process when the packed column has a high resins utilization rate furthermore table 6 shows the experimental comparison between one column cyclic process and seven column smb process for boron recovery from brine with about 500 mg l of boron although the resins packed amount in the smb process 315 ml is higher than that in one fixed bed adsorber 60 ml the inlet brine volume per unit time and unit resin in smb process 0 0794 l min l is higher than that in one fixed bed adsorber 0 0727 l min l boron productivity per unit time and unit resin in smb process 0 03023 g min l is higher than that in fixed bed adsorber 0 01659 g min l and the ratio of hcl consumption to boron productivity per cyclic period 7 94 mol g l min is lower than that in fixed bed adsorber 10 06 mol g l min the comparison between fixed bed process and smb process in table 6 is based on the high resin utilization rate in the packed column in adsorption zone of the smb process there are two tandem columns and the resins packed in the first column can adsorb boron from brine as more as possible reaching almost the saturated adsorption amount with boron content of brine before it is shifted into the water washing 1 zone and desorption zone so the resins packed in the column in smb process have a higher utilization rate when compared with one fixed bed adsorber usually sacrificing the resin utilization rate to improve the boron adsorption efficiency from brine moreover the second column in smb process can continue to adsorb boron when the effluent solution of the first column passes through the second column so the boron adsorption efficiency can be improved as 89 in another side the experimental data of fixed bed belong to sacrifice the boron adsorption efficiency 58 0 from brine to improve the resin utilization rate as shown in fig 10 where the packed column also reaches almost the saturated adsorption amount with boron content of brine in this work we do not optimize the operating conditions of the proposed smb process in fact the proposed multicolumn smb process has many advantages over single fixed bed adsorber on the management of process water hcl and other chemicals naoh nacl which are outlined below requiring further investigation by experiment and simulation 1 fixed bed adsorber with one column in turn goes on adsorption water washing 1 desorption waster washing 2 and resin regeneration steps so it is not a continuous boron recovery process owing to the boron recovery from brine only at the adsorption step the seven column smb process can achieve the continuous recovery of boron from brine in adsorption zone where the packed columns in four zones are run together with a fully automatic control panel at the simulated moving bed operation mode 2 the resins packed in the first column in adsorption zone of the smb process can adsorb boron from brine as more as possible reaching almost the saturated adsorption amount with boron content of brine before it is shifted into the water washing 1 zone and desorption zone so the resins packed in the column have a higher utilization rate when compared with one fixed bed adsorber usually sacrificing the utilization rate of resins to improve the boron adsorption efficiency from brine 3 the first column in water washing 1 zone of the smb process is washed using fresh water to remove the retained brine and the outflow solution from the first column is input to the second column continuously washing the retained brine so water consumption amount can be saved almost by half when compared with one fixed bed adsorber if multicolumn is washed with water in a series connection the consumption amount of water will be further reduced 4 the fresh hcl solution is input into the first column in boron desorption zone of the smb process to desorb the adsorbed boron from resins as more as possible and the outflow hcl solution from the first column is input to the second column to continuously desorb boron so the consumption amount of hcl solution can be reduced almost by half when compared with one fixed bed adsorber if multicolumn is desorbed in a series connection by hcl solution the consumption amount of hcl solution will be further reduced 5 similar to the fixed bed adsorber one column is adopted in waster washing 2 and resin regeneration zone of the smb process going on water washing 2 step to recover the retained hcl solution and to regenerate the amine functional groups of the resins by inputting naoh solution and nacl solution the consumption amounts of naoh and nacl solutions are small based on the stoichiometry relationship of h and oh for the regeneration of the amine functional groups of the resins in summary compared with the fixed bed adsorber the utilization rate of resins in smb process is higher the consumption amounts of water and hcl solution can be saved significantly when using the tandem columns in water washing 1 zone and in desorption zone therefore the smb process has evident advantages in boron recovery and removal from brine with a broad industrial application prospect 4 conclusions the adjacent double hydroxyl group of the n methylglucamine resin d403 resin forms preferentially the complexation adsorption with borate ion to realize the effective separation of boron and cations in brine d403 resin has the fast adsorption rate of boron high boron adsorption amount excellent boron selectivity good stability for the cyclic adsorption and desorption and better salt tolerance which make the n methylglucamine resin more promising for industrial application experiments in fixed bed adsorber with d403 resins demonstrate that the cyclic process for boron recovery from brine involves five steps such as boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration the boron can be recovered efficiently from brine and the boron rich solution with a little amount of other cations is obtained by this cyclic process however the boron recovery from brine by the fixed bed adsorber is discontinuous owing to this column completing the five steps independently during one cyclic operation period four zones are disconnected in the developed multicolumn smb process and it is actually an improvement to a single fixed bed adsorber with five steps when the packed columns in four zones are run together with a fully automatic control panel by smb mode the developed seven column smb process can achieve the continuous recovery of boron from brine 280 67 mg l 516 06 mg l of boron with a high boron adsorption efficiency 89 98 65 and a high boron desorption efficiency 98 65 99 50 moreover the tandem columns in adsorption zone water washing zone and desorption zone are adopted to save the consumption amounts of water and hcl solution and the utilization rate of resins in column can be improved therefore the smb process has evident advantages in boron recovery and removal from brine with a broad industrial application prospect declaration of competing interest the authors

12448,the objective of this work is to develop an advanced adsorption process to continuously recover and remove boron from brines firstly the adsorption and desorption performances of boron on the commercially available n methylglucamine resin d403 resin are evaluated then the cyclic adsorption and desorption process is investigated experimentally in the fixed bed adsorber for boron recovery from brine it is confirmed that the cyclic process involves five steps such as boron recovery from brine water washing 1 to remove the retained brine boron desorption to obtain boron rich solution water washing 2 to recover the retained hcl solution and resin regeneration for the reuse furthermore the seven column simulated moving bed smb process with four zones is designed and investigated experimentally experimental results demonstrate that boron can be recovered continuously from brine in adsorption zone and boron rich solution is obtained continuously in desorption zone when the inlet brine contains a low boron content for example 296 5 mg l most boron in brine can be recovered by the seven column smb unit with 96 8 boron adsorption efficiency and the discharged brine contains 8 77 mg l boron approximately meeting the environmental protection requirement for the limitation of boron emission therefore the simultaneous recovery and removal of boron from brine can be achieved by the proposed multicolumn smb process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords boron recovery from brine boron adsorption n methylglucamine resin fixed bed adsorption multicolumn smb process data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction boron is an important micronutrient for plants humans and animals in the appropriate amount but excess amount would cause adverse effect the world health organization who recommends the limited boron concentration in drinking water as 2 4 mg l and in irrigation water 5 mg l 1 in the other side boron and its compounds play an important role in modern industry widely used in electronics chemical pharmaceutical nuclear industry glass ceramics etc 2 4 recently it is found that boron is also the potential candidate for production of liquid fuels anti cancer or other drugs and advanced energy materials 2 therefore both removal and recovery of boron from the boron containing solutions are more significant it achieves two goals 2 as a preventive mode to meet the regulation of drinking water and to protect boron sensitive agricultural crops and as a productive mode to recover boron from salt lake brine seawater and geothermal water used as a raw material in industrial production with the overmining of ores and the regulation of environmental pollution salt lake brine seawater and geothermal water containing plenty of boron with huge reserves have become the valuable resources according to statistics boron resources in brines account for about 50 of the boron reserves in the world the extraction cost of boron from the concentrated brines is estimated 30 to 50 less than that from the mined ores therefore the development of the cleaner and more efficient boron recovery methods from brines is significant which satisfies the necessities of maintaining sustainable supply of boron and minimizing environmental risks 2 4 5 in the past two decades the removal and recovery of boron from boron containing solutions have been investigated widely 2 14 and a lot of conventional and advanced technologies have been developed including precipitation solvent extraction membrane processes ion exchange adsorption electrodialysis etc state of the art reviews for the removal and recovery of boron can be found in the literatures 2 14 solvent extraction is a promising method particularly applicable to boron recovery from high boron content solution 2 15 17 membrane processes for boron recovery have gained more attention owing to the advantages of no chemical addition little sludge production and ease operation 2 more recently the bipolar membrane electrodialysis process is developed for boron recovery from boron containing solution without addition of solvent and the similar electrochemical methods have been documented as the sustainable and clean process 2 3 6 8 up to now most of the current studies focus on boron removal and very few studies focus on boron recovery more emphasis on boron recovery also is needed to minimize waste and promote sustainability 2 brines with the abundant reserves are complex in compositions containing 59 elements such as li b k na mg ca cs br and rb etc moreover brines have a low content of boron high contents of alkaline metals and alkaline earth metals that results in high extraction cost and energy consumption for boron recovery from brine for the low grade boron recovery from brines the environmentally friendly adsorption method has potential predominance owing to the high selectivity of sorbents for boron component in brine through the efforts of many scientists a number of sorbents have been prepared and applied for the removal and recovery of boron 10 18 57 including the chelating resins activated carbon fly ash and industrial waste materials natural materials oxides and hydroxides etc among them the chelating resins are the important sorbents for the removal and recovery of boron from brines and aqueous solutions most synthesized chelating resins available on the market have a macroporous polystyrene matrix attached with the n methylglucamine functional group such as ira743 resin amberlite crb01 resin and crb02 resin diaion bsr 1 resin dowex d403 resin china these chelating resins have the adjacent hydroxyl groups with a high selectivity to borate ions in brines based on the complexation adsorption mechanism recently the development in new chelating resins and fibers with large capacity high selectivity and high sorption rate have received great interest for the removal and recovery boron from natural waters wastewater and brines 10 18 27 because of the limitation of boron resources the boron recovery from salt lake brine desalination seawater and geothermal water is becoming correspondingly important and the research and development in this area is urgently needed at present most researches focus on the development of the advanced sorbents 18 61 and there are few researches on the cycle adsorption desorption process for the boron continuous recovery from brine therefore the aim of this work is to develop the continuous boron recovery process from brine using the commercially available n methylglucamine resin d403 resin as boron sorbent experiments with the batch adsorber single packed column and seven column unit are performed for boron recovery from brine here the seven column unit is operated by the simulated moving bed smb mode which has not been reported before for the boron continuous recovery from brine the feasibility and effectiveness of the seven column smb process will be evaluated through experiments in the laboratory scale 2 materials and method 2 1 resins and brines reagents lithium chloride monohydrate licl h2o ar 99 0 calcium

the boron adsorption amount on resins was measured by the static experiments typically the wet resins about 2 g 5 g were added into 100 ml solution with initial boron concentration in a range of 100 mg l 1000 mg l in a conical flask then the bottle was placed in an incubator with 150 rpm shaking rate at the given temperature for 4 h after adsorption resins were collected through filtration and the boron concentration in the supernatant liquid was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry icp aes for the experiments to evaluate the effect of ph value on the boron adsorption amount of resins the ph value in the aqueous solution was adjusted initially in the range of 3 0 12 0 by the appropriate addition of hcl or naoh solution to evaluate the boron selectivity of resins brine with the equivalent weight for boron and each cation about 1000 mg l for na k li mg2 ca2 and b respectively was used for the competitive adsorption experiment typically 5 g wet resins were added into 100 ml brine in a conical flask then the bottle was placed in an incubator with 150 rpm shaking rate at 298 k for 4 h after adsorption the resins were collected through filtration and the concentrations of cations and boron in the supernatant liquid were analyzed by icp aes the recyclability of resins was evaluated through the cyclic adsorption desorption experiment for ten times at the adsorption step 5 g wet resins were added into 100 ml brine with about 500 mg l boron in a conical flask then the bottle was placed in an incubator with 150 rpm shaking rate at 298 k for 4 h after adsorption the resins were collected by filtration and the boron concentration in the supernatant liquid was analyzed by icp aes at the desorption step the collected resins were regenerated by 0 5 m hcl 100 ml for 1 h then washed with deionized water until neutral ph value for the next cyclic experiment the boron adsorption rate on resins was measured in a batch adsorber with stirring and temperature was controlled by a constant temperature bath typically 5 g wet resins were immersed in 100 ml brine with different boron concentration in a batch adsorber at the given adsorption interval a little amount of supernatant liquid was taken out for the analysis of boron content by icp aes according to the measured data in the static experiments the boron adsorption amount q b per gram of resins boron adsorption efficiency from brines in batch adsorber r b were calculated by eqs 1 2 1 q b c b 0 c b t v m 2 r b c b 0 c b t c b 0 100 where c b 0 mg l was the boron initial concentration in brine c b t mg l was the boron concentration in brine at t time v l was brine volume and m g was resin amount 2 3 fixed bed experiment a fixed bed adsorber was used to recover boron from brine as shown in fig 1a the fixed bed adsorber was packed with 60 ml resins 300 mm packed height and 16 mm packed diameter 46 g weight of resins circulating water from the thermostat was used to control the constant temperature in the fixed bed adsorber the inlet flow rate of the feed solution to the packed column was controlled by a metering pump and the feed solutions included brine water hcl solution naoh solution nacl solution the composition of the effluent solution from the fixed bed in each step was analyzed by icp aes there were five steps in a cyclic process for the boron recovery from brine by the fixed bed adsorber including boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration as shown in fig 1b the function of each step was described as follows 1 at the boron adsorption step the brine passed through the resins packed column where boron was preferentially adsorbed by resins and the effluent solution was with a low content boron 2 at the water washing 1 step some water was input to remove the retained brine 3 at the boron desorption step the adsorbed boron on resins was desorbed through inputting hcl solution and the boron rich solution was obtained from the outlet of the fixed bed 4 at the water washing 2 step the retained hcl solution in the packed column was recovered through water washing 5 at the resin regeneration step naoh solution and nacl solution were input to the fixed bed respectively to regenerate the amine functional groups of resins for the cyclic use during each step the effluent solution from the packed column was collected to analyze the composition of sample by icp aes the deionized water was used at two water washing steps the concentration of hcl solution was in the range of 0 1 mol l 0 5 mol l and 0 5 mol l naoh solution and 1 mol l nacl solution were used for the resin regeneration the operation temperature was 298 k the boron adsorption amount on the packed resins q b mg g was calculated by eq 3 the boron adsorption efficiency from brine r b was calculated by eq 4 and the boron desorption efficiency d b was calculated by eq 5 3 q b v 0 v a c b 0 c b v dv m 4 r b v 0 v a c b 0 c b v dv c b 0 v a 100 5 d b v 0 v b c b v dv mq b 100 where c b 0 mg l was the boron concentration in brine c b v mg l was the outflow boron concentration from the packed column with v l volume of effluent solution m g was the amount of the packed resins and v a and v b were the total volume from adsorption step and desorption step respectively 2 4 multicolumn simulated moving bed experiment as shown in fig 1b it needed five steps in one cyclic process for boron recovery from brine by one fixed bed adsorber where the packed column went on in turn boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration steps so it was difficult to continuously recover boron from brine using one column to achieve the boron continuous recovery from brine multicolumn operation unit was required here we designed the seven column four zone simulated moving bed smb process where the four zones correspond to the five steps in the fixed bed adsorber respectively as shown in fig 2a namely as boron adsorption zone i with two tandem columns water washing 1 zone ii with two tandem columns boron desorption zone iii with two tandem columns water washing 2 and resin regeneration zone iv together with one column both water washing 2 step and resin regeneration step were arranged into the zone iv together with one column due to the shorter operation time at each step according to the simulated moving bed smb operation mode seven packed columns in fig 2a did not move during the cyclic operation but the input and output stream ports were switched synchronously from one column to next column along the fluid flow direction resulting in the first column in each zone would be shifted into the next zone after each switch with the input and output stream ports frequently switching each column would go in the different operation zone for example column 1 going on boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration in turn then recycle operation as shown in fig 2a table 1 also listed the operating sequences for each packed column in the seven column smb unit at one smb cycle the packed column took on the different role in each operation zone in adsorption zone i brine passed through column 1and column 2 boron component was adsorbed by d403 resins and the effluent solution from column 2 was discharged after boron adsorption column 1 was shifted into water washing 1 zone ii at next switch at the same time in water washing 1 zone ii water passed through column 6 and column 7 to remove the retained brine and the effluent solution from column 7 was discharged after water washing column 6 was shifted into boron desorption zone iii at next switch in boron desorption zone iii 0 3 m hcl passed through column 4 and column 5 to desorb boron from d403 resins and the boron rich solution was obtained at the outlet of column 5 after desorption column 4 was shifted into water washing 2 and resin transformation zone iv at next switch in water washing 2 and resin regeneration zone iv three streams passed through column 3 in turn during one switch interval firstly water inlet to column 3 to recover the retained acid then 0 15 m naoh passing through column 3 to regenerate the amine functional groups of resins following the inlet of 0 5 m nacl to remove free oh ions in the packed column going into the boron adsorption zone i at next switch in the laboratory the seven column smb unit was set up as shown in fig 2b seven columns were packed with d403 resins at the same packed size for each column packed diameter 20 mm packed height 145 mm 45 ml resins four metering pumps were adopted for inlet of brine tbp2h02f type no hcl solution tbp5002f type no water tbp2h02 type no and naoh solution and nacl solution tbp5002 type no respectively which were made by tauto biotech company in china the fully automatic control valves airtac company 2klh030 06 open type and 2lh 06 close type were installed at the inlet and output ports of each column which were controlled by a home made computer control platform based on the experimental data obtained in single column we might select the initial experimental conditions of smb process with these initial experimental conditions we did some trial and error runs on d403 resins packed seven column smb unit to correct the operating conditions as listed in table 2 in this work we should test the feasibility of the proposed smb process for boron continuous recovery from brine with different boron content such as exp 1 with 516 1 mg l of boron exp 2 with 428 7 mg l of boron exp 3 with 296 5 mg l of boron because of the limitation of the experimental installation conditions we were not yet able to directly use the high salinity brine in the smb equipment all the smb experiments were carried out in laboratory for boron continuous recovery from the low salinity brine one switch time was set as 20 min for the inlet and output stream ports shifting and one smb cycle period for seven columns was 140 min it needed to take eight smb cycles reaching the stable state of the experimental system then we started to sample and analyze the contents of boron and cations the selection of experimental conditions was not stringent in this work in future work more systematic optimal design for the boron recovery smb process would be needed such as by adopting the model based design approach based on adsorption and mass transfer parameters of boron and other components moreover the tested brine mainly contained cl ions so the acidic desorption solution was selected as the diluted hcl solution avoiding the other acidic anions into salt lake brines to produce pollution 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption and desorption performance of boron on n methylglucamine resin boron presents two states in aqueous solution boric acid b oh 3 and borate ion b oh 4 where b oh 3 can accept oh ion to form b oh 4 following a reversible reaction 6 b oh 3 h 2 o b oh 4 h the contents of two boron components in aqueous solution are dependent on ph value of solution as shown in fig 3 which are calculated based on the equilibrium constant of eq 6 58 59 with a lower ph value acidic solution boric acid dominates while at alkaline condition borate ion dominates in aqueous solution when d403 resin is used to recover boron from aqueous solution the adjacent double hydroxyl groups of resin form preferentially the complexation reaction with borate ions as shown in fig 4a with the adsorption of borate ions boric acids will go on hydrolysis to produce borate ions for adsorption based on the reversible reaction of eq 6 and the released h ions in eq 6 will be neutralized by the amine functional group of resin because there is not the complexation reaction between boron acid and the n methylglucamine resin the complexed borate compound on resin can be desorbed in the form of boron acid through the immersion of hcl solution fig 4b shows the infrared spectrums of d403 resin before adsorption after adsorption and after desorption of boron there are some characteristic peaks at 856 2 cm 1 1045 2 cm 1 1085 7 cm 1 1463 7 cm 1 1633 4 cm 1 2935 2 cm 1 3401 8 cm 1 wavenumbers for the original d403 resin before boron adsorption however the obvious difference for the vibration peak at 1045 2 cm 1 can be found before and after adsorption desorption of boron on d403 resin during boron adsorption the vibration peak at 1045 2 cm 1 disappears and one new vibration peak at 964 2 cm 1 is formed which means the formation of one new complex when borate ion is adsorbed on the surface of d403 resin after boron desorption by hcl solution the vibration peak at 964 2 cm 1 disappears and the vibration peak at 1045 2 cm 1 appears again the boron adsorption and desorption behaviors of d403 resin are evaluated through the static experiments and the experimental results are shown in fig 5a e the experimental data in fig 5a illustrate that d403 resin has a high boron adsorption amount in the ph value range of 4 10 reaching 9 mg g and the adsorbed boron can be desorbed at the strong acidic solution ph value 1 the adsorption mechanism is that the adjacent double hydroxyl group of d403 resin form preferentially the complexation reaction with borate ion the complexation adsorption involves the dissociation of oh ion from the functional group of resin and the strong alkaline solution ph 10 is unfavorable to the dissociation of oh ion resulting in the decrease of the boron adsorption amount as shown in fig 5a the boron adsorption process belongs to the chemisorption so the boron equilibrium adsorption amount increases with increasing temperature as shown in fig 5b the boron equilibrium adsorption isotherm can be represented using langmuir isotherm equation with an acceptable accuracy as shown in fig 5b with solid lines the model parameters ka and qm in the langmuir equation q e q m k a c e 1 k a c e are estimated as 0 048 l mg and 8 88 mg g at 298 k 0 041 l mg and 9 31 mg g at 318 k 0 041 l mg and 9 62 mg g at 338 k respectively the complexation adsorption of borate ion has a high selectivity as shown in fig 5c and the adsorption amounts of other metal ions on d403 resin are small the adsorption sites on the surface of d403 resins for metal cations and borate ion are different so the effect of metal cations on the adsorption amount of boron on d403 resin is weak moreover d403 resin has the good boron adsorption kinetics and the fast adsorption rate about 60 min reaching one saturation adsorption amount as shown in fig 5d in addition the cyclic adsorption brine with 500 mg l of boron 4 h and desorption 1 mol l hcl 1 h static experiment is carried out to evaluate the stability of d403 resin and the experimental results in fig 5e illustrate the d403 resin having the good stability for the repeated use 3 2 cyclic adsorption and desorption process for boron recovery from brine in the fixed bed adsorber through the assessment of adsorption and desorption performances of boron on d403 resin in the batch adsorber it is found that the commercially available boron chelating resin d403 resin has the excellent performance for the boron removal and recovery from the aqueous solution then we investigate further the boron recovery from brine in the fixed bed adsorber packed with d403 resins the cyclic adsorption and desorption process for boron recovery from brine in a fixed bed is designed with five operation steps including â  boron adsorption â¡ water washing 1 â¢ boron desorption â£ water washing 2 â¤ resin regeneration as shown in fig 1b the operation conditions in each step are investigated experimentally then the experimental demonstration is performed to evaluate the stability and efficiency of the cyclic process 1 breakthrough curve of boron from the fixed bed adsorber brines with different boron content 205 1 mg l 490 8 mg l 978 5 mg l and at different flowrate 3 ml min 6 ml min 10 ml min pass through the fixed bed and the boron breakthrough curves are measured at the outlet of the packed column as shown in fig 6a b the effect of boron content in brine on the breakthrough curve is shown in fig 6a at 10 ml min flowrate the experimental results illustrate the effect of boron content is more obvious the higher the boron content the earlier the boron breakthrough from the fixed bed based on the breakthrough curves the boron adsorption amounts on the packed resins are calculated as 7 76 mg g with 54 0 boron adsorption efficiency from brine containing 205 1 mg l boron 8 23 mg g with 42 5 boron adsorption efficiency from brine containing 490 8 mg l boron 9 77 mg g with 38 0 boron adsorption efficiency from brine containing 978 5 mg l boron respectively the effect of brine flowrate on the breakthrough curve is shown in fig 6b where brine with 490 8 mg l of boron passes through the fixed bed at three different inlet flowrates 3 ml min 6 ml min 10 ml min respectively the experimental results show the effect of brine flowrate mainly on the shape of breakthrough curve and the effect on the treated brine amount is not obvious due to the fast adsorption rate of boron on d403 resin when the brine flowrate is very fast for example 10 ml min there occurs the effect of the mass transfer resistance resulting in an earlier breakthrough according to the breakthrough curves it is estimated that boron adsorption amount on the packed resins is 7 65 mg g with 61 1 boron adsorption efficiency for 3 ml min 7 64 mg g with 55 2 boron adsorption efficiency with for 6 ml min 8 23 mg g with 42 6 boron adsorption efficiency for 10 ml min respectively because single fixed bed is packed with 60 ml d403 resins 46 g weight the total amount of boron removed by a single column is calculated as 351 44 g 378 58 g from brine with 490 8 mg l of boron at 3 ml min 10 ml min flowrate 2 water washing 1 to remove the retained brine in the packed column after boron recovery from brine the fixed bed will go on water washing step to remove the retained brine in the column in order to reduce the contents of impurities in the boron rich solution obtained at the desorption step the water washing mode is to inlet water from the bottom of the packed column after the boron adsorption from brine inputting 10 ml min brine with 490 8 mg l of boron for 150 min 10 ml min water is input the fixed bed and the effluent curves are shown in fig 7 it is found that the retained cations such as k na ca2 mg2 in the packed column can be washed out and water consumption amount is about 180 ml 3 bed volumes 3 boron desorption behavior in fixed bed by hcl solution after water washing to remove the retained brine in the column hcl solution is input into the fixed bed to desorb the adsorbed boron on resins and the boron rich solution is obtained from the outlet of the column both hcl concentration and flowrate are the key operation conditions fig 8a shows the effect of the hcl concentration on the desorption efficiency of boron where the hcl solution with 0 1 mol l 0 3 mol l 0 5 mol l and 1 mol l hcl respectively is inlet to the fixed bed at 5 ml min flowrate the boron adsorption and water washing 1 are carried out using the same operation conditions before boron desorption 10 ml min brine with 490 8 mg l of boron for 150 min 10 ml min water for 20 min the boron desorption efficiency reaches 96 9 99 7 98 7 and 98 2 respectively the adsorbed boron is desorbed easily the boron desorption efficiency also reaches 96 9 even if we input 0 1 mol l hcl solution then the effect of the inlet flowrate of 0 5 mol l hcl solution is tested as shown in fig 8b where 3 ml min 5 ml min and 7 ml min are adopted respectively the desorption efficiency reaches 97 0 3 ml min 100 5 ml min 99 6 7 ml min and the boron content in the relative effluent solution reaches 902 6 mg l 856 3 mg l and 703 2 mg l respectively and the obtained boron rich solutions contain a little amount of other cations 4 water washing 2 and resin regeneration after the boron desorption from the packed column water is inlet to recover the retained acid solution in the fixed bed because the amine functional group of resin is with h type after boron desorption by the hcl solution it needs to be regenerated as oh type through the immersion of naoh solution ready for the repeated use the resin regeneration method is after the second water washing at 10 ml min for 15 min to recover the retained hcl solution 0 5 m naoh at 5 ml min flowrate is inlet to the packed column for 10 min to regenerate the amine functional group of d403 resin then passing through 1 m nacl solution at 5 ml min about 30 min to remove the free oh ions until ph as 7 9 in the effluent solution after regeneration of d403 resins the fixed bed is reused to recover boron from brine with the same operation conditions as the first cycle and the boron breakthrough curves at the first cycle and at the second cycle are compared in fig 9 it is found that two breakthrough curves almost are in agreement with each other 5 experimental demonstration for boron recovery from brine by the cyclic adsorption and desorption process in the fixed bed the cyclic experiment is done with the following conditions for boron recovery from brine by one fixed bed with d403 resins â  at boron adsorption step inlet brine with at 10 ml min 120 min to recover boron from brine by the d403 resin packed column â¡ at water washing 1 step inlet water at 10 ml min 20 min to remove the retained brine â¢ at boron desorption step inlet 0 5 mol l hcl solution at 5 ml min 80 min to obtain the boron rich solution â£ at water washing 2 step inlet water at 10 ml min 15 min to recover the retained acid â¤ at resin regeneration step inlet 0 5 m naoh at 5 ml min 10 min following 1 m nacl solution at 5 ml min 30 min fig 10a shows the boron effluent curves from the fixed bed during the first cycle and the tenth cycle two effluent curves are in agreement with each other and other experiments are also consistent as shown in fig 10b the tested brine contains 498 6 mg l of boron and 1000 mg l for each cation li na k ca2 and mg2 through the adsorption and desorption steps in the fixed bed the obtained boron rich solution contains 690 3 mg l of boron and the other cation contents 20 0 mg l in the first cycle boron adsorption efficiency from brine reaches 58 5 boron desorption efficiency is 93 6 boron adsorption amount on the packed resins is 7 65 mg g after multicycles the same results can also be obtained as listed in table 3 in the tenth cycle the obtained boron rich solution contains 679 4 mg l of boron boron adsorption efficiency from brine reaches 57 1 boron desorption efficiency is 92 8 boron adsorption amount on the packed resins is 7 59 mg g 3 3 effect of brine salinity for boron recovery from brine by the fixed bed adsorber in the above mentioned experiments the tested brine is with a low salinity where each cation content is set as 1000 mg l li na k ca2 and mg2 in the brine the boron adsorption performance of d403 resin in a high salinity brine will be evaluated where brine is from qaerhan salt lake china with the typical chemical composition of 29 1 mg l of li 1218 1 mg l of na 39 9 mg l of k 67 1 mg l of ca2 12 564 4 mg l of mg2 200 mg l of boron ph 6 58 fig 11 shows the effect of brine salinity on boron adsorption kinetics of d403 resin where both the high salinity brine and the low salinity brine are tested in the batch experiments with the same initial boron concentration in brine and the same operation conditions 4 g 500 ml 200 mg l of boron in brine experimental results in fig 11 confirm that d403 resin has the good salt tolerance and the high salinity in brine does not result in the obvious decrease of the boron adsorption amount since the high cation contents in brine do not affect the complexation adsorption of borate ion however there occurs the mass transfer resistance for diffusion of borate ion into the surface of d403 resin for the complexation adsorption in the high salinity brine a relative slower adsorption rate at the intimal adsorption stage 60 min is found as shown in fig 11 furthermore we compare the boron breakthrough and elution curves in the fixed bed for boron recovery from the high salinity brine and the low salinity brine at the same operation conditions for example brine contained about 200 mg l of boron at 20 ml min for 100 min adsorption water washing at 20 ml min for 20 min and 0 5 mol l hcl desorption at 10 ml min for 60 min as shown in fig 12 fixed bed is packed with 120 ml d403 resins 30 mm diameter 170 mm packed height it is found that boron breakthroughs early when the high salinity brine passes through the fixed bed due to the mass transfer resistance but the adsorption amount and desorption amount per gram resins for the given operation periods are almost the same for two brines as listed in table 4 so the effect of the brine salinity is weak on the complexation adsorption of borate ion and d403 resin is applicable to boron recovery from brine at a large scale 3 4 boron continuous recovery from brine by seven column smb process the above mentioned experimental results in fixed bed adsorber demonstrate that the cyclic process for boron recovery from brine needs five steps when one packed column is adopted the boron recovery from brine is discontinuous owing to this column completing the five steps independently during one cyclic operation to realize the continuous extraction of boron from brine the seven column smb process is adopted to recover continuously boron from brine in adsorption zone i and to obtain continuously boron rich solution in desorption zone iii because it needs to take more than eight smb cycles reaching the stable state of the experimental system and the consumption amounts of brine water 0 3 m hcl solution are large for each experiment here three group of experiments are carried out to validate the feasibility of the seven column smb process for boron continuous recovery from brine with boron content as 516 1 mg l in exp 1 428 7 mg l in exp 2 296 5 mg l in exp 3 the initial operation conditions in adsorption water washing 1 and desorption zones are designed approximately according to the above mentioned experimental conditions in the fixed bed adsorber however it is used two tandem columns in adsorption zone water washing 1 zone and desorption zone respectively theses operation conditions are corrected by the trial and error runs on smb unit before the formal experiment as listed in table 2 fig 13 shows the effluent curves from the d403 resins packed columns in adsorption zone i and in desorption zone iii in one smb cycle operation period after the system reaching stabile state 8 cycles where brine contains a higher boron content in exp 1 typically as 516 06 mg l according to the experimental results in fig 13a the boron adsorption efficiency reaches 89 0 water washing removes most of the retained cations and the obtained boron rich solution in desorption zone contains a little amount of cations na k ca2 mg3 as shown in fig 13b and table 5 the effective separation of boron and cations in brine is achieved by the seven column smb process and the boron desorption efficiency reaches 98 7 for the mass balance of boron over four zones boron contents are measured in brine 516 06 mg l effluent solution from zone i 55 25 mg l from zone ii 107 20 mg l from zone iii 463 63 mg l and from zone iv 5 mg l the boron loss rate in water washing zone is estimated as 16 61 due to the retained brine in the column and the consumption amount of 0 3 m hcl solution per gram of boron product is 2 16 l g based on the measured data when the input brine contains a relatively low boron content such as 428 7 mg l in exp 2 the boron adsorption efficiency in adsorption zone i increases to 92 18 and the boron content in the effluent solution from adsorption zone i can be reduced as 33 51 mg l as shown in fig 14a but the boron content of the outflow brine exceeds the discharge standard not meeting the environmental protection requirement in desorption zone the boron rich solution with 417 11 mg l of boron and small amounts of cations is obtained and the boron desorption efficiency reaches 98 65 as shown in fig 14b and table 5 once again this group of experiment also demonstrates that the continuous extraction of boron from brine can be achieved by the seven column smb process for the mass balance of boron over the seven column unit the average boron contents in each zone are brine 428 7 mg l effluent solutions in zone i 33 51 mg l in zone ii 71 2 mg l in zone iii 417 11 mg l in zone iv 5 67 mg l the boron loss rate in water washing zone is estimated as 13 28 due to the retained brine in the column and the consumption amount of 0 3 m hcl solution per gram of boron product is 2 39 l g based on the measured data when the input brine contains 296 5 mg l of boron in exp 3 most boron can be recovered by the seven column four zone smb process the boron adsorption efficiency reaches 96 8 and the discharged brine contain a little amount of boron 8 77 mg l meeting the environmental protection requirement as shown in fig 15a at the same time the boron rich solution containing 326 6 mg l of boron with a little amount of cations is obtained and the boron desorption efficiency reaches 99 5 in the desorption zone as shown in fig 15b and table 5 therefore the continuous and simultaneous recovery and removal of boron from brine also can be achieved with the developed multicolumn smb process for the mass balance of boron over the seven column unit boron concentrations are measured in brine 296 5 mg l effluent solution in zone i 8 77 mg l in zone ii 29 13 mg l in zone iii 326 60 mg l in zone iv 3 59 mg l the boron loss rate in water washing zone is calculated as 7 86 and the consumption amount of 0 3 m hcl solution per gram of boron product is 3 0 l g based on the measured data in this work three group of experiments are carried out for boron continuous recovery from brine in the set up seven column smb unit with the same flowrates where boron content in brine is different including 516 1 mg l in exp 1 428 7 mg l in exp 2 296 5 mg l in exp 3 as listed in table 2 with the same flowrates in the smb process the boron loss in zone i can be reduced when boron content in brine decreases for example brine containing 516 06 mg l of boron used in exp 1 with 89 0 adsorption efficiency and 11 0 boron loss brine containing 428 7 mg l of boron used in exp 2 with 92 18 adsorption efficiency and 7 82 boron loss brine containing 296 5 mg l of boron used in exp 3 with 96 8 adsorption efficiency and 3 2 boron loss as listed in table 5 the boron loss in zone ii is caused by the retained brine in the packed column which is almost the same between the seven column smb process and single fixed bed process when the packed column has a high resins utilization rate furthermore table 6 shows the experimental comparison between one column cyclic process and seven column smb process for boron recovery from brine with about 500 mg l of boron although the resins packed amount in the smb process 315 ml is higher than that in one fixed bed adsorber 60 ml the inlet brine volume per unit time and unit resin in smb process 0 0794 l min l is higher than that in one fixed bed adsorber 0 0727 l min l boron productivity per unit time and unit resin in smb process 0 03023 g min l is higher than that in fixed bed adsorber 0 01659 g min l and the ratio of hcl consumption to boron productivity per cyclic period 7 94 mol g l min is lower than that in fixed bed adsorber 10 06 mol g l min the comparison between fixed bed process and smb process in table 6 is based on the high resin utilization rate in the packed column in adsorption zone of the smb process there are two tandem columns and the resins packed in the first column can adsorb boron from brine as more as possible reaching almost the saturated adsorption amount with boron content of brine before it is shifted into the water washing 1 zone and desorption zone so the resins packed in the column in smb process have a higher utilization rate when compared with one fixed bed adsorber usually sacrificing the resin utilization rate to improve the boron adsorption efficiency from brine moreover the second column in smb process can continue to adsorb boron when the effluent solution of the first column passes through the second column so the boron adsorption efficiency can be improved as 89 in another side the experimental data of fixed bed belong to sacrifice the boron adsorption efficiency 58 0 from brine to improve the resin utilization rate as shown in fig 10 where the packed column also reaches almost the saturated adsorption amount with boron content of brine in this work we do not optimize the operating conditions of the proposed smb process in fact the proposed multicolumn smb process has many advantages over single fixed bed adsorber on the management of process water hcl and other chemicals naoh nacl which are outlined below requiring further investigation by experiment and simulation 1 fixed bed adsorber with one column in turn goes on adsorption water washing 1 desorption waster washing 2 and resin regeneration steps so it is not a continuous boron recovery process owing to the boron recovery from brine only at the adsorption step the seven column smb process can achieve the continuous recovery of boron from brine in adsorption zone where the packed columns in four zones are run together with a fully automatic control panel at the simulated moving bed operation mode 2 the resins packed in the first column in adsorption zone of the smb process can adsorb boron from brine as more as possible reaching almost the saturated adsorption amount with boron content of brine before it is shifted into the water washing 1 zone and desorption zone so the resins packed in the column have a higher utilization rate when compared with one fixed bed adsorber usually sacrificing the utilization rate of resins to improve the boron adsorption efficiency from brine 3 the first column in water washing 1 zone of the smb process is washed using fresh water to remove the retained brine and the outflow solution from the first column is input to the second column continuously washing the retained brine so water consumption amount can be saved almost by half when compared with one fixed bed adsorber if multicolumn is washed with water in a series connection the consumption amount of water will be further reduced 4 the fresh hcl solution is input into the first column in boron desorption zone of the smb process to desorb the adsorbed boron from resins as more as possible and the outflow hcl solution from the first column is input to the second column to continuously desorb boron so the consumption amount of hcl solution can be reduced almost by half when compared with one fixed bed adsorber if multicolumn is desorbed in a series connection by hcl solution the consumption amount of hcl solution will be further reduced 5 similar to the fixed bed adsorber one column is adopted in waster washing 2 and resin regeneration zone of the smb process going on water washing 2 step to recover the retained hcl solution and to regenerate the amine functional groups of the resins by inputting naoh solution and nacl solution the consumption amounts of naoh and nacl solutions are small based on the stoichiometry relationship of h and oh for the regeneration of the amine functional groups of the resins in summary compared with the fixed bed adsorber the utilization rate of resins in smb process is higher the consumption amounts of water and hcl solution can be saved significantly when using the tandem columns in water washing 1 zone and in desorption zone therefore the smb process has evident advantages in boron recovery and removal from brine with a broad industrial application prospect 4 conclusions the adjacent double hydroxyl group of the n methylglucamine resin d403 resin forms preferentially the complexation adsorption with borate ion to realize the effective separation of boron and cations in brine d403 resin has the fast adsorption rate of boron high boron adsorption amount excellent boron selectivity good stability for the cyclic adsorption and desorption and better salt tolerance which make the n methylglucamine resin more promising for industrial application experiments in fixed bed adsorber with d403 resins demonstrate that the cyclic process for boron recovery from brine involves five steps such as boron adsorption water washing 1 boron desorption water washing 2 and resin regeneration the boron can be recovered efficiently from brine and the boron rich solution with a little amount of other cations is obtained by this cyclic process however the boron recovery from brine by the fixed bed adsorber is discontinuous owing to this column completing the five steps independently during one cyclic operation period four zones are disconnected in the developed multicolumn smb process and it is actually an improvement to a single fixed bed adsorber with five steps when the packed columns in four zones are run together with a fully automatic control panel by smb mode the developed seven column smb process can achieve the continuous recovery of boron from brine 280 67 mg l 516 06 mg l of boron with a high boron adsorption efficiency 89 98 65 and a high boron desorption efficiency 98 65 99 50 moreover the tandem columns in adsorption zone water washing zone and desorption zone are adopted to save the consumption amounts of water and hcl solution and the utilization rate of resins in column can be improved therefore the smb process has evident advantages in boron recovery and removal from brine with a broad industrial application prospect declaration of competing interest the authors

12449,progressive freezing is a separation and purification technology that is widely used to treat various kinds of wastewater because of providing energy savings and environmental protection however there have been no reports of using it to treat sulfonamide antibiotics sas wastewater and the mechanism of the progressive freezing method for wastewater treatment still needs to be clarified therefore we selected four typical sas including sulfadiazine sd sulfapyridine sp sulfamethazine sm2 and sulfaquinoxaline sq as research subjects to systematically explore the solid liquid phase distribution of sas during the freezing process we considered the binding energy between an sa and an ice molecule or a water cluster to elucidate the purification mechanism of the freezing process the results showed that the purification rate of the sas solution was 65 86 and decreased in the order sd sp sm2 sq the gaussian calculation showed that the binding energy of sas to the ice phase was less than that to the water phase resulting in the separation of the sas in ice water two phase and purification of the ice body the main reason for the difference among the purification rates of the

the earliest discovered and most widely used antibiotics 1 sas have the advantages of a broad antibacterial spectrum stable properties and being easy to use 2 3 after sas are ingested by humans and animals only a small quantity remains in the body and most sas 85 are excreted through feces and urine in the form of original drugs and metabolites 4 5 if these excrements are used for composting microorganisms are more likely to produce antibiotic resistance gene 6 sas have been detected to varying degrees in surface water 7 8 groundwater 9 10 sewage and wastewater 11 12 the concentration of sas in sewage treatment plants and hospital wastewater is far higher than that in other water the concentration level of sulfadiazine sd detected in hospital wastewater is as high as 39 3 Î¼g l the concentration of sulfamethoxazole smx in aquaculture wastewater is as high as 54 83 mg l 13 15 and has reached acute toxicity levels 16 sas have also been detected in surface water 10 ng l 142 6 Î¼g l oceans 74 92 ng l 17 18 and drinking water 0 0 94 ng l 19 studies have found that sas are toxic to microorganisms bacteria algae and fish 16 17 20 the direct discharge of untreated wastewater containing sas into the environment harms the ecosystem 21 and can accumulate through the food chain thus seriously threat to human health the freezing method offers the advantages of low energy consumption high efficiency and no secondary pollution 22 23 and has thus been widely used in concentrating food products 24 25 seawater desalination 26 aquaculture wastewater and industrial sewage

carried out at low temperatures does not produce scale during the wastewater treatment process and is less corrosive to equipment 30 31 adjusting the process parameters of the progressive freezing method can result in a desalination rate of up to 74 for treating artificial seawater salinity 35 67 g l 32 at a cost of only 0 34 m3 which is 1 10th that of msf and 1 2 that of ro 22 33 progressive freezing has achieved good results in the treatment of various wastewater thus the progressive freezing method is a novel wastewater treatment technology with broad application prospects however there are few explanations for the mechanism of progressive freezing it is well known that energy is the basis for driving the motion of matter and the process of water molecules becoming ice is often accompanied by changes in energy by calculating energy we can better understand the migration process of substances during the freezing process of water at present quantum chemical calculation methods have gradually become the main method of chemical calculation theory research 34 35 mainly applied in energetic materials 36 37 modern molecular biology 38 solid material chemistry 39 and molecular

microstructure 42 44 in recent decades the treatment of aqueous solution by progressive freezing has mainly focused on the food field 45 47 while the research on novel contaminants sas especially the freezing mechanism has not been reported yet therefore the treatment efficiency of progressive freezing for different sas was explored in this study four sas with a high detection rate and toxicity in water were selected as research subjects including sulfadiazine sd sulfapyridine sp sulfamethazine sm2 and sulfaquinoxaline sq a quantum chemical calculation of the purification process was carried out using gaussian multiwfn and other software and the purification mechanism of the four sas in the freezing process was elucidated at the molecular level to provide a reference for using progressive freezing to treat pollutants in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 icing experiment 2 1 1 materials sulfadiazine 99 96 purity sulfapyridine 99 2 purity sulfamethazine 99 91 purity and sulfaquinoxaline 99 1 purity were purchased from stanford chemicals ultra pure water 18 2 mÏ cm toc 1 Î¼g l was prepared by a purelab ultra elga uk analytical system the physicochemical properties of the four sas are described in the supplementary material table s1 mixed standard stock solution 50 mg of each of the four sas standards were accurately weighed and dissolved in methanol to prepare a mixed 50 mg l standard stock solution the mixed standard stock solution was transferred to a 1 l brown wide mouth constant volume bottle the bottle mouth was closed with a sealing film and the bottle was transferred to a low temperature box at 20 c 2 1 2 experimental device fig 1 shows the experimental setup consisting of an icing simulator and analytical instruments the ice simulator was an icing device 20 cm 20 cm 30 cm constructed inhouse that transmitted cold energy in one direction the upper opening was in direct contact with cold air and the bottom and surroundings were insulated with high density expanded polystyrene eps with a thickness of 5 cm that effectively prevented the infiltration of cold energy a teflon film was attached to the inner wall of the ice simulator to prevent adsorption of the sas to ensure that water under ice could be sampled without affecting the icing process a sampling controller was placed in the icing simulator the sampling controller consisted of a sampling needle cylinder a t shaped control valve and a long sampling tube teflon with a 2 mm diameter and a 40 cm length during sampling the sampling needle cylinder and the t shaped control valve were connected and then the t shaped control valve was opened a 3 ml sample of aqueous ice solution was extracted for testing then the aqueous solution in the long tube was drained and the t shaped control valve was closed the analytical instrument was an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer uplc esi ms ms acquity uplc tqd and the chromatographic column was an acquitytm uplc ben c8 column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 Î¼m the detailed equipment operation parameters and the gradient elution procedure are shown in the supplementary material text s1and table s2 respectively 2 1 3 experimental design studies have shown that the sulfonamide antibiotic concentrations exceeding 100 Î¼g l are toxic to microorganisms 16 therefore the experiment was carried out using a 100 Î¼g l aqueous solution of sas and the water depth of solution was set at 25 cm the stock solution was diluted with ultrapure water to prepare a 100 Î¼g l standard solution then 10 l of the standard solution the water depth of 25 cm were placed in an ice simulator and frozen in a 15 c low temperature test box the total freezing time was 96 h and the icing ratio was 75 after 96 h of freezing samples of the sa antibiotics were extracted from the water under ice by a sampler the ice and water were separated and the ice body was removed and melted at a constant temperature of 25 c to obtain a melted water sample the samples of water under ice and melted water samples were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane and then detected by uplc esi ms ms the residue rate r reflects the residue of the sas in ice and is calculated as the ratio of the mass of the sas in the ice after the 96 h freezing experiment to the total mass of the sas in the initial solution 1 r c i v i c 0 v 0 100 where c i and v i represent the concentration of the sas in the ice and the volume of ice after freezing for 96 h respectively and c 0 and v 0 represent the initial concentration of the sas and the initial volume of the aqueous solution respectively the purification rate p reflects the quantity of sas separated from ice and is calculated as the ratio of the mass of the sas separated from ice after the 96 h freezing experiment to the total mass of sas in the initial solution 2 p 1 r 2 2 quantum chemical calculation 2 2 1 molecular model to explore the purification mechanism of sas during the freezing process ice and water were regarded as two media and a single sulfonamide molecule was combined with an ice molecule or a water cluster the artificial ice ih molecular structure was adopted for ice the same number 20 of molecules were used in a water cluster as in the ice molecule and the sas molecules were downloaded from chemical book https www chemicalbook com productindex aspx to ensure that the most stable structure of a sulfonamide molecule combined with an ice molecule or a water cluster the structures of the ice molecule water cluster and sulfonamides molecules were optimized and the extreme points and electrostatic potential distributions of the individual molecules were found 48 the optimization methods are described in the supplementary material text s2 then the maximum point minimum point of the electrostatic potential of a sulfonamide molecule was combined with the minimum point maximum point of the electrostatic potential of an ice molecule or a water cluster and the combined structure was further optimized by gaussian 16 w the compound optimization methods are described in the supplementary material text s3 finally a combination model of a sulfonamide molecule with an ice molecule or a water cluster was established 2 2 2 binding energy after determining the combined structure of a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or a water cluster the relationship between the energies of a sulfonamide molecule in ice and water media was calculated the binding energy was introduced as the energy difference between the single point energies of a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or water cluster and the energy of a formed interaction system to represent the force between the free molecules and the interaction system 49 50 as shown in eq 3 and eq 4 the higher the binding energy is the more energy is released upon binding and the more stable the system 3 e s i e s e i e s i 4 e s w e s e w e s w in the equations above e s is the optimized single point energy of a sulfonamide molecule kcal mol e i is the optimized single point energy of an ice molecule e w is the optimized single point energy of a water cluster and e s i e s w is the energy of the interacting system formed by an sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule water cluster 3 results and discussion after 96 h of progressive freezing treatment samples of water under ice and melted water were extracted and the concentrations of the sas in the samples were measured to determine the concentration distribution of sas in the ice water two phase fig 2a fig 2a shows that after 96 h of progressive freezing treatment the concentration of the sas in the water under ice increased in the order sd sp sm2 sq corresponding to 3 45 2 70 2 65 and 2 59 times the respective initial concentration respectively the highest concentration of sas in the water under ice was observed for sd at 344 8 Î¼g l during the progressive freezing process the increase in the sas concentration in the water under ice indicated that the sas migrated to the water under ice resulting in a decrease in the sas content of the ice body fig 2b shows that the residual rate of sas in the ice body was between 14 and 35 and the purification rate was between 65 and 86 the purification rate decreased in the order sd sp sm2 sq the purification rates of the different sas varied considerably which was mainly attributed to the different characteristics of the sas molecules in the ice water two phase a quantum chemical analysis was performed to gain an in depth understanding of the influence mechanism 4 purification mechanism of sulfonamide antibiotics during the progressive freezing process the research results presented above show that during progressive freezing the four sas were redistributed in the ice water two phase but the sas had different purification rates energy is the driving force for molecular motion and the freezing of water is often accompanied by energetic changes to explore the relationship between the difference in the sas purification rates and energy during progressive freezing the extreme points and electrostatic potential distribution of the sas molecules and the energy of sas molecules in the ice water two phase were calculated by gaussian 09 and multiwfn 4 1 extreme points and electrostatic potential distribution the extreme point distributions and electrostatic potential distributions of the four sas antibiotics an ice molecule and a water cluster were calculated using multiwfn as the results are shown in figs 3 6 fig 3a shows that the maximum point of the ice molecule was 77 73 kcal mol and mainly concentrated near the hydrogen atom farthest from the center point the minimum point of the ice molecule was 72 06 kcal mol and mainly concentrated near the oxygen atom farthest from the center point fig 3b shows that the maximum point of the water cluster was 73 37 kcal mol and mainly concentrated near the hydrogen atom farthest from the center and the minimum point of the water cluster was 64 00 kcal mol and mainly concentrated far from the center and in the presence of dense oxygen atoms the electrostatic potential of an atom is mainly related to the number of atomic charges the electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of positively negatively charged atoms was positive negative the distribution of surface electrostatic potential is related to its structure the ice molecule had a six membered chair structure composed of 20 water molecules with a uniform distribution the positive and negative electrostatic potentials were mainly distributed around the hydrogen and oxygen atoms respectively overlap between the electrostatic potential surfaces of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the ice molecule zeroed the internal electrostatic potential outside the ice molecule as the distance from the center point increased the effect of other atoms on the electrostatic potential diminished and the electrostatic potential increased therefore the maximum minimum electrostatic potential was distributed near the hydrogen oxygen atom farthest from the center point of the ice molecule the 20 molecules in the water cluster were unevenly distributed the electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of the water molecule depended on both the distance from the center point and the atomic density the larger the atomic density was the larger the electrostatic potential was therefore the electrostatic potential of a water cluster reached a maximum near the hydrogen atom farthest from the center point and reached a minimum far from the center where dense oxygen atoms were located the maximum and minimum points of sd were 43 80 kcal mol and 39 90 kcal mol respectively fig 4a the maximum and minimum points of sp were 42 40 kcal mol and 40 95 kcal mol respectively fig 4b the maximum and minimum points of sm2 were 43 12 kcal mol and 41 08 kcal mol respectively fig 4c the maximum and minimum points of sq were 44 95 kcal mol and 38 20 kcal mol respectively fig 4d fig 4 shows that the maximum minimum points of the four sas molecular were mainly concentrated near the hydrogen oxygen atom farthest from the center point the distributions of the extreme points of the sas can be understood analogously to the distributions of the extreme points of the ice molecule and water cluster fig 5a shows that the electrostatic potential for the ice molecule with a value range of 75 kcal mol 80 kcal mol the positive electrostatic potential was 320 2218 Ã¥ accounting for 49 7073 and the negative electrostatic potential was 298 1477 Ã¥ accounting for 50 2928 in general the electrostatic potential was relatively uniformly distributed over the surface area of the ice molecule fig 5b shows that the electrostatic potential for the water cluster with a value range of 65 kcal mol 75 kcal mol the positive electrostatic potential was 233 1255 Ã¥ accounting for 49 1172 and the negative electrostatic potential was 241 504 Ã¥ accounting for 50 8826 the electrostatic potential over the surface of the water cluster was mainly concentrated in the 20 kcal mol 25 kcal mol range accounting for 56 9148 of the cumulative electrostatic potential compared to ice molecules and water clusters the electrostatic potential range of the four sas antibiotics was relatively small as shown in fig 6 the electrostatic potential values of sd sp and sq ranged from 40 kj mol to 45 kj mol and that of sm2 ranged from 50 kj mol to 45 kj mol the order of electrostatic potential surface area was sq 307 7428 Ã¥ sm2 301 9625 Ã¥ sp 264 6194 Ã¥ sd 260 1041 Ã¥ and the proportion of positive area was sm2 54 0461 sd 50 6766 sp 48 8278 sq 47 99 the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of four sulfonamide antibiotics was relatively concentrated the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of sd was mainly concentrated at 15 kj mol 20 kj mol accounting for 73 9157 the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of sp was mainly concentrated at 10 kj mol 15 kj mol accounting for 74 302 the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of sm2 and sq were mainly concentrated at 15 kj mol 15 kj mol accounting for 68 2234 and 68 1057 respectively fig 5 and fig 6 show that the electrostatic potential distribution was most uniform for the ice molecule followed by the water cluster and was the same for the four sas the large electrostatic potential was less and the small electrostatic potential was more the largest range of extreme points was found for the ice molecule the range of extreme points for the water cluster was similar to that of the ice molecule and the four sas had the same ranges of extreme points the main reason for the aforementioned phenomenon was that the large volume large surface area and small atomic density of the ice structure resulted in weak interactions between atoms and a small overlap between the electrostatic potential surfaces the four sas had similar structures and atomic compositions resulting in similar extreme points and electrostatic potential distributions 4 2 binding energy of sulfonamide antibiotics in the ice and water phases after determining the electrostatic potential distribution of ice molecule water clusters and sas antibiotics close the sas antibiotic molecules to the electrostatic potential anisotropic surface of ice molecules water clusters the stable combination models of sas ice and sas water were obtained as the results are shown in fig 7 fig 8 we could find that the sas molecules were located near surfaces of the ice molecule and water cluster with oppositely charged electrostatic potentials the four sas molecules partially overlap with the ice molecule or water cluster indicating the existence of a force between the four sas molecules and the ice molecule or water cluster comparing the combination models of sas ice and sas water showed that the structure of sas ice was more regular than that of sas water as the ice molecule was more regularly shaped than the water cluster the electrostatic potential was uniformly distributed over the surface of the ice molecule and the force between atoms was equal when the combined structure was formed the sas water structure was irregular the shape of water cluster was irregular the distance between the atoms in the water cluster and the sas molecule was different thus the force between the molecules was affected by the electrostatic potential distribution and the distance between the molecules resulting in the formation of irregular combination models of a water cluster and a sulfonamide molecule 51 52 through gaussian calculation we obtained the energy of sulfonamide molecules ice molecule and water clusters as well as the energy of the combined model of sas ice and sas water the calculation results are shown in table 1 the results of a gaussian calculation showed that the sum of the monomer energies of a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or water cluster was higher than the energy of the sas ice or sas water combination models indicating that energy was released during the process of a sulfonamide antibiotic molecule combining with an ice molecule or water cluster in addition the binding energies of the four sas ice models were smaller than those of the sas water models that is a small quantity of energy was released when a sulfonamide molecule combined with an ice molecule and a large quantity of energy was released when a sulfonamide molecule combined with a water cluster the larger the energy release was the more stable the structure of the formed compound was as a result of the energy difference between the two models all four sas molecules tended to combine with the water cluster rather than the ice molecule therefore during progressive freezing sas molecules migrate to the water under ice thereby achieving separation in the ice water two phase table 2 shows the binding energies of four sas molecules when they combine with ice molecule and water molecules respectively among them sm2 exhibited the largest energy of binding with the ice molecule among the four sas molecules at 24 4698 kcal mol sq exhibited the smallest energy of binding with the ice molecule among the four sas at 18 522 kcal mol the binding energy decreased in the order sm2 sp sd sq sm2 exhibited the largest energy of binding with the water cluster among the four sas at 25 647 kcal mol sq exhibited the smallest energy of binding with the water cluster among the four sas at 19 638 kcal mol the binding energy decreased in the order sm2 sp sd sq during the freezing process sulfonamide molecules combine with water clusters and ice molecules at the same time creating competition between water clusters and ice molecules therefore we don t just have to think about the binding energy of sas molecules when they combine with ice molecule or water molecules but also the difference between them the larger the difference between the binding energies of the sas ice molecule and sas water cluster is the easier it is for a sulfonamide molecule to break away from an ice molecule and combine with a water cluster the correlation between the difference in binding energy and purification rate of four sas antibiotics was explored the pearson correlation r was 0 999 p 0 01 indicating a strong positive correlation between binding energy and purification rate the greater the binding energy difference the greater the purification rate the difference in the binding energies of the sas with the ice and water in the ice water two phase caused the differences in the purification rates of the sas during progressive freezing this result is consistent with the study on the migration of organic pollutants with different functional groups during suspension freezing by peng et al 42 5 conclusion the mixed solution of four sas was subjected to progressive freezing treatment for 96 h and it was found that the concentration of sas antibiotics in the water increased to varying degrees the concentration of sas in the water under ice reached 259 02 Î¼g l 344 8 Î¼g l which is 2 59 3 44 times that of the original solution and the purification rates of the four sas were 65 86 indicating that progressive freezing was an effective separation method for the sas waste liquid the purification rates of the different sas varied the purification rate decreased in the order sd sp sm2 sq quantum chemical calculations revealed that the separation of sas in the ice water two phase was mainly related to the binding energy and the purification rate was related to the difference in these binding energies for the sulfonamide molecules in the ice water two phase the larger the difference in the binding energies between a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or water cluster in the ice water two phase the easier it was for a sulfonamide molecule to migrate to the water phase this study provides a novel method for the removal of sulfonamide pollutants in water and provides a novel mechanism for the removal of pollutants during the freezing process declaration

control valve was closed the analytical instrument was an ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometer uplc esi ms ms acquity uplc tqd and the chromatographic column was an acquitytm uplc ben c8 column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 Î¼m the detailed equipment operation parameters and the gradient elution procedure are shown in the supplementary material text s1and table s2 respectively 2 1 3 experimental design studies have shown that the sulfonamide antibiotic concentrations exceeding 100 Î¼g l are toxic to microorganisms 16 therefore the experiment was carried out using a 100 Î¼g l aqueous solution of sas and the water depth of solution was set at 25 cm the stock solution was diluted with ultrapure water to prepare a 100 Î¼g l standard solution then 10 l of the standard solution the water depth of 25 cm were placed in an ice simulator and frozen in a 15 c low temperature test box the total freezing time was 96 h and the icing ratio was 75 after 96 h of freezing samples of the sa antibiotics were extracted from the water under ice by a sampler the ice and water were separated and the ice body was removed and melted at a constant temperature of 25 c to obtain a melted water sample the samples of water under ice and melted water samples were filtered through a 0 22 Î¼m membrane and then detected by uplc esi ms ms the residue rate r reflects the residue of the sas in ice and is calculated as the ratio of the mass of the sas in the ice after the 96 h freezing experiment to the total mass of the sas in the initial solution 1 r c i v i c 0 v 0 100 where c i and v i represent the concentration of the sas in the ice and the volume of ice after freezing for 96 h respectively and c 0 and v 0 represent the initial concentration of the sas and the initial volume of the aqueous solution respectively the purification rate p reflects the quantity of sas separated from ice and is calculated as the ratio of the mass of the sas separated from ice after the 96 h freezing experiment to the total mass of sas in the initial solution 2 p 1 r 2 2 quantum chemical calculation 2 2 1 molecular model to explore the purification mechanism of sas during the freezing process ice and water were regarded as two media and a single sulfonamide molecule was combined with an ice molecule or a water cluster the artificial ice ih molecular structure was adopted for ice the same number 20 of molecules were used in a water cluster as in the ice molecule and the sas molecules were downloaded from chemical book https www chemicalbook com productindex aspx to ensure that the most stable structure of a sulfonamide molecule combined with an ice molecule or a water cluster the structures of the ice molecule water cluster and sulfonamides molecules were optimized and the extreme points and electrostatic potential distributions of the individual molecules were found 48 the optimization methods are described in the supplementary material text s2 then the maximum point minimum point of the electrostatic potential of a sulfonamide molecule was combined with the minimum point maximum point of the electrostatic potential of an ice molecule or a water cluster and the combined structure was further optimized by gaussian 16 w the compound optimization methods are described in the supplementary material text s3 finally a combination model of a sulfonamide molecule with an ice molecule or a water cluster was established 2 2 2 binding energy after determining the combined structure of a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or a water cluster the relationship between the energies of a sulfonamide molecule in ice and water media was calculated the binding energy was introduced as the energy difference between the single point energies of a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or water cluster and the energy of a formed interaction system to represent the force between the free molecules and the interaction system 49 50 as shown in eq 3 and eq 4

the interacting system formed by an sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule water cluster 3 results and discussion after 96 h of progressive freezing treatment samples of water under ice and melted water were extracted and the concentrations of the sas in the samples were measured to determine the concentration distribution of sas in the ice water two phase fig 2a fig 2a shows that after 96 h of progressive freezing treatment the concentration of the sas in the water under ice increased in the order sd sp sm2 sq corresponding to 3 45 2 70 2 65 and 2 59 times the respective initial concentration respectively the highest concentration of sas in the water under ice was observed for sd at 344 8 Î¼g l during the progressive freezing process the increase in the sas concentration in the water under ice indicated that the sas migrated to the water under ice resulting in a decrease in the sas content of the ice body fig 2b shows that the residual rate of sas in the ice body was between 14 and 35 and the purification rate was between 65 and 86 the purification rate decreased in the order sd sp sm2 sq the purification rates of the different sas varied considerably which was mainly attributed to the different characteristics of the sas molecules in the ice water two phase a quantum chemical analysis was performed to gain an in depth understanding of the influence mechanism 4 purification mechanism of sulfonamide antibiotics during the progressive freezing process the research results presented above show that during progressive freezing the four sas were redistributed in the ice water two phase but the sas had different purification rates energy is the driving force for molecular motion and the freezing of water is often accompanied by energetic changes to explore the relationship between the difference in the sas purification rates and energy during progressive freezing the extreme points and electrostatic potential distribution of the sas molecules and the energy of sas molecules in the ice water two phase were calculated by gaussian 09 and multiwfn 4 1 extreme points and electrostatic potential distribution the extreme point distributions and electrostatic potential distributions of the four sas antibiotics an ice molecule and a water cluster were calculated using multiwfn as the results are shown in figs 3 6 fig 3a shows that the maximum point of the ice molecule was 77 73 kcal mol and mainly concentrated near the hydrogen atom farthest from the center point the minimum point of the ice molecule was 72 06 kcal mol and mainly concentrated near the oxygen atom farthest from the center point fig 3b shows that the maximum point of the water cluster was 73 37 kcal mol and mainly concentrated near the hydrogen atom farthest from the center and the minimum point of the water cluster was 64 00 kcal mol and mainly concentrated far from the center and in the presence of dense oxygen atoms the electrostatic potential of an atom is mainly related to the number of atomic charges the electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of positively negatively charged atoms was positive negative the distribution of surface electrostatic potential is related to its structure the ice molecule had a six membered chair structure composed of 20 water molecules with a uniform distribution the positive and negative electrostatic potentials were mainly distributed around the hydrogen and oxygen atoms respectively overlap between the electrostatic potential surfaces of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the ice molecule zeroed the internal electrostatic potential outside the ice molecule as the distance from the center point increased the effect of other atoms on the electrostatic potential diminished and the electrostatic potential increased therefore the maximum minimum electrostatic potential was distributed near the hydrogen oxygen atom farthest from the center point of the ice molecule the 20 molecules in the water cluster were unevenly distributed the electrostatic potential distribution on the surface of the water molecule depended on both the distance from the center point and the atomic density the larger the atomic density was the larger the electrostatic potential was therefore the electrostatic potential of a water cluster reached a maximum near the hydrogen atom farthest from the center point and reached a minimum far from the center where dense oxygen atoms were located the maximum and minimum points of sd were 43 80 kcal mol and 39 90 kcal mol respectively fig 4a the maximum and minimum points of sp were 42 40 kcal mol and 40 95 kcal mol respectively fig 4b the maximum and minimum points of sm2 were 43 12 kcal mol and 41 08 kcal mol respectively fig 4c the maximum and minimum points of sq were 44 95 kcal mol and 38 20 kcal mol respectively fig 4d fig 4 shows that the maximum minimum points of the four sas molecular were mainly concentrated near the hydrogen oxygen atom farthest from the center point the distributions of the extreme points of the sas can be understood analogously to the distributions of the extreme points of the ice molecule and water cluster fig 5a shows that the electrostatic potential for the ice molecule with a value range of 75 kcal mol 80 kcal mol the positive electrostatic potential was 320 2218 Ã¥ accounting for 49 7073 and the negative electrostatic potential was 298 1477 Ã¥ accounting for 50 2928 in general the electrostatic potential was relatively uniformly distributed over the surface area of the ice molecule fig 5b shows that the electrostatic potential for the water cluster with a value range of 65 kcal mol 75 kcal mol the positive electrostatic potential was 233 1255 Ã¥ accounting for 49 1172 and the negative electrostatic potential was 241 504 Ã¥ accounting for 50 8826 the electrostatic potential over the surface of the water cluster was mainly concentrated in the 20 kcal mol 25 kcal mol range accounting for 56 9148 of the cumulative electrostatic potential compared to ice molecules and water clusters the electrostatic potential range of the four sas antibiotics was relatively small as shown in fig 6 the electrostatic potential values of sd sp and sq ranged from 40 kj mol to 45 kj mol and that of sm2 ranged from 50 kj mol to 45 kj mol the order of electrostatic potential surface area was sq 307 7428 Ã¥ sm2 301 9625 Ã¥ sp 264 6194 Ã¥ sd 260 1041 Ã¥ and the proportion of positive area was sm2 54 0461 sd 50 6766 sp 48 8278 sq 47 99 the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of four sulfonamide antibiotics was relatively concentrated the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of sd was mainly concentrated at 15 kj mol 20 kj mol accounting for 73 9157 the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of sp was mainly concentrated at 10 kj mol 15 kj mol accounting for 74 302 the electrostatic potential surface area distribution of sm2 and sq were mainly concentrated at 15 kj mol 15 kj mol accounting for 68 2234 and 68 1057 respectively fig 5 and fig 6 show that the electrostatic potential distribution was most uniform for the ice molecule followed by the water cluster and was the same for the four sas the large electrostatic potential was less and the small electrostatic potential was more the largest range of extreme points was found for the ice molecule the range of extreme points for the water cluster was similar to that of the ice molecule and the four sas had the same ranges of extreme points the main reason for the aforementioned phenomenon was that the large volume large surface area and small atomic density of the ice structure resulted in weak interactions between atoms and a small overlap between the electrostatic potential surfaces the four sas had similar structures and atomic compositions resulting in similar extreme points and electrostatic potential distributions 4 2 binding energy of sulfonamide antibiotics in the ice and water phases after determining the electrostatic potential distribution of ice molecule water clusters and sas antibiotics close the sas antibiotic molecules to the electrostatic potential anisotropic surface of ice molecules water clusters the stable combination models of sas ice and sas water were obtained as the results are shown in fig 7 fig 8 we could find that the sas molecules were located near surfaces of the ice molecule and water cluster with oppositely charged electrostatic potentials the four sas molecules partially overlap with the ice molecule or water cluster indicating the existence of a force between the four sas molecules and the ice molecule or water cluster comparing the combination models of sas ice and sas water showed that the structure of sas ice was more regular than that of sas water as the ice molecule was more regularly shaped than the water cluster the electrostatic potential was uniformly distributed over the surface of the ice molecule and the force between atoms was equal when the combined structure was formed the sas water structure was irregular the shape of water cluster was irregular the distance between the atoms in the water cluster and the sas molecule was different thus the force between the molecules was affected by the electrostatic potential distribution and the distance between the molecules resulting in the formation of irregular combination models of a water cluster and a sulfonamide molecule 51 52 through gaussian calculation we obtained the energy of sulfonamide molecules ice molecule and water clusters as well as the energy of the combined model of sas ice and sas water the calculation results are shown in table 1 the results of a gaussian calculation showed that the sum of the monomer energies of a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or water cluster was higher than the energy of the sas ice or sas water combination models indicating that energy was released during the process of a sulfonamide antibiotic molecule combining with an ice molecule or water cluster in addition the binding energies of the four sas ice models were smaller than those of the sas water models that is a small quantity of energy was released when a sulfonamide molecule combined with an ice molecule and a large quantity of energy was released when a sulfonamide molecule combined with a water cluster the larger the energy release was the more stable the structure of the formed compound was as a result of the energy difference between the two models all four sas molecules tended to combine with the water cluster rather than the ice molecule therefore during progressive freezing sas molecules migrate to the water under ice thereby achieving separation in the ice water two phase table 2 shows the binding energies of four sas molecules when they combine with ice molecule and water molecules respectively among them sm2 exhibited the largest energy of binding with the ice molecule among the four sas molecules at 24 4698 kcal mol sq exhibited the smallest energy of binding with the ice molecule among the four sas at 18 522 kcal mol the binding energy decreased in the order sm2 sp sd sq sm2 exhibited the largest energy of binding with the water cluster among the four sas at 25 647 kcal mol sq exhibited the smallest energy of binding with the water cluster among the four sas at 19 638 kcal mol the binding energy decreased in the order sm2 sp sd sq during the freezing process sulfonamide molecules combine with water clusters and ice molecules at the same time creating competition between water clusters and ice molecules therefore we don t just have to think about the binding energy of sas molecules when they combine with ice molecule or water molecules but also the difference between them the larger the difference between the binding energies of the sas ice molecule and sas water cluster is the easier it is for a sulfonamide molecule to break away from an ice molecule and combine with a water cluster the correlation between the difference in binding energy and purification rate of four sas antibiotics was explored the pearson correlation r was 0 999 p 0 01 indicating a strong positive correlation between binding energy and purification rate the greater the binding energy difference the greater the purification rate the difference in the binding energies of the sas with the ice and water in the ice water two phase caused the differences in the purification rates of the sas during progressive freezing this result is consistent with the study on the migration of organic pollutants with different functional groups during suspension freezing by peng et al 42 5 conclusion the mixed solution of four sas was subjected to progressive freezing treatment for 96 h and it was found that the concentration of sas antibiotics in the water increased to varying degrees the concentration of sas in the water under ice reached 259 02 Î¼g l 344 8 Î¼g l which is 2 59 3 44 times that of the original solution and the purification rates of the four sas were 65 86 indicating that progressive freezing was an effective separation method for the sas waste liquid the purification rates of the different sas varied the purification rate decreased in the order sd sp sm2 sq quantum chemical calculations revealed that the separation of sas in the ice water two phase was mainly related to the binding energy and the purification rate was related to the difference in these binding energies for the sulfonamide molecules in the ice water two phase the larger the difference in the binding energies between a sulfonamide molecule and an ice molecule or water cluster in the ice water two phase the easier it was for a sulfonamide molecule to migrate to the water phase this study provides a novel method for the removal of sulfonamide pollutants in water and provides a novel mechanism for the removal of pollutants during the freezing process declaration
