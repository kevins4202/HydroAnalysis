24435,artificial reefs play a key functional role in marine ecosystem recovery and particularly in the rebuilding of fish populations however improving the reef design for viscous egg spawning fish is very challenging viscous eggs must adhere to a substrate to continue the hatching process i e increasing the egg adhesion rate of the reef makes it a better fish spawning habitat therefore the movement characteristics of viscous fish eggs in an artificial reef are a vital issue in marine ecology in this study a vertical two dimensional lattice boltzmann method was developed to simulate the complex hydraulic field in a reef zone and to predict the movement of fish eggs as affected by the hydrographic environment a particle image velocimetry experiment on fish egg transportation was carried out to validate the model these results revealed the effects of different hydrodynamic conditions on the migration of sticky eggs in the reef zone to promote the sustainable development of fisheries and restore the marine ecology keywords artificial reef fish eggs numerical simulation egg transport adhesion locations flow field effect 1 introduction overfishing and nearshore marine aquaculture have increased dramatically with the increasing human demand for marine resources this has led to the destruction of fish habitat exhaustion of ocean resources and degradation of the marine ecological system jackson et al 2001 scheffer et al 2005 posing a serious threat to the sustainable development of the marine environment artificial reefs with different design patterns produce various flow fields and help achieve natural reef ecology pybas and seaman 1994 many studies have used numerical models to better understand the flow field influenced by the shape and structure of reefs the flow field effect is one of the most important hydrodynamic parameters in the reef zone as it causes desirable characteristics in the surrounding water e g upwelling acceleration of flow and vortices these area of different flow not only attract jet flow or slow flow preferring fish but provide growth and developmental areas for fish eggs and larvae cheung et al 2009 the flow field effect also accelerates ocean water exchange from the lower level to the upper level and increases the bait concentration promoting optimization of the local ecological environment and fish aggregation walker et al 2002 suenaga et al 2001 observed the upwelling and eddy currents near reefs in a water tank experiment and reported that these currents affect fish eggs and larvae logan and lowe 2019 studied the space use and the oviposition behavior of three kinds of bass influenced by artificial reefs through passive acoustic measurements they showed that the flow field characteristic varied to meet the requirements of the fish species in addition previous studies have investigated the flow field effect in artificial reefs using experimental and mathematical models dong et al 2010 analyzed the variations in the seabed terrain condition affected by the hydrodynamic flow field around hollow square artificial reefs jiang et al 2016 simulated the flow field of frame square reefs with a guide plate and demonstrated the high impact of the guide plate pang et al 2017 analyzed the flow field characteristics of three hollow typed reefs with a 20 void rate observing the vortex area formed by the resisting effect of these three fish reefs and reporting that the optimal flow field effect appeared in the box typed reef zone artificial reefs play an important role in improving sticky egg spawning fish habitat sticky eggs usually possess higher viscosity on the surface and are denser than water in general sticky fish eggs are more sensitive to the environment and their hatching process requires sticking to aquatic plants gravel shells rocks or other objects using the mucus or the sticky silk on the surface of the egg membrane zhang 1985 high velocity in the local area is unfavorable for eggs to attach and hatch and leading to a reduced biomass of sticky egg spawning fish artificial reefs help improve the ecological environment in reef areas and form good fish breeding habitats effectively increasing local aquatic biomass particularly in the fast flowing region reefs vary the hydrodynamic conditions of the inner space and provide a hatching location for viscous eggs many studies have employed numerical migration modeling to explore the transport characteristics of fish eggs in complex hydrodynamic conditions lin et al 2015 fish eggs are passive floating particles in the water and their movements highly depend on the hydrodynamic conditions and the biological characteristics of the body of water they inhabit martins et al 2007 studied egg migration characteristics in the brazilian patos lagoon estuary with two dimensional shallow water equations and the particle tracking method zhao et al 2010 established an eulerian lagrangian model to simulate the migration of floating eggs in a three dimensional flow field and predicted the movement characteristics of yellowcheck carp eggs downstream in the jinsha river wang et al 2012 employed the lagrange model to simulate the migration of chinese sturgeon eggs and predicted their spawning grounds garcia et al 2013 simulated four egg migration movements using the lagrange tracking model and predicted the distribution of fish eggs according to these previous studies the migration characteristics of fish eggs have been mainly investigated in rivers or aquaria rather than in a reef zone therefore revealing the movement characteristics of viscous fish eggs under the influence of reef structures is important to evaluate the artificial reef design as a spawning ground and an ecological restoration site the lattice boltzmann lb method served as the modeling framework in this study the lb method is a reliable mesoscopic numerical method that uses a simple form to follow the movement rule of microparticles and determine the macroscopic flow characteristics zhou 2004 liu et al 2015 this method is superior for use in complicated terrain with irregular boundaries and is simple to implement in parallel computing mei et al 2006 ding et al 2018 it is also easy to couple with the lagrangian tracking module by leveraging the euler lagrange inborn nature chen and doolen 1998 in this study the lb model was established to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics and the migration of fish eggs in an artificial reef zone under ocean current conditions the model was validated by the experimental results provided by the particle image velocimetry piv technique which was carried out in a water flume 2 governing equations 2 1 the navier stokes equations two dimensional vertical flow

width height water flume the inflow discharge was controlled by a pump system set to 30 l s with a 0 4 m water depth the frame typed reef was typical and widely used in marine fisheries for its fish attracting effect among them the cubic frame typed reef block with a culture cage fixed in the center fig 2 a is multifunctional and was used in this study the vertical profile of the reef is demonstrated in fig 2 b the cut opening ratio cor was defined as the ratio of the aperture area to the projected area of the reef block in the direction perpendicular to the incoming flow direction and was 0 45 for this reef considering that many frame typed reefs have been placed on the sea bottom only the vertical profile is of concern a row of reefs was generalized into the structure shown in fig 3 the artificial reef was constructed of acrylic the experimental reef is scaled down by 1 20 the maximum current velocity is 0 55 m s in the reef region of the yellow and bohai sea of china according to the froude similarity law the inflow velocity of the experiment was set to 0 10 m s the artificial reef was fixed to the bottom of the flume 10 m away from the entrance the flow distribution was analyzed by the piv and the set up is shown in fig 4 after the model stabilized 100 images within 6 67 s were recorded with a camera and the flow field was obtained with dynamic studio software 4 1 2 computational domain and parameters a vertical two dimensional numerical model was set up in a 1 1 0 4 m water flume the water depth was constant at 0 4 m the zero gradient condition was set at the upper and right boundaries the bounce back condition was set at the lower boundary and the solid boundary the water level at the inflow boundary was 40 cm the velocity at the entrance was 0 1 m s according to the froude law of similarity the computational domain was divided into 440 160 lattices the time interval δ t was 0 0025 s and the relaxation time was 0 5002 the reef block was fixed to the bottom of the flume 0 5 m away from the inlet fig 4 4 1 3 results after the simulation stabilized 150 000 iterations the vector diagram of the computational domain is presented in fig 5 the flow field at the front of the reef block was barely affected then the flow direction was varied and generated an upwelling after encountering the reef wall the maximum upwelling velocity was 87 of the mean inflow velocity subsequently the velocity slowed when the water passed through the block and vortices formed at the rear of the reef fig 6 the regions of upwelling and vortex are key indicators of the hydrodynamic impact of the reef the upwelling region referred to the area there the velocity was 5 of the inflow velocity in the y direction the vortex region is the area where the velocity was 70 of the inflow velocity in the x direction the upwelling area and the vortex area produced by a single reef block in the flow field were 0 18 m 2 and 0 12 m 2 respectively eleven gauging points fig 7 distributed around the reef were selected fig 8 shows that the simulation results were consistent with the experimental values the mean relative error of the flow velocity was 8 6 a strong vortex produces errors at points close to the reef in the middle part of the flow field fig 9 the density of the piv tracking particles was slightly less than that of water weakening the particle velocity in the flow field and causing inaccuracy 4 2 verification of the fish egg tracking model 4 2 1 experimental setup the hydrodynamic conditions were the same as described in section 4 1 ten reef blocks were placed in the research area fig 10 to determine the migration of sticky fish eggs in the collection of artificial reefs and the first reef was 10 m away from the entrance to the flume the camera is projected to focus on the first two reefs to detect the eggs in the water flume about 2 000 fish eggs were uniformly released from a dropper into the flume just to the left side of the first reef 0 01 m lower than the top of the reef the initial position of the eggs is nearly the same as the range of the blue region in fig 12 as a result of extrusion from the dropper the fish eggs are dyed in red ink to facilitate identification in a photograph fig 11 the red ink maintained the activity characteristics of the idiosome and the structural integrity of the external protonema guaranteeing the attachment process between the fish egg and the reef surface 4 2 2 computational domain and parameters the basic settings were the same as described in section 4 1 ten reef blocks were placed in the research area and the computational domain was increased accordingly the egg diameter was 1 mm the eggs were slightly denser than water at 1 040 kg m 3 the trajectories of the eggs were predicted by the particle transport module coupled with the hydrodynamic module in the lb framework after the model stabilized 650 fish eggs were released from the blue region and time was started 4 2 3 results the snapshots of the fish eggs are shown in fig 13 the experimental data were digitized to display the positions of the eggs as it was difficult to observe newly released eggs due to the previously released eggs the distribution of the simulated eggs was constant with the experiments fig 14 the eggs moved from the initial position and were mostly concentrated in the northeast quadrant of the first reef within 1 s after 0 67 s the range of egg distribution extended to northwest corner of the second reef then the eggs gradually occupied the entire field of the second reef during 2 33 3 s the simulated trajectories of the eggs are demonstrated in fig 15 the eggs were driven by the water flow and the majority adhered to the reef surface and the bottom the computational domain was divided into 12 regions from left to right and the distribution of fish eggs obtained from the experiment is shown in fig 16 after release a small number of eggs remained in the forepart of the reef area more than half of the eggs adhered to the first three reef blocks more than 80 of the eggs were blocked in the first six reefs about one tenth of the eggs were transported through this reef region the distribution of the final adhered position according to the numerical model declined gradually along the x axis fig 17 the mean absolute difference in this distribution between the model and the experiment was 3 possibly because the same actual eggs stuck together and these cohesive eggs were not easily captured by the reefs the main sources of the uncertainty in this numerical model include 1 the variation of the inflow velocity in nature 2 the simplification of the real three dimensional problem to the two dimensional model and 3 the errors in measurement data processing and model conversion 4 3 effect of the cut opening ratio cor the cor of the reef is the area ratio between the cut opening area and the total area of the upstream face the hydrodynamic effect and egg transport in the reefs with four cors such as a 0 75 b 0 55 c 0 35 and d 0 15 were investigated fig 18 demonstrates the lateral views of the reef blocks with different cors the hydrodynamic condition and the reef arrangement are identical to section 4 2 the flow field characteristics based on the simulation are shown in fig 19 the vector diagram depicts the cor of a reef that produced a non ignorable effect on the flow field initially the current was slow after entering the reef region hindered by the reef surface a part of the flow tended to go upwards then velocity declined and a vortex region formed at the rear of the reef with the increase in the cor its influence on the upward flow increased gradually fig 20 shows the nonlinear relationship of the flow field characteristics with different cors except cor 0 75 the upwelling and vortex areas reduces with an decrease in the cor reaching the largest when cor 0 55 the ratio of the maximum upwelling velocity and the inflow velocity fell in the range of 1 1 1 68 and was the largest when the cor 0 55 we concluded that the reefs with a cor 0 55 produced better upward and vortex flow the adhered locations of the fish eggs are shown in fig 21 the number of adhered eggs declined generally from the fore to the rear part cor 0 55 was characterized by a low relative deviation of 8 the deviations were slightly larger for cor 0 75 and 0 35 at 10 while the deviation for cor 0 15 was 15 to ensure the best adhering effect the reefs with cor 0 55 achieved a better ecological effect considering the dispersed location of the fish eggs the variation of the adhesion position can be described by the probability distribution function pdf which is obtained by discrete binned gaussian kraskov ksg and kernel models li and convertino 2021 in this study the discrete model is used to predict the distribution function and the function is defined as f x p x in which p is the probability measure x 0 1 5 is horizontal position of fish egg adhesion based on the results of scenario 2 the pdf with spatial variation is demonstrated in fig 22 there are about 50 eggs adhered in the first two reefs and over 90 eggs adhered in the first six reefs meanwhile less than 0 8 eggs migrated through the reef region 4 4 sensitivity analysis the velocity at the entrance u e has a profound effect on egg transport therefore a sensitivity analysis of inlet velocity was conducted in this study simulations of the effects of different inlet velocities on the egg distribution were carried out the results showed that the egg adhering percentages was sensitive to the inflow velocity fig 23 overall the inlet flow rate showed a negative correlation with egg adhesion rate when the inflow velocity was lowered by 40 and 20 the egg adhering percentages in these selected reefs were increased by 7 and 4 respectively when the inflow velocity was risen by 20 and 40 the egg adhering percentages were reduced by 2 and 4 respectively 5 conclusion in this study the lb model was developed to show the flow field characteristics in the reef zone and the transport of viscous fish eggs the numerical model was verified by the data obtained during a piv experiment this verification demonstrates that this numerical model is a reliable tool to predict fish egg transport in a complex aquatic environment the hydrodynamic and cumulative effects of reef blocks were investigated regarding various cors the relationship between the cors of the reef block and its effects was nonlinear these results indicate that a reef with cor 0 55 had a clear impact on the hydrodynamic conditions and formed a more suitable hatching habitat for viscous fish eggs credit authorship contribution statement yu ding writing original draft

northeast quadrant of the first reef within 1 s after 0 67 s the range of egg distribution extended to northwest corner of the second reef then the eggs gradually occupied the entire field of the second reef during 2 33 3 s the simulated trajectories of the eggs are demonstrated in fig 15 the eggs were driven by the water flow and the majority adhered to the reef surface and the bottom the computational domain was divided into 12 regions from left to right and the distribution of fish eggs obtained from the experiment is shown in fig 16 after release a small number of eggs remained in the forepart of the reef area more than half of the eggs adhered to the first three reef blocks more than 80 of the eggs were blocked in the first six reefs about one tenth of the eggs were transported through this reef region the distribution of the final adhered position according to the numerical model declined gradually along the x axis fig 17 the mean absolute difference in this distribution between the model and the experiment was 3 possibly because the same actual eggs stuck together and these cohesive eggs were not easily captured by the reefs the main sources of the uncertainty in this numerical model include 1 the variation of the inflow velocity in nature 2 the simplification of the real three dimensional problem to the two dimensional model and 3 the errors in measurement data processing and model conversion 4 3 effect of the cut opening ratio cor the cor of the reef is the area ratio between the cut opening area and the total area of the upstream face the hydrodynamic effect and egg transport in the reefs with four cors such as a 0 75 b 0 55 c 0 35 and d 0 15 were investigated fig 18 demonstrates the lateral views of the reef blocks with different cors the hydrodynamic condition and the reef arrangement are identical to section 4 2 the flow field characteristics based on the simulation are shown in fig 19 the vector diagram depicts the cor of a reef that produced a non ignorable effect on the flow field initially the current was slow after entering the reef region hindered by the reef surface a part of the flow tended to go upwards then velocity declined and a vortex region formed at the rear of the reef with the increase in the cor its influence on the upward flow increased gradually fig 20 shows the nonlinear relationship of the flow field characteristics with different cors except cor 0 75 the upwelling and vortex areas reduces with an decrease in the cor reaching the largest when cor 0 55 the ratio of the maximum upwelling velocity and the inflow velocity fell in the range of 1 1 1 68 and was the largest when the cor 0 55 we concluded that the reefs with a cor 0 55 produced better upward and vortex flow the adhered locations of the fish eggs are shown in fig 21 the number of adhered eggs declined generally from the fore to the rear part cor 0 55 was characterized by a low relative deviation of 8 the deviations were slightly larger for cor 0 75 and 0 35 at 10 while the deviation for cor 0 15 was 15 to ensure the best adhering effect the reefs with cor 0 55 achieved a better ecological effect considering the dispersed location of the fish eggs the variation of the adhesion position can be described by the probability distribution function pdf which is obtained by discrete binned gaussian kraskov ksg and kernel models li and convertino 2021 in this study the discrete model is used to predict the distribution function and the function is defined as f x p x in which p is the probability measure x 0 1 5 is horizontal position of fish egg adhesion based on the results of scenario 2 the pdf with spatial variation is demonstrated in fig 22 there are about 50 eggs adhered in the first two reefs and over 90 eggs adhered in the first six reefs meanwhile less than 0 8 eggs migrated through the reef region 4 4 sensitivity analysis the velocity at the entrance u e has a profound effect on egg transport therefore a sensitivity analysis of inlet velocity was conducted in this study simulations of the effects of different inlet velocities on the egg distribution were carried out the results showed that the egg adhering percentages was sensitive to the inflow velocity fig 23 overall the inlet flow rate showed a negative correlation with egg adhesion rate when the inflow velocity was lowered by 40 and 20 the egg adhering percentages in these selected reefs were increased by 7 and 4 respectively when the inflow velocity was risen by 20 and 40 the egg adhering percentages were reduced by 2 and 4 respectively 5 conclusion in this study the lb model was developed to show the flow field characteristics in the reef zone and the transport of viscous fish eggs the numerical model was verified by the data obtained during a piv experiment this verification demonstrates that this numerical model is a reliable tool to predict fish egg transport in a complex aquatic environment the hydrodynamic and cumulative effects of reef blocks were investigated regarding various cors the relationship between the cors of the reef block and its effects was nonlinear these results indicate that a reef with cor 0 55 had a clear impact on the hydrodynamic conditions and formed a more suitable hatching habitat for viscous fish eggs credit authorship contribution statement yu ding writing original draft

24436,latitudinal variations in species niche due to factors such as phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation pose fundamental problems for ecological niche modelling at large geographic scales species adaptation to varying climates across latitudes thus necessitates the latitudinal adjustment of climatic variables for incorporation into more accurate models of habitat suitability and species distribution previous studies have identified changes in species elevational distributions across latitudes however few studies incorporate latitude adjusted variables into suitability or distribution models in this study we utilized generalized additive models gams to adjust bioclimatic variables by latitude in order to remove latitudinal variation in ecological niche models we incorporated these latitude adjusted variables into maximum entropy maxent models of two species of toad bufo sachalinensis previously bufo gargarizans and bufo stejnegeri in northeast asia we additionally identified thresholds in bioclimatic and terrain variables that delineate boundaries between the two bufo species where their ranges overlap we found that gam adjustment of bioclimatic variables effectively removed latitudinal variation in said variables maxent models incorporating these latitude adjusted variables had significantly improved model fit auc and tss for both bufo species we identified a potential sympatric area shared by the two species and delineated a geographic boundary thresholding the probable presence of one species over the other this study shows a clear improvement for distribution models with the inclusion of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables for both narrow and wide ranging species this has implications for future distribution modelling practices especially for geographically widespread species and has potential for modelling species distributions in climate change scenarios further the methodology for delimiting species thresholds has future use in modelling contact zones of related species graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords maximum entropy model latitudinal adjustment species distribution northeast asia toad 1 introduction species ranges have been shown to be affected by environmental variables along a latitudinal gradient as a response to changing bioclimatic conditions along those gradients brock and inman 2006 ecologically speaking adaptation occurs when resource use changes to match availability dobzhansky 1968 if there is a climatic gradient across latitudes a species will exhibit some degree of adaptation to match that gradient likely depending on how widespread it is for instance a relationship between latitude and distribution was found in the northeastern united states with catharus bicknelli bicknell s thrush whose lower elevational limit has been observed to decrease by 81 63 m per degree of latitude lambert et al 2005 in a study of gulo gulo wolverines in finland copeland et al 2010 demonstrated that for average maximum august temperature across 14 of latitude use of the bioclimatic variable by the species followed the average of availability or the available range of the bioclimatic variable at higher latitudes and diverged from the average at lower latitudes due to a range of environmental conditions including abiotic and biotic factors a species is unlikely to occupy the full range of climatic conditions across its distribution as evidenced by tree species which favour a peaked suitability hypothesis wherein species occupancy is proportional to the suitability index and peaks at the species optimum boucher lalonde et al 2012 additionally phenotypic plasticity specifies that a species can express different phenotypes in order to tolerate varying environmental conditions fox et al 2019 although phenotypic plasticity does not translate directly to adaptation schilthuizen and kellermann 2014 it can allow a species to colonize and endure conditions in novel habitats and is particularly advantageous to species at higher latitudes which experience greater climatic variation than those at lower latitudes this positive correlation between phenotypic plasticity and latitude has been observed in an invasive plant taraxacum officinale molina montenegro and naya 2012 and copepods pereira et al 2017 in addition to phenotypic plasticity species may also exhibit local adaptation corresponding to climate or latitude as in panicum virgatum vascular plant casler et al 2004 viola reichenbachiana and aesculus hippocastanum vascular plants tryjanowski et al 2006 and rana temporaria common brown frog liess et al 2013 according to rapoport s rule species found at higher latitudes will have a larger geographic range than those found at lower latitudes stevens 1989 this is because higher latitudes have greater climatic variability so an organism found at high latitudes will be adapted to and experience a wider range of climatic conditions than lower latitude species stevens 1989 this pattern is found in many taxa including reptiles and amphibians in north america conant 1958 stevens 1989 and rapoport s rule has been demonstrated more recently in snakes böhm et al 2017 but is shown to be more regional than global for amphibians whitton et al 2012 although adaptation and plasticity across latitudinal gradients are important for species physiology few species distribution or habitat modelling techniques consider species adaptability to new climates or geographic variation in climate tolerance within a species that is populations at higher latitudes will experience larger climatic fluctuations than those at lower latitudes bonebrake and mastrandrea 2010 de frenne et al 2013 and will therefore likely have different suitability requirements distribution and habitat use models incorporating latitude adjusted elevation have been created for g gulo wolverines in the united states carroll et al 2020 inman et al 2012 phenology of bird species in western north america socolar et al 2017 and woodboring beetle outbreak predictions ray et al 2019 however this method of incorporating latitude adjusted elevation is limited to a single linear conversion of an indicator of climatic variation and remains untested against unadjusted corresponding variables other methods incorporating adaptation in distribution models largely rely on genetics hällfors et al 2016 kearney et al 2009 which are not always readily available for many taxa of interest to modelling some methods allowing for geographic differences are trait based benito garzón et al 2019 or mechanistic which will not work for understudied species evans et al 2015 another type of latitudinal adjustment uses latitude in bias correction brown 2014 however this is meant to correct for greater amounts of model background points at higher latitudes due to unequal cell size rather than accounting for potential adaptation of species to higher latitudes to our knowledge no studies currently utilize latitude adjusted bioclimatic factors as environmental predictor variables the basis of utilizing latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables is that species use environmental factors relative to what is available to them and so these adjusted variables will provide a baseline from which this relative use can be modelled and extrapolated to address latitudinal variation as a factor in species distributions we utilized a suite of ecological modelling methods including generalized linear models gams maximum entropy maxent algorithm and thresholding our primary objective was to test the effect of incorporating latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables on the model fit statistics for species distribution models of two example bufo toad species from northeast asia as a secondary objective we aimed to delineate a geographic boundary between the two bufo species which are geographically close but whose ecological requirements are effectively exclusive of each other in doing so we present novel methods for delineating species thresholds in sympatric areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 target species to analyse effects of latitude on bioclimatic niche we chose to focus on two species of toads bufo sachalinensis and bufo stejnegeri ranging across a similar geographic extent in northeast asia bufo sachalinensis was recently split from b gargarizans and the species is widespread across northeast china the russian primorye region and the korean peninsula othman et al 2022 the species is common and found in many types of landscapes iucn ssc amphibian specialist group 2019 it mainly inhabits lowland areas and is less common at higher elevations borzée et al 2017 zhan and fu 2011 conversely to b sachalinensis b stejnegeri has a more restricted range occurring in the korean peninsula and northeastern china borzée et al 2021 iucn ssc amphibian specialist group 2020 2020 the species is restricted to forests and wetlands and is mostly found at higher elevation streams in mountainous areas fong et al 2020 lee et al 2010 while the two species are similar in appearance their habitats differ such that they are not expected to be found living sympatrically messenger et al 2020 othman et al 2022 and are only purported to do so in the southern korean peninsula matsui 1980 the inclusion of both species in this study allowed us to analyse the effect of latitude on both widespread and narrow ranging species and to delimit their ranges and contact zones 2 2 occurrence data and geographic range to model distributions of our two focal species we collected occurrence data from multiple sources including the literature matsui 1980 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 governmental survey data national institute of ecology korea open source and citizen science data gbif doi 10 15468 dl gnm233 inaturalist org naturing net and field observations from authors dataset andersen et al 2021 for the purpose of this study we only included b sachalinensis occurrence points following the definition of othman et al 2022 since the geographic range of the species overlaps with that of b stejnegeri it is deeply divergent from the clade b gargarizans and the species has specific ecological requirements borzée et al 2017 in total we used 695 occurrences of b sachalinensis and 639 occurrences of b stejnegeri we also collected 976 absence points for b stejnegeri defined as a surveyed location where the species was not found for three visits to the site for b sachalinensis we considered b stejnegeri occurrences as absence points and vice versa since their habitats exclude each other kang and yoon 1975 matsui 1980 our total geographic range 34 0 n to 56 0 n and 116 e to 145 e see fig 2 was approximately that of the easternmost b sachalinensis clade borzée et al 2017 expanded to the next whole decimal degree from occurrence points to include potential unknown areas of distribution we excluded japan and jeju island from the geographic range as neither species is found on these islands 2 3 latitude adjustment for bioclimatic variables to adjust for latitudinal gradient as to remove latitudinal variation of bioclimatic variables we used a modified version of the method presented by brock and inman 2006 which was originally used to adjust treeline elevation across latitudes while they suggest in their study that this method may not be suitable for bioclimatic variables the purpose of the current study is to determine whether incorporation of such latitude adjusted variables in modelling can lead to more accurate distribution models instead of using a linear model as in brock and inman 2006 we used a generalized additive model gam gam function in the mgcv r package gams which describe nonparametric relationships between predictor and response variables hastie and tibshirani 1987 are largely used in ecology to ascertain relationships between environmental conditions and species presence probability leathwick et al 2006 yee and mitchell 1991 zaniewski et al 2002 these are useful in tackling the shortcomings of generalized linear models glms which assume a linear relationship between predictors and responses as such responses in ecological studies can be much more complicated larsen 2015 for example exhibiting bell shaped responses instead of linear ones yee and mitchell 1991 similarly previously referenced studies which incorporate latitude adjusted treeline elevation use both linear and quadratic terms ray et al 2019 socolar et al 2017 demonstrating that such environmental responses across latitudinal gradients are more complex than simple linear models and such blanket assumptions cannot be made especially for multiple variables to utilize gams in our distribution models we conducted latitude adjustment of bioclimatic variables with r version 3 6 1 we trained gams for each of 19 bioclimatic variables from worldclim version 2 0 fick and hijmans 2017 from a dataset consisting of 20 000 random background points across the full extent of the study area combined range of both species 34 n to 56 n 116 e to 145 e and using latitude as our smoothing variable gam bio s latitude wood and wood 2015 we projected this model to a latitude raster covering our study area then subtracted from this layer the expected value at 45 of latitude or the mid latitude of our study area brock and inman 2006 this layer we then subtracted from the original raster for the bioclimatic variable this equation adapted from brock and inman 2006 is represented by v v v g a m v 45 where v lati tude adju sted vari able v unad just ed vari able v gam vari able pred icted by gam model v 45 vari able pred icted value at 45 lati tude 2 4 maxent distribution models our primary objective was to create a spatial model that best represented the species distributions while incorporating latitudinal gradients corrected as described in this study using the program maxent phillips et al 2017 we created and tested 36 models see table 1 for each bufo species using different combinations of unadjusted and latitude adjusted variable types variable selection and bias layers we created models using latitude adjusted variables only unadjusted variables only and both unadjusted and latitude adjusted variables combined by combining unadjusted and latitude adjusted variables we were able to apply both strict climatic limitation unadjusted and variability with latitude latitude adjusted we also used unadjusted elevation usgs slope slope and slope slope was derived using the slope tool in arcmap 10 6 esri redlands ca usa both slope and slope were derived through the focal statistics tool in arcmap 10 6 esri redlands ca usa creating averaged raster values within a neighbourhood of 3 and 10 raster cells representing average slope in degrees within a 5 44 km2 area and 60 5 km2 area respectively landscape variables were not used in model training as occurrence points were taken from the years 1890 2020 of 1585 total observations 92 were taken before 1970 and 396 were taken after 2000 and landscape variables are subject to change over time due to human activities and yearly variations especially on the korean peninsula lee and miller rushing 2014 park et al 2014 we then ran models containing the full set of variable types unadjusted latitude adjusted or both then used model selection to reduce model complexity warren and seifert 2011 by selecting amongst correlated variables r 0 8 based on percent contribution and permutation importance separately since bias in the current study was largely driven by sampling effort within countries we created three bias layers input in the maxent platform representing the number of occurrence points per country number of presence and absence points for b sachalinensis and number of presence and absence points for b stejnegeri we therefore created four model sets corrected for no bias model run without bias layer correction weak bias occurrence points per country moderate bias presence and absence points for b sachalinensis and strong bias presence and absence points for b stejnegeri based on the number of occurrence points represented the lowest number being weak bias and highest number being strong bias when running maxent we used environmental layers table a 1 with a 0 0083 decimal degree dd 778 m resolution the coarsest resolution of all layers for model replication we used the cross validate run type option with five replicates 5 k fold we set background points at 20 000 hill et al 2012 sidder et al 2016 jenkins et al 2020 muscatello et al 2021 and removed duplicate presence points within the same cell of the environmental layers 0 0083 dd we set background points at 20 000 rather than the default 10 000 because increasing the number of background points can improve model accuracy phillips and dudík 2008 barbet massin et al 2012 and because the larger number of points allowed more thorough sampling of environmental factors across our large study area all other parameters were unchanged from maxent s base settings phillips et al 2017 the easternmost bufo sachalinensis clade is found in lower elevations with upper elevation limits ranging from 800 m borzée et al 2017 to 1600 m zhan and fu 2011 we therefore used 1400 m as an upper elevation cutoff in geographical representation of our selected model for the species as it was the maximum elevation value of our occurrence points for b stejnegeri we removed unsuitable landscape classes agriculture bare grassland urban lee et al 2010 source mdaus basevue 2013 world land cover layer with 30 m resolution from suitable area in our selected model for the species to test our distribution models we opted to test presence with known absence locations from our dataset rather than using the background points created in maxent as those points can only be considered pseudo absences and may represent locations where the species is actually present for testing b sachalinensis we added 1000 random points 0 0083 dd away resolution of environmental layers from occurrence of both b sachalinensis and b stejnegeri to cover the full geographic range of the b sachalinensis from the model values at our presence and absence points we calculated area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic roc and maximum true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 of presence absence by predicted values to test for overfitting we additionally calculated the test omission rate at the 10 percent omission threshold we selected the best model for each species based on maximum tss sensitivity specificity 1 allouche et al 2006 of actual by predicted values at the maximum test sensitivity plus specificity threshold since this statistic best maximizes the true positive and negative rates while minimizing the false positive and negative rates sensitivity is defined as the proportion of correctly predicted presences and specificity as the proportion of correctly predicted absences allouche et al 2006 to determine which combinations of variable types variable selections and biases significantly affected model fit we ran analysis of variance and tukeyhsd tests on auc and tss using variable types variable selections and biases as factor covariates these analyses were conducted with r version 3 6 1 2 5 species boundary our secondary objective was to delineate a geographic boundary between the two bufo species to do this we calculated environmental variable thresholds at which one species could be reliably found over the other by applying the sensitivity and specificity concepts allouche et al 2006 by equating sensitivity and specificity for a binary where b sachalinensis 1 and b stejnegeri 0 we were able to find the threshold at which one species could be found over the other in this analysis we calculated equal sensitivity and specificity thresholds for unadjusted and latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables elevation and three slope variables slope slope and slope by using the extracted values of each environmental variable at observation points these analyses were conducted with r version 3 6 1 for geographical representation we created a weighted average of the 20 thresholded layers with the highest tss values sensitivity specificity 1 allouche et al 2006 weighted by their corresponding tss values marmion et al 2009 we then overlaid the weighted average over the overlapping area of our selected maxent models that were thresholded using the maximum tss threshold approach the average width of these overlap areas collectively referred to as ribbon was calculated from the generic equation to find the width of a rectangle with the same perimeter and width of the irregular polygon using the quadratic equation w i d t h p e r i m e t e r p e r i m e t e r 2 16 a r e a 4 all areas were calculated after projecting our models to the behrmann world equal area projection esri 54 017 3 results 3 1 latitude adjustment for bioclimatic variables gams of bioclimatic variables using a smoothed latitude coefficient described between 11 7 and 87 5 of variation µ 53 5 25 1 for the 19 bioclimatic variables tested these models showed that the smoothed latitude coefficient was significant for all bioclimatic variables after applying the formula for latitude adjustment the adjusted r2 was 0 and the p value was 1 for all variables effectively removing latitudinal variation fig 1 3 2 maxent distribution models our maxent models had auc values ranging between 0 8104 and 0 8965 for b sachalinensis and between 0 9490 and 0 9822 for b stejnegeri and maximum tss ranging between 0 5012 and 0 6532 for b sachalinensis and between 0 8147 and 0 8882 for b stejnegeri for b sachalinensis the selected model fig 2 with the highest tss of 0 6532 auc 0 8921 was the model using latitude adjusted variables only without variable selection and the strong bias layer table 1 the full area of minimum suitability for the b sachalinensis model was 2356 241 km2 73 8 of total study area with the area above the maximum tss of 642 470 km2 20 1 of total study area for b stejnegeri the selected model fig 3 with the highest tss of 0 8882 auc 0 9818 was the model using all variable types unadjusted and latitude adjusted without variable selection and the medium bias layer table 1 the full area of minimum suitability for this model was 375 590 km2 11 8 of total study area with the area above the maximum tss of 144 666 km2 4 5 of total study area for details of variables used in each model see appendix a 3 analysis of variance for effect of model covariates on auc and tss revealed that for b sachalinensis variable type unadjusted vs latitude adjusted vs both had the greatest influence on auc f3 28 140 9 p 0 0001 and tss f3 28 47 8 p 0 0001 followed by selection full vs

all variable types had the highest auc and tss followed by unadjusted variables only then latitude adjusted variables only p 0 05 for all pairs table 1 the full model had significantly higher

to 0 7106 with slope having the highest tss followed by elevation slope and latitude adjusted bio1 or annual mean temperature see table a 2 for all thresholds from the maximum tss thresholded maxent models the two species have an overlap of predicted presence over 39 984 km2 the average width of the overlap ribbon was 5 58 3 36 km for overlap areas 10 km2 97 5 of total overlap area 11 78 4 43 km for the largest overlap areas comprising 90 of total overlap and 16 83 3 46 km for the 4 largest overlap areas comprising 80 of total overlap when the weighted threshold layer was overlaid onto this overlap fig 4 b sachalinensis was more likely in 74 1 of this range and b stejnegeri was more likely in 25 9 4 discussion 4 1 latitude adjusted variables in maxent distribution models an important finding of this research was that inclusion of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables was the most significant contributor to improved model accuracy in the form of auc and tss statistics for species with both wide and narrow ranges this held true despite the suggestion of brock and inman 2006 that such latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables may not be suitable for inclusion in ecological models also although tss was higher for b stejnegeri models that only used unadjusted variables compared to latitude adjusted variables tss was also higher for models incorporating both unadjusted and latitude adjusted variables than models only using unadjusted variables the caveat is that models incorporating these variables must be tested against those that do not incorporate latitude adjusted variables this inclusion was more important than either variable selection or correction of bias through use of a bias layer although the use of a bias layer also significantly improved model accuracy while current modelling techniques without the use of latitude adjusted variables can and do produce accurate models we believe that incorporation of such variables can improve on existing models and even provide a solution where model fit is inadequate without strong model effects of unadjusted variable to exemplify the use of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables as a solution to models that do not accurately represent the species range our models improve on previous models of b sachalinensis distribution which have not predicted suitability in the species northern range garcia porta et al 2012 possibly due to the previous lack of consideration for the species ability to adapt to climates at higher latitudes our findings that inclusion of latitude adjusted variables improves distribution models are in line with previous research for example latitude adjusted treeline elevation provided highly accurate models for detecting habitat patches for c bicknelli bicknell s thrush in the northeastern united states lambert et al 2005 and for gulo gulo wolverines in greater yellowstone usa inman et al 2012 based on our results these methods of latitude adjustment can be taken a step further and applied to bioclimatic variables in complex distribution models to significantly improve model accuracy for species with both narrow and wide ranges although the incorporation of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables improves model accuracy from use of only unadjusted variables there is a possibility for overextension of suitable area at higher latitudes at which point physiological traits if available may be used to create a bounding climatic envelope we also recommend that these methods be compared to those incorporating trait based adaptive ability benito garzón et al 2019 if these methods yielded similar results latitudinal adjustment methods could be used in lieu of fitness related traits for understudied species which applies to many species which are endangered or rare and thus have restrictions on collection and experimentation doremus 2001 garmestani et al 2008 runge 2011 in addition to improve predictive accuracy of species distribution we suggest that this methodology to adjust climate to latitude could be applied to projections under climate change such application would likely create significantly different projections from current practices and would better inform predictions of future suitability when used in conjunction with traditional methods for instance in a study of latitudinal patterns of climate change impacts bonebrake and mastrandrea 2010 predicted greater impacts on tropical species compared to higher latitude species due to narrower climatic tolerance for incorporation of these variables we suggest applying the initial adjustment equation to future climates without training a new gam to the future climatic conditions this would adjust for latitude as well as incorporate extent of divergence from current climate we expect the result to be a reduced vulnerability to climate change similar to what has been previously demonstrated by incorporation of adaptation in such models bush et al 2016 as a concrete example borzée et al 2019a projected the range of karsenia koreana to expand by 9156 km2 in 2050 and 28 245 km2 in 2070 under an intermediate climate change scenario rcp 4 5 with most expansion occurring to the north of the current range however using the methods developed in the current paper may have resulted in limited northward suitability expansion instead it has been predicted in terrestrial insects that species at higher latitudes will be less affected by climate change since they are adapted to a wider range of climatic conditions and climate is expected to warm to the species optimum deutsch et al 2008 in amphibians however even though occurring at high latitude temperate species have high margins of thermal tolerance and they are expected to be highly vulnerable to climatic change based on physiological ctmax tests and maxent models gerick et al 2014 based on the conflicting results of these studies we cannot make an accurate prediction of the effect of climate change on our example species but from our use availability and distribution results we expect that b sachalinensis will be less affected because of its wide range and therefore greater overall tolerance of a wide range of climatic conditions whereas the narrow ranging high elevation b stejnegeri may find its range greatly reduced 4 2 multi species range and contact zone delimitation our results for delineating a contact zone and boundary between the two focal species highlight the usefulness of our methodology for identifying such areas between other related species such as cryptic species or multiple species that are classified as one due to morphological similarities pfenninger and schwenk 2007 this can then be a useful tool for conservation if one or more of these species are threatened previous studies using genetics of geolocated samples can further be enhanced using distribution models representing contact zones for instance a study of a hynobius species complex in the republic of korea delineated general contact boundaries between morphologically similar hynobius species in the southern part of the country borzée et al 2019b borzée and min 2021 but the zones of sympatry and boundaries between ranges could be further enhanced using the methods described in the current study however such an application at a finer scale would require inclusion of landscape variables and consideration of interspecies competition 5 conclusions our results show that consideration of latitude greatly improves species distribution model accuracy we therefore posit that this aspect has been greatly overlooked in the field up to this point and that the inclusion of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables in model building is necessary to model more accurate species distributions and suitability the methodology presented here also has the benefit of deconstructing influences of latitude into parameters that are likely more closely linked to mechanisms determining species distributions than the single parameter estimate of treeline elevation described by brock and inman 2006 further our methodologies and results have implications for indicating species adaptive abilities species distributions under climate change and delimiting contact zones of related species additionally gam latitude adjustment successfully removed latitudinal

24436,latitudinal variations in species niche due to factors such as phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation pose fundamental problems for ecological niche modelling at large geographic scales species adaptation to varying climates across latitudes thus necessitates the latitudinal adjustment of climatic variables for incorporation into more accurate models of habitat suitability and species distribution previous studies have identified changes in species elevational distributions across latitudes however few studies incorporate latitude adjusted variables into suitability or distribution models in this study we utilized generalized additive models gams to adjust bioclimatic variables by latitude in order to remove latitudinal variation in ecological niche models we incorporated these latitude adjusted variables into maximum entropy maxent models of two species of toad bufo sachalinensis previously bufo gargarizans and bufo stejnegeri in northeast asia we additionally identified thresholds in bioclimatic and terrain variables that delineate boundaries between the two bufo species where their ranges overlap we found that gam adjustment of bioclimatic variables effectively removed latitudinal variation in said variables maxent models incorporating these latitude adjusted variables had significantly improved model fit auc and tss for both bufo species we identified a potential sympatric area shared by the two species and delineated a geographic boundary thresholding the probable presence of one species over the other this study shows a clear improvement for distribution models with the inclusion of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables for both narrow and wide ranging species this has implications for future distribution modelling practices especially for geographically widespread species and has potential for modelling species distributions in climate change scenarios further the methodology for delimiting species thresholds has future use in modelling contact zones of related species graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords maximum entropy model latitudinal adjustment species distribution northeast asia toad 1 introduction species ranges have been shown to be affected by environmental variables along a latitudinal gradient as a response to changing bioclimatic conditions along those gradients brock and inman 2006 ecologically speaking adaptation occurs when resource use changes to match availability dobzhansky 1968 if there is a climatic gradient across latitudes a species will exhibit some degree of adaptation to match that gradient likely depending on how widespread it is for instance a relationship between latitude and distribution was found in the northeastern united states with catharus bicknelli bicknell s thrush whose lower elevational limit has been observed to decrease by 81 63 m per degree of latitude lambert et al 2005 in a study of gulo gulo wolverines in finland copeland et al 2010 demonstrated that for average maximum august temperature across 14 of latitude use of the bioclimatic variable by the species followed the average of availability or the available range of the bioclimatic variable at higher latitudes and diverged from the average at lower latitudes due to a range of environmental conditions including abiotic and biotic factors a species is unlikely to occupy the full range of climatic conditions across its distribution as evidenced by tree species which favour a peaked suitability hypothesis wherein species occupancy is proportional to the suitability index and peaks at the species optimum boucher lalonde et al 2012 additionally phenotypic plasticity specifies that a species can express different phenotypes in order to tolerate varying environmental conditions fox et al 2019 although phenotypic plasticity does not translate directly to adaptation schilthuizen and kellermann 2014 it can allow a species to colonize and endure conditions in novel habitats and is particularly advantageous to species at higher latitudes which experience greater climatic variation than those at lower latitudes this positive correlation between phenotypic plasticity and latitude has been observed in an invasive plant taraxacum officinale molina montenegro and naya 2012 and copepods pereira et al 2017 in addition to phenotypic plasticity species may also exhibit local adaptation corresponding to climate or latitude as in panicum virgatum vascular plant casler et al 2004 viola reichenbachiana and aesculus hippocastanum vascular plants tryjanowski et al 2006 and rana temporaria common brown frog liess et al 2013 according to rapoport s rule species found at higher latitudes will have a larger geographic range than those found at lower latitudes stevens 1989 this is because higher latitudes have greater climatic variability so an organism found at high latitudes will be adapted to and experience a wider range of climatic conditions than lower latitude species stevens 1989 this pattern is found in many taxa including reptiles and amphibians in north america conant 1958 stevens 1989 and rapoport s rule has been demonstrated more recently in snakes böhm et al 2017 but is shown to be more regional than global for amphibians whitton et al 2012 although adaptation and plasticity across latitudinal gradients are important for species physiology few species distribution or habitat modelling techniques consider species adaptability to new climates or geographic variation in climate tolerance within a species that is populations at higher latitudes will experience larger climatic fluctuations than those at lower latitudes bonebrake and mastrandrea 2010 de frenne et al 2013 and will therefore likely have different suitability requirements distribution and habitat use models incorporating latitude adjusted elevation have been created for g gulo wolverines in the united states carroll et al 2020 inman et al 2012 phenology of bird species in western north america socolar et al 2017 and woodboring beetle outbreak predictions ray et al 2019 however this method of incorporating latitude adjusted elevation is limited to a single linear conversion of an indicator of climatic variation and remains untested against unadjusted corresponding variables other methods incorporating adaptation in distribution models largely rely on genetics hällfors et al 2016 kearney et al 2009 which are not always readily available for many taxa of interest to modelling some methods allowing for geographic differences are trait based benito garzón et al 2019 or mechanistic which will not work for understudied species evans et al 2015 another type of latitudinal adjustment uses latitude in bias correction brown 2014 however this is meant to correct for greater amounts of model background points at higher latitudes due to unequal cell size rather than accounting for potential adaptation of species to higher latitudes to our knowledge no studies currently utilize latitude adjusted bioclimatic factors as environmental predictor variables the basis of utilizing latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables is that species use environmental factors relative to what is available to them and so these adjusted variables will provide a baseline from which this relative use can be modelled and extrapolated to address latitudinal variation as a factor in species distributions we utilized a suite of ecological modelling methods including generalized linear models gams maximum entropy maxent algorithm and thresholding our primary objective was to test the effect of incorporating latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables on the model fit statistics for species distribution models of two example bufo toad species from northeast asia as a secondary objective we aimed to delineate a geographic boundary between the two bufo species which are geographically close but whose ecological requirements are effectively exclusive of each other in doing so we present novel methods for delineating species thresholds in sympatric areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 target species to analyse effects of latitude on bioclimatic niche we chose to focus on two species of toads bufo sachalinensis and bufo stejnegeri ranging across a similar geographic extent in northeast asia bufo sachalinensis was recently split from b gargarizans and the species is widespread across northeast china the russian primorye region and the korean peninsula othman et al 2022 the species is common and found in many types of landscapes iucn ssc amphibian specialist group 2019 it mainly inhabits lowland areas and is less common at higher elevations borzée et al 2017 zhan and fu 2011 conversely to b sachalinensis b stejnegeri has a more restricted range occurring in the korean peninsula and northeastern china borzée et al 2021 iucn ssc amphibian specialist group 2020 2020 the species is restricted to forests and wetlands and is mostly found at higher elevation streams in mountainous areas fong et al 2020 lee et al 2010 while the two species are similar in appearance their habitats differ such that they are not expected to be found living sympatrically messenger et al 2020 othman et al 2022 and are only purported to do so in the southern korean peninsula matsui 1980 the inclusion of both species in this study allowed us to analyse the effect of latitude on both widespread and narrow ranging species and to delimit their ranges and contact zones 2 2 occurrence data and geographic range to model distributions of our two focal species we collected occurrence data from multiple sources including the literature matsui 1980 zhang et al 2016 zhao et al 2008 governmental survey data national institute of ecology korea open source and citizen science data gbif doi 10 15468 dl gnm233 inaturalist org naturing net and field observations from authors dataset andersen et al 2021 for the purpose of this study we only included b sachalinensis occurrence points following the definition of othman et al 2022 since the geographic range of the species overlaps with that of b stejnegeri it is deeply divergent from the clade b gargarizans and the species has specific ecological requirements borzée et al 2017 in total we used 695 occurrences of b sachalinensis and 639 occurrences of b stejnegeri we also collected 976 absence points for b stejnegeri defined as a surveyed location where the species was not found for three visits to the site for b sachalinensis we considered b stejnegeri occurrences as absence points and vice versa since their habitats exclude each other kang and yoon 1975 matsui 1980 our total geographic range 34 0 n to 56 0 n and 116 e to 145 e see fig 2 was approximately that of the easternmost b sachalinensis clade borzée et al 2017 expanded to the next whole decimal degree from occurrence points to include potential unknown areas of distribution we excluded japan and jeju island from the geographic range as neither species is found on these islands 2 3 latitude adjustment for bioclimatic variables to adjust for latitudinal gradient as to remove latitudinal variation of bioclimatic variables we used a modified version of the method presented by brock and inman 2006 which was originally used to adjust treeline elevation across latitudes while they suggest in their study that this method may not be suitable for bioclimatic variables the purpose of the current study is to determine whether incorporation of such latitude adjusted variables in modelling can lead to more accurate distribution models instead of using a linear model as in brock and inman 2006 we used a generalized additive model gam gam function in the mgcv r package gams which describe nonparametric relationships between predictor and response variables hastie and tibshirani 1987 are largely used in ecology to ascertain relationships between environmental conditions and species presence probability leathwick et al 2006 yee and mitchell 1991 zaniewski et al 2002 these are useful in tackling the shortcomings of generalized linear models glms which assume a linear relationship between predictors and responses as such responses in ecological studies can be much more complicated larsen 2015 for example exhibiting bell shaped responses instead of linear ones yee and mitchell 1991 similarly previously referenced studies which incorporate latitude adjusted treeline elevation use both linear and quadratic terms ray et al 2019 socolar et al 2017 demonstrating that such environmental responses across latitudinal gradients are more complex than simple linear models and such blanket assumptions cannot be made especially for multiple variables to utilize gams in our distribution models we conducted latitude adjustment of bioclimatic variables with r version 3 6 1 we trained gams for each of 19 bioclimatic variables from worldclim version 2 0 fick and hijmans 2017 from a dataset consisting of 20 000 random background points across the full extent of the study area combined range of both species 34 n to 56 n 116 e to 145 e and using latitude as our smoothing variable gam bio s latitude wood and wood 2015 we projected this model to a latitude raster covering our study area then subtracted from this layer the expected value at 45 of latitude or the mid latitude of our study area brock and inman 2006 this layer we then subtracted from the original raster for the bioclimatic variable this equation adapted from brock and inman 2006 is represented by v v v g a m v 45 where v lati tude adju sted vari able v unad just ed vari able v gam vari able pred icted by gam model v 45 vari able pred icted value at 45 lati tude 2 4 maxent distribution models our primary objective was to create a spatial model that best represented the species distributions while incorporating latitudinal gradients corrected as described in this study using the program maxent phillips et al 2017 we created and tested 36 models see table 1 for each bufo species using different combinations of unadjusted and latitude adjusted variable types variable selection and bias layers we created models using latitude adjusted variables only unadjusted variables only and both unadjusted and latitude adjusted variables combined by combining unadjusted and latitude adjusted variables we were able to apply both strict climatic limitation unadjusted and variability with latitude latitude adjusted we also used unadjusted elevation usgs slope slope and slope slope was derived using the slope tool in arcmap 10 6 esri redlands ca usa both slope and slope were derived through the focal statistics tool in arcmap 10 6 esri redlands ca usa creating averaged raster values within a neighbourhood of 3 and 10 raster cells representing average slope in degrees within a 5 44 km2 area and 60 5 km2 area respectively landscape variables were not used in model training as occurrence points were taken from the years 1890 2020 of 1585 total observations 92 were taken before 1970 and 396 were taken after 2000 and landscape variables are subject to change over time due to human activities and yearly variations especially on the korean peninsula lee and miller rushing 2014 park et al 2014 we then ran models containing the full set of variable types unadjusted latitude adjusted or both then used model selection to reduce model complexity warren and seifert 2011 by selecting amongst correlated variables r 0 8 based on percent contribution and permutation importance separately since bias in the current study was largely driven by sampling effort within countries we created three bias layers input in the maxent platform representing the number of occurrence points per country number of presence and absence points for b sachalinensis and number of presence and absence points for b stejnegeri we therefore created four model sets corrected for no bias model run without bias layer correction weak bias occurrence points per country moderate bias presence and absence points for b sachalinensis and strong bias presence and absence points for b stejnegeri based on the number of occurrence points represented the lowest number being weak bias and highest number being strong bias when running maxent we used environmental layers table a 1 with a 0 0083 decimal degree dd 778 m resolution the coarsest resolution of all layers for model replication we used the cross validate run type option with five replicates 5 k fold we set background points at 20 000 hill et al 2012 sidder et al 2016 jenkins et al 2020 muscatello et al 2021 and removed duplicate presence points within the same cell of the environmental layers 0 0083 dd we set background points at 20 000 rather than the default 10 000 because increasing the number of background points can improve model accuracy phillips and dudík 2008 barbet massin et al 2012 and because the larger number of points allowed more thorough sampling of environmental factors across our large study area all other parameters were unchanged from maxent s base settings phillips et al 2017 the easternmost bufo sachalinensis clade is found in lower elevations with upper elevation limits ranging from 800 m borzée et al 2017 to 1600 m zhan and fu 2011 we therefore used 1400 m as an upper elevation cutoff in geographical representation of our selected model for the species as it was the maximum elevation value of our occurrence points for b stejnegeri we removed unsuitable landscape classes agriculture bare grassland urban lee et al 2010 source mdaus basevue 2013 world land cover layer with 30 m resolution from suitable area in our selected model for the species to test our distribution models we opted to test presence with known absence locations from our dataset rather than using the background points created in maxent as those points can only be considered pseudo absences and may represent locations where the species is actually present for testing b sachalinensis we added 1000 random points 0 0083 dd away resolution of environmental layers from occurrence of both b sachalinensis and b stejnegeri to cover the full geographic range of the b sachalinensis from the model values at our presence and absence points we calculated area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic roc and maximum true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 of presence absence by predicted values to test for overfitting we additionally calculated the test omission rate at the 10 percent omission threshold we selected the best model for each species based on maximum tss sensitivity specificity 1 allouche et al 2006 of actual by predicted values at the maximum test sensitivity plus specificity threshold since this statistic best maximizes the true positive and negative rates while minimizing the false positive and negative rates sensitivity is defined as the proportion of correctly predicted presences and specificity as the proportion of correctly predicted absences allouche et al 2006 to determine which combinations of variable types variable selections and biases significantly affected model fit we ran analysis of variance and tukeyhsd tests on auc and tss using variable types variable selections and biases as factor covariates these analyses were conducted with r version 3 6 1 2 5 species boundary our secondary objective was to delineate a geographic boundary between the two bufo species to do this we calculated environmental variable thresholds at which one species could be reliably found over the other by applying the sensitivity and specificity concepts allouche et al 2006 by equating sensitivity and specificity for a binary where b sachalinensis 1 and b stejnegeri 0 we were able to find the threshold at which one species could be found over the other in this analysis we calculated equal sensitivity and specificity thresholds for unadjusted and latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables elevation and three slope variables slope slope and slope by using the extracted values of each environmental variable at observation points these analyses were conducted with r version 3 6 1 for geographical representation we created a weighted average of the 20 thresholded layers with the highest tss values sensitivity specificity 1 allouche et al 2006 weighted by their corresponding tss values marmion et al 2009 we then overlaid the weighted average over the overlapping area of our selected maxent models that were thresholded using the maximum tss threshold approach the average width of these overlap areas collectively referred to as ribbon was calculated from the generic equation to find the width of a rectangle with the same perimeter and width of the irregular polygon using the quadratic equation w i d t h p e r i m e t e r p e r i m e t e r 2 16 a r e a 4 all areas were calculated after projecting our models to the behrmann world equal area projection esri 54 017 3 results 3 1 latitude adjustment for bioclimatic variables gams of bioclimatic variables using a smoothed latitude coefficient described between 11 7 and 87 5 of variation µ 53 5 25 1 for the 19 bioclimatic variables tested these models showed that the smoothed latitude coefficient was significant for all bioclimatic variables after applying the formula for latitude adjustment the adjusted r2 was 0 and the p value was 1 for all variables effectively removing latitudinal variation fig 1 3 2 maxent distribution models our maxent models had auc values ranging between 0 8104 and 0 8965 for b sachalinensis and between 0 9490 and 0 9822 for b stejnegeri and maximum tss ranging between 0 5012 and 0 6532 for b sachalinensis and between 0 8147 and 0 8882 for b stejnegeri for b sachalinensis the selected model fig 2 with the highest tss of 0 6532 auc 0 8921 was the model using latitude adjusted variables only without variable selection and the strong bias layer table 1 the full area of minimum suitability for the b sachalinensis model was 2356 241 km2 73 8 of total study

models the two species have an overlap of predicted presence over 39 984 km2 the average width of the overlap ribbon was 5 58 3 36 km for overlap areas 10 km2 97 5 of total overlap area 11 78 4 43 km for the largest overlap areas comprising 90 of total overlap and 16 83 3 46 km for the 4 largest overlap areas comprising 80 of total overlap when the weighted threshold layer was overlaid onto this overlap fig 4 b sachalinensis was more likely in 74 1 of this range and b stejnegeri was more likely in 25 9 4 discussion 4 1 latitude adjusted variables in maxent distribution models an important finding of this research was that inclusion of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables was the most significant contributor to improved model accuracy in the form of auc and tss statistics for species with both wide and narrow ranges this held true despite the suggestion of brock and inman 2006 that such latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables may not be suitable for inclusion in ecological models also although tss was higher for b stejnegeri models that only used unadjusted variables compared to latitude adjusted variables tss was also higher for models incorporating both unadjusted and latitude adjusted variables than models only using unadjusted variables the caveat is that models incorporating these variables must be tested against those that do not incorporate latitude adjusted variables this inclusion was more important than either variable selection or correction of bias through use of a bias layer although the use of a bias layer also significantly improved model accuracy while current modelling techniques without the use of latitude adjusted variables can and do produce accurate models we believe that incorporation of such variables can improve on existing models and even provide a solution where model fit is inadequate without strong model effects of unadjusted variable to exemplify the use of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables as a solution to models that do not accurately represent the species range our models improve on previous models of b sachalinensis distribution which have not predicted suitability in the species northern range garcia porta et al 2012 possibly due to the previous lack of consideration for the species ability to adapt to climates at higher latitudes our findings that inclusion of latitude adjusted variables improves distribution models are in line with previous research for example latitude adjusted treeline elevation provided highly accurate models for detecting habitat patches for c bicknelli bicknell s thrush in the northeastern united states lambert et al 2005 and for gulo gulo wolverines in greater yellowstone usa inman et al 2012 based on our results these methods of latitude adjustment can be taken a step further and applied to bioclimatic variables in complex distribution models to significantly improve model accuracy for species with both narrow and wide ranges although the incorporation of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables improves model accuracy from use of only unadjusted variables there is a possibility for overextension of suitable area at higher latitudes at which point physiological traits if available may be used to create a bounding climatic envelope we also recommend that these methods be compared to those incorporating trait based adaptive ability benito garzón et al 2019 if these methods yielded similar results latitudinal adjustment methods could be used in lieu of fitness related traits for understudied species which applies to many species which are endangered or rare and thus have restrictions on collection and experimentation doremus 2001 garmestani et al 2008 runge 2011 in addition to improve predictive accuracy of species distribution we suggest that this methodology to adjust climate to latitude could be applied to projections under climate change such application would likely create significantly different projections from current practices and would better inform predictions of future suitability when used in conjunction with traditional methods for instance in a study of latitudinal patterns of climate change impacts bonebrake and mastrandrea 2010 predicted greater impacts on tropical species compared to higher latitude species due to narrower climatic tolerance for incorporation of these variables we suggest applying the initial adjustment equation to future climates without training a new gam to the future climatic conditions this would adjust for latitude as well as incorporate extent of divergence from current climate we expect the result to be a reduced vulnerability to climate change similar to what has been previously demonstrated by incorporation of adaptation in such models bush et al 2016 as a concrete example borzée et al 2019a projected the range of karsenia koreana to expand by 9156 km2 in 2050 and 28 245 km2 in 2070 under an intermediate climate change scenario rcp 4 5 with most expansion occurring to the north of the current range however using the methods developed in the current paper may have resulted in limited northward suitability expansion instead it has been predicted in terrestrial insects that species at higher latitudes will be less affected by climate change since they are adapted to a wider range of climatic conditions and climate is expected to warm to the species optimum deutsch et al 2008 in amphibians however even though occurring at high latitude temperate species have high margins of thermal tolerance and they are expected to be highly vulnerable to climatic change based on physiological ctmax tests and maxent models gerick et al 2014 based on the conflicting results of these studies we cannot make an accurate prediction of the effect of climate change on our example species but from our use availability and distribution results we expect that b sachalinensis will be less affected because of its wide range and therefore greater overall tolerance of a wide range of climatic conditions whereas the narrow ranging high elevation b stejnegeri may find its range greatly reduced 4 2 multi species range and contact zone delimitation our results for delineating a contact zone and boundary between the two focal species highlight the usefulness of our methodology for identifying such areas between other related species such as cryptic species or multiple species that are classified as one due to morphological similarities pfenninger and schwenk 2007 this can then be a useful tool for conservation if one or more of these species are threatened previous studies using genetics of geolocated samples can further be enhanced using distribution models representing contact zones for instance a study of a hynobius species complex in the republic of korea delineated general contact boundaries between morphologically similar hynobius species in the southern part of the country borzée et al 2019b borzée and min 2021 but the zones of sympatry and boundaries between ranges could be further enhanced using the methods described in the current study however such an application at a finer scale would require inclusion of landscape variables and consideration of interspecies competition 5 conclusions our results show that consideration of latitude greatly improves species distribution model accuracy we therefore posit that this aspect has been greatly overlooked in the field up to this point and that the inclusion of latitude adjusted bioclimatic variables in model building is necessary to model more accurate species distributions and suitability the methodology presented here also has the benefit of deconstructing influences of latitude into parameters that are likely more closely linked to mechanisms determining species distributions than the single parameter estimate of treeline elevation described by brock and inman 2006 further our methodologies and results have implications for indicating species adaptive abilities species distributions under climate change and delimiting contact zones of related species additionally gam latitude adjustment successfully removed latitudinal

24437,the use of cleaner fish is an environmentally friendly approach to combat the salmon louse threatening commercial salmon farming dynamic energy budget deb modelling helps understand the bioenergetics of early life stages of the cleaner fish and can thereby aid optimisation of their culturing here we report on our attempts to parametrise debkiss models for the yolk feeding stages of two cleaner fish species ballan wrasse labrus bergylta and lumpfish cyclopterus lumpus a range of measurements was taken over early development including biometry using imaging weight and composition as well as measurements of respiration rate despite the previous success of applying the debkiss model to early life stages of atlantic cod the model failed to capture the patterns of yolk depletion for ballan wrasse the main issues were related to substantial changes in the water content of both yolk and structure over development and a stop of growth before disappearance of the yolk sac these issues require further experimental work to address especially more efficient proxies for the dry mass of yolk and structure such that these compartments can be efficiently separated nevertheless apart from the pattern of yolk depletion the model provides a reasonable explanation of all traits simultaneously this indicates that model modifications may only need to be minor for lumpfish the data set was quite limited for testing of the debkiss model due to the opacity of the egg and the fact that there was only one time point with measurements post hatch nevertheless the data are consistent with the model the modelling results indicate that both cleaner fish species may have very similar bioenergetic parameters and quite similar to atlantic cod as well the conspicuous difference in early life history may be mainly caused by the larger yolk provisioning in the egg and late hatching in lumpfish the debkiss model is a simple and promising tool for bioenergetics of fish early life stages however its application and in depth testing is currently limited by the difficulties of obtaining detailed measurements on these life stages keywords dynamic energy budget debkiss ballan wrasse lumpfish biometry early life stages 1 introduction the salmon louse lepeophtheirus salmonis threatens commercial salmon farming in norwegian waters as an environmentally friendly treatment strategy the use of cleaner fish such as ballan wrasse labrus bergylta ascanius 1767 and lumpfish cyclopterus lumpus linnaeus 1758 has been proposed however to be safe and sustainable the cleaner fish would have to be cultured rather than caught in the wild efficient production of fish requires a thorough knowledge of the life history of the species and how environmental factors such as food and temperature affect it this is especially true for the early life stages which form a bottleneck for fish culturing dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2001 jusup et al 2017 can help to quantitatively understand a species life history in a integrated framework for metabolic organisation the theory is generic covering all life forms on the planet and has found extensive application in aquaculture e g føre et al 2016 stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 the theory is structured around the laws for mass and energy conservation resources are taken up from the environment and are subsequently used for the energy demanding processes such as growth development and maintenance deb theory provides a set of simple rules for the intake and allocation of resources across the various processes these rules vary only little between species species mainly differ in the magnitudes of the various fluxes for practical models derived from the theory this implies that the same model structure can be used for many taxonomically related species for example ray finned fish seem to be well represented by a common model structure but differences in their model parameters lead to very different life cycles see e g lika et al 2014 marques et al 2018 once a deb model is reliably calibrated for a species the model can be used to predict life history traits as a function of environmental variables such as time varying temperature and food availability or even to reconstruct feeding history from measurements on field collected or cultured fish pecquerie et al 2012 stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 furthermore it is more meaningful to compare treatments e g feeding strategies or species or strains within species on the basis of deb model parameters than on the basis of some arbitrary trait at some arbitrary point in the life cycle lika et al 2014 marques et al 2018 deb models thereby offer many possibilities to optimise fish culturing however parametrising such a model for a species is not a trivial task especially for the so called standard deb model see jusup et al 2017 even though this task is supported by a parameter library rules for filling data gaps and dedicated software marques et al 2018 it is often difficult to establish a unique parametrisation for a species potter et al 2021 in this study we decided to use a simplified deb framework debkiss jager et al 2013 jager 2018 which has a tighter link to measurable properties and is therefore easier to apply for feeding life stages the debkiss framework provides a simple set of equations that works well for many species see list of publications at http www debtox info debkiss appl html for yolk feeding stages the model is less well tested though it performed excellently on literature data for early life stages of atlantic cod jager et al 2018 as well as eggs of pond snails jager et al 2013 in this study we report on our attempts to parametrise debkiss models for the yolk feeding stages of two cleaner fish species ballan wrasse l bergylta and lumpfish c lumpus a range of biometrical size weight and composition measurements were taken over early development as well as measurements of respiration rate essential for modelling of yolk feeding stages is a precise and accurate estimation of the biomass of yolk and structural tissue over development in practice this is complicated by the difficulty of separating the contributions of yolk and structure changes in shape over ontogeny the possibility for variations in water content and the often substantial variation between individuals even from the same batch of eggs length and body area measurement are for example relatively easy to obtain by imaging but have a rather uncertain relationship to biomass especially when the species changes in shape for a copepod example see jager et al 2021 this study should therefore be seen as preliminary to explore the usefulness of debkiss models for early life stages of these two species and to investigate to what extent imaging can be used to parametrise such models 2 methods 2 1 debkiss model the debkiss framework is described in detail elsewhere jager 2018 jager et al 2013 the special case for yolk feeding stages was presented and tested for atlantic cod by jager et al 2018 here we use those model equations without further modification given in supporting information which were implemented in the byom platform under matlab http debtox info byom html the mass flows in the model are shown in fig 1 and the model parameters are summarised in table 1 this table also provides the parameter estimates for atlantic cod as established by jager et al 2018 which will be used as reference our initial idea was to fit the debkiss model to the data obtained for cleaner fish however due to limitations in the data set and unexpected behaviour of these species we decided to stick to model simulations the parameter setting for the cleaner fish species table 1 is discussed in section 2 5 as shown in table 1 the model contains a number of primary parameters parameters directly related to the mass fluxes in the model as well as a range of auxiliary parameters e g conversions to make measured properties comparable to the model s state variables the primary parameters cannot be directly determined only indirectly from fitting the model to data auxiliary parameters and initial states may be directly estimated from observations and can sometimes be fitted to the data 2 2 experimental work ballan wrasse full details of the experiments are provided in the supporting information below a short overview is provided two series of experiments were performed an extensive experiment with 4 replicates for one batch of eggs bg1 and a more limited experiment no replication with eggs from five different sources var since there are no obvious differences between the var egg sources and no replication we decided to lump them for this analysis for each set of experiments there were two separate samplings for different destructive measurements the first series comprised measurements on 1 8 individuals combined covering eggs and yolk sac larvae measured variables as used for the analysis in this paper were total dry weight carbon content nitrogen content and respiration rate oxygen use the second series comprised imaging of individual larvae post hatch only determining yolk biometry area and length total body area standard length and length along the myotome at various time points 12 50 individuals were imaged only for the bg1 experiment there were also biometrical measurements on images from eggs total egg diameter and yolk diameter at various time points 6 15 individual eggs were measured 2 3 experimental work lumpfish full details are again provided in the supporting information a single experiment was conducted with eggs from five different sources here the results from only two egg batches are used eggs from wild caught animals the differences between the egg batches were small and the two selected batches provide representative results for the current analysis there were two separate samplings for different destructive measurements the first series comprised measurements in triplicate for each batch on 1 6 individuals combined covering eggs and larvae measured variables as used for the analysis in this paper were total dry weight carbon content nitrogen content and respiration rate oxygen use the second series comprised imaging of individual larvae post hatch only of yolk biometry ventral and side area body area ventral area without tail standard length ventral length without tail and lipid droplet area at only one time point 66 72 individuals were measured per egg batch there were also biometrical measurements on images of eggs at the start of the experiment total egg diameter 36 individual eggs were measured per egg batch 2 4 translation of biometry data the measurements made on the cleaner fish cannot be used directly for modelling the model s state variables are body dry mass and yolk dry mass which have not been separately measured therefore auxiliary hypotheses are needed to compare model output to observations see also jager et al 2021 full details are provided in the supporting information for wrasse the total volume of the egg was determined from the diameter of the egg excluding the gum layer assuming the egg is a sphere the yolk volume inside the egg was estimated using the relationships for a prolate spheroid from the two length measurements longest and shortest diameter for the larvae post hatch yolk sac volume was again calculated assuming a prolate spheroid but using length and projected yolk sac area the structural area of the larva was calculated as the total area minus the yolk sac area the structural area is combined with body length into a structural volume assuming the relationship for a cylinder for lumpfish different biometrical measurements were taken so the approach to derive volumes differs somewhat from that for wrasse the egg is again treated as a sphere and its volume calculated from the diameter for the larvae the yolk sac is rather oddly shaped we approach the shape by a general ellipsoid and estimated volume from the yolk sac s side area ventral area and length the yolk sac length was not measured in the images but estimated from side area by assuming that the projected area from the side is circular from the images it seems that the lipid droplet will be included in the volume calculated from the yolk sac area therefore lipid volume was estimated from its area assuming a sphere and subtracted from the yolk volume for the total body volume estimation is somewhat complex the larvae are rather tadpole like in shape with a large body and a narrow tail we estimate volume excluding the tail approximated by a cylinder volume is calculated from ventral length which excludes the tail and ventral area also excluding tail structural volume is calculated as total body volume minus lipid and yolk volumes this will underestimate true volume somewhat as the tail section is ignored for both species the measurements for dry weight carbon content and nitrogen content are for the total egg or larva and thus comprise contributions from yolk and structural body mass carbon and nitrogen content remains rather constant over early development which implies that yolk and structure have a similar composition in terms of these elements the dry weight measurement is used as is and can be compared to the sum of the two state variables in the model for the egg stages the chorion weight is added to the value of these two modelled states respiration is used as is and can be compared to sum of several dissipating mass fluxes in the model maintenance maturation and the overheads of growth full details in jager et al 2018 2 5 auxiliary model parameters and initial states 2 5 1 wrasse the carbon content of yolk and structure d c is needed to link oxygen use to the dissipated mass flux in the model carbon content was measured in both experiments and was rather constant at 0 46 mg mg since there was no clear change in carbon content over development the content in yolk and structure must be similar for the estimation of oxygen use an additional parameter is the respiratory quotient f r q the moles of co 2 eliminated per mole of o 2 taken up following jager et al 2018 we take 0 8 as a reasonable value hatching time could be directly observed in the experiments and is only used in the model in the calculation of the total dry weight the chorion and other egg materials such as the gum layer will contribute to weight for the egg stage only the actual temperatures in the two sets of experiments bg1 and var turned out to be slightly different and slightly different from the temperature at which the respiration rates where measured 10 c furthermore we want to relate our parameters to those for atlantic cod which were performed at 6 c therefore we need to apply temperature corrections we use the arrhenius relationship and derived the arrhenius temperature t a from literature data on hatching time at different temperatures d arcy et al 2012 see supporting information the shape correction factor δ m relates the standard length to the volumetric length the cubic root of structural body volume this factor could be established from the biometrical measurements on the larvae only and remained rather constant over time the value in the var experiment is slightly larger which likely relates to uncertainty in the volume estimation rather than to true differences in shape nevertheless we decided to use separate values for the current analysis both values are close to that for cod which indicates that the larvae of these two species have a similar shape we furthermore need initial values for the state variables weights of yolk and structure in the egg as well as weight of the chorion and additional egg materials that are not part of yolk or body structure as starting point we assume the same initial structural weight for wrasse as established for cod the initial yolk weight and chorion weight were manually tuned to provide an approximate match for the observations on initial yolk volume and total egg weight as well as for the drop in total dry weight at hatch relating biovolumes to mass requires estimates for the dry weight density of yolk and structure d b and d v we do not have measurements of volume and dry weight on the same animals and not always at the same time point however from the time points on which both measures are available we can use the means all measurements from the same test container to provide estimates for the density we cannot separate the dry weights for yolk and structure and therefore look at the development of the total density over time initially density will be dominated by yolk and at the end of the test by structure for eggs total density is the total measured dry weight divided by the egg volume egg volume is calculated from egg diameter excluding the gum layer but including chorion and perivitelline space therefore the total density can only provide approximate information about the densities of yolk and structure for the larvae total density is the total dry weight divided by the sum of the estimated volumes of yolk and structure the total density changes over time but we start by setting both yolk density and structural density to 0 25 mg mm 3 which provides a reasonable match to the initial total density of the egg and for the late yolk sac larvae 2 5 2 lumpfish the initial egg weight for lumpfish is much larger than for wrasse so we can safely assume that yolk and chorion represent the total mass there was a substantial difference in egg size between the two egg batches nr and rk2 so separate values will be used we calculated chorion weight from the average weight difference before t 21 days post fertilisation dpf and after hatch the initial yolk dry weight then follows from the total egg weight minus the chorion weight the shape correction coefficient was calculated from the standard length and the cubic root of estimated volume the latter excluding the tail the total density of the eggs is estimated at 0 28 mg mm 3 using only the data for t 7 dpf the total density of larvae shortly post hatch is also 0 28 mg mm 3 although we calculated the volume without tail we therefore start from the assumption that the density of both yolk and structure has this value carbon content remained rather constant at 0 49 mg mg incubation temperature was slightly lower than the temperature at which respiration was measured 10 c and we again want to use the reference temperature of 6 c to compare the results for lumpfish to wrasse and cod we used a default arrhenius temperature of 8000 k lika et al 2011 as no specific information for lumpfish could be found 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial model parametrisation the initial parametrisation for the auxiliary parameters and initial states is shown in table 1 these values were used to provide the model predictions in figs 3 and 4 the performance of the model will be discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 below we start with a discussion of the parametrisation 3 1 1 wrasse the initial yolk dry weight is somewhat smaller for wrasse than for cod which is to be expected as the eggs are also somewhat smaller the chorion of marine fish eggs makes up 10 33 of the egg dry weight lønning et al 1988 the tuned value here 0 025 mg on a total egg dry weight of approximately 0 09 mg would be at the upper end of that range the model predicts a sudden decrease in dry weight at hatch as the chorion is shed the data however indicate a more smooth decrease already before hatching fig 3 this may relate to degradation of the chorion and the gum layer surrounding the egg during incubation as a preparation to hatching thinning of the chorion before hatch was for example observed in halibut finn et al 1991 the results for the estimated total dry weight density are plotted in fig 2 for the egg stage density decreases somewhat over time which likely relates to burning of yolk as the transformation into structure is less than 100 efficient while the total egg diameter remains constant the yolk density of 0 25 mg mm 3 is much higher than the value established for cod this reflects a typical difference in yolk hydration between pelagic and demersal eggs craik and harvey 1986 it is good to realise that the density of the fresh egg does not necessarily equal the density of yolk the estimated volume of the total egg excluding the gum layers is approximately 0 4 mm 3 while the yolk makes up some 0 25 mm 3 the rest is structure chorion and perivitelline space however since the largest part of the egg is yolk the initial dry weight density of yolk should not be radically different from 0 25 mg mm 3 the value is also well in line with the observations of finn et al 2002 who report an initial egg water content of 76 implying a density of 0 24 mg mm 3 at hatching density jumps up and decreases over the remainder of the experiment this is rather surprising as we assumed equal densities for yolk and structure of 0 25 mg mm 3 table 1 both observations are clearly inconsistent with equal and constant densities the jump at hatching indicates that yolk has a much higher density close to hatch than initially in the egg if yolk decreases in density the remaining space inside the egg will be filled with water since total egg volume remains constant which is lost at hatching after hatching there is a decline in density which is especially prominent in var such a decline in total density could relate to the decreasing contribution of high density yolk in the larva over development to explain the observed changes in total density we would require substantially different values than those in table 1 with a large difference between d v and d b to provide an approximate match fig 2 we would need to set d v 0 15 the value established for cod and d b 0 80 mg mm 3 this value for yolk implies a water content of just 20 which seems unrealistic however it is possible that the density of structural tissues changes as well from feeding experiments with wrasse larvae unpublished results the estimated density rapidly decreased from some 0 17 0 18 mg mm 3 after disappearance of the yolk sac to a rather constant 0 12 mg mm 3 for later stages changes in water content shortly post hatch have been documented for other species for example escaffre and bergot 1984 report a steady increase in water content of trout both in terms of structural tissues and yolk after hatching more direct measurements would be needed to address this issue and to quantify the hypothesised changes in water content over early development 3 1 2 lumpfish for the lumpfish the opacity of the egg precluded biometrical measurements during the egg stage on larvae furthermore measurements were only performed at one time point immediately post hatch therefore this data set is rather limited for the purpose of bioenergetic modelling the initial parametrisation is mostly based on direct observations the densities of structure and yolk both estimated at 0 28 mg mm 3 as well as the carbon content are similar to those established for wrasse for the lumpfish the structural density is also considerably larger than for cod lumpfish eggs are also demersal just like the wrasse eggs the data set does not allow identifying changes in water content over development however feeding experiments with lumpfish larvae after yolk sac disappearance unpublished results yielded an estimated density decreasing from some 0 20 to 0 13 mg mm 3 therefore it is likely that also for this species there are changes in water content over early development hatching time is much larger than for wrasse as well as cod and the larva hatches in a more developed state this difference in early development is permitted by the much larger eggs of the lumpfish containing more yolk the shape correction coefficient was larger than for wrasse which indicates a more rounded animal which is consistent with the visual appearance of the larvae 3 2 general pattern in yolk depletion first we can compare the general patterns in the data set to the model expectations fig 3 most strikingly the pattern of yolk depletion is completely different from the model expectation the model predicts an increasing absolute rate of yolk use over development as the assimilation of yolk only depends on the structural size of the embryo or larva the data for wrasse however show a rapid initial yolk depletion over the first three days followed by an extended period of very slow utilisation the rapid initial phase makes little sense only the structural part of the embryo utilises yolk and this part is initially too small to use yolk at the rate indicated by the decrease in yolk volume furthermore rapid metabolic usage of yolk should have led to a substantial peak in oxygen use which was not observed the only logical explanation is that the water content of yolk does not remain constant but rapidly decreases over the first week of the experiment this is consistent with the observed jump in density at hatching in fig 2 the extended period of very slow yolk utilisation roughly in the second week of the experiment also requires further scrutiny yolk is not even completely depleted by the end of the experiment 16 dpf while length growth stops around 11 dpf already note that body length likely provides a better indicator for structural growth than body volume especially given the strong signs of changes in water content this prolonged yolk utilisation is not in line with the assumptions of the debkiss model yolk is assumed to be assimilated at the maximum rate that the embryo is capable of given its current structural mass the rate of yolk depletion will thus increase as the embryonic structure grows and stop suddenly when the yolk is fully depleted this prediction was consistent with the data for cod embryos jager et al 2018 but clearly not with our wrasse data also for other fish species structural size was observed to reach a maximum before yolk would completely run out and final yolk resorption was relatively slow for example in trout escaffre and bergot 1984 and three tropical marine fish species bagarinao 1986 several authors have speculated that the rate of yolk use depends on the size or surface area of the yolk sac rather than the embryos structural size e g beer and anderson 1997 for salmonids this pattern may also reflect a strategy whereby the larva prioritises survival under uncertain food conditions at the expense of growth on the other hand it is possible that the yolk sac is still present but that there is no yolk left inside in fact we are assuming that the estimated volume of the yolk sac from side view images represents the volume of yolk present in the larva unfortunately we have no way to test these competing hypotheses from the current data set this would likely require dissection of the egg and extraction of the yolk sac content clearly the pattern in yolk depletion cannot be matched by the model the initial rapid decrease in yolk volume the slow rate of yolk use in larvae and the stop of length growth before yolk runs out cannot be captured these observed patterns in wrasse are very different from those of atlantic cod for which the model was successfully tested jager et al 2018 if this pattern of yolk depletion is real and not an artefact due to the use of imaging it would require structural model modifications it is good to realise that the debkiss model is simplified relative to the standard deb models in debkiss the yolk sac represent a buffer of food that is assimilated by the embryo while in standard deb it is part of the reserve that is mobilised in standard deb models the embryo s reserve compartment is thus partitioned in two fractions the yolk sac and an internalised reserve this complicates interpretation of yolk volume in relation to growth if there is no internalised reserve and yolk would represent the entire reserve growth would indeed decrease and stop before the yolk sac is completely depleted however this situation seems unlikely for two reasons firstly the maternal effects rule of standard deb lika et al 2011 states that reserve density at birth start of exogenous feeding equals that of the mother at egg production assuming that the eggs came from a well fed culture and assuming that birth coincides with the complete depletion of the yolk sac we would expect the internal reserve of the larva at birth to be sufficient to support growth for a while thus exaggerating the mismatch between model and data secondly the reserve in deb theory should not be seen as storage for later use reserve compounds can play active metabolic roles kooijman 2001 for example ribosomal rna should at least partly be considered as a reserve compound reserve is thus closely integrated with structure therefore it seems unlikely that reserve can be restricted to the yolk sac for fish larvae a stop of structural growth before the yolk sac runs out is thus also not a straightforward result from standard deb models the observations on wrasse early life stages force us to reconsider our modelling efforts the data strongly suggest that deb models require some modification to the auxiliary hypotheses e g allowing changes in water content of yolk and structure over early ontogeny furthermore it is likely that modifications to the model structure are needed as well e g allowing the rate of yolk usage to be affected by the size of the yolk sac unfortunately the current data set is not strong enough to test alternative modelling options 3 3 comparison of data and model 3 3 1 wrasse the model is compared to the observations in fig 3 the observations on standard length total dry weight and oxygen use are shown as is individual measurements are shown which reveals that the variation is quite reasonable since the overall pattern of the data cannot be matched by the model as explained in section 3 2 it makes no sense to try to fit model parameters instead we base the auxiliary parameters on the observations in the experiments with wrasse as explained in section 2 5 for the primary parameters we remain as close as possible to the values for cod only the assimilation rate was increased by hand to provide an approximate fit to the data for standard length this parameter turned out to be the only single parameter where a modification was sufficient to provide a reasonable correspondence together with the changes in initial yolk and chorion weight see section 2 5 it is good to stress that the value for the assimilation rate needed to provide correspondence to the data is strongly dependent on the value for the dry weight density of structure d v which is quite uncertain see section 3 1 1 all parameters used are shown in table 1 the length growth over time is well captured by the model however as already discussed this is possibly for the wrong reason length growth in the model stops when yolk runs out but in the data it stops well before yolk is depleted it is good to realise that no external food is supplied in these experiments therefore after yolk runs out in the model maintenance costs will need to be paid from burning structure and the larvae shrink even though the animal will shrink in terms of structural biomass there will be no shrinking in length since length is determined by the notochord that resists shrinking on structural volume basis however we expect to see shrinking surprisingly the data do not show this total body weight indeed shows a decrease but structural volume shows a tendency to increase most strikingly for var an increase in volume without corresponding increases in dry weight or length indicates an increase in the water content of the structural tissues as also indicated for total density in fig 2 the stop of growth also implies a drop in oxygen use in the model since the overhead costs for growth are an important contribution to respiration however the data do not show such a rapid reduction but rather a plateau in respiration the initial part of the respiration curve up to point where yolk is expected to run out around 10 dpf is consistent with the model predictions however the rapid decrease after that is not shown in the data it is possible that the growth costs are lower than assumed in the model or that the animals increase their swimming activity at this point e g attempting to find prey or due to stress in the respiration chamber the importance of swimming activity was also indicated for larvae of cod finn et al 1995 showed a markedly higher respiration rate for cod larvae after the yolk sac ran out when kept in light conditions compared to dark conditions the debkiss model provided a good match to the respiration rates under dark conditions jager et al 2018 in this study measurements were done in the light which may explain the observed discrepancy 3 3 2 lumpfish fig 4 compares the model predictions to the observations the data are extremely limited but the model is able to provide a very good explanation for these data with the same primary parameters as for wrasse this is somewhat surprising since the early life history of the two species is quite different lumpfish has a much larger egg and the larva hatches at a more developed stage and with a very different shape from the wrasse larvae nevertheless the model analysis shows that this difference may be mainly caused by additional yolk provisioning in the egg and a delayed hatching 4 conclusions despite the previous success of applying the debkiss model to early life stages of atlantic cod the model fails to capture the patterns for ballan wrasse the main issues are related to substantial changes in the water content of both yolk and structure over development and the stop of growth before the yolk sac disappears these issues require model modifications and further experimental work to address especially direct measurements or more efficient proxies for the dry mass of yolk and structure separately imaging provides an excellent approach to estimate volumes of parts of eggs and larvae but when water content changes over development this information does not suffice with more detailed observations there is a basis for testing various hypotheses regarding these deviating patterns nevertheless apart from the pattern of yolk depletion the model provides a reasonable explanation of all traits simultaneously this indicates that model modification may only need to be minor the auxiliary parameters were set to best estimates for wrasse whereas the primary parameters were mostly kept at the values established for cod only the specific assimilation rate needed to be substantially larger for wrasse a factor of 1 7 however it is good to note that this parameter is particularly sensitive to the value for the density of structure which is quite uncertain and likely changing over early ontogeny for lumpfish the data set is quite limited for testing of the debkiss model nevertheless the data are consistent with the model using species specific auxiliary parameters and initial yolk weight but the same primary parameters as for wrasse this indicates that primary parameter values may not differ too much between fish species at least not for the early development stages in fact the conspicuous difference in early life history between wrasse and lumpfish seems to be explainable from the substantial difference in yolk provisioning of the egg the debkiss model is a simple and promising model for the bioenergetics of fish early life stages however its application and in depth testing is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining detailed measurements on these life stages this is especially true for lumpfish where the opacity of the egg precludes biometrical analysis of yolk and structural biomass for both species there is a need for more direct estimation of yolk and structural dry weight it is good to realise that even rather substantial data sets may still leave open questions which require literature data educated guesses or specific experimental work nevertheless bioenergetic modelling

debkiss ballan wrasse lumpfish biometry early life stages 1 introduction the salmon louse lepeophtheirus salmonis threatens commercial salmon farming in norwegian waters as an environmentally friendly treatment strategy the use of cleaner fish such as ballan wrasse labrus bergylta ascanius 1767 and lumpfish cyclopterus lumpus linnaeus 1758 has been proposed however to be safe and sustainable the cleaner fish would have to be cultured rather than caught in the wild efficient production of fish requires a thorough knowledge of the life history of the species and how environmental factors such as food and temperature affect it this is especially true for the early life stages which form a bottleneck for fish culturing dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2001 jusup et al 2017 can help to quantitatively understand a species life history in a integrated framework for metabolic organisation the theory is generic covering all life forms on the planet and has found extensive application in aquaculture e g føre et al 2016 stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 the theory is structured around the laws for mass and energy conservation resources are taken up from the environment and are subsequently used for the energy demanding processes such as growth development and maintenance deb theory provides a set of simple rules for the intake and allocation of resources across the various processes these rules vary only little between species species mainly differ in the magnitudes of the various fluxes for practical models derived from the theory this implies that the same model structure can be used for many taxonomically related species for example ray finned fish seem to be well represented by a common model structure but differences in their model parameters lead to very different life cycles see e g lika et al 2014 marques et al 2018 once a deb model is reliably calibrated for a species the model can be used to predict life history traits as a function of environmental variables such as time varying temperature and food availability or even to reconstruct feeding history from measurements on field collected or cultured fish pecquerie et al 2012 stavrakidis zachou et al 2019 furthermore it is more meaningful to compare treatments e g feeding strategies or species or strains within species on the basis of deb model parameters than on the basis of some arbitrary trait at some arbitrary point in the life cycle lika et al 2014 marques et al 2018 deb models thereby offer many possibilities to optimise fish culturing however parametrising such a model for a species is not a trivial task especially for the so called standard deb model see jusup et al 2017 even though this task is supported by a parameter library rules for filling data gaps and dedicated software marques et al 2018 it is often difficult to establish a unique parametrisation for a species potter et al 2021 in this study we decided to use a simplified deb framework debkiss jager et al 2013 jager 2018 which has a tighter link to measurable properties and is therefore easier to apply for feeding life stages the debkiss framework provides a simple set of equations that works well for many species see list of publications at http www debtox info debkiss appl html for yolk feeding stages the model is less well tested though it performed excellently on literature data for early life stages of atlantic cod jager et al 2018 as well as eggs of pond snails jager et al 2013 in this study we report on our attempts to parametrise debkiss models for the yolk feeding stages of two cleaner fish species ballan wrasse l bergylta and lumpfish c lumpus a range of biometrical size weight and composition measurements were taken over early development as well as measurements of respiration rate essential for modelling of yolk feeding stages is a precise and accurate estimation of the biomass of yolk and structural tissue over development in practice this is complicated by the difficulty of separating the contributions of yolk and structure changes in shape over ontogeny the possibility for variations in water content and the often substantial variation between individuals even from the same batch of eggs length and body area measurement are for example relatively easy to obtain by imaging but have a rather uncertain relationship to biomass especially when the species changes in shape for a copepod example see jager et al 2021 this study should therefore be seen as preliminary to explore the usefulness of debkiss models for early life stages of these two species and to investigate to what extent imaging can be used to parametrise such models 2 methods 2 1 debkiss model the debkiss framework is described in detail elsewhere jager 2018 jager et al 2013 the special case for yolk feeding stages was presented and tested for atlantic cod by jager et al 2018 here we use those model equations without further modification given in supporting information which were implemented in the byom platform under matlab http debtox info byom html the mass flows in the model are shown in fig 1 and the model parameters are summarised in table 1 this table also provides the parameter estimates for atlantic cod as established by jager et al 2018 which will be used as reference our initial idea was to fit the debkiss model to the data obtained for cleaner fish however due to limitations in the data set and unexpected behaviour of these species we decided to stick to model simulations the parameter setting for the cleaner fish species table 1 is discussed in section 2 5 as shown in table 1 the model contains a number of primary parameters parameters directly related to the mass fluxes in the model as well as a range of auxiliary parameters e g conversions to make measured properties comparable to the model s state variables the primary parameters cannot be directly determined only indirectly from fitting the model to data auxiliary parameters and initial states may be directly estimated from observations and can sometimes be fitted to the data 2 2 experimental work ballan wrasse full details of the experiments are provided in the supporting information below a short overview is provided two series of experiments were performed an extensive experiment with 4 replicates for one batch of eggs bg1 and a more limited experiment no replication with eggs from five different sources var since there are no obvious differences between the var egg sources and no replication we decided to lump them for this analysis for each set of experiments there were two separate samplings for different destructive measurements the first series comprised measurements on 1 8 individuals combined covering eggs and yolk sac larvae measured variables as used for the analysis in this paper were total dry weight carbon content nitrogen content and respiration rate oxygen use the second series comprised imaging of individual larvae post hatch only determining yolk biometry area and length total body area standard length and length along the myotome at various time points 12 50 individuals were imaged only for the bg1 experiment there were also biometrical measurements on images from eggs total egg diameter and yolk diameter at various time points 6 15 individual eggs were measured 2 3 experimental work lumpfish full details are again provided in the supporting information a single experiment was conducted with eggs from five different sources here the results from only two egg batches are used eggs from wild caught animals the differences between the egg batches were small and the two selected batches provide representative results for the current analysis there were two separate samplings for different destructive measurements the first series comprised measurements in triplicate for each batch on 1 6 individuals combined covering eggs and larvae measured variables as used for the analysis in this paper were total dry weight carbon content nitrogen content and respiration rate oxygen use the second series comprised imaging of individual larvae post hatch only of yolk biometry ventral and side area body area ventral area without tail standard length ventral length without tail and lipid droplet area at only one time point 66 72 individuals were measured per egg batch there were also biometrical measurements on images of eggs at the start of the experiment total egg diameter 36 individual eggs were measured per egg batch 2 4 translation of biometry data the measurements made on the cleaner fish cannot be used directly for modelling the model s state variables are body dry mass and yolk dry mass which have not been separately measured therefore auxiliary hypotheses are needed to compare model output to observations see also jager et al 2021 full details are provided in the supporting information for wrasse the total volume of the egg was determined from the diameter of the egg excluding the gum layer assuming the egg is a sphere the yolk volume inside the egg was estimated using the relationships for a prolate spheroid from the two length measurements longest and shortest diameter for the larvae post hatch yolk sac volume was again calculated assuming a prolate spheroid but using length and projected yolk sac area the structural area of the larva was calculated as the total area minus the yolk sac area the structural area is combined with body length into a structural volume assuming the relationship for a cylinder for lumpfish different biometrical measurements were taken so the approach to derive volumes differs somewhat from that for wrasse the egg is again treated as a sphere and its volume calculated from the diameter for the larvae the yolk sac is rather oddly shaped we approach the shape by a general ellipsoid and estimated volume from the yolk sac s side area ventral area and length the yolk sac length was not measured in the images but estimated from side area by assuming that the projected area from the side is circular from the images it seems that the lipid droplet will be included in the volume calculated from the yolk sac area therefore lipid volume was estimated from its area assuming a sphere and subtracted from the yolk volume for the total body volume estimation is somewhat complex the larvae are rather tadpole like in shape with a large body and a narrow tail we estimate volume excluding the tail approximated by a cylinder volume is calculated from ventral length which excludes the tail and ventral area also excluding tail structural volume is calculated as total body volume minus lipid and yolk volumes this will underestimate true volume somewhat as the tail section is ignored for both species the measurements for dry weight carbon content and nitrogen content are for the total egg or larva and thus comprise contributions from yolk and structural body mass carbon and nitrogen content remains rather constant over early development which implies that yolk and structure have a similar composition in terms of these elements the dry weight measurement is used as is and can be compared to the sum of the two state variables in the model for the egg stages the chorion weight is added to the value of these two modelled states respiration is used as is and can be compared to sum of several dissipating mass fluxes in the model maintenance maturation and the overheads of growth full details in jager et al 2018 2 5 auxiliary model parameters and initial states 2 5 1 wrasse the carbon content of yolk and structure d c is needed to link oxygen use to the dissipated mass flux in the model carbon content was measured in both experiments and was rather constant at 0 46 mg mg since there was no clear change in carbon content over development the content in yolk and structure must be similar for the estimation of oxygen use an additional parameter is the respiratory quotient f r q the moles of co 2 eliminated per mole of o 2 taken up following jager et al 2018 we take 0 8 as a reasonable value hatching time could be directly observed in the experiments and is only used in the model in the calculation of the total dry weight the chorion and other egg materials such as the gum layer will contribute to weight for the egg stage only the actual temperatures in the two sets of experiments bg1 and var turned out to be slightly different and slightly different from the temperature at which the respiration rates where measured 10 c furthermore we want to relate our parameters to those for atlantic cod which were performed at 6 c therefore we need to apply temperature corrections we use the arrhenius relationship and derived the arrhenius temperature t a from literature data on hatching time at different temperatures d arcy et al 2012 see supporting information the shape correction factor δ m relates the standard length to the volumetric length the cubic root of structural body volume this factor could be established from the biometrical measurements on the larvae only and remained rather constant over time the value in the var experiment is slightly larger which likely relates to uncertainty in the volume estimation rather than to true differences in shape nevertheless we decided to use separate values for the current analysis both values are close to that for cod which indicates that the larvae of these two species have a similar shape we furthermore need initial values for the state variables weights of yolk and structure in the egg as well as weight of the chorion and additional egg materials that are not part of yolk or body structure as starting point we assume the same initial structural weight for wrasse as established for cod the initial yolk weight and chorion weight were manually tuned to provide an approximate match for the observations on initial yolk volume and total egg weight as well as for the drop in total dry weight at hatch relating biovolumes to mass requires estimates for the dry weight density of yolk and structure d b and d v we do not have measurements of volume and dry weight on the same animals and not always at the same time point however from the time points on which both measures are available we can use the means all measurements from the same test container to provide estimates for the density we cannot separate the dry weights for yolk and structure and therefore look at the development of the total density over time initially density will be dominated by yolk and at the end of the test by structure for eggs total density is the total measured dry weight divided by the egg volume egg volume is calculated from egg diameter excluding the gum layer but including chorion and perivitelline space therefore the total density can only provide approximate information about the densities of yolk and structure for the larvae total density is the total dry weight divided by the sum of the estimated volumes of yolk and structure the total density changes over time but we start by setting both yolk density and structural density to 0 25 mg mm 3 which provides a reasonable match to the initial total density of the egg and for the late yolk sac larvae 2 5 2 lumpfish the initial egg weight for lumpfish is much larger than for wrasse so we can safely assume that yolk and chorion represent the total mass there was a substantial difference in egg size between the two egg batches nr and rk2 so separate values will be used we calculated chorion weight from the average weight difference before t 21 days post fertilisation dpf and after hatch the initial yolk dry weight then follows from the total egg weight minus the chorion weight the shape correction coefficient was calculated from the standard length and the cubic root of estimated volume the latter excluding the tail the total density of the eggs is estimated at 0 28 mg mm 3 using only the data for t 7 dpf the total density of larvae shortly post hatch is also 0 28 mg mm 3 although we calculated the volume without tail we therefore start from the assumption that the density of both yolk and structure has this value carbon content remained rather constant at 0 49 mg mg incubation temperature was slightly lower than the temperature at which respiration was measured 10 c and we again want to use the reference temperature of 6 c to compare the results for lumpfish to wrasse and cod we used a default arrhenius temperature of 8000 k lika et al 2011 as no specific information for lumpfish could be found 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial model parametrisation the initial parametrisation for the auxiliary parameters and initial states is shown in table 1 these values were used to provide the model predictions in figs 3 and 4 the performance of the model will be discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 below we start with a discussion of the parametrisation 3 1 1 wrasse the initial yolk dry weight is somewhat smaller for wrasse than for cod which is to be expected as the eggs are also somewhat smaller the chorion of marine fish eggs makes up 10 33 of the egg dry weight lønning et al 1988 the tuned value here 0 025 mg on a total egg dry weight of approximately 0 09 mg would be at the upper end of that range the model predicts a sudden decrease in dry weight at hatch as the chorion is shed the data however indicate a more smooth decrease already before hatching fig 3 this may relate to degradation of the chorion and the gum layer surrounding the egg during incubation as a preparation to hatching thinning of the chorion before hatch was for example observed in halibut finn et al 1991 the results for the estimated total dry weight density are plotted in fig 2 for the egg stage density decreases somewhat over time which likely relates to burning of yolk as the transformation into structure is less than 100 efficient while the total egg diameter remains constant the yolk density of 0 25 mg mm 3 is much higher than the value established for cod this reflects a typical difference in yolk hydration between pelagic and demersal eggs craik and harvey 1986 it is good to realise that the density of the fresh egg does not necessarily equal the density of yolk the estimated volume of the total egg excluding the gum layers is approximately 0 4 mm 3 while the yolk makes up some 0 25 mm 3 the rest is structure chorion and perivitelline space however since the largest part of the egg is yolk the initial dry weight density of yolk should not be radically different from 0 25 mg mm 3 the value is also well in line with the observations of finn et al 2002 who report an initial egg water content of 76 implying a density of 0 24 mg mm 3 at hatching density jumps up and decreases over the remainder of the experiment this is rather surprising as we assumed equal densities for yolk and structure of 0 25 mg mm 3 table 1 both observations are clearly inconsistent with equal and constant densities the jump at hatching indicates that yolk has a much higher density close to hatch than initially in the egg if yolk decreases in density the remaining space inside the egg will be filled with water since total egg volume remains constant which is lost at hatching after hatching there is a decline in density which is especially prominent in var such a decline in total density could relate to the decreasing contribution of high density yolk in the larva over development to explain the observed changes in total density we would require substantially different values than those in table 1 with a large difference between d v and d b to provide an approximate match fig 2 we would need to set d v 0 15 the value established for cod and d b 0 80 mg mm 3 this value for yolk implies a water content of just 20 which seems unrealistic however it is possible that the density of structural tissues changes as well from feeding experiments with wrasse larvae unpublished results the estimated density rapidly decreased from some 0 17 0 18 mg mm 3 after disappearance of the yolk sac to a rather constant 0 12 mg mm 3 for later stages changes in water content shortly post hatch have been documented for other species for example escaffre and bergot 1984 report a steady increase in water content of trout both in terms of structural tissues and yolk after hatching more direct measurements would be needed to address this issue and to quantify the hypothesised changes in water content over early development 3 1 2 lumpfish for the lumpfish the opacity of the egg precluded biometrical measurements during the egg stage on larvae furthermore measurements were only performed at one time point immediately post hatch therefore this data set is rather limited for the purpose of bioenergetic modelling the initial parametrisation is mostly based on direct observations the densities of structure and yolk both estimated at 0 28 mg mm 3 as well as the carbon content are similar to those established for wrasse for the lumpfish the structural density is also considerably larger than for cod lumpfish eggs are also demersal just like the wrasse eggs the data set does not allow identifying changes in water content over development however feeding experiments with lumpfish larvae after yolk sac disappearance unpublished results yielded an estimated density decreasing from some 0 20 to 0 13 mg mm 3 therefore it is likely that also for this species there are changes in water content over early development hatching time is much larger than for wrasse as well as cod and the larva hatches in a more developed state this difference in early development is permitted by the much larger eggs of the lumpfish containing more yolk the shape correction coefficient was larger than for wrasse which indicates a more rounded animal which is consistent with the visual appearance of the larvae 3 2 general pattern in yolk depletion first we can compare the general patterns in the data set to the model expectations fig 3 most strikingly the pattern of yolk depletion is completely different from the model expectation the model predicts an increasing absolute rate of yolk use over development as the assimilation of yolk only depends on the structural size of the embryo or larva the data for wrasse however show a rapid initial yolk depletion over the first three days followed by an extended period of very slow utilisation the rapid initial phase makes little sense only the structural part of the embryo utilises yolk and this part is initially too small to use yolk at the rate indicated by the decrease in yolk volume furthermore rapid metabolic usage of yolk should have led to a substantial peak in oxygen use which was not observed the only logical explanation is that the water content of yolk does not remain constant but rapidly decreases over the first week of the experiment this is consistent with the observed jump in density at hatching in fig 2 the extended period of very slow yolk utilisation roughly in the second week of the experiment also requires further scrutiny yolk is not even completely depleted by the end of the experiment 16 dpf while length growth stops around 11 dpf already note that body length likely provides a better indicator for structural growth than body volume especially given the strong signs of changes in water content this prolonged yolk utilisation is not in line with the assumptions of the debkiss model yolk is assumed to be assimilated at the maximum rate that the embryo is capable of given its current structural mass the rate of yolk depletion will thus increase as the embryonic structure grows and stop suddenly when the yolk is fully depleted this prediction was consistent with the data for cod embryos jager et al 2018 but clearly not with our wrasse data also for other fish species structural size was observed to reach a maximum before yolk would completely run out and final yolk resorption was relatively slow for example in trout escaffre and bergot 1984 and three tropical marine fish species bagarinao 1986 several authors have speculated that the rate of yolk use depends on the size or surface area of the yolk sac rather than the embryos structural size e g beer and anderson 1997 for salmonids this pattern may also reflect a strategy whereby the larva prioritises survival under uncertain food conditions at the expense of growth on the other hand it is possible that the yolk sac is still present but that there is no yolk left inside in fact we are assuming that the estimated volume of the yolk sac from side view images represents the volume of yolk present in the larva unfortunately we have no way to test these competing hypotheses from the current data set this would likely require dissection of the egg and extraction of the yolk sac content clearly the pattern in yolk depletion cannot be matched by the model the initial rapid decrease in yolk volume the slow rate of yolk use in larvae and the stop of length growth before yolk runs out cannot be captured these observed patterns in wrasse are very different from those of atlantic cod for which the model was successfully tested jager et al 2018 if this pattern of yolk depletion is real and not an artefact due to the use of imaging it would require structural model modifications it is good to realise that the debkiss model is simplified relative to the standard deb models in debkiss the yolk sac represent a buffer of food that is assimilated by the embryo while in standard deb it is part of the reserve that is mobilised in standard deb models the embryo s reserve compartment is thus partitioned in two fractions the yolk sac and an internalised reserve this complicates interpretation of yolk volume in relation to growth if there is no internalised reserve and yolk would represent the entire reserve growth would indeed decrease and stop before the yolk sac is completely depleted however this situation seems unlikely for two reasons firstly the maternal effects rule of standard deb lika et al 2011 states that reserve density at birth start of exogenous feeding equals that of the mother at egg production assuming that the eggs came from a well fed culture and assuming that birth coincides with the complete depletion of the yolk sac we would expect the internal reserve of the larva at birth to be sufficient to support growth for a while thus exaggerating the mismatch between model and data secondly the reserve in deb theory should not be seen as storage for later use reserve compounds can play active metabolic roles kooijman 2001 for example ribosomal rna should at least partly be considered as a reserve compound reserve is thus closely integrated with structure therefore it seems unlikely that reserve can be restricted to the yolk sac for fish larvae a stop of structural growth before the yolk sac runs out is thus also not a straightforward result from standard deb models the observations on wrasse early life stages force us to reconsider our modelling efforts the data strongly suggest that deb models require some modification to the auxiliary hypotheses e g allowing changes in water content of yolk and structure over early ontogeny furthermore it is likely that modifications to the model structure are needed as well e g allowing the rate of yolk usage to be affected by the size of the yolk sac unfortunately the current data set is not strong enough to test alternative modelling options 3 3 comparison of data and model 3 3 1 wrasse the model is compared to the observations in fig 3 the observations on standard length total dry weight and oxygen use are shown as is individual measurements are shown which reveals that the variation is quite reasonable since the overall pattern of the data cannot be matched by the model as explained in section 3 2 it makes no sense to try to fit model parameters instead we base the auxiliary parameters on the observations in the experiments with wrasse as explained in section 2 5 for the primary parameters we remain as close as possible to the values for cod only the assimilation rate was increased by hand to provide an approximate fit to the data for standard length this parameter turned out to be the only single parameter where a modification was sufficient to provide a reasonable correspondence together with the changes in initial yolk and chorion weight see section 2 5 it is good to stress that the value for the assimilation rate needed to provide correspondence to the data is strongly dependent on the value for the dry weight density of structure d v which is quite uncertain see section 3 1 1 all parameters used are shown in table 1 the length growth over time is well captured by the model however as already discussed this is possibly for the wrong reason length growth in the model stops when yolk runs out but in the data it stops well before yolk is depleted it is good to realise that no external food is supplied in these experiments therefore after yolk runs out in the model maintenance costs will need to be paid from burning structure and the larvae shrink even though the animal will shrink in terms of structural biomass there will be no shrinking in length since length is determined by the notochord that resists shrinking on structural volume basis however we expect to see shrinking surprisingly the data do not show this total body weight indeed shows a decrease but structural volume shows a tendency to increase most strikingly for var an increase in volume without corresponding increases in dry weight or length indicates an increase in the water content of the structural tissues as also indicated for total density in fig 2 the stop of growth also implies a drop in oxygen use in the model since the overhead costs for growth are an important contribution to respiration however the data do not show such a rapid reduction but rather a plateau in respiration the initial part of the respiration curve up to point where yolk is expected to run out around 10 dpf is consistent with the model predictions however the rapid decrease after that is not shown in the data it is possible that the growth costs are lower than assumed in the model or that the animals increase their swimming activity at this point e g attempting to find prey or due to stress in the respiration chamber the importance of swimming activity was also indicated for larvae of cod finn et al 1995 showed a markedly higher respiration rate for cod larvae after the yolk sac ran out when kept in light conditions compared to dark conditions the debkiss model provided a good match to the respiration rates under dark conditions jager et al 2018 in this study measurements were done in the light which may explain the observed discrepancy 3 3 2 lumpfish fig 4 compares the model predictions to the observations the data are extremely limited but the model is able to provide a very good explanation for these data with the same primary parameters as for wrasse this is somewhat surprising since the early life history of the two species is quite different lumpfish has a much larger egg and the larva hatches at a more developed stage and with a very different shape from the wrasse larvae nevertheless the model analysis shows that this difference may be mainly caused by additional yolk provisioning in the egg and a delayed hatching 4 conclusions despite the previous success of applying the debkiss model to early life stages of atlantic cod the model fails to capture the patterns for ballan wrasse the main issues are related to substantial changes in the water content of both yolk and structure over development and the stop of growth before the yolk sac disappears these issues require model modifications and further experimental work to address especially direct measurements or more efficient proxies for the dry mass of yolk and structure separately imaging provides an excellent approach to estimate volumes of parts of eggs and larvae but when water content changes over development this information does not suffice with more detailed observations there is a basis for testing various hypotheses regarding these deviating patterns nevertheless apart from the pattern of yolk depletion the model provides a reasonable explanation of all traits simultaneously this indicates that model modification may only need to be minor the auxiliary parameters were set to best estimates for wrasse whereas the primary parameters were mostly kept at the values established for cod only the specific assimilation rate needed to be substantially larger for wrasse a factor of 1 7 however it is good to note that this parameter is particularly sensitive to the value for the density of structure which is quite uncertain and likely changing over early ontogeny for lumpfish the data set is quite limited for testing of the debkiss model nevertheless the data are consistent with the model using species specific auxiliary parameters and initial yolk weight but the same primary parameters as for wrasse this indicates that primary parameter values may not differ too much between fish species at least not for the early development stages in fact the conspicuous difference in early life history between wrasse and lumpfish seems to be explainable from the substantial difference in yolk provisioning of the egg the debkiss model is a simple and promising model for the bioenergetics of fish early life stages however its application and in depth testing is hampered by the difficulties of obtaining detailed measurements on these life stages this is especially true for lumpfish where the opacity of the egg precludes biometrical analysis of yolk and structural biomass for both species there is a need for more direct estimation of yolk and structural dry weight it is good to realise that even rather substantial data sets may still leave open questions which require literature data educated guesses or specific experimental work nevertheless bioenergetic modelling

studying these relations are gaining ground a socio ecological systems ses perspective therefore embraces both social and environmental factors that uses nonlinearities feedbacks models and multi level networks for understanding and studying those phenomena when undesired drivers as climate change are also taken into account the most urgent question is how these critical socio ecological systems will behave given the stresses they endure this work had the objective of creating a new simulation of a coastal ses from brazil that is able to integrate several climatic and social variables through a dynamic and coupled model and forecast its behavior in the future according to scenarios specifically a systems dynamics simulation model using mimes multiscale integrated model of ecosystem services was developed for ubatuba a coastal city highly dependent and influenced by tourism results showed good correspondence between the model and the data when testing several environmental inputs wind speed and direction cloud cover sea surface temperature precipitation patterns the model simulated the population dynamics of 15 biological groups from 2010 to 2100 under different scenarios climate change will reduce most of populations in a range from 0 13 0 0 to 10 31 0 0 there are groups where the influence of climate change is not significant bivalve brachyuran pelagic feeding fish and benthic feeding fish with variations from 0 to 2 and others with moderate significance phytoplankton zooplankton and enterococcus with variations 2 tourists reacting to water quality degradation is very relevant in enterococcus population with a reduction of 34 results show the urban activities strongly influencing the biological populations and that these impacts depend on the scenario context this suggests a policy that limits the number of tourists and increases the water quality at the same time therefore the model s spatial simulation of this complex socio ecological system can be used to develop an integrative decision making tool to help the city manage its natural capital and adapt to its changes keywords socio ecological systems ecological models mimes multiscale integrated model of ecosystem services climate change scenarios brazil 1 introduction the study of socio ecological systems has been gaining momentum since the perception of society intertwined with its natural environment liu et al 2007 2015 and its relevance for sustainability economics and governance integrated perspectives of research increase the potential to understand natural phenomena and

perspective on research embodies notions of complexity non linearity feedback emergent behavior determined by self organization and other characteristics of complex adaptive systems sterman 2000 embracing climate change as a scenario suits these integrative approaches mostly due to the nature of its influence in the biosphere pervasive multi level and non linear systemic therefore the potential for application of a systems perspective in research and practice is not only increasing in intensity but also in urgency modeling is a relevant tool for learning and simulating socio

1960s with the seminal work from forrester at mit industrial dynamics 1961 since then the science around system dynamics has expanded worldwide and reached a high degree of development one of the main advantages of these models is the capacity to integrate a systems complexity in the simulation as described by forrester 1994 it can accept the complexity nonlinearity and feedback loop structures

algorithm was improved with wind and productivity participation items 2 to 5 are new features that addresses limitations of previous versions of the model ses modeling represents one frontier in scientific development to which spatially explicit and dynamic modeling represents the cutting edge of research in this field costanza et al 2014 it is believed that increasing the application and development of dynamic integrated models can enhance the knowledge and practice in the field and help addressing the challenges for analysis and governance resulting from the intertwined diverse and complex adaptive nature of sess schlüter et al 2019 the objectives of this work were fourfold 1 to integrate available socio ecological data of the city ubatuba into a dynamic and comprehensive model enhancing the knowledge and understanding about the integrative social ecological challenges 2 to formalize the causal premises assumed for the system the ecological attributes behavior and their interactions with human sphere 3 to simulate these interactions in time and space and 4 to discuss the problems the area can face due to climate change 2 methods the research translated into this paper has the overall structure fig 1 this paper is part of a greater piece formed by four papers the present one introduces and describes a new ecological model of ecological population dynamics for coastal ubatuba there are three more papers that represent applications of the model described here 2nd economic valuation of ecosystem services 3rd resilience index description using homo economicus as standard and 4th advanced index development with culture theory perspectives these applications were separated into specific papers due to the length constraints and to reach different audience with relevant information 2 1 area description and spatial definition ubatuba is a coastal city on the northern são paulo state coast brazil fig 1 the city is formed by 200 km of beaches that cover all west frontiers eastern limits are the serra do mar mountain range with altitudes greater than 1300 m the northern limit is paraty rj state and south caraguatatuba sp state also two touristic cities but with different profiles ubatuba had its origins during the xvi century with the portuguese arrival and making conflict with the tupinambás natives that lived in the region around xviii century the city was producing cachaça a sugarcane strong alcohol beverage and sugar to fuel the national market but this production was about to decline due to the development of commerce in santos region the main brazilian harbor since then and also the faster development of other productive areas such as the paraíba river valley fontanelli 2019 following the decline of sugarcane coffee production rose allowing the construction of the main buildings in the city counselors chamber and the main church 2 2 https www ubatuba sp gov br a cidade accessed in 29 07 2020 at the end of the coffee cycle ubatuba did not have great economic development from the end of the 19th century to the first decades of the 20th century the economy started to grow significantly again during the 1950s and 1970s when roads connected the city and tourism activity started to push economic activity locally diegues 1974 nowadays the city has 80 of its land covered by tropical forests which includes the biggest protected area in são paulo state the state park of serra do mar which overlaps a national park national park of serra da bocaina in the extreme north of the city the marine area has other protected areas such as the apamln protected area and the anchieta island state park peia model boundaries follow the political limits of the city the focus of this study is to embrace the structure and processes that happen in the water despite the relevance and exuberance of the local forest for the space limits it embraces the continental area of the city two main islands mar virado and anchieta and also the marine area figs 2 and 3 until 50m depth with limits following the northern sector cunhambebe of the apamln protected area considering the possible future uses of the model for this protected area policymaking the area embodied in the model was delimited to match the north sector of the main marine protected area in the region apamln this marine protected area also occurs in two other regions of the são paulo coast fig 2 the idea is that future developments of the model could be created to embrace the other regions due to the connectivity between both land and ocean coastal areas are influenced by events that happen in these two realms the shape of the coast wave heights and other traits are determined by several processes from geological activity to wind speed and direction garrison 2014 several of these factors influence coastal water quality and beach sediments some variables change slowly such as sea level during global glaciation periods while others change rapidly such as wave height or concentration of gases and minerals these fast changing variables and their causes can be modeled stochastically as cloud cover bergemann et al 2017 mangrove inundation frequencies and communities gao et al 2021 and waves idier et al 2020 the present study used stochastic simulation bounded by historical data to some determinants of the marine population as wind speed and direction cloud cover and precipitation patterns the results and accuracy are discussed in the discussion session 2 2 causal loop diagram cld as a precursor step a casual loop diagram cld was constructed using expert knowledge inside the research group in brazil the cld fig 4 is a representation of the main aspects subsequently integrated into the model with a main emphasis on water quality we see it is influenced positively by some ocean ecosystem services such as waste depuration and dilution the main attributes of these services are on the right side of the model represented by the variables depuration bacteria activity and dissolved nitrogen din some of these variables are influenced by temperature and sunlight and then influence phytoplankton growth dissolved oxygen consequently influencing zooplankton population fish and flag fauna animals that can be attractive for scuba diving the left side of the cld shows the main variables of the social sphere represented by resident and visiting population tourists influenced positively by affluence state gross domestic product gdp and negatively by water quality decrease due to sewage disposal clds are very useful because they represent the formalization of the mental models and theory of a determined situation of interest despite their limitations such as the absence of numerical simulation clds are already an interesting tool for making individual assumptions of system s behavior and feedbacks clear and ready to be challenged by others assumptions about the same system the next step increases the complexity of the model with the translation of these relations and feedbacks in terms of the numerical simulation with stocks and flows 2 3 considerations about the model structure and data sources the basic idea of the model fig 5 presents all environmental attributes captured by the simulation in a reader friendly image causalities are represented by arrows connecting variables environmental variables precipitation sea surface temperature wind cloud cover and light are exogenous and influence several water attributes primary productivity transparency oxygen concentration etc primary productivity holds the whole food web starting from zooplankton and most of other species at the coast some of them also get food from detritus or suspended materials all the macro fauna species are connected through a food web of prey predator relations fisheries represent a main way society benefits from the coast human population is formed by residents and tourists fig 5 they interfere with the ecological population dynamics trough waste production that is transformed in nutrients at the water climate data are the determinant of some particles the simulation s group formed by the plankton community plus enterococcus and sediments growth with water nutrients these data can be influenced by scenarios at the water particles interact with nutrients climate and water conditions to grow these particles are the base of a macro food web with eleven groups of species that are interlinked through the food web and water conditions the interactions among all these organisms and the water create the ecosystem services that come back to the population as benefits food web interactions happen between organisms from the same sub model particles and species and different sub model as well feeding between sub models are relevant to sustainability of the food web and resilience of the system as discussed in dragicevic and shogren 2021 input data table 1 present data relative to the same period 2010 2017 when data estimates were present to future periods they were used for calibration as in population and tourism 3 3 http www ciiagro sp gov br dados entrada html visited in 10 august 2017 the resident population is distributed along the 200km of shores but the northern part of the city is less densely occupied cetesb companhia de tecnologia ambiental do estado de são paulo 2016 fig 2c the central part of the city is occupied with high density houses and small buildings fig 2b the southern part is an intermediary density fig 2a in the model we distributed percentages of the population to fill this pattern 70 25 and 4 respectively secondary data used as parameters for calibrating the model were obtained in the literature review see calibration section to include estimates of tourism and population growth cetesb companhia de tecnologia ambiental do estado de são paulo 2014 the model assumes tourism follows a constant growth rate until the end of the simulation except when a specific scenario reacting tourists is active the time horizon of the model starts in 2010 because this represented the majority of data available são paulo state population showed rapid growth in the 1990s most of it due to migration from other states and stabilizing in the 21st century 2010 2025 possibly signaling a demographic transition visiting and resident population estimates were obtained until 2040 cetesb companhia de tecnologia ambiental do estado de são paulo 2016 this is most important for the model and local management once the city is dependent on tourism for the economy and this activity is the most related to environmental impacts on the coasts data from sewage treatment cetesb companhia de tecnologia ambiental do estado de são paulo 2014 considered the city collects 100 of sewage but only 50 is treated the same estimates consider biological oxygen demand in 0 045 g l per person per day 2 4 ecological model structure and equations the mimes architecture follows the architecture in model development described by fitz et al 1996 see also boumans et al 2002 boumans et al 2015 who proposed the use of a unit model as a node for implementation into a spatial network to achieve spatial dynamic simulations we developed unit models to model upland and marine areas coupled through the upland marine interactions signified in waste production from the land into the ocean and the production of ecosystem services in the ocean enjoyed on the land the unit model for upland simulates human population dynamics residents and tourists and the trends in environmental awareness the marine model simulates the food web dynamics among 11 major groups of species found in the region asteroidean brachyuran bivalves penaeidae echinoids cnidarian benthic feeding fish pelagic feeding fish piscivorous fish piscivorous rays pelagic fish and the fates of 7 classes of particles phytoplankton zooplankton detritus suspended materials salps enterococcus and bacterioplankton the coupled unit models were used to simulate the ubatuba coastal regions fig 4 a collection of 3 upland and 9 marine areas the model was coded into

forms the model considers the dynamics for marine particles mp and how such particles modify light nutrients and conditions on dissolved oxygen the particles are either organisms themselves such as

model ll or light limit is determined by the availability of light at body of water considered as one depth only the par is calculated by simile depending on the latitude programmed in the model the model then reduces par considering the influence of cloud cover from 0 to 17 anthony et al 2004 another light reducing influence comes from the amount of particles dissolved in the water the influence of particles in water transparency data came from lorenzen 1972 the climate scenarios do influence the light limitation by changing the julian day probabilities for cloud cover and therefore the effect of the seasonal sun angle on par food limit come from the availability of phytoplankton for zooplankton from the sum of phytoplankton plus zooplankton for bivalves and salps and for each population of prey each predator preys upon nitrogen limitation is only for primary producers phytoplankton and bacterioplankton oxygen limit is for every organism as a minimum requirement for living 5mg l otherwise the population starts to die 2 5 scenarios description the model works with two systems type scenarios climate and reacting tourists representing the biggest menaces to ubatuba s ses são paulo 2019a 2 5 1 ses scenarios climate scenarios climate scenarios were developed using two contrasting scenarios described by ipcc 2014 rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 data used here sometimes are different than that found in ipcc once some variables were not found at a satisfactory scale for the municipality level even in downscaling works chou et al 2014a 2014b for example some sources são paulo 2019a project sst alterations between 4 and 8 c due to climate change scenarios despite the values used for sst in the model having their origin in ipcc reports ipcc 2014 page 61 the values used here are approximations table 2 the names rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 are references to the better and worse scenarios and must be understood as rcp like scenarios due to these numerical differences these climate scenarios bring variations in sst wind speed the amount of cloud cover and the frequency and intensity of precipitation table 2 alterations in precipitation were made instantly and starts to act with full intensity once the model is active july 2017 tourism scenario the second system scenario used in the model came from previous research amazonas et al 2021 made in the same city that remarked on the great concern from tourists regarding the water quality when asked about which factor was more important to tourist activities on the beach 61 of tourists considered the water quality followed by 33 on weather and 23 of sand cleanliness this semi structured interview which reached 387 tourists during summer 2016 also revealed that 83 of interviewees stated they would not come to the beach if it was not proper meaning with good water quality for batheability 52 said they would not come if the water presented a different color and 74 said they would not come if the water was muddy with excess sediment these results corroborated previous studies for the same region e g ghilardi lopes et al 2015 therefore water and sand cleanliness are relevant to tourists when choosing the beach they will visit the way tourists perceive this cleanliness and act accordingly is harder to tell since the são paulo state agency for batheability management cetesb uses a microorganism enterococcus concentration as an indicator to monitor water quality we do the same in the model the cetesb communication program has been using this same proxy to raise awareness about water quality for decades tourists cannot see the microorganisms in the water but if the concentration exceeds a threshold then the environmental agency puts red signs on the beach and makes public announcements about the quality on their website social media and also in great circulation newspapers so it was considered a good proxy for scenarios most likely to reach tourists and influence their decision to move to a different location for the purposes of this study the concentration limit was established in 1 6 mgww m2 of enterococcus which means twice the worst value found in the first year of simulation due to the reaction to poor environmental conditions we considered that up to 15 of the visiting rate could be affected consequently in this scenario tourism has a lower growth rate compared to the baseline situation fig 6 reaching their maximum at 85 of the previous rate 2 6 model validation and calibration validation means the establishment of legitimacy typically in terms of contracts arguments and methods oreskes et al 1994 a valid contract is one that has not been shown to be incorrect yet a valid argument is one that has not been refuted by peers to that finality it is a common practice among modelers to divide data into two parts using the first part to calibrate the model and then certifying the results of the model are coherent with that time series and posteriorly comparing the other results with the second part of the data from which is usually inferred that if the results and the data were congruent the model is valid otherwise not this practice is misleading oreskes et al 1994 sterman 2000 and does not ensure the validity of the model because being an open system the congruence of data and results are occasional oreskes et al 1994 claim that verifying or validating numerical models of natural systems is impossible that happens for two reasons first these systems are open which implies that there are variabilities in the system that were not captured by the model second some results the more verisimilar they appear can be originated in different models and therefore it is not possible to know for sure which represents the reality which one is true even if the model is congruent with data from the present and satisfactorily fits data from the past there is no guarantee that it will explain future events for which no data is available yet finally the model can be tested and declared false but its veracity cannot be determined because it is embracing an open system nonetheless all modeled variables were compared to data using the information presented in table a1 appendix 1 originally collected from rocha et al 2003 and 2007 and measured in grams of wet weight per square meter gww m2 the simulation of the input data as sea surface temperature cloud cover precipitation and wind speed and direction are available on the calibration topic in appendix 1 table a1 the model followed satisfactorily the seasonal oscillations presented by data and that is relevant due to the effect this seasonality will show in some ecological processes sewage depuration oxygen production carbon sequestration and future ecosystem services valuation in the present model the comparison between what is produced in the model and data was done in all climate and biological population s data for sea surface temperature the correlation between data and the results of the model was r 0 31 for cloud cover the correlation was r 0 26 in relation to the variations of wind speed and direction we had u component r 0 15 and v component r 0 15 which are lower than more elaborated wind models with correlations of 0 6 as in valentin el al 2013 the precipitation model correlation between data and the simulation was r 0 21 these values are considered satisfactory when comparing to other mimes models boumans et al 2002 2015 due to the main power of these models rely on the integration of multiple variables not just individual simulations further comparison of accuracy with models for the same region remain difficult due to the lack of proper correlation information in the models for the same area galvão et al 2006 abessa et al 2005 heckler et al 2013 mazzuco et al 2015 dias et al 2016 marques et al 2021 in the end what makes a good model is its capacity to test discrepancies in assumptions mental models included good models are those that confirm or refute the hypothesis that has been created from other research methods and knowledge gathering good models can be used to answer what if questions and then make some forecasts or even explore causal hypotheses in its past and future behavior in short good models are tools for learning sterman 2000 and heuristics oreskes et al 1994 for further information see apendix 1 3 results the graphs present results for the first year of simulation and for a long range forecast until 2100 where the scenarios of climate change and tourism can present their effect on these populations when present min and max indicate the model range of values based see table a1 3 1 water particles and fish populations phytoplankton simulations figs 7 and 8 show the seasonal oscillation in this population and their numbers are well suited in the expected range table a1 in the appendix this simulation shows the oscillation from summer to winter and the diminishing population with rcp8 5 in the long range reactive tourists scenario was not different from the base case not shown zooplankton brings a higher value for its population in winter when compared to summer rocha et al 2003 our simulation fig 9 could not reach this inverted oscillation and then zooplankton population decreases in winter when food fig 7 decreases in the long range simulation fig 10 zooplankton population suffers from stronger oscillations in winter also the zooplankton population tends to be smaller due to the effect of rcp 8 5 the population of enterococcus is determined by the sewage deposition and the area where sewage depuration is happening with less than 10m depth area fig 11 considering the local and tourist population growth the enterococcus population increases along the century fig 12 from the model individual results for each modeled group can be extracted table 3 the sum of daily population can be used to understand the differences between scenarios this table brings the simulation results for each interest group along the simulation period those values are discussed below it is important to notice that these values and scenarios variations are the basis for the next papers once these biomass will be used for the economic valuation trough benefit transfer method and will be the basis for the development of the resilience analysis once each group biomass was investigated and simulated we can infer about the ecosystem services production for most of fisheries the biomass is the basis on which the fishery will act and result in the fisheries ecosystem services for carbon sequestration and oxygen production the biomass of the producers phytoplankton is the basis for the metabolism that control those gases cycle from these populations with some inferences of metabolism results the nitrogen related ecosystem services nitrogen depuration and mineralization and from a representative organism enterococcus unfold the sewage depuration service 4 discussion population data for phytoplankton zooplankton detritus suspended material salps enterococcus and bacterioplankton did not present time series data against which the simulation could be compared thus the model focused on delineating the maximum and minimum populations when available or some reference value e g fig 7 and satisfactorily follow those limits table a1 all values in the water particles sub model present clear seasonal variability the causal reason for phytoplankton is the light availability season zooplankton varies due to phytoplankton variation that acts as food limit presenting higher population in summer than winter salps vary according to zooplankton and phytoplankton but only occurs in summer detritus suspended material and enterococcus are directly dependent on tourists zooplankton population simulation presented a different pattern when compared to the literature rocha et al 2003 the authors reported higher values for the zooplankton population during winter probably where the absence of salp s predation allowed these creatures to reproduce and reach these high values the model has not captured this movement and the main limitation to zooplankton growth is food availability phytoplankton and therefore their behavior follows its variation enterococcus population however was higher in winter when compared to summer when compared directly with batheability data cetesb 2010 to 2016 these seasonal fluctuations cannot be detected easily nevertheless in other research oliveira et al 2020 using neural network analysis this seasonality was detected in batheability data showing the difference between seasons in bacteria concentration along the whole coast of ubatuba the vertebrate and invertebrate populations showed simulated values that are very close to the literature table a1 invertebrates presented slight seasonal variability that follows their food source variations detritus suspended material etc superior groups like vertebrates have not shown the same amplitude in their oscillations presented by water particles or even by invertebrates vertebrate s oscillations are very discrete in the model and absent in reference literature rocha et al 2003 2007 the model developed by rocha et al 2003 2007 did not reach seasonal variations in their vertebrate analysis and the present model brings this novelty these populations presented different behavior when compared to scenarios of climate change and reactive tourists this variance was expected once these two types of scenarios act upon different set of variables in the model climate scenarios change wind speed precipitation patterns sst and cloud cover table 2 while reactive tourists change the number of tourists and therefore their effluents in water nitrogen enterococcus suspended material for climate change scenarios the biological population variation table 3 ranged from 0 13 0 0 to 10 31 0 0 these results table 3 allows the formation of groups where the influence of climate change are not significant with influences from 0 to 2 bivalve brachyuran pelagic feeding fish and benthic feeding fish and moderate significance with variations 2 phytoplankton zooplankton and enterococcus these results are slightly different from that found in lotze et al 2019 for rcp8 5 17 2 10 7 these difference are understood as natural once those authors focused in open seas where stratification was the main phenomena limiting primary productivity and our case represents a coastal area with probably more influence from the mixing zone other comment is that the variations expected in lotze et al 2019 where comparing to the period of 1990 1999 and ours to the period 2010 2017 in terms of feeding limitation the reactive tourist scenario showed that most of the studied groups had variations smaller than 1 except for enterococcus which had 34 decrease this result shows that if a policy controlling the number of tourists where implemented the quality of water would increase sharply which is one of the main factors that attract tourists for that city in the first place amazonas et al 2021 policies like that can be one way to reduce global inputs of sewage into the sea especially nitrogen and can contribute to reshape the ocean concentration into his boundaries rockström et al 2009 steffen et al 2015 4 1 limitations and boundaries of the model mimes is a modeling framework that allows the inclusion of virtually every possible variable related to the problem understudy as it was born from the system dynamics body of knowledge it is recommended to follow the best practices and guidelines from this field which are well described in sterman 2000 considering that and the fact that the present study focused on the city ubatuba as a whole and how it in interferes with the ecological coastal dynamics some boundaries apply on the present work 1 we recognize underground water flows as potentially relevant for the area but considering the lack of data these flows were not considered to the present work 2 agriculture is representative of only 3 of the city s economy and therefore do not represent a significant flow of minerals to the water natural forests can also contribute with some minerals to the coastal area but due to lack of data they were not considered in the present case the spatial limitation used in the model embracing the north sector of apamln seems appropriate due to the importance of this area in providing ecosystem services for the city but future development of the model could improve some features of the model named 1 use smaller water polygons to enhance the definition of the results 2 embrace the types of substrate in the bottom of the sea for each of these polygons allowing the simulation of benthic species distribution this idea was made in lorilla et al 2020 with influence on conservation practices 3 land polygons can be diminished using small scale data for population groups as determined by national census data and therefore increase the accuracy of the model 4 fish landings would be benefited by monitoring of fish vessels and productivity 5 water quality monitoring in depths of 20m and 50m would increase the quality of information about this environments and the es produced at these points the choice of the groups in the water particle sub model and the fish sub model were based on the best data available rocha et al 2003 2007 but some of them revealed useless for es assessment as echinoids or asteroidean 5 conclusions the objective of this paper was to build a new coastal ecology model that at the same time integrates some key elements of the socio economics of ubatuba brazil and then simulate them in time and space to better understand and forecast biological populations along the century and under different scenarios we carried out this objective within the mimes framework a very integrative and powerful modeling technique that allowed us to embrace the main portion of the marine biota and simulate them in different scenarios this ubatuba mimes model embraces data from atmospheric sciences mostly collected by satellites cloud cover light availability wind speed and direction precipitation and sea surface temperature and through its causal structure integrated this information with the biological and oceanographic information about the physical state of the coast nitrogen concentration oxygen particulates and undesired microorganisms and the food web from primary producers to top predators human society influences the water quality through sewage dumping which can vary according to scenarios results show good correlation between data and the model outputs and thus the biological population forecast was done with good confidence climate change will reduce most populations along a range from 0 13 0 0 to 10 31 0 0 there are groups where the influence of climate change are not significant bivalve brachyuran pelagic feeding fish and benthic feeding fish with variations from 0 2 and other with moderate significance phytoplankton zooplankton and enterococcus with variations 2 reactive tourist scenario shown to be very relevant in enterococcus population with a reduction of 34 this can be translated into a policy that limits the number of tourists and increases the water quality at the same time further studies and applications of this model can measure the economic impact of this possible policy spatial simulation of the groups and the interfaces between the number of residents and the biological populations can be used to develop an integrative decision making system to help the city to manage its natural capital and adapt to its changes implications of this work for the city management point to the necessity of a climate adaptation plan specifically designed to mitigate the effects of climate change in the reduction of the fish populations carbon and oxygen exchanges and sewage depuration ecosystem services offer it is also clear in the study the effects of tourist population in the es provision pointing to the necessity of control of this visiting population in terms of sewage management this research has shown that despite the negative effects on the beach area the nutrients provided are useful to sustain fish populations and therefore using pipelines to direct discharge away from beaches are better than removing all the nutrients from sewage despite the overall negative effects to the oceans as such nitrogen pollution this approach could feed the fishes at the same time that leaves the beaches clean for tourists credit authorship contribution statement bruno m oliveira conceptualization visualization formal analysis writing original draft roelof boumans visualization

24438,understanding the complex dynamics between society and nature is a critical contribution of ecological modelling integrated views of human nature relations as well as tools and frameworks for studying these relations are gaining ground a socio ecological systems ses perspective therefore embraces both social and environmental factors that uses nonlinearities feedbacks models and multi level networks for understanding and studying those phenomena when undesired drivers as climate change are also taken into account the most urgent question is how these critical socio ecological systems will behave given the stresses they endure this work had the objective of creating a new simulation of a coastal ses from brazil that is able to integrate several climatic and social variables through a dynamic and coupled model and forecast its behavior in the future according to scenarios specifically a systems dynamics simulation model using mimes multiscale integrated model of ecosystem services was developed for ubatuba a coastal city highly dependent and influenced by tourism results showed good correspondence between the model and the data when testing several environmental inputs wind speed and direction cloud cover sea surface temperature precipitation patterns the model simulated the population dynamics of 15 biological groups from 2010 to 2100 under different scenarios climate change will reduce most of populations in a range from 0 13 0 0 to 10 31 0 0 there are groups where the influence of climate change is not significant bivalve brachyuran pelagic feeding fish and benthic feeding fish with variations from 0 to 2 and others with moderate significance phytoplankton zooplankton and enterococcus with variations 2 tourists reacting to water quality degradation is very relevant in enterococcus population with a reduction of 34 results show the urban activities strongly influencing the biological populations and that these impacts depend on the scenario context this suggests a policy that limits the number of tourists and increases the water quality at the same time therefore the model s spatial simulation of this complex socio ecological system can be used to develop an integrative decision making tool to help the city manage its natural capital and adapt to its changes keywords socio ecological systems ecological models mimes multiscale integrated model of ecosystem services climate change scenarios brazil 1 introduction the study of socio ecological systems has been gaining momentum since the perception of society intertwined with its natural environment liu et al 2007 2015 and its relevance for sustainability economics and governance integrated perspectives of research increase the potential to understand natural phenomena and relation with social well being reinforcing the importance of systemic paradigms of research towards a holistic perspective to complement conventional approaches schlüter et al 2012 2019 a systems perspective on research embodies notions of complexity non linearity feedback emergent behavior determined by self organization and other characteristics of complex adaptive systems sterman 2000 embracing climate change as a scenario suits these integrative approaches mostly due to the nature of its influence in the biosphere pervasive multi level and non linear systemic therefore the potential for application of a systems perspective in research and practice is not only increasing in intensity but also in urgency modeling is a relevant tool for learning and simulating socio ecological systems ford 1999 sterman 2000 meadows 2009 schlüter et al 2012 2019 through simulation it is possible to model population dynamics to test the nature of the coupling between society and the environment making forecasting possible one goal is improving the possibility of investigating how new interventions practices projects or policies would unfold system dynamics started in the 1960s with the seminal work from forrester at mit industrial dynamics 1961 since then the science around system dynamics has expanded worldwide and reached a high degree of development one of the main advantages of these models is the capacity to integrate a systems complexity in the simulation as described by forrester 1994 it can accept the complexity nonlinearity and feedback loop structures that are inherent in social and physical systems the method is responsible for enhancing learning about complex systems sterman 2000 for coastal areas the necessity of integrated nature society investigations and governance are blatant since the recognition of the historical and current abuses of marine environment capacities halpern et al 2015 altman et al 2014 börger et al 2014 ioc unesco 2020 and the huge importance of oceans on the provision of food minerals climate control transport etc to aid management in formulating regulating and guiding the governance of coastal areas we aim to design a simulation that mitigates complications associated with the complexities inherent in a multi criteria perspective on ecosystem management by means of an ecological model that considers population dynamics and ecosystem services that has value to management mimes boumans et al 2015 is a very interesting tool for planning and management the mimes model is built on causalities with complex adaptive systems background embodying feedbacks path dependencies and nonlinearities from the environment in a highly interdisciplinary and integrated simulation for the present study a new mimes model 1 1 the model can be downloaded at https drive google com drive folders 16xtycetoxhkpcsfvhy4u68ceifo cofp usp sharing was created from scratch developed specifically for the study area which is a timely novelty for south american coastal areas this paper presents the integrated mimes model for ubatuba a case study for a brazilian coastal city with description of the data integration model building and scenarios discussing the simulation development caveats and limits mimes is the acronym of multiscale integrated model of ecosystem services boumans et al 2002 altman et al 2014 boumans et al 2015 this model is based on system dynamics and has been used in several cases boumans et al 2002 batker et al 2010 altman et al 2014 boumans et al 2015 each mimes model is unique built specially for the case and questions the user intends to study for this brazilian area a new mimes model was built mimes is slightly different concerning regular system dynamics studies remarks should include the interaction with gis systems the use of arrays and the great complexity of these models mimes goals boumans et al 2015 are build integrated models of social ecological systems to guide the process of decision making build ecological economics models focused on integration of knowledge regarding ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services under the human well being perspective create computer infrastructure as a modeling tool that can incorporate stakeholder input and biophysical dynamics for valuation of ecosystem services and decision making simulate ecosystems and socio economic systems in space simulate these systems over time and simulate the interactions between these systems through the coupling in addition to extending mimes to a new application the current model presents modifications in relation to previous versions of mimes 1 scenarios were directly coded in the model instead of being reloaded as scenario parameters 2 a new sub model for sewage depuration was developed from scratch 3 precipitation sub model was built in a more accurate fashion 4 fisheries sub model was built using variable fishing rates 5 oxygen dissolution algorithm was improved with wind and productivity participation items 2 to 5 are new features that addresses limitations of previous versions of the model ses modeling represents one frontier in scientific development to which spatially explicit and dynamic modeling represents the cutting edge of research in this field costanza et al 2014 it is believed that increasing the application and development of dynamic integrated models can enhance the knowledge and practice in the field and help addressing the challenges for analysis and governance resulting from the intertwined diverse and complex adaptive nature of sess schlüter et al 2019 the objectives of this work were fourfold 1 to integrate available socio ecological data of the city ubatuba into a dynamic and comprehensive model enhancing the knowledge and understanding about the integrative social ecological challenges 2 to formalize the causal premises assumed for the system the ecological attributes behavior and their interactions with human sphere 3 to simulate these interactions in time and space and 4 to discuss the problems the area can face due to climate change 2 methods the research translated into this paper has the overall structure fig 1 this paper is part of a greater piece formed by four papers the present one introduces and describes a new ecological model of ecological population dynamics for coastal ubatuba there are three more papers that represent applications of the model described here 2nd economic valuation of ecosystem services 3rd resilience index description using homo economicus as standard and 4th advanced index development with culture theory perspectives these applications were separated into specific papers due to the length constraints and to reach different audience with relevant information 2 1 area description and spatial definition ubatuba is a coastal city on the northern são paulo state coast brazil fig 1 the city is formed by 200 km of beaches that cover all west frontiers eastern limits are the serra do mar mountain range with altitudes greater than 1300 m the northern limit is paraty rj state and south caraguatatuba sp state also two touristic cities but with different profiles ubatuba had its origins during the xvi century with the portuguese arrival and making conflict with the tupinambás natives that lived in the region around xviii century the city was producing cachaça a sugarcane strong alcohol beverage and sugar to fuel the national market but this production was about to decline due to the development of commerce in santos region the main brazilian harbor since then and also the faster development of other productive areas such as the paraíba river valley fontanelli 2019 following the decline of sugarcane coffee production rose allowing the construction of the main buildings in the city counselors chamber and the main church 2 2 https www ubatuba sp gov br a cidade accessed in 29 07 2020 at the end of the coffee cycle ubatuba did not have great economic development from the end of the 19th century to the first decades of the 20th century the economy started to grow significantly again during the 1950s and 1970s when roads connected the city and tourism activity started to push economic activity locally diegues 1974 nowadays the city has 80 of its land covered by tropical forests which includes the biggest protected area in são paulo state the state park of serra do mar which overlaps a national park national park of serra da bocaina in the extreme north of the city the marine area has other protected areas such as the apamln protected area and the anchieta island state park peia model boundaries follow the political limits of the city the focus of this study is to embrace the structure and processes that happen in the water despite the relevance and exuberance of the local forest for the space limits it embraces the continental area of the city two main islands mar virado and anchieta and also the marine area figs 2 and 3 until 50m depth with limits following the northern sector cunhambebe of the apamln protected area considering the possible future uses of the model for this protected area policymaking the area embodied in the model was delimited to match the north sector of the main marine protected area in the region apamln this marine protected area also occurs in two other regions of the são paulo coast fig 2 the idea is that future developments of the model could be created to embrace the other regions due to the connectivity between both land and ocean coastal areas are influenced by events that happen in these two realms the shape of the coast wave heights and other traits are determined by several processes from geological activity to wind speed and direction garrison 2014 several of these factors influence coastal water quality and beach sediments some variables change slowly such as sea level during global glaciation periods while others change rapidly such as wave height or concentration of gases and minerals these fast changing variables and their causes can be modeled stochastically as cloud cover bergemann et al 2017 mangrove inundation frequencies and communities gao et al 2021 and waves idier et al 2020 the present study used stochastic simulation bounded by historical data to some determinants of the marine population as wind speed and direction cloud cover and precipitation patterns the results and accuracy are discussed in the discussion session 2 2 causal loop diagram cld as a precursor step a casual loop diagram cld was constructed using expert knowledge inside the research group in brazil the cld fig 4 is a representation of the main aspects subsequently integrated into the model with a main emphasis on water quality we see it is influenced positively by some ocean ecosystem services such as waste depuration and dilution the main attributes of these services are on the right side of the model represented by the variables depuration bacteria activity and dissolved nitrogen din some of these variables are influenced by temperature and sunlight and then influence phytoplankton growth dissolved oxygen consequently influencing zooplankton population fish and flag fauna animals that can be attractive for scuba diving the left side of the cld shows the main variables of the social sphere represented by resident and visiting population tourists influenced positively by affluence state gross domestic product gdp and negatively by water quality decrease due to sewage disposal clds are very useful because they represent the formalization of the mental models and theory of a determined situation of interest despite their limitations such as the absence of numerical simulation clds are already an interesting tool for making individual assumptions of system s behavior and feedbacks clear and ready to be challenged by others assumptions about the same system the next step increases the complexity of the model with the translation of these relations and feedbacks in terms of the numerical simulation with stocks and flows 2 3 considerations about the model structure and data sources the basic idea of the model fig 5 presents all environmental attributes captured by the simulation in a reader friendly image causalities are represented by arrows connecting variables environmental variables precipitation sea surface temperature wind cloud cover and light are exogenous and influence several water attributes primary productivity transparency oxygen concentration etc primary productivity holds the whole food web starting from zooplankton and most of other species at the coast some of them also get food from detritus or suspended materials all the macro fauna species are connected through a food web of prey predator relations fisheries represent a main way society benefits from the coast human population is formed by residents and tourists fig 5 they interfere with the ecological population dynamics trough waste production that is transformed in nutrients at the water climate data are the determinant of some particles the simulation s group formed by the plankton community plus enterococcus and sediments growth with water nutrients these data can be influenced by scenarios at the water particles interact with nutrients climate and water conditions to grow these particles are the base of a macro food web with eleven groups of species that are interlinked through the food web and water conditions the interactions among all these organisms and the water create the ecosystem services that come back to the population as benefits food web interactions happen between organisms from the same sub model particles and species and different sub model as well feeding between sub models are relevant to sustainability of the food web and resilience of the system as discussed in dragicevic and shogren 2021 input data table 1 present data relative to the same period 2010 2017 when data estimates were present to future periods they were used for calibration as in population and tourism 3 3 http www ciiagro sp gov br dados

ambiental do estado de são paulo 2016 fig 2c the central part of the city is occupied with high density houses and small buildings fig 2b the southern part is an intermediary density fig 2a in the model we distributed percentages of the population to fill this pattern 70 25 and 4 respectively secondary data used as parameters for calibrating the model were obtained in the literature review see calibration section to include estimates of tourism and population growth cetesb companhia de tecnologia ambiental do estado de são paulo 2014 the model assumes tourism follows a constant growth rate until the end of the simulation except when a specific scenario reacting tourists is active the time horizon of the model starts in 2010 because this represented the majority of data available são paulo state population showed rapid growth in the 1990s most of it due to migration from other states and stabilizing in the 21st century 2010 2025 possibly signaling a demographic transition visiting and resident population estimates were obtained until 2040 cetesb companhia de tecnologia ambiental do estado de são paulo 2016 this is most important for the model and local management once the city is dependent on tourism for the economy and this activity is the most related to environmental impacts on the coasts data from sewage treatment cetesb companhia de tecnologia ambiental do estado de são paulo 2014 considered the city collects 100 of sewage but only 50 is treated the same estimates consider biological oxygen demand in 0 045 g l per person per day 2 4 ecological model structure and equations the mimes architecture follows the architecture in model development described by fitz et al 1996 see also boumans et al 2002 boumans et al 2015 who proposed the use of a unit model as a node for implementation into a spatial network to achieve spatial dynamic simulations we developed unit models to model upland and marine areas coupled through the upland marine interactions signified in waste production from the land into the ocean and the production of ecosystem services in the ocean enjoyed on the land the unit model for upland simulates human population dynamics residents and tourists and the trends in environmental awareness the marine model simulates the food web dynamics among 11 major groups of species found in the region asteroidean brachyuran bivalves penaeidae echinoids cnidarian benthic feeding fish pelagic feeding fish piscivorous fish piscivorous rays pelagic fish and the fates of 7 classes of particles phytoplankton zooplankton detritus suspended materials salps enterococcus and bacterioplankton the coupled unit models were used to simulate the ubatuba coastal regions fig 4 a collection of 3 upland and 9 marine areas the model was coded into

forms the model considers the dynamics for marine particles mp and how such particles modify light nutrients and conditions on dissolved oxygen the particles are either organisms themselves such as

model ll or light limit is determined by the availability of light at body of water considered as one depth only the par is calculated by simile depending on the latitude programmed in the model the model then reduces par considering the influence of cloud cover from 0 to 17 anthony et al 2004 another light reducing influence comes from the amount of particles dissolved in the water the influence of particles in water transparency data came from lorenzen 1972 the climate scenarios do influence the light limitation by changing the julian day probabilities for cloud cover and therefore the effect of the seasonal sun angle on par food limit come from the availability of phytoplankton for zooplankton from the sum of phytoplankton plus zooplankton for bivalves and salps and for each population of prey each predator preys upon nitrogen limitation is only for primary producers phytoplankton and bacterioplankton oxygen limit is for every organism as a minimum requirement for living 5mg l otherwise the population starts to die 2 5 scenarios description the model works with two systems type scenarios climate and reacting tourists representing the biggest menaces to ubatuba s ses são paulo 2019a 2 5 1 ses scenarios climate scenarios climate scenarios were developed using two contrasting scenarios described by ipcc 2014 rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 data used here sometimes are different than that found in ipcc once some variables were not found at a satisfactory scale for the municipality level even in downscaling works chou et al 2014a 2014b for example some sources são paulo 2019a project sst alterations between 4 and 8 c due to climate change scenarios despite the values used for sst in the model having their origin in ipcc reports ipcc 2014 page 61 the values used here are approximations table 2 the names rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 are references to the better and worse scenarios and must be understood as rcp like scenarios due to these numerical differences these climate scenarios bring variations in sst wind speed the amount of cloud cover and the frequency and intensity of precipitation table 2 alterations in precipitation were made instantly and starts to act with full intensity once the model is active july 2017 tourism scenario the second system scenario used in the model came from previous research amazonas et al 2021 made in the same city that remarked on the great concern from tourists regarding the water quality when asked about which factor was more important to tourist activities on the beach 61 of tourists considered the water quality followed by 33 on weather and 23 of sand cleanliness this semi structured interview which reached 387 tourists during summer 2016 also revealed that 83 of interviewees stated they would not come to the beach if it was not proper meaning with good water quality for batheability 52 said they would not come if the water presented a different color and 74 said they would not come if the water was muddy with excess sediment these results corroborated previous studies for the same region e g ghilardi lopes et al 2015 therefore water and sand cleanliness are relevant to tourists when choosing the beach they will visit the way tourists perceive this cleanliness and act accordingly is harder to tell since the são paulo state agency for batheability management cetesb uses a microorganism enterococcus concentration as an indicator to monitor water quality we do the same in the model the cetesb communication program has been using this same proxy to raise awareness about water quality for decades tourists cannot see the microorganisms in the water but if the concentration exceeds a threshold then the environmental agency puts red signs on the beach and makes public announcements about the quality on their website social media and also in great circulation newspapers so it was considered a good proxy for scenarios most likely to reach tourists and influence their decision to move to a different location for the purposes of this study the concentration limit was established in 1 6 mgww m2 of enterococcus which means twice the worst value found in the first year of simulation due to the reaction to poor environmental conditions we considered that up to 15 of the visiting rate could be affected consequently in this scenario tourism has a lower growth rate compared to the baseline situation fig 6 reaching their maximum at 85 of the previous rate 2 6 model validation and calibration validation means the establishment of legitimacy typically in terms of contracts arguments and methods oreskes et al 1994 a valid contract is one that has not been shown to be incorrect yet a valid argument is one that has not been refuted by peers to that finality it is a common practice among modelers to divide data into two parts using the first part to calibrate the model and then certifying the results of the model are coherent with that time series and posteriorly comparing the other results with the second part of the data from which is usually inferred that if the results and the data were congruent the model is valid otherwise not this practice is misleading oreskes et al 1994 sterman 2000 and does not ensure the validity of the model because being an open system the congruence of data and results are occasional oreskes et al 1994 claim that verifying or validating numerical models of natural systems is impossible that happens for two reasons first these systems are open which implies that there are variabilities in the system that were not captured by the model second some results the more verisimilar they appear can be originated in different models and therefore it is not possible to know for sure which represents the reality which one is true even if the model is congruent with data from the present and satisfactorily fits data from the past there is no guarantee that it will explain future events for which no data is available yet finally the model can be tested and declared false but its veracity cannot be determined because it is embracing an open system nonetheless all modeled variables were compared to data using the information presented in table a1 appendix 1 originally collected from rocha et al 2003 and 2007 and measured in grams of wet weight per square meter gww m2 the simulation of the input data as sea surface temperature cloud cover precipitation and wind speed and direction are available on the calibration topic in appendix 1 table a1 the model followed satisfactorily the seasonal oscillations presented by data and that is relevant due to the effect this seasonality will show in some ecological processes sewage depuration oxygen production carbon sequestration and future ecosystem services valuation in the present model the comparison between what is produced in the model and data was done in all climate and biological population s data for sea surface temperature the correlation between data and the results of the model was r 0 31 for cloud cover the correlation was r 0 26 in relation to the variations of wind speed and direction we had u component r 0 15 and v component r 0 15 which are lower than more elaborated wind models with correlations of 0 6 as in valentin el al 2013 the precipitation model correlation between data and the simulation was r 0 21 these values are considered satisfactory when comparing to other mimes models boumans et al 2002 2015 due to the main power of these models rely on the integration of multiple variables not just individual simulations further comparison of accuracy with models for the same region remain difficult due to the lack of proper correlation information in the models for the same area galvão et al 2006 abessa et al 2005 heckler et al 2013 mazzuco et al 2015 dias et al 2016 marques et al 2021 in the end what makes a good model is its capacity to test discrepancies in assumptions mental models included good models are those that confirm or refute the hypothesis that has been created from other research methods and knowledge gathering good models can be used to answer what if questions and then make some forecasts or even explore causal hypotheses in its past and future behavior in short good models are tools for learning sterman 2000 and heuristics oreskes et al 1994 for further information see apendix 1 3 results the graphs present results for the first year of simulation and for a long range forecast until 2100 where the scenarios of climate change and tourism can present their effect on these populations when present min and max indicate the model range of values based see table a1 3 1 water particles and fish populations phytoplankton simulations figs 7 and 8 show the seasonal oscillation in this population and their numbers are well suited in the expected range table a1 in the appendix this simulation shows the oscillation from summer to winter and the diminishing population with rcp8 5 in the long range reactive tourists scenario was not different from the base case not shown zooplankton brings a higher value for its population in winter when compared to summer rocha et al 2003 our simulation fig 9 could not reach this inverted oscillation and then zooplankton population decreases in winter when food fig 7 decreases in the long range simulation fig 10 zooplankton population suffers from stronger oscillations in winter also the zooplankton population tends to be smaller due to the effect of rcp 8 5 the population of enterococcus is determined by the sewage deposition and the area where sewage depuration is happening with less than 10m depth area fig 11 considering the local and tourist population growth the enterococcus population increases along the century fig 12 from the model individual results for each modeled group can be extracted table 3 the sum of daily population can be used to understand the differences between scenarios this table brings the simulation results for each interest group along the simulation period those values are discussed below it is important to notice that these values and scenarios variations are the basis for the next papers once these biomass will be used for the economic valuation trough benefit transfer method and will be the basis for the development of the resilience analysis once each group biomass was investigated and simulated we can infer about the ecosystem services production for most of fisheries the biomass is the basis on which the fishery will act and result in the fisheries ecosystem services for carbon sequestration and oxygen production the biomass of the producers phytoplankton is the basis for the metabolism that control those gases cycle from these populations with some inferences of metabolism results the nitrogen related ecosystem services nitrogen depuration and mineralization and from a representative organism enterococcus unfold the sewage depuration service 4 discussion population data for phytoplankton zooplankton detritus suspended material salps enterococcus and bacterioplankton did not present time series data against which the simulation could be compared thus the model focused on delineating the maximum and minimum populations when available or some reference value e g fig 7 and satisfactorily follow those limits table a1 all values in the water particles sub model present clear seasonal variability the causal reason for phytoplankton is the light availability season zooplankton varies due to phytoplankton variation that acts as food limit presenting higher population in summer than winter salps vary according to zooplankton and phytoplankton but only occurs in summer detritus suspended material and enterococcus are directly dependent on tourists zooplankton population simulation presented a different pattern when compared to the literature rocha et al 2003 the authors reported higher values for the zooplankton population during winter probably where the absence of salp s predation allowed these creatures to reproduce and reach these high values the model has not captured this movement and the main limitation to zooplankton growth is food availability phytoplankton and therefore their behavior follows its variation enterococcus population however was higher in winter when compared to summer when compared directly with batheability data cetesb 2010 to 2016 these seasonal fluctuations cannot be detected easily nevertheless in other research oliveira et al 2020 using neural network analysis this seasonality was detected in batheability data showing the difference between seasons in bacteria concentration along the whole coast of ubatuba the vertebrate and invertebrate populations showed simulated values that are very close to the literature table a1 invertebrates presented slight seasonal variability that follows their food source variations detritus suspended material etc superior groups like vertebrates have not shown the same amplitude in their oscillations presented by water particles or even by invertebrates vertebrate s oscillations are very discrete in the model and absent in reference literature rocha et al 2003 2007 the model developed by rocha et al 2003 2007 did not reach seasonal variations in their vertebrate analysis and the present model brings this novelty these populations presented different behavior when compared to scenarios of climate change and reactive tourists this variance was expected once these two types of scenarios act upon different set of variables in the model climate scenarios change wind speed precipitation patterns sst and cloud cover table 2 while reactive tourists change the number of tourists and therefore their effluents in water nitrogen enterococcus suspended material for climate change scenarios the biological population variation table 3 ranged from 0 13 0 0 to 10 31 0 0 these results table 3 allows the formation of groups where the influence of climate change are not significant with influences from 0 to 2 bivalve brachyuran pelagic feeding fish and benthic feeding fish and moderate significance with variations 2 phytoplankton zooplankton and enterococcus these results are slightly different from that found in lotze et al 2019 for rcp8 5 17 2 10 7 these difference are understood as natural once those authors focused in open seas where stratification was the main phenomena limiting primary productivity and our case represents a coastal area with probably more influence from the mixing zone other comment is that the variations expected in lotze et al 2019 where comparing to the period of 1990 1999 and ours to the period 2010 2017 in terms of feeding limitation the reactive tourist scenario showed that most of the studied groups had variations smaller than 1 except for enterococcus which had 34 decrease this result shows that if a policy controlling the number of tourists where implemented the quality of water would increase sharply which is one of the main factors that attract tourists for that city in the first place amazonas et al 2021 policies like that can be one way to reduce global inputs of sewage into the sea especially nitrogen and can contribute to reshape the ocean concentration into his boundaries rockström et al 2009 steffen et al 2015 4 1 limitations and boundaries of the model mimes is a modeling framework that allows the inclusion of virtually every possible variable related to the problem understudy as it was born from the system dynamics body of knowledge it is recommended to follow the best practices and guidelines from this field which are well described in sterman 2000 considering that and the fact that the present study focused on the city ubatuba as a whole and how it in interferes with the ecological coastal dynamics some boundaries apply on the present work 1 we recognize underground water flows as potentially relevant for the area but considering the lack of data these flows were not considered to the present work 2 agriculture is representative of only 3 of the city s economy and therefore do not represent a significant flow of minerals to the water natural forests can also contribute with some minerals to the coastal area but due to lack of data they were not considered in the present case the spatial limitation used in the model embracing the north sector of apamln seems appropriate due to the importance of this area in providing ecosystem services for the city but future development of the model could improve some features of the model named 1 use smaller water polygons to enhance the definition of the results 2 embrace the types of substrate in the bottom of the sea for each of these polygons allowing the simulation of benthic species distribution this idea was made in lorilla et al 2020 with influence on conservation practices 3 land polygons can be diminished using small scale data for population groups as determined by national census data and therefore increase the accuracy of the model 4 fish landings would be benefited by monitoring of fish vessels and productivity 5 water quality monitoring in depths of 20m and 50m would increase the quality of information about this environments and the es produced at these points the choice of the groups in the water particle sub model and the fish sub model were based on the best data available rocha et al 2003 2007 but some of them revealed useless for es assessment as echinoids or asteroidean 5 conclusions the objective of this paper was to build a new coastal ecology model that at the same time integrates some key elements of the socio economics of ubatuba brazil and then simulate them in time and space to better understand and forecast biological populations along the century and under different scenarios we carried out this objective within the mimes framework a very integrative and powerful modeling technique that allowed us to embrace the main portion of the marine biota and simulate them in different scenarios this ubatuba mimes model embraces data from atmospheric sciences mostly collected by satellites cloud cover light availability wind speed and direction precipitation and sea surface temperature and through its causal structure integrated this information with the biological and oceanographic information about the physical state of the coast nitrogen concentration oxygen particulates and undesired microorganisms and the food web from primary producers to top predators human society influences the water quality through sewage dumping which can vary according to scenarios results show good correlation between data and the model outputs and thus the biological population forecast was done with good confidence climate change will reduce most populations along a range from 0 13 0 0 to 10 31 0 0 there are groups where the influence of climate change are not significant bivalve brachyuran pelagic feeding fish and benthic feeding fish with variations from 0 2 and other with moderate significance phytoplankton zooplankton and enterococcus with variations 2 reactive tourist scenario shown to be very relevant in enterococcus population with a reduction of 34 this can be translated into a policy that limits the number of tourists and increases the water quality at the same time further studies and applications of this model can measure the economic impact of this possible policy spatial simulation of the groups and the interfaces between the number of residents and the biological populations can be used to develop an integrative decision making system to help the city to manage its natural capital and adapt to its changes implications of this work for the city management point to the necessity of a climate adaptation plan specifically designed to mitigate the effects of climate change in the reduction of the fish populations carbon and oxygen exchanges and sewage depuration ecosystem services offer it is also clear in the study the effects of tourist population in the es provision pointing to the necessity of control of this visiting population in terms of sewage management this research has shown that despite the negative effects on the beach area the nutrients provided are useful to sustain fish populations and therefore using pipelines to direct discharge away from beaches are better than removing all the nutrients from sewage despite the overall negative effects to the oceans as such nitrogen pollution this approach could feed the fishes at the same time that leaves the beaches clean for tourists credit authorship contribution statement bruno m oliveira conceptualization visualization formal analysis writing original draft roelof boumans visualization

24439,phosphate p i and temperature are two important environmental factors affecting algal growth and the occurrence of red tide in this paper we conduct experiments on karenia mikimotoi under different p i concentrations and temperatures and propose a novel p i uptake model by incorporating arrhenius function and p i stress function into the two stage model presented in one of our recent paper jiang et al 2019 in both p i replete and p i deplete the model parameters are obtained by fitting the experimental data at 24 c and validated by the experimental data at 20 c respectively k mikimotoi under low p i condition entered into the exponential growth phase earlier compared with p i replete groups under the p i replete condition k mikimotoi continually increased while the p i deplete condition showed a wave trend the experimental results and the fitting of experimental data both show that k mikimotoi has an obvious response to temperature in both p i replete and p i deplete the peak values of the cell quota of intracellular p i and surface adsorbed p i at 24 c were higher than those at 20 c using the luxury coefficient and growth potential interspecific competition between k mikimotoi and prorocentrum donghaiense is also discussed these results and conclusions are helpful to understand the p i uptake characteristics of algae at different p i concentrations and temperatures and could effectively explain mechanisms of interspecific competition and succession between different algae species during red tide keywords algal bloom competition prorocentrum donghaiense surface adsorption two stage model data accessibility all data used in this study can be found in the manuscript and its supplementary materials 1 introduction karenia mikimotoi formerly named gymnodinium mikimotoi brand et al 2012 a widely distributed red tide species is known to form alternating blooms with some other harmful algae species e g prorocentrum donghaiense heterocapsa circularisquama and so on chang 2011 li et al 2009 uchida et al 1999 since 1998 the blooms of k mikimotoi have often been seen in the coastal waters of the zhejiang and fujian provinces in china and have caused heavy losses in aquaculture and deterioration of the marine ecological environment zhao 2010 li et al 2019 lü et al 2019 it is found that after diatom blooms the concentration of phosphate p i is relatively low in the coastal water of the east china sea li et al 2009 zhao 2010 and the previous studies showed that the p i uptake rate in cells with p i stress is higher than that without p i stress lehman and sandgren 1982 riegman and mur 1984 lin et al 2016 on the other hand the temperature is also a major factor controlling photosynthesis which has a close relationship with the metabolism and growth of algae helbling et al 2011 shen et al 2016 davison 1991 it can affect the maximum growth rate of algae goldman and carpenter 1974 thereby changing the p i uptake rate of algae cells and affecting the alternations of algal blooms karentz and smayda 1984 during most k mikimotoi blooms the sea surface temperature ranges from 18 c to 26 c zhao 2010 chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2017b a the highest specific growth rate of k mikimotoi is obtained at 24 c shen et al 2016 and the average sea surface temperature from 2001 to 2010 was 23 6 c when blooms of k mikimotoi occurred in the east china sea zhao 2010 hence it is important to understand the kinetics of p i uptake by algae under different conditions of p i concentration and temperature in many previous studies the michaelis menten equation has often been used to describe the nutrient uptake process by algae lee et al 2015 however the successful use of michaelis menten kinetics model to describe nutrient uptake often masks the difficulties in interpreting the kinetics parameters obtained by measurement droop 1983 in addition the two parameter michaelis menten kinetics model cannot well describe the observed phenomenon of luxury uptake of algae cells under p i stress goldman et al 1981 harrison et al 1976 1989 therefore it is not enough to describe the p i uptake process of microalgae only by michaelis menten kinetics within the adaptive range algae can maintain the maximum growth rate by adjusting their internal nutrient quota and absorbing nutrients at the maximum short term nutrient uptake rate according to changes in external nutrient concentration morel 1987 aksnes and egge 1991 developed a phytoplankton nutrient uptake rate model described by v n a v s 1 h a v s where v is the uptake rate n is the number of cellular uptake sites a is the area of uptake sites h is the time required for processing one nutrient ion v is the mass transfer coefficient s is the nutrient concentration in the substrate and confirmed that the michaelis menten equation applied to the uptake process of algae was a special case of the model in fact this model can be rearranged as v n h 1 s h a v 1 s which can then be transmitted to the classical michaelis menten kinetics model by letting v max n h 1 and k s h a v 1 harrison et al 1989 suggested that the maximum uptake rate of cells should be related to the size of the intracellular p i pools considering the multiple p i pools in cells john and flynn 2000 established the three compartment p i model of microalgal growth phosphate interaction model pim recently singh et al 2018 further extended the pim model by considering the combined effects of light and nutrients on algal growth notice that most studies mentioned above only considered the transportation from substrate into cells in fact the intracellular p i qp pool and surface adsorbed p i ap pool have great significance to the investigation of p i uptake kinetics of phytoplankton harrison et al 1989 jiang et al 2019 yao et al 2011 sañudo wilhelmy et al 2004 jin et al 2021 the coexistence of qp pool and ap pool demonstrate that the p i uptake process of algae should be divided into two stages substrate p i wp is first adsorbed on the cell surface and then ap enters the interior of cell to become qp through the active transport of membrane considering the effects of ap and qp on algal growth liu et al 2007 established a two stage growth kinetics model of algae by further considering the regulation via transport inhibition from size of qp pool yao et al 2011 constructed a two stage kinetics model of p i uptake by algae based on the experimental data of short term absorption kinetics of a green algae scenedesmus quadricauda based on the phosphate absorption experimental data of prorocentrum donghaiense under different phosphorus concentrations in a recent paper jiang et al 2019 we proposed a two stage p i uptake kinetics model with the droop equation describing the dependence of cell growth on the qp based on the model of yao et al 2011 in refs jiang et al 2019 and yao et al 2011 the two stage model and the traditional one stage model were compared from the model fitting results the biological significance of parameters and statistical test results et al the two stage model provides a more reasonable and realistic explanation for the process of p i uptake by algae to better understand the effects of different p i concentrations and temperatures on the p i uptake kinetics of algae in the present paper the temperature function arrhenius function and p i stress function are further introduced to the model given in jiang et al 2019 and obtain a novel two stage kinetics model the parameter calibration and validation of the model are carried out based on the experimental data of p i uptake by k mikimotoi under different p i concentrations and temperatures then the effects of p i concentration and temperature on p i uptake characteristics of k mikimotoi are analyzed by experimental data and parameter fitting results the impact of different p i uptake characteristics of p donghaiense and k mikimotoi on interspecific competition between these two species under different p i concentrations and temperatures are also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the process of p i uptake by algae is divided into two steps in the first step p i in the substrate is adsorbed to the cell surface in the second step p i adsorbed on the cell surface is transported into the cell see jiang et al 2019 for more details we improve the model provided in jiang et al 2019 from the following two aspects firstly to clearly consider the influence of temperature on the growth rate of algae the arrhenius function is introduced into the model the early p i uptake model proposed by droop 1973 presents a simple quota model in which the specific growth rate of algae μ is assumed to be a function of intracellular p i concentration 1 μ μ max q c q min q c where μ max is the maximum growth rate of algae q c 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 is the cell quota of qp i e q c qp n where n is the cell density of algae and q min is the minimum of q c the maximum specific growth rate of algae though independent of limiting nutrient concentrations is still a function of other environmental variables such as temperature using the arrhenius equation μ max can be described as a function of temperature below goldman and carpenter 1974 bordel et al 2009 2 μ max a exp e k b t where t stands for the temperature and the parameters a e k b are respectively the maximum growth rate of algae at a particular temperature activation energy for algal growth and universal gas constant by substituting 2 into 1 then the specific growth rate of algae can be written as 3 μ a exp e k b t q c q min q c secondly to consider the influence of different p i concentrations on the uptake kinetics of p i by algae the p i stress function is introduced into the model in the model of jiang et al 2019 the traditional michaelis menten equation for p i transport rate pt was modified as 4 pt k p q max μ max s p s p k t 1 q c q max 4 1 q c q max 4 k q where k p is a dimensionless coefficient describing p i stress q max is the maximum quota of p i in the cell and k p q max μ max represents the maximum transport rate yao et al 2011 s p 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 is the cell quota of ap i e s p ap n k t is the half saturation constant from algal p i uptake and 5 1 q c q max 4 1 q c q max 4 k q is a feedback function describing the regulation of the transport rate of p i for each algal cell via the inhibition from the size of intracellular p i pool where k q is a coefficient in the feedback control function notice that k p describes the change of p i uptake rate of algae under p i stress and there are literatures demonstrating that it is inversely proportional to phosphorus concentration in the environment dyhrman and palenik 1999 rengefors et al 2003 yao et al 2011 algal cells can increase alkaline phosphatase activity and the number of high affinity phosphate transporters under low phosphorus conditions to improve p i uptake and utilization efficiency ou et al 2008 lin et al 2016 to describe the p i uptake characteristics of algae under different p i concentrations we propose the following p i stress function 6 k p 1 1 α wp β where wp is the p i concentration in substrate and the parameters α and β are respectively the coefficient of wp affecting transport rate and a dimensionless coefficient in p i stress function thus the final form of p i transport rate can be represented as 7 pt q max 1 1 α wp β a exp e k b t s p s p k t 1 q c q max 4 1 q c q max 4 k q based on above we can write out our novel p i uptake kinetics model as follows 8 d n d t a exp e k b t μ max arrhenius equation q c q min q c μ droop equation n r cell growth e n d cell death dap d t k a wp

the cell growth with respect to qp quota the second and the fourth equations describe respectively the p i adsorption and desorption between cell surface and substrate while the third equation describes the intracellular transportation of ap 2 2 experimental materials and methods 2 2 1 algal culture conditions karenia mikimotoi was provided by prof zhaoli xu from east china sea fisheries research institute shanghai china the algae was pre cultured at 20 c in f 2 medium guillard 1975 with a light intensity of 65 70 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 cool white light 12 12 h light dark cycle the photoperiod is from 6 am to 6 pm these cultures were manually shaken twice daily at 7 00 am and 6 00 pm these algal cells in the exponential growth phase were used in the following experiments 2 2 2 temperature treatment experiments to compare the growth rules of k mikimotoi at different temperatures these algal cells were cultured in 50 ml of fresh f 2 media in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks at an initial cell density of 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 the temperatures of the flasks were set at 20 c and 24 c and the illumination condition as preculture 2 2 3 phosphate uptake experiments the cell density of the algal cultures were about 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 and the experiments were divided into p i replete group 25 55 μ m p i and p i deplete group 0 74 μ m p i with three replicates a 10 ml sample was collected at the interval of 3 days in each group the determination methods of wp ap and qp are based on yao et al 2011 and jiang et al 2019 with minor modifications the cell density n was counted using the method of jiang et al 2019 at 0 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 day 2 2 4 model calibration and validation in this study parameter values of model 8 are calibrated based on the experimental data n wp q c s p of k mikimotoi at 24 c under the conditions of p i replete and p i deplete by using the least square method which is implemented by the function of fmincon of matlab r2016b the least square estimation method is to find a set of optimal parameter values in parameter space to minimize the objective function to get the objective function the following model cost is used in this study adhurya et al 2021 c o s t i j 1 n x i j s i m x i j o b s 2 x i j o b s 2 where c o s t i is the model cost of the i th state variable in parameter calibration n is the number of observed data x i j s i m is the simulation value of the j th day of the i th state variable and x i j o b s is the corresponding observed value of the j th day of the i th state variable model calibration of multiple variables simultaneously using the average cost of multiple variables as the objective function f θ m 1 m i 1 m c o s t i where θ is a parameter vector to be calibrated m is the number of state variables chosen to calibrate simultaneously after model calibration experimental data n wp q c s p of k mikimotoi at 20 c under two p i concentrations were used for model validation in addition the relative error is also calculated as another index to measure model fitness the relative error between the simulation data and the observation data is calculated by the method of marois and mitsch 2016 r e j x j s i m x j o b s 1 100 where r e j is the relative error x j s i m and x j o b s are the simulation data and the observation data at j th day respectively the relative error of a state variable is expressed by the average relative error of all experimental data 3 results 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 results of short term phosphate absorption experiments of k mikimotoi under p i replete condition the changes of state variables n wp q c cell quota of qp and s p cell quota of ap of k mikimotoi at 20 c and 24 c under the condition of p i replete over time are shown in fig 2 with the initial cell density of 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 n increased slowly during the early 6 days and increased quickly in the latter 12 days when the initial p i concentration in the substrate was 25 55 μ m the trends of wp in both 20 c and 24 c conditions ultimately reached a plateau after a sharp initial decline wp at 24 c decreased more significantly than wp at 20 c with the initial q c 6 70 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 the trends of q c at 20 c and 24 c were identified as increasing in the early 3 or 6 days then decreasing however the maximum value of q c 16 33 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 at 24 c was larger than that at 20 c 11 24 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 with the initial s p 19 68 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 s p at two temperatures increased in the first 3 days and dropped rapidly for the next 9 days then it maintained a more or less stable condition the peak value of s p at 24 c was higher than that at 20 c in addition the decline rates of s p at the two temperatures were different from day 3 to day 12 at 24 c s p first decreased slowly then decreased rapidly and finally decreased slowly while at 20 c s p declined almost linearly 3 1 2 results of short term phosphate absorption experiments of k mikimotoi under p i deplete condition the changes of n wp q c and s p of k mikimotoi at 20 c and 24 c under the condition of p i deplete with time are shown in fig 3 with the initial cell density 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 n showed a trend of fluctuation during the experiment at the condition of 20 c it increased in the first 9 days decreased in the next 6 days and increased in the last 3 days n at 24 c decreased in the first 3 days then increased in the latter 9 days and dropped again in the final 6 days with the initial p i concentration in substrate 0 74 μ m wp at 20 c was almost the same as wp at 24 c ultimately reached a plateau after a sharp initial decline with the initial q c 4 57 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 q c decreased almost linearly in the course of the experiment at two temperatures in the first 12 days the trend of decline was relatively fast and in the last 6 days reached a plateau with the initial s p 11 43 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 s p at 24 c decreased soon after increasing in the first 3 days while s p at 20 c decreased during the first 6 days finally s p tended to a plateau at both temperatures 3 2 experimental data fitting the model calibration and validation results are shown in figs 4 5 6 and 7 table 4 shows the model cost and relative error of all state variables in model calibration and validation the model fitting results of the experimental data of k mikimotoi under p i replete condition at 24 c are shown in fig 4 among the four variables q c has the best simulation effect model cost and relative error both are the smallest which are 0 63 and 2 79 respectively the algal cell density n and the substrate p i concentration wp are simulated moderately well with relative error of 11 21 and 13 83 respectively for s p the simulated curve shows a trend similar to the observed curve and can better simulate the observation data of the first 9 days however the model cannot fit the observed data for the last 9 days and simulation data is lower than the observation data the fitting results of model 8 under the condition of p i deplete at 24 c are given in fig 5 the simulation of q c performed the best with the model cost of 1 86 and the relative error of 15 34 for n and s p the model fitting curve and experimental data have similar trends but can only fit some data points for wp the model can well fit the variation trend of experimental data but in most cases the observed value of wp is underestimated the calibrated parameter values are displayed in table 3 figs 6 and 7 show the model validation results of the experimental data of k mikimotoi under the conditions of p i replete and p i deplete at 20 c it can be seen that the experimental data at 20 c can be well fitted by using the trained model here the model parameter values from in table 3 and only change the temperature value combined with the calibration and validation results of model 8 it can be seen that the novel two stage kinetics model can well describe the p i uptake characteristics of algae at different p i concentrations and temperatures 4 discussion in the previous paper jiang et al 2019 we focused on the comparison between the one stage model and the two stage model to study the p i uptake kinetics by algae p donghaiense in this study the effects of different p i concentrations and temperatures on the p i uptake characteristics of k mikimotoi are mainly considered combined with the experimental data and the fitting results of the model it can be found that the p i uptake characteristics of k mikimotoi are different under different p i concentrations and temperatures through these p i uptake characteristics the interspecific competition mechanism of two species p donghaiense and k mikimotoi during the red tide can be furthered to understand 4 1 the role of temperature on p i uptake the influence of temperature on the p i uptake process of algae can be divided into two aspects on the one hand temperature affects the activity of rate limiting enzymes which could limit the photosynthesis of light saturation and regulate the amount of inorganic phosphorus transported into cells von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 stitt 1986 when considering the influence of temperature on the rate limiting enzymes it is important to consider the independent effect of temperature on the maximum growth rate μ max which is temperature dependent and related to p i uptake directly bordel et al 2009 goldman and carpenter 1974 on the other hand temperature could influence other enzymes and physical processes raven and smith 1978 raven and geider 1988 which may also indirectly influence on phosphorus transport process under the same p i concentration in the substrate k mikimotoi showed different growth characteristics at different temperatures figs 2a and 3a one possible reason is that temperature can directly regulate algae growth through light fluctuations and nutrient availability it strongly affects the composition of cells the absorption rate of nutrients the fixation of carbon dioxide and the growth rate of algae juneja et al 2013 ahmad et al 2020 furthermore the peak values of q c and s p at 24 c were higher than those at 20 c in both p i replete and p i deplete see figs 2c d 3c and d 4 2 the role of p i concentration on p i uptake phosphorus is one of the main elements in phytoplankton growth which is directly engaged in many processes of photosynthesis such as the calvin cycle and adjustment of some enzymes activity wang et al 2004 shen and li 2016 in the present study k mikimotoi obviously grows fast under p i replete than those under p i deplete figs 2a and 3a one possible reason for this phenomenon is that the growth rate of algae is proportional to the p i concentration in a range of low and medium p i concentrations long and du 2005 shen and li 2016 about the condition of low p i concentration k mikimotoi ended the exponential growth phase earlier and entered the decline phase figs 2a and 3a this may be due to the luxury uptake of p i by algal cells under low phosphorus conditions which increases the growth rate of cells in a short time thus rapidly entering the exponential growth period to reach the peak and then entering the decrease stage due to the depletion of phosphorus the decrease of q c of k mikimotoi from day 6 to day 18 at 20 c and 24 c under the p i replete condition fig 2c which may be due to the dilution of intracellular p i concentration caused by the increase of cell density n and the decrease of p i concentration in the substrate wp resulted in the decrease of the amount of p i transported into cells the quantity q c decreased in k mikimotoi during the whole treatment time at 20 c and 24 c under the condition of low p i concentration fig 3c it may be because the p i concentration of substrate was lower so that k mikimotoi cannot grow and survive therefore as cell density grew previous cells had to allocate part of their own q c to newborn cells s p reached its maximum value faster and entered into stable phase earlier under p i deplete than that at p i replete figs 2d and 3d the reason for this phenomenon may be that algal cells at the condition of low p i concentration took little time to make p i of surface adsorbed transfer into intracellular than that at high p i concentration furthermore this can be explained as dinoflagellate cells can accelerate p i uptake by increasing the number of high affinity phosphate transporters when the deterioration of the external environment is in the state of phosphorus stress lin et al 2016 in model 8 a decreasing function k p of external phosphorus concentration is used to describe this phenomenon when p i is deficient k p has a large value and the uptake rate of p i by algal cells increased at this time in addition the parameter values of q max q min and s p max at p i replete group were higher than those at p i deplete group table 3 this may be because when phosphorus is sufficient the survival strategy of algae cell has changed increasing its internal and external p i pools and storing a large amount of p i to cope with sudden deterioration of the external environment kwon et al 2013 the value of e at p i replete is lower than that at p i deplete which may be increased cell mortality due to the lack of nutrition in the environment 4 3 the role of p i uptake on the competition between k m i k i m o t o i and p d o n g h a i e n s e jiang et al 2019 studied the p i uptake characteristics of p donghaiense by using the two stage kinetics model under different p i concentrations compared it with the one stage kinetics model and found that the two stage kinetics process was better than one stage kinetics process here the mechanism of competition between p donghaiense and k mikimotoi under various p i concentrations at 24 c will be discussed droop first proposed the concept of luxury coefficient r q max q min and used it to express the nutritional storage capacity of algal cells a larger r gives a stronger p i storage capacity of algal cells droop 1974 li 2007 the utility value of the nutrient storage in algal cells for cell growth depends also on the maximum growth rate of the algae for this reason pedersen and borum 1996 proposed the concept of growth potential t g ln r μ max to evaluate the utility of nutrients stored in algal cells for cell growth and reproduction table 5 shows the calculation results of luxury coefficient r and growth potential t g of k mikimotoi and p donghaiense at two p i concentrations of 24 c the values of r of p donghaiense and k mikimotoi under p i replete condition at 24 c are 26 87 jiang et al 2019 and 41 68 respectively t g values of p donghaiense and k mikimotoi under p i replete condition at 24 c are 8 76 jiang et al 2019 and 16 45 respectively the higher values of r and t g of k mikimotoi than those of p donghaiense under the condition of p i replete concentration at 24 c imply that the viability of k mikimotoi is better than p donghaiense in the bi algae substrate at higher temperature under p i replete condition 24 c and 28 c shen et al 2014 similarly the large values of r and t g in k mikimotoi 48 75 16 83 than those in p donghaiense 26 84 8 45 under p i deplete condition at 24 c imply that the viability of k mikimotoi is also better than p donghaiense in bi algal culture medium under p i deplete condition at 24 c 5 conclusion based on the two stage model in our previous work jiang et al 2019 a novel two stage kinetics model is developed by combining the arrhenius temperature function and p i stress function this model will help predict p i uptake kinetics of algae at different phosphorus and temperatures concentrations the model parameters are calibrated by the experimental data of k mikimotoi at 24 c under the conditions of p i replete and p i deplete and then the model is validated by the experimental data of two p i concentrations at 20 c experimental data and fitting results suggest that the p i uptake characteristics of the k mikimotoi vary under different cultural conditions of p i concentration and temperature furthermore by using the results of experiments and parameter values the interspecific competition between two species k mikimotoi and p donghaiense under different p i concentrations are discussed in order to predict the occurrence of algal blooms in oceans using observational information from marine and experimental results some factors need to be explored further for example p h value solar irradiance water velocity environmental toxins and the direct or indirect interactions of algal species yang and yuan 2021 xu et al 2021 constraints of solar irradiance and phosphate on algae or algae daphnia interactions were modeled in wang et al 2008 li and wang 2012 peace et al 2014 peace and wang 2019 yuan et al 2020 davies and wang 2021 and zhao et al 2020 via stoichiometric theory the integration of stoichiometric models with the multi stage algal nutrient uptake process would provide a fundamental modeling framework of nutrient cycling and energy flow in trophic cascades this would be a promising cutting edge area to explore in the future

24439,phosphate p i and temperature are two important environmental factors affecting algal growth and the occurrence of red tide in this paper we conduct experiments on karenia mikimotoi under different p i concentrations and temperatures and propose a novel p i uptake model by incorporating arrhenius function and p i stress function into the two stage model presented in one of our recent paper jiang et al 2019 in both p i replete and p i deplete the model parameters are obtained by fitting the experimental data at 24 c and validated by the experimental data at 20 c respectively k mikimotoi under low p i condition entered into the exponential growth phase earlier compared with p i replete groups under the p i replete condition k mikimotoi continually increased while the p i deplete condition showed a wave trend the experimental results and the fitting of experimental data both show that k mikimotoi has an obvious response to temperature in both p i replete and p i deplete the peak values of the cell quota of intracellular p i and surface adsorbed p i at 24 c were higher than those at 20 c using the luxury coefficient and growth potential interspecific competition between k mikimotoi and prorocentrum donghaiense is also discussed these results and conclusions are helpful to understand the p i uptake characteristics of algae at different p i concentrations and temperatures and could effectively explain mechanisms of interspecific competition and succession between different algae species during red tide keywords algal bloom competition prorocentrum donghaiense surface adsorption two stage model data accessibility all data used in this study can be found in the manuscript and its supplementary materials 1 introduction karenia mikimotoi formerly named gymnodinium mikimotoi brand et al 2012 a widely distributed red tide species is known to form alternating blooms with some other harmful algae species e g prorocentrum donghaiense heterocapsa circularisquama and so on chang 2011 li et al 2009 uchida et al 1999 since 1998 the blooms of k mikimotoi have often been seen in the coastal waters of the zhejiang and fujian provinces in china and have caused heavy losses in aquaculture and deterioration of the marine ecological environment zhao 2010 li et al 2019 lü et al 2019 it is found that after diatom blooms the concentration of phosphate p i is relatively low in the coastal water of the east china sea li et al 2009 zhao 2010 and the previous studies showed that the p i uptake rate in cells with p i stress is higher than that without p i stress lehman and sandgren 1982 riegman and mur 1984 lin et al 2016 on the other hand the temperature is also a major factor controlling photosynthesis which has a close relationship with the metabolism and growth of algae helbling et al 2011 shen et al 2016 davison 1991 it can affect the maximum growth rate of algae goldman and carpenter 1974 thereby changing the p i uptake rate of algae cells and affecting the alternations of algal blooms karentz and smayda 1984 during most k mikimotoi blooms the sea surface temperature ranges from 18 c to 26 c zhao 2010 chen et al 2003 zhou et al 2017b a the highest specific growth rate of k mikimotoi is obtained at 24 c shen et al 2016 and the average sea surface temperature from 2001 to 2010 was 23 6 c when blooms of k mikimotoi occurred in the east china sea zhao 2010 hence it is important to understand the kinetics of p i uptake by algae under different conditions of p i concentration and temperature in many previous studies the michaelis menten equation has often been used to describe the nutrient uptake process by algae lee et al 2015 however the successful use of michaelis menten kinetics model to describe nutrient uptake often masks the difficulties in interpreting the kinetics parameters obtained by measurement droop 1983 in addition the two parameter michaelis menten kinetics model cannot well describe the observed phenomenon of luxury uptake of algae cells under p i stress goldman et al 1981 harrison et al 1976 1989 therefore it is not enough to describe the p i uptake process of microalgae only by michaelis menten kinetics within the adaptive range algae can maintain the maximum growth rate by adjusting their internal nutrient quota and absorbing nutrients at the maximum short term nutrient uptake rate according to changes in external nutrient concentration morel 1987 aksnes and egge 1991 developed a phytoplankton nutrient uptake rate model described by v n a v s 1 h a v s where v is the uptake rate n is the number of cellular uptake sites a is the area of uptake sites h is the time required for processing one nutrient ion v is the mass transfer coefficient s is the nutrient concentration in the substrate and confirmed that the michaelis menten equation applied to the uptake process of algae was a special case of the model in fact this model can be rearranged as v n h 1 s h a v 1 s which can then be transmitted to the classical michaelis menten kinetics model by letting v max n h 1 and k s h a v 1 harrison et al 1989 suggested that the maximum uptake rate of cells should be related to the size of the intracellular p i pools considering the multiple p i pools in cells john and flynn 2000 established the three compartment p i model of microalgal growth phosphate interaction model pim recently singh et al 2018 further extended the pim model by considering the combined effects of light and nutrients on algal growth notice that most studies mentioned above only considered the transportation from substrate into cells in fact the intracellular p i qp pool and surface adsorbed p i ap pool have great significance to the investigation of p i uptake kinetics of phytoplankton harrison et al 1989 jiang et al 2019 yao et al 2011 sañudo wilhelmy et al 2004 jin et al 2021 the coexistence of qp pool and ap pool demonstrate that the p i uptake process of algae should be divided into two stages substrate p i wp is first adsorbed on the cell surface and then ap enters the interior of cell to become qp through the active transport of membrane considering the effects of ap and qp on algal growth liu et al 2007 established a two stage growth kinetics model of algae by further considering the regulation via transport inhibition from size of qp pool yao et al 2011 constructed a two stage kinetics model of p i uptake by algae based on the experimental data of short term absorption kinetics of a green algae scenedesmus quadricauda based on the phosphate absorption experimental data of prorocentrum donghaiense under different phosphorus concentrations in a recent paper jiang et al 2019 we proposed a two stage p i uptake kinetics model with the droop equation describing the dependence of cell growth on the qp based on the model of yao et al 2011 in refs jiang et al 2019 and yao et al 2011 the two stage model and the traditional one stage model were compared from the model fitting results the biological significance of parameters and statistical test results et al the two stage model provides a more reasonable and realistic explanation for the process of p i uptake by algae to better understand the effects of different p i concentrations and temperatures on the p i uptake kinetics of algae in the present paper the temperature function arrhenius function and p i stress function are further introduced to the model given in jiang et al 2019 and obtain a novel two stage kinetics model the parameter calibration and validation of the model are carried out based on the experimental data of p i uptake by k mikimotoi under different p i concentrations and temperatures then the effects of p i concentration and temperature on p i uptake characteristics of k mikimotoi are analyzed by experimental data and parameter fitting results the impact of different p i uptake characteristics of p donghaiense and k mikimotoi on interspecific competition between these two species under different p i concentrations and temperatures are also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 model description the process of p i uptake by algae is divided into two steps in the first step p i in the substrate is adsorbed to the cell surface in the second step p i adsorbed on the cell surface is transported into the cell see jiang et al 2019 for more details we improve the model provided in jiang et al 2019 from the following two aspects firstly to clearly consider the influence of temperature on the growth rate of algae the arrhenius function is introduced into the model the early p i uptake model proposed by droop 1973 presents a simple quota model in which the specific growth rate of algae μ is assumed to be a function of intracellular p i concentration 1 μ μ max q c q min q c where μ max is the maximum growth rate of algae q c 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 is the cell quota of qp i e q c qp n where n is the cell density of algae and q min is the minimum of q c the maximum specific growth rate of algae though independent of limiting nutrient concentrations is still a function of other environmental variables such as temperature using the arrhenius equation μ max can be described as a function of temperature below goldman and carpenter 1974 bordel et al 2009 2 μ max a exp e k b t where t stands for the temperature and the parameters a e k b are respectively the maximum growth rate of algae at a particular temperature activation energy for algal growth and universal gas constant by substituting 2 into 1 then the specific growth rate of algae can be written as 3 μ a exp e k b t q c q min q c secondly to consider the influence of different p i concentrations on the uptake kinetics of p i by algae the p i stress function is introduced into the model in the model of jiang et al 2019 the traditional michaelis menten equation for p i transport rate pt was modified as 4 pt k p q max μ max s p s p k t 1 q c q max 4 1 q c q max 4 k q where k p is a dimensionless coefficient describing p i stress q max is the maximum quota of p i in the cell and k p q max μ max represents the maximum transport rate yao et al 2011 s p 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 is the cell quota of ap i e s p ap n k t is the half saturation constant from algal p i uptake and 5 1 q c q max 4 1 q c q max 4 k q is a feedback function describing the regulation of the transport rate of p i for each algal cell via the inhibition from the size of intracellular p i pool where k q is a coefficient in the feedback control function notice that k p describes the change of p i uptake rate of algae under p i stress and there are literatures demonstrating that it is inversely proportional to phosphorus concentration in the environment dyhrman and palenik 1999 rengefors et al 2003 yao et al 2011 algal cells can increase alkaline phosphatase activity and the number of high affinity phosphate transporters under low phosphorus conditions to improve p i uptake and utilization efficiency ou et al 2008 lin et al 2016 to describe the p i uptake characteristics of algae under different p i concentrations we propose the following p i stress function 6 k p 1 1 α wp β where wp is the p i concentration in substrate and the parameters α and β are respectively the coefficient of wp affecting transport rate and a dimensionless coefficient in p i stress function thus the final form of p i transport rate can be represented as 7 pt q max 1 1 α wp β a exp e k b t s p s p k t 1 q c q max 4 1 q c q max 4 k q based on above we can write out our novel p i uptake kinetics model as follows 8 d n d t a exp e k b t μ max arrhenius equation q c q min q c μ droop equation n r cell growth e n d cell death dap d t k a wp

the cell growth with respect to qp quota the second and the fourth equations describe respectively the p i adsorption and desorption between cell surface and substrate while the third equation describes the intracellular transportation of ap 2 2 experimental materials and methods 2 2 1 algal culture conditions karenia mikimotoi was provided by prof zhaoli xu from east china sea fisheries research institute shanghai china the algae was pre cultured at 20 c in f 2 medium guillard 1975 with a light intensity of 65 70 μ mol photons m 2 s 1 cool white light 12 12 h light dark cycle the photoperiod is from 6 am to 6 pm these cultures were manually shaken twice daily at 7 00 am and 6 00 pm these algal cells in the exponential growth phase were used in the following experiments 2 2 2 temperature treatment experiments to compare the growth rules of k mikimotoi at different temperatures these algal cells were cultured in 50 ml of fresh f 2 media in 100 ml erlenmeyer flasks at an initial cell density of 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 the temperatures of the flasks were set at 20 c and 24 c and the illumination condition as preculture 2 2 3 phosphate uptake experiments the cell density of the algal cultures were about 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 and the experiments were divided into p i replete group 25 55 μ m p i and p i deplete group 0 74 μ m p i with three replicates a 10 ml sample was collected at the interval of 3 days in each group the determination methods of wp ap and qp are based on yao et al 2011 and jiang et al 2019 with minor modifications the cell density n was counted using the method of jiang et al 2019 at 0 3 6 9 12 15 and 18 day 2 2 4 model calibration and validation in this study parameter values of model 8 are calibrated based on the experimental data n wp q c s p of k mikimotoi at 24 c under the conditions of p i replete and p i deplete by using the least square method which is implemented by the function of fmincon of matlab r2016b the least square estimation method is to find a set of optimal parameter values in parameter space to minimize the objective function to get the objective function the following model cost is used in this study adhurya et al 2021 c o s t i j 1 n x i j s i m x i j o b s 2 x i j o b s 2 where c o s t i is the model cost of the i th state variable in parameter calibration n is the number of observed data x i j s i m is the simulation value of the j th day of the i th state variable and x i j o b s is the corresponding observed value of the j th day of the i th state variable model calibration of multiple variables simultaneously using the average cost of multiple variables as the objective function f θ m 1 m i 1 m c o s t i where θ is a parameter vector to be calibrated m is the number of state variables chosen to calibrate simultaneously after model calibration experimental data n wp q c s p of k mikimotoi at 20 c under two p i concentrations were used for model validation in addition the relative error is also calculated as another index to measure model fitness the relative error between the simulation data and the observation data is calculated by the method of marois and mitsch 2016 r e j x j s i m x j o b s 1 100 where r e j is the relative error x j s i m and x j o b s are the simulation data and the observation data at j th day respectively the relative error of a state variable is expressed by the average relative error of all experimental data 3 results 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 results of short term phosphate absorption experiments of k mikimotoi under p i replete condition the changes of state variables n wp q c cell quota of qp and s p cell quota of ap of k mikimotoi at 20 c and 24 c under the condition of p i replete over time are shown in fig 2 with the initial cell density of 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 n increased slowly during the early 6 days and increased quickly in the latter 12 days when the initial p i concentration in the substrate was 25 55 μ m the trends of wp in both 20 c and 24 c conditions ultimately reached a plateau after a sharp initial decline wp at 24 c decreased more significantly than wp at 20 c with the initial q c 6 70 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 the trends of q c at 20 c and 24 c were identified as increasing in the early 3 or 6 days then decreasing however the maximum value of q c 16 33 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 at 24 c was larger than that at 20 c 11 24 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 with the initial s p 19 68 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 s p at two temperatures increased in the first 3 days and dropped rapidly for the next 9 days then it maintained a more or less stable condition the peak value of s p at 24 c was higher than that at 20 c in addition the decline rates of s p at the two temperatures were different from day 3 to day 12 at 24 c s p first decreased slowly then decreased rapidly and finally decreased slowly while at 20 c s p declined almost linearly 3 1 2 results of short term phosphate absorption experiments of k mikimotoi under p i deplete condition the changes of n wp q c and s p of k mikimotoi at 20 c and 24 c under the condition of p i deplete with time are shown in fig 3 with the initial cell density 0 2 1 0 8 cells l 1 n showed a trend of fluctuation during the experiment at the condition of 20 c it increased in the first 9 days decreased in the next 6 days and increased in the last 3 days n at 24 c decreased in the first 3 days then increased in the latter 9 days and dropped again in the final 6 days with the initial p i concentration in substrate 0 74 μ m wp at 20 c was almost the same as wp at 24 c ultimately reached a plateau after a sharp initial decline with the initial q c 4 57 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 q c decreased almost linearly in the course of the experiment at two temperatures in the first 12 days the trend of decline was relatively fast and in the last 6 days reached a plateau with the initial s p 11 43 1 0 8 μ mol cell 1 s p at 24 c decreased soon after increasing in the first 3 days while s p at 20 c decreased during the first 6 days finally s p tended to a plateau at both temperatures 3 2 experimental data fitting the model calibration and validation results are shown in figs 4 5 6 and 7 table 4 shows the model cost and relative error of all state variables in model calibration and validation the model fitting results of the experimental data of k mikimotoi under p i replete condition at 24 c are shown in fig 4 among the four variables q c has the best simulation effect model cost and relative error both are the smallest which are 0 63 and 2 79 respectively the algal cell density n and the substrate p i concentration wp are simulated moderately well with relative error of 11 21 and 13 83 respectively for s p the simulated curve shows a trend similar to the observed curve and can better simulate the observation data of the first 9 days however the model cannot fit the observed data for the last 9 days and simulation data is lower than the observation data the fitting results of model 8 under the condition of p i deplete at 24 c are given in fig 5 the simulation of q c performed the best with the model cost of 1 86 and the relative error of 15 34 for n and s p the model fitting curve and experimental data have similar trends but can only fit some data points for wp the model can well fit the variation trend of experimental data but in most cases the observed value of wp is underestimated the calibrated parameter values are displayed in table 3 figs 6 and 7 show the model validation results of the experimental data of k mikimotoi under the conditions of p i replete and p i deplete at 20 c it can be seen that the experimental data at 20 c can be well fitted by using the trained model here the model parameter values from in table 3 and only change the temperature value combined with the calibration and validation results of model 8 it can be seen that the novel two stage kinetics model can well describe the p i uptake characteristics of algae at different p i concentrations and temperatures 4 discussion in the previous paper jiang et al 2019 we focused on the comparison between the one stage model and the two stage model to study the p i uptake kinetics by algae p donghaiense in this study the effects of different p i concentrations and temperatures on the p i uptake characteristics of k mikimotoi are mainly considered combined with the experimental data and the fitting results of the model it can be found that the p i uptake characteristics of k mikimotoi are different under different p i concentrations and temperatures through these p i uptake characteristics the interspecific competition mechanism of two species p donghaiense and k mikimotoi during the red tide can be furthered to understand 4 1 the role of temperature on p i uptake the influence of temperature on the p i uptake process of algae can be divided into two aspects on the one hand temperature affects the activity of rate limiting enzymes which could limit the photosynthesis of light saturation and regulate the amount of inorganic phosphorus transported into cells von caemmerer and farquhar 1981 stitt 1986 when considering the influence of temperature on the rate limiting enzymes it is important to consider the independent effect of temperature on the maximum growth rate μ max which is temperature dependent and related to p i uptake directly bordel et al 2009 goldman and carpenter 1974 on the other hand temperature could influence other enzymes and physical processes raven and smith 1978 raven and geider 1988 which may also indirectly influence on phosphorus transport process under the same p i concentration in the substrate k mikimotoi showed different growth characteristics at different temperatures figs 2a and 3a one possible reason is that temperature can directly regulate algae growth through light fluctuations and nutrient availability it strongly affects the composition of cells the absorption rate of nutrients the fixation of carbon dioxide and the growth rate of algae juneja et al 2013 ahmad et al 2020 furthermore the peak values of q c and s p at 24 c were higher than those at 20 c in both p i replete and p i deplete see figs 2c d 3c and d 4 2 the role of p i concentration on p i uptake phosphorus is one of the main elements in phytoplankton growth which is directly engaged in many processes of photosynthesis such as the calvin cycle and adjustment of some enzymes activity wang et al 2004 shen and li 2016 in the present study k mikimotoi obviously grows fast under p i replete than those under p i deplete figs 2a and 3a one possible reason for this phenomenon is that the growth rate of algae is proportional to the p i concentration in a range of low and medium p i concentrations long and du 2005 shen and li 2016 about the condition of low p i concentration k mikimotoi ended the exponential growth phase earlier and entered the decline phase figs 2a and 3a this may be due to the luxury uptake of p i by algal cells under low phosphorus conditions which increases the growth rate of cells in a short time thus rapidly entering the exponential growth period to reach the peak and then entering the decrease stage due to the depletion of phosphorus the decrease of q c of k mikimotoi from day 6 to day 18 at 20 c and 24 c under the p i replete condition fig 2c which may be due to the dilution of intracellular p i concentration caused by the increase of cell density n and the decrease of p i concentration in the substrate wp resulted in the decrease of the amount of p i transported into cells the quantity q c decreased in k mikimotoi during the whole treatment time at 20 c and 24 c under the condition of low p i concentration fig 3c it may be because the p i concentration of substrate was lower so that k mikimotoi cannot grow and survive therefore as cell density grew previous cells had to allocate part of their own q c to newborn cells s p reached its maximum value faster and entered into stable phase earlier under p i deplete than that at p i replete figs 2d and 3d the reason for this phenomenon may be that algal cells at the condition of low p i concentration took little time to make p i of surface adsorbed transfer into intracellular than that at high p i concentration furthermore this can be explained as dinoflagellate cells can accelerate p i uptake by increasing the number of high affinity phosphate transporters when the deterioration of the external environment is in the state of phosphorus stress lin et al 2016 in model 8 a decreasing function k p of external phosphorus concentration is used to describe this phenomenon when p i is deficient k p has a large value and the uptake rate of p i by algal cells increased at this time in addition the parameter values of q max q min and s p max at p i replete group were higher than those at p i deplete group table 3 this may be because when phosphorus is sufficient the survival strategy of algae cell has changed increasing its internal and external p i pools and storing a large amount of p i to cope with sudden deterioration of the external environment kwon et al 2013 the value of e at p i replete is lower than that at p i deplete which may be increased cell mortality due to the lack of nutrition in the environment 4 3 the role of p i uptake on the competition between k m i k i m o t o i and p d o n g h a i e n s e jiang et al 2019 studied the p i uptake characteristics of p donghaiense by using the two stage kinetics model under different p i concentrations compared it with the one stage kinetics model and found that the two stage kinetics process was better than one stage kinetics process here the mechanism of competition between p donghaiense and k mikimotoi under various p i concentrations at 24 c will be discussed droop first proposed the concept of luxury coefficient r q max q min and used it to express the nutritional storage capacity of algal cells a larger r gives a stronger p i storage capacity of algal cells droop 1974 li 2007 the utility value of the nutrient storage in algal cells for cell growth depends also on the maximum growth rate of the algae for this reason pedersen and borum 1996 proposed the concept of growth potential t g ln r μ max to evaluate the utility of nutrients stored in algal cells for cell growth and reproduction table 5 shows the calculation results of luxury coefficient r and growth potential t g of k mikimotoi and p donghaiense at two p i concentrations of 24 c the values of r of p donghaiense and k mikimotoi under p i replete condition at 24 c are 26 87 jiang et al 2019 and 41 68 respectively t g values of p donghaiense and k mikimotoi under p i replete condition at 24 c are 8 76 jiang et al 2019 and 16 45 respectively the higher values of r and t g of k mikimotoi than those of p donghaiense under the condition of p i replete concentration at 24 c imply that the viability of k mikimotoi is better than p donghaiense in the bi algae substrate at higher temperature under p i replete condition 24 c and 28 c shen et al 2014 similarly the large values of r and t g in k mikimotoi 48 75 16 83 than those in p donghaiense 26 84 8 45 under p i deplete condition at 24 c imply that the viability of k mikimotoi is also better than p donghaiense in bi algal culture medium under p i deplete condition at 24 c 5 conclusion based on the two stage model in our previous work jiang et al 2019 a novel two stage kinetics model is developed by combining the arrhenius temperature function and p i stress function this model will help predict p i uptake kinetics of algae at different phosphorus and temperatures concentrations the model parameters are calibrated by the experimental data of k mikimotoi at 24 c under the conditions of p i replete and p i deplete and then the model is validated by the experimental data of two p i concentrations at 20 c experimental data and fitting results suggest that the p i uptake characteristics of the k mikimotoi vary under different cultural conditions of p i concentration and temperature furthermore by using the results of experiments and parameter values the interspecific competition between two species k mikimotoi and p donghaiense under different p i concentrations are discussed in order to predict the occurrence of algal blooms in oceans using observational information from marine and experimental results some factors need to be explored further for example p h value solar irradiance water velocity environmental toxins and the direct or indirect interactions of algal species yang and yuan 2021 xu et al 2021 constraints of solar irradiance and phosphate on algae or algae daphnia interactions were modeled in wang et al 2008 li and wang 2012 peace et al 2014 peace and wang 2019 yuan et al 2020 davies and wang 2021 and zhao et al 2020 via stoichiometric theory the integration of stoichiometric models with the multi stage algal nutrient uptake process would provide a fundamental modeling framework of nutrient cycling and energy flow in trophic cascades this would be a promising cutting edge area to explore in the future
