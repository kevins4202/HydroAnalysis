the arid and semi arid climates accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et o can provide a scientific basis for developing irrigation scheduling for saving irrigation water and efficiently use water et o is required evapotranspiration is the combination of two separate processes whereby water is lost on the one hand from the soil surface by evaporation and on the other hand from the crop by transpiration jensen and allen 2016 since allen et al 1998 established the first version of fao 56 with the penman monteith equation fao pm fao pm became a standard for calculating reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 fao pm has been widely used due to its satisfactory results under various climate conditions around the world but it requires a large amount of meteorological data hobbins 2016 which originates from standard metrological observation stations to overcome the existing limits of the fao pm model various attempts aiming to estimate et o with limited observed data have been conducted a large number of studies have focused on estimating et o using limited ground data such as the hargreaves and samani equation priestley taylor equation and thornthwaite equation were used for estimating et o djaman et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2017 the demand of water for industries and agriculture sector in india is continuously growing to meet the demands of 1 2 billion people wheat and maize are the most commonly cultivated crops and have high water consumption in the region of punjab india punjab known as the bread basket of india has 3 51 million ha land under wheat cultivation with production and productivity of 17 million tonnes and 4 85 tonnes ha1 respectively the state alone contributes 40 of wheat to the central pool i e critical for the food security of india go 2014 since the central zone of punjab is facing problem of declining water table increased energy cost for pumping and scanty rainfall so there is a need to manage the available surface and groundwater resources optimally to sustain agriculture over estimation of crop water requirement leads to waste water water logging nutrient leaching in the soil and polluting the groundwater resources the problems in irrigation sector in india include low irrigation efficiency 30 35 uncontrolled water delivery tail end water deprivation seepage loss siltation waterlogging and soil salinity to avoid such negative impact proper policies and measures are needed for the quantification of crop growth as well as water in this context state of the science agricultural models have been widely accepted tools for developing water management information for increased water productivity in agriculture mcnider et al 2015 saseendran et al 2015 several computer simulation techniques and

many researchers have further improved jensen 1968 doorenbos 1975 burman et al 1980 however k c approach has the potential to precisely calculate the actual crop evapotranspiration etc according to the fao methodology by allen et al 1998 the four growing stages of a crop are the initial stage crop development stage mid season stage and end season stage allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient method can be expressed as follows allen et al 1998 1 et c k c et o where et c represents the crop water requirement mm d 1 k c the crop coefficient et o the reference crop water requirement mm d 1

india using ensembling method such as the fuzzy genetic and regularization random forest models there is a great need to modernize agricultural practices for better water productivity and resource conservation any changes in meteorological variables due to climate change will affect evapotranspiration crop water requirement and eventually affect water allocation for agriculture and food production zhang et al 2011 in this paper the proposed model is designed on the basis of two factors firstly agriculture analyst can predict the k c crop coefficient without having prior knowledge of

crop evapotranspiration et c for ludhiana station using training and testing datasets 2 3 1 crop modeling fuzzy genetic simulation a genetic algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm to construct a fuzzy system that adequate to fit the given training data it can be used as a prediction model composed of fuzzy logic rules that provide a good linguistic representation the package fuger bujard 2012 implements genetic algorithms to construct an frbs from numerical data for classification bujard and rcpp 2012 an idea of applying genetic algorithms in the field of fuzzy modeling appeared in the early nineties of the last century the package fuger is designed for training fuzzy systems based on evolutionary algorithms it is based on fuzzy cooperative coevolution where two co evolving species are defined the database and the rulebase in this package there are two main functions which are fuger run for construction of the frbs model and fuger predict for prediction the genetic algorithm generates a random population of the fuzzy system at each generation all the fuzzy systems are tested and their predictions are then compared with the labels and a performance is given at each system the top best system elitism are taken without modification for the next generation the population is used to generate the population for the next generation using crossover and mutation finally the fuzzy system with the best performance is obtained for the development of model we have set maximum number of rules as 5 maximum variables per rule set as 4 and a number of generations considered are 100 to 150 and the population as 200 the elitist parameter was set to be 20 out of every generation the flowchart of fuzzy genetic system is presented in fig 3 2 3 2 regularized random forest random forest rf is a well established supervised machine learning algorithm for classification and regression models there are several techniques to construct the ensemble for instance bagging and boosting etc our experiments investigate the performance of the regularized random forest rrf tree as the analyst ensemble model rrf is a recent augmentation of random forest rf apply a regularization framework to random forests that incorporates into the tree growing algorithm deng 2013 regularization usually involves the additional penalty to a loss function in order to prevent overfitting in this paper we implemented rrf using the caret and rrf packages the rrf model has been known by its two primary reasons firstly rrfs are well known to provide high accuracies that are competitive with state of the art across a wide range of classification or regression problems secondly rrfs are relatively efficient to train which is important to our study since we must train one rrf for each possible subset of features up to some maximum size the regularization framework is applied to the random forest and boosted trees and can be easily applied to other tree models 2 4 model development

the arid and semi arid climates accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et o can provide a scientific basis for developing irrigation scheduling for saving irrigation water and efficiently use water et o is required evapotranspiration is the combination of two separate processes whereby water is lost on the one hand from the soil surface by evaporation and on the other hand from the crop by transpiration jensen and allen 2016 since allen et al 1998 established the first version of fao 56 with the penman monteith equation fao pm fao pm became a standard for calculating reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 fao pm has been widely used due to its satisfactory results under various climate conditions around the world but it requires a large amount of meteorological data hobbins 2016 which originates from standard metrological observation stations to overcome the existing limits of the fao pm model various attempts aiming to estimate et o with limited observed data

india using ensembling method such as the fuzzy genetic and regularization random forest models there is a great need to modernize agricultural practices for better water productivity and resource conservation any changes in meteorological variables due to climate change will affect evapotranspiration crop water requirement and eventually affect water allocation for agriculture and food production zhang et al 2011 in this paper the proposed model is designed on the basis of two factors firstly agriculture analyst can predict the k c crop coefficient without having prior knowledge of

crop evapotranspiration et c for ludhiana station using training and testing datasets 2 3 1 crop modeling fuzzy genetic simulation a genetic algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm to construct a fuzzy system that adequate to fit the given training data it can be used as a prediction model composed of fuzzy logic rules that provide a good linguistic representation the package fuger bujard 2012 implements genetic algorithms to construct an frbs from numerical data for classification bujard and rcpp 2012 an idea of applying genetic algorithms in the field of fuzzy modeling appeared in the early nineties of the last century the package fuger is designed for training fuzzy systems based on evolutionary algorithms it is based on fuzzy cooperative coevolution where two co evolving species are defined the database and the rulebase in this package there are two main functions which are fuger run for construction of the frbs model and fuger predict for prediction the genetic algorithm generates a random population of the fuzzy system at each generation all the fuzzy systems are tested and their predictions are then compared with the labels and a performance is given at each system the top best system elitism are taken without modification for the next generation the population is used to generate the population for the next generation using crossover and mutation finally the fuzzy system with the best performance is obtained for the development of model we have set maximum number of rules as 5 maximum variables per rule set as 4 and a number of generations considered are 100 to 150 and the population as 200 the elitist parameter was set to be 20 out of every generation the flowchart of fuzzy genetic system is presented in fig 3 2 3 2 regularized random forest random forest rf is a well established supervised machine learning algorithm for classification and regression models there are several techniques to construct the ensemble for instance bagging and boosting etc our experiments investigate the performance of the regularized random forest rrf tree as the analyst ensemble model rrf is a recent augmentation of random forest rf apply a regularization framework to random forests that incorporates into the tree growing algorithm deng 2013 regularization usually involves the additional penalty to a loss function in order to prevent overfitting in this paper we implemented rrf using the caret and rrf packages the rrf model has been known by its two primary reasons firstly rrfs are well known to provide high accuracies that are competitive with state of the art across a wide range of classification or regression problems secondly rrfs are relatively efficient to train which is important to our study since we must train one rrf for each possible subset of features up to some maximum size the regularization framework is applied to the random forest and boosted trees and can be easily applied to other tree models 2 4 model development the fuzzy genetic and regularized random forest fg rrf proposed model is implemented using rstudio version 3 5 2 to simulate the reference crop coefficient k c and et c the proposed model consists of

historical weather dataset is collected from imd and case study of crop coefficient k c values of three crops such as maize wheat1 wheat2 by pau ludhiana in the data preprocessing stage the reference evapotranspiration et o and solar radiation r s parameters are estimated using cropwat 8 0 software the et c is calculated on the basis of estimated et o and k c values using the equation 2 in third stage fuzzy genetic model is applied to simulate the k c and et c values using training dataset based on the fuzzy genetic model prediction results both k c and et c prediction probabilities are combined in newly dataset with previous weather dataset this ensemble dataset is evaluated on the basis of performance metrics to check accuracy of results in the fourth stage the ensembling dataset

decision support tools for predicting et c in agriculture across different climate parameters time series forecasting of evapotranspiration is very important in order to help the decision makers to build up proper systems to sustain and manage water resources because time series considered that the history repeats itself hence by analyzing the past values better choices or forecasts can be

10761,the use of drainage pipe is documented as far back as 200 b c and continues to be used in poorly drained agricultural regions throughout the world while good for crop production the eco hydrologic impacts of this modification have been shown to adversely affect natural drainage networks identifying the exact location of drainage pipe networks is essential to developing groundwater and surface water models the geometry of drainage pipe networks installed decades ago has often been lost with time or was never well documented in the first place previous work has recognized that drainage pipes can be observed for certain soil types in visible spectrum rgb remote sensing data due to changes in soil albedo in this work small unmanned aerial systems suas were used to collect high resolution rgb and thermal data to map subsurface drainage pipe within less than 96 h of a small 1 3 cm rain event a total of approximately 60 ha of suas thermal and rgb data were acquired at two different locations in the iml czo in illinois the thermal imagery showed limited evidence of thermal contrast related to the drainage pipe if the data were acquired immediately after a rain event it is more likely a temperature contrast would have been detected due to lower soil moisture proximal to the drainage pipe network the rgb data however elucidated the drainage pipe entirely at one site and elucidated traces of the drainage pipe at the other site these results illustrate the importance of the timing of suas data collection with respect to the precipitation event ongoing related work focusing on laboratory and numerical experiments to better quantify feedbacks between albedo soil moisture and heat transfer will help predict the optimal timing of data collection for applications such as drainage pipe mapping keywords uas tile drainage cpt drainage pipe drone remote sensing czo thermal mapping 1 introduction tile drainage pipe has been used throughout the world in poorly drained agricultural areas since greek and roman times klippart 1862 drainage pipes were originally made of loosely jointed sections of clay pipe but in recent decades has been replaced by perforated corrugated plastic tubing cpt networks both clay tile and cpt are buried sub horizontally 0 5 2 m below agricultural fields and gently slope 5 to a surface runoff discharge point such as a drainage ditch or stream drainage pipe networks accelerate groundwater movement shilling et al 2015 thus removing excess groundwater to improve crop production reduce salt accumulation improve timeliness of field operations decrease soil erosion and compaction hofstrand 2010 ruark et al 2009 suggs 2007 applies gis techniques to air photos in one of the more recent attempts to estimate total area drained by tiles in the continental united states hofstrand 2010 estimates that there are at least three midwestern states having more than 50 of agricultural land drained by pipes fig 1 drainage pipe density in the midwestern united states is approximately 10 m between rows but will vary depending on slope and soil type wright and sands 2001 modern machinery enables efficient installment of tile in parallel rows that merge and empty into lower elevation drainage ditches fig 2 provides examples of common drainage pipe layouts in more recent decades newly installed drainage pipe can be recorded with gps however this leaves more than a century s worth of drainage pipe locations that might be unknown due to potentially lost records or never recorded in the first place there are both production related and environmental motivators for mapping drainage pipe ageing drainage pipe systems may cease to efficiently function thus leading to decreases in crop production it is essential to identify existing drainage pipe in order to perform maintenance and ensure proper performance the location of existing drainage pipe will inform plans for any installment of new tile excessive drainage pipe density can also lead to wasted fertilizer via accelerated transport shilling et al 2015 smith et al 2015 accurate drainage pipe maps and indication of proper performance help to optimize operational efficiency and improve production environmental motivators for mapping drainage pipes are from the local to national watershed scale it has been recognized for more than two decades that rapid drainage facilitated by drainage pipe causes nitrogen and phosphate loading in streams and rivers the biggest manifestation of this type of nitrogen loading is in the annual spring runoff dead zone in the gulf of mexico rabalais et al 2002 accurate local and regional estimates of drainage pipe density will refine hydrologic models used to estimate nitrate and phosphate transport in streams and rivers e g woo and kumar 2019 allred et al 2004 reports on geophysical methods to map drainage pipe while ground penetrating radar allred et al 2018b proved reliable it is a time consuming and cost ineffective method several authors verma et al 1996 ale et al 2007 naz et al 2009 have described the use of color infrared and visible spectrum air photos to identify drainage pipe in fallow or newly planted fields their methods rely on soil albedo characteristics that vary with soil moisture content where soil is drier directly above the drainage pipe and soil moisture increases with lateral distance from the drainage pipe these differences in soil moisture are revealed as albedo contrasts in visible and color infrared imagery so that soil above the drainage pipe appears brighter drier soil exhibits higher albedos in the visible and infrared wavelength regions therefore image acquisition 2 3 days after a rain event of 1 2 cm or more provides the most favorable conditions for drainage pipe detection naz et al 2009 controlled soil moisture experiments conducted by barnsdale 2014 show that medium soil moisture levels between five and fifteen percent exhibit the greatest albedo contrast with dry soils however predicting how soon after a rain event these conditions will occur is difficult due to differences in soil type wind sun and other environmental variability airborne remote sensing surveys for agriculture are not new but come with an economy of scale that might not be practical for an individual producer within approximately the past five years the use of suas small unmanned aerial systems for agricultural applications has been put directly into the hands of producers sub centimeter resolution suas data yield highly accurate elevation models and indices of vegetation vigor that can be acquired as frequently as weather conditions permit and at a fraction of the cost of airborne acquisitions pai et al 2017 barnsdale 2014 and allred et al 2018a describe successful drainage pipe detection with suas color infrared and thermal infrared data respectively the basis for thermal detection of drainage pipe is also tied to soil moisture where soil above the drainage pipe will dry faster and be warmer than moist soil that is further from the drainage pipe and drains more slowly woo et al 2019 yet as barnsdale 2014 points out the conditions for successful detection vary with soil type in addition to other environmental factors that are not fully constrained therefore the objectives of this study are to better understand the optimal soil moisture conditions for drainage pipe detection with uas thermal and visible spectrum rgb surveys 2 materials and methods 2 1 test sites two intensively managed lands critical zone observatory iml czo sites were the focus of this study during which time fields were freshly tilled and planted but with no crop residue or emergent crop the first site located in monticello il 40 025611 n 88 661167 w is a mixture of ipava silt loam and sable silty clay loam with less than 2 slope wilkins et al 2019 the study site is a 6 75 ha drainage area within a field that is 53 ha the drainage consists of 5 individual drainage pipes spaced 25 m apart and located 1 m below the surface this is single generation cpt having an unknown installation date the second site is located at goose creek il 40 1558363 n 88 5780138 w and has the same soil and slope characteristics as those found at the monticello site described above cpt at this location was installed in 2015 2 2 suas data acquisition and processing five days prior to data acquisition 1 24 cm and 0 76 cm of rain were recorded at the goose creek and monticello sites respectively on may 8 2018 both sites were flown with on a tarot 650 airframe manufactured by tarot china with a pixhawk flight controller manufactured by pixhawk switzerland the aircraft was equipped with a gimbled mapir rgb camera manufactured by mapir san diego california and an ici 8640 thermal camera manufactured by ici beaumont texas during data acquisition wind speed averaged 10 mph with stronger gusts and high cirrus clouds while the air temperature was 75 85 f sensor and mission characteristics are presented in table 1 mission planner bangkok thailand ground control station was used to execute programmed missions 80 m above ground level with 60 forwardlap and 40 sidelap more than 30 ha were imaged at each site pix4d prilly switzerland uas photogrammetry software was used to create rgb mosaics and digital surface models dsm from the more than 3000 photos from both sites a total of more than 700 thermal images were acquired but problems with camera gps integration prevented successful geotagging thus preventing a stitch nonetheless the individual thermal images were useful for evaluating drainage pipe detection 3 results 3 1 visible rgb soil moisture contrasts responsible for differences in albedo are colloquially referred to as chalking and are readily apparent in the allerton rgb mosaic fig 3 the remotely mapped drainage pipe locations were confirmed by the operator s knowledge of the installation here nearly the entire drainage pipe network can be seen parallel to the long axis of the field where it converges on the west side of the field before emptying into a drainage ditch the most obvious chalking on the northern part of fig 3 was observable in the field with the naked eye however chalking in the fig 3 inset could not be observed on the ground contrast between wet and dry soil becomes less apparent in the eastern half of fig 3 where higher soil albedo dry soil occurs more broadly this broad zone of higher albedo soil closely corresponds to topographically higher portions of the field where there are least tens of centimeters difference in elevation areas of subtle but nonetheless higher relief cause a slight hydrologic gradient that promotes faster drying furthermore the higher relief areas of the field are better exposed to the evaporating effects of wind only hints of chalking caused by drainage pipe can be seen at the tower site fig 4 and are confirmed by the documented drainage pipe locations shown in fig 4a naz et al 2009 and verma et al 1996 found that the best time to acquire uas data is 2 3 days after a rain event when the water table develops a more convex shape toward tile drainage pipes thus providing soil moisture and albedo contrasts we looked at individual bands but found the rgb data provided the best guide for where drainage pipe might be detected in the thermal data with results discussed in the next section 3 2 thermal imagery fig 5 provides an example of the thermal imagery spatial and radiometric resolution where footprints exhibit a 0 5 c temperature contrast with undisturbed soil uncalibrated surface temperatures ranged from 15 58 c with a 10 20 range being more typical microtopography associated with plow furrows and tire ruts cause topographic lows to receive less sun and exposure to evaporative winds topographic highs receive more sun and greater effects of wind evaporation and are therefore warmer these temperature contrasts can be seen in fig 5 where the darkest lines are the tire ruts represented by about 10 cm of relief thermal images in fig 6 co located with the rgb mosaic show a lack of any apparent thermal contrasts related to the drainage pipe to enhance any potential thermal contrast all 740 thermal images were contrast stretched and color enhanced an example is presented in fig 7 unfortunately drier and warmer soil above tiles did not provide sufficient thermal contrast to allow drainage pipe detection and is below the thermal resolution of the sensor low thermal contrast might be the result of the modest preceding rain event or a time interval that is too long between the rain event and data acquisition lack of thermal contrast might also be due to accelerated evaporation driven by persistent hot wind during the survey 4 discussion while this may not be considered a blind test as the location of the drains are known it is clear from figs 6 and 7 there is no discernable thermal signature from the drainage pipe the weak rain event 1 3 cm prior to the survey followed by data acquisition five days later might explain why drainage pipe was not discernable in the thermal imagery williamson et al 2019 report on effective uas thermal data drainage pipe mapping at similar spatial resolution soil type time of year and field conditions as described for this survey however williamson et al 2019 received more than 8 cm of precipitation during a ten day period that was five days prior to data acquisition soil water content reported by williamson et al 2019 went from 36 to 24 percent during the five days immediately following the precipitation event allred et al 2018a mapped 60 of drainage pipes using uas thermal sensing when soil water moisture was between 15 1 and 10 7 percent the allred et al 2018a site conditions were also similar to this study in terms of soil type season spatial resolution air temperature and as little as 4 3 mm of precipitation within seven days prior to uas data acquisition without soil water moisture measurements to support this study we can use the allred et al 2018a work as a proxy to speculate that soil water moisture was in the single digits it is possible the hot winds during data acquisition accelerated drying closest to the soil surface and put soil water moisture contrasts below a threshold of detectability the rgb images clearly show the presence of drainage pipe patterns and locations at the monticello site like the thermal data there is some lack of agreement with similar studies regarding the best soil water conditions for detection using uas rgb data neither the work of williamson et al 2019 or allred et al 2018a showed promise for reliably revealing drainage lines with rbg data for the given set of environmental conditions it is not clear in this study what set of conditions helped to reveal the drainage network in the rgb data 5 conclusions at the farm scale drainage pipe mapping can facilitate improved agricultural water management and crop production at the watershed scale drainage pipe mapping can improve county state and regional hydrologic models and estimates of potential nutrient loading although not foolproof both thermal and rgb imagery demonstrate the potential to elucidate drainage pipes the optimal meteorological and soil water conditions for successful drainage pipe detection have not been well constrained these results provide another important data point to inform and guide future work some advantages to uas agricultural surveys are 1 low cost compared to airborne surveys 2 operational flexibility that only requires winds less than 15 mph 3 potential for higher temporal resolution if required 4 surveys can be conducted with multiple sensors rgb multispectral thermal during the same flight by individual producers rapid development in aircraft and sensor technology is likely to improve the efficiency and efficacy of drainage pipe detection with uas acquiring rgb data comes with the important added bonus of high resolution digital elevation models via structure from motion sfm and inform future drainage pipe network design or tillage practices thus uas thermal and rgb surveys provide a transformational method for agricultural water management declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was made possible by national science foundation awards ear 1440506

site conditions were also similar to this study in terms of soil type season spatial resolution air temperature and as little as 4 3 mm of precipitation within seven days prior to uas data acquisition without soil water moisture measurements to support this study we can use the allred et al 2018a work as a proxy to speculate that soil water moisture was in the single digits it is possible the hot winds during data acquisition accelerated drying closest to the soil surface and put soil water moisture contrasts below a threshold of detectability the rgb images clearly show the presence of drainage pipe patterns and locations at the monticello site like the thermal data there is some lack of agreement with similar studies regarding the best soil water conditions for detection using uas rgb data neither the work of williamson et al 2019 or allred et al 2018a showed promise for reliably revealing drainage lines with rbg data for the given set of environmental conditions it is not clear in this study what set of conditions helped to reveal the drainage network in the rgb data 5 conclusions at the farm scale drainage pipe mapping can facilitate improved agricultural water management and crop production at the watershed scale drainage pipe mapping can improve county state and regional hydrologic models and estimates of potential nutrient loading although not foolproof both thermal and rgb imagery demonstrate the potential to elucidate drainage pipes the optimal meteorological and soil water conditions for successful drainage pipe detection have not been well constrained these results provide another important data point to inform and guide future work some advantages to uas agricultural surveys are 1 low cost compared to airborne surveys 2 operational flexibility that only requires winds less than 15 mph 3 potential for higher temporal resolution if required 4 surveys can be conducted with multiple sensors rgb multispectral thermal during the same flight by individual producers rapid development in aircraft and sensor technology is likely to improve the efficiency and efficacy of drainage pipe detection with uas acquiring rgb data comes with the important added bonus of high resolution digital elevation models via structure from motion sfm and inform future drainage pipe network design or tillage practices thus uas thermal and rgb surveys provide a transformational method for agricultural water management declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was made possible by national science foundation awards ear 1440506

10762,there is an urgent need to consider adaptation strategies for agricultural water resources in response to the ever growing demand for freshwater around the world this is especially poignant in arid and semi arid regions like the middle east and north africa mena where water resources have been extremely limited historically today water resources are declining due to a variety of factors including climate change population growth and changing food preferences research on this topic typically seeks to assess the impact of discreet alternative interventions in isolation however it is necessary to analyze the broader factors affecting agricultural water management as interconnected components of a complex water governance system within a specific geographic context this research uses an exploratory formative scenario planning approach to a identify important adaptation strategies b use those adaptation strategies to construct a small set of coherent plausible and diverse regional agricultural water governance scenarios and c analyze future scenarios of the zayandehroud watershed in iran in the year 2040 the research shares five scenarios that exemplify divergent adaptation and mitigation approaches to agriculture water demand in zayandehroud watershed including adhering to the status quo each scenario embodies different economic and political priorities to reveal how those priorities impact the ecological social and economic sustainability of this watershed these scenarios provide insights into the long term implications of near term decisions about water and food security resilience of local communities and the ecological integrity of the regional watershed this research explores the conceptual relationships between components of the water governance system and demonstrates an approach to analyzing alternative constellations of factors that will impact agricultural water management policy makers can make more effective policies if they consider how to transform the broader system of regional water governance rather than only evaluating discrete agricultural water management projects on a project by project basis keywords adaptive governance scenario planning water market rural development local governance land use planning 1 introduction climate change and population growth are often the most discussed causes for global water scarcity in terms of supply uncertainty and increasing demand respectively yet water crises can also be attributed to governance including a broad range of political social economic and administrative systems that are in place to develop and manage water resources this is especially the case in developing countries where rigid and hierarchical governance systems which exercise monopolies via governmental control corporate contractors water market manipulation through trade policies incentives and water credits inhibit rational objective water policies rogers and hall 2003 in arid and semi arid regions characterized by low precipitation high evaporation and uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water resources agricultural water governance is of utmost importance since the decisions impact the dual goals of food security and water security for instance in the middle east and north africa mena region over 85 of available fresh water is being consumed by the agricultural sector to guarantee food security yet water demand far outstrips water availability bucknall 2007 shetty 2006 classic approaches to agricultural water management in these regions rely mostly on technologies and connected infrastructure to augment the irrigation water supply and to enhance the productivity and efficiency of irrigation the appeal of technological solutions can lead decisionmakers to overlook the potential of alternative solutions like market policies institutional reforms and social changes madani 2014 in fact adaptation processes can be constrained by a lack of political will and consensus oppositional cultural factors and the lack of stakeholder engagement ricart et al 2019b 2019a as an example intra basin competition over water resources can arise when public officials seek to implement short term visible outcomes for the landowning farmers that elected them thereby contributing to the persistence of technocratic approaches dietz et al 2003 in developing regions around the world international donors and other financial organizations historically have been strong external drivers of policy they can incentivize technology oriented solutions and centralized governance structures in order to control and protect their investments iglesias and garroteb 2015 performed a comprehensive study to identify agricultural water management adaptation strategies and evaluate their feasibility and effectiveness in europe iglesias and garrote 2015 the adaptation strategies they cataloged cannot be considered a comprehensive set of neutral and independent tools that can be implemented globally to mitigate the water management crisis boelens and vos 2012 explored the effects of discrete interventions that would affect water efficiency and enhance productivity yet they concluded that while those interventions represent important alternative decisions they need to be understood within complex social and power relationships in the specific geographic contexts where they are being implemented boelens and vos 2012 given the increasing vulnerability of water resources climate uncertainty and complex governance effective water management policies must account systematically for a wider range of adaptation strategies that embrace aspects of the built environment social institutions and socio ecological systems as well as different water activity domains including supply delivery use and outflow field 2014 larson et al 2013 white et al 2015 despite this need there is a dearth of studies that attend to the interplay between adaptation choices discrete interventions and geo political context and social relationships which are often neglected in these studies this means that the effectiveness and plausibility of a particular adaptation strategy is not considered in relation to other interventions despite boelens and vos 2012 arguments to the contrary to this point knieper and colleagues 2010 argue that there is a need for policy makers to explore alternative governance scenarios that attend to the technological and societal forces at work in their decisions foley and wiek 2014 knieper et al 2010 scenario planning offers a powerful tool to study the future states of a system by exploring alternative yet plausible and consistent futures that could evolve out of present conditions funke et al 2013 mahmoud et al 2009 stewart et al 2007 scenarios can help decision makers broadly defined to understand and analyze the key connections explore the uncertainties of a specific system to take a more holistic perspective and to assess coordinated actions in a highly uncertain environment henriques et al 2015 scenarios can be qualitative or quantitative based upon the nature of the data qualitative scenarios are more suitable for the analysis of complex systems with high degrees of uncertainty and when most of information cannot be readily quantified due to data uncertainties van notten et al 2003 on the other hand scenarios can be categorized as predictive explorative or normative based on the research question that the researcher aims to address while predictive scenarios seek to identify the most probable futures by answering questions related to what will happen explorative scenarios develop knowledge about what are the most plausible futures i e what can happen finally normative scenarios explore questions about the most preferable futures bishop et al 2007 this typology of scenario analysis is important to consider and will help the reader position our work within the field of scenario methodologies it also should be noted that the nature of scenarios as a type of foresight knowledge is non verifiable since it is not able to provide an exact representation of an observed reality so for qualitative scenarios quality criteria include logical coherence plausibility divergence and relevance to decision making rather than the accuracy of the prediction guimaraes pereira et al 2006 for example the national parks service uses scenarios to anticipate plausible but unprecedented conditions and expect surprises with respect to the effects of climate change on the national parks national park services 2013 this study offers a conceptual framework that attends to the interplay among multiple social political and technological factors and employs an explorative scenario development approach to study different constellations of those factors qualitatively the arrangement of those factors will inform distinct water governance scenarios some of which may contribute to key aspects of sustainability and less so for others the scenarios are not a blue print for sustainable water governance rather this study demonstrates conceptual relationships and explores the interplay of alternative strategy elements our research explores an important yet modest goal by addressing the question what adaptation policies technical and infrastructure investments can alleviate future water scarcity of this watershed how does each mitigation strategy promote or obstruct other choices how will understanding about these interplays guide us to delineate alternative water governance scenarios finally how will these alternative scenarios affect the ecosystems agricultural sector and rural communities this paper offers a small set of alternative scenarios which depict plausible comprehensive governance regimes that address agricultural water demand at its core is an exploration of the societal and technological transformations that may arise in parallel and ameliorate the conditions that are promulgating water wars across the global left unchecked the current rates of water overexploitation will lead to the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 ostrom 2009 with dire consequences for millions of people rather than focusing on silver bullet solutions to water crises this research treats water governance as a wicked problem that demands more holistic adaptive management strategies this study explores sustainable water governance by considering how alternative adaptation choices could function consistently without major obstructions to bring the people and places into focus next we introduce the zayandehrud basin in iran as a means of highlighting the key geopolitical factors unique to that watershed this case study will serve to illustrate the use of scenarios to explore potential approaches to the broader issues of water governance in arid and semi arid regions generally and the mena region specifically 2 case study context zayandehrud watershed the zayandehrud river originates from the zagros mountains in the northwest of iran and flows 250 miles through the arid and semi arid central plains before emptying into the gavkhooni swamp fig 1 the total basin area of 16 000 mi2 extends into the provinces of isfahan and chahar mahal charmahal province is located upstream of the river and its share of the river basin is just 7 of the land and 1 8 of the population mohajeri et al 2016 beside isfahan and charmahal provinces zayandehrud also provides residential water to residents of two arid neighbor cities of yazd and kashan currently more than one million about 20 residents of the basin depend on farming income and subsistence food supplies over an area of nearly 200 000 ha of cultivated land which is more than 90 irrigated food security concerns arose in the 1980 s during an eight year war between iraq and iran this event made food self sufficiency one of the highest national priorities regardless of severe water crises in most parts of the country self sufficiency 1 1 the terms in bracket refer to adaptation strategies and are identified as key variables listed in table 1 policies for food self sufficiency include high tariffs on imported foods and incentives such as subsidized water energy fertilizer and equipment to support domestic food production food trade regulation water pricing and subsidies subsequently the agriculture sector is expanding in this watershed even though it is a closed basin irrigated land area molle and mamanpoush 2012 the food self sufficiency incentives are not keyed to knowledge of the available water resources or their conservation therefore they prevent the agriculture sector from shifting toward more efficient and productive practices agricultural practices as a result despite the existence of severe water scarcity in the basin about 90 of its cultivated area is still supplied with water by flood irrigation irrigation system nikouei and ward 2013 shahdany et al 2018 the irrigation water storage and distribution networks are mostly open and uncovered canals and there is no infrastructure to gather treat and redistribute marginal quality water in farms storage and distribution system farms in close vicinity to the river rely on surface water 30 while other farms use spring water 6 and groundwater from wells 58 and qanats 6 for irrigating their farms felmeden 2014 a key historical and cultural feature of the agricultural water systems in iran are qanats which are underground horizontal tunnels excavated to convey groundwater from mountainous areas where the water table is closest to the surface to arid regions qanats minimize water contamination and evaporation unlike the pumping system qanats only extract renewable water yazdanpanah et al 2013a overdevelopment of upstream irrigated areas in addition to unauthorized groundwater extraction have disturbed the traditional qanat water allocation system substantially downstream farmers along the river as well as qanat water right holders no longer receive their full water rights water allocation this problem has led to widespread dissatisfaction and continuous protests protesters believe that the current water allocation system is unfair and water managers must stop pumping water to neighboring cities like yazd and kashan in fact angry farmers have frequently damaged the exporting water pipeline to those cities for instance as recently as october 2018 the water pipeline to the city of yazd was vandalized and ruptured by protesters 22 times according to the governor of yazd province bbc 2018 to satisfy increasing demand almost all river runoff is stored behind the chadegan dam three tunnels divert water from the neighboring watershed karoon while several new tunnels are under construction to increase the supply water transfer projects shown in fig 1 despite these efforts the gavkhooni wetland which iran committed to preserve under the ramsar convention has not been receiving its minimum water requirements to preserve ecological integrity since 1995 wetland water right the zayandehroud river passes through the city of isfahan the third most populous city in iran zayandehrud is a key feature of isfahan city a hub of tourism in iran many outstanding features of this ancient city such as bridges and palaces rely on the glory of this life giving river 2 2 the meaning of zayandehrud in farsi is the life giving river schramm and sattary 2014 the zayandehrud watershed was chosen as an illustrative case study due to its socioeconomic and ecological importance and as a complex case of agricultural water demand management a few scenario planning studies have been conducted on different aspects of the zayandehrud watershed gohari et al 2013 developed a system dynamics model to evaluate new water augmentation projects on supply demand dynamics in the zayandehrud watershed gohari et al 2013 safavi et al 2016 also developed an adaptive network based fussy inference system anfis model to evaluate the impact of climate change and supply augmentation projects on the near future condition 2015 2019 of this watershed felmeden 2014 developed three scenarios with special focus on integrated water management though that study offered very narrow recommendations this broad range of studies and the complex characteristics of the zayandehrud watershed make it an ideal case study to explore alternative governance arrangements through scenarios and thus offer findings for other watersheds in the mena region 3 research design and methods 3 1 theoretical framing this study draws upon elinor ostrom s 2009 scholarship on the governance of the commons and integrates aspects of the built environment socio economic and ecological environment into an analytical framework ostrom 2009 the built environment mostly embraces physical variables like technologies and infrastructures while socio economic conditions covers factors such as policies and regulations finally the ecological interface includes environmental conditions and systems those three categories were complemented by the work of keeler and colleagues 2015 which added phases of water governance including the five domains of supply delivery use outflow and cross cutting activities larson et al 2013 white et al 2015 these two frameworks together inform the theoretical framework for this paper s governance of agricultural water demand and demonstrate the conceptual alignment of the governance factors identified by ostrom with the five phases offered by keeler see fig 2 such an alignment allows this research to interrogate the interdependencies between and among the system elements and sustainability principles such as social institutions and water delivery or the built environment and socio ecological integrity 3 2 scenario construction methodology scenario development is usually a step wise process in which all tasks can be categorized into three standard groups idea generation integration and consistency checking bishop et al 2007 there are several available techniques that are used in each group and these can be adapted individually or in hybrid format based on the context nature of study and available resources generating techniques include collecting information from experts and or stakeholders integrating techniques are used to combine parts into wholes consistency techniques are utilized to secure the consistency between or within scenarios börjeson et al 2005 this research generated data from qualitative sources including individual interviews group discussions and desk research this research adapted a step wise formative scenario analysis methodology developed by scholz and tietje scholz and tietje 2002 tietje 2005 to integrate the information into a discrete set of governance oriented scenarios for the zayandehrud basin through 2040 the method was also used to secure consistency and diversity across the scenarios this exploratory approach helps to link the formative scenarios with expert and stakeholder knowledge to create a subset of signature scenarios which are normative comprehensible and informative for decision makers foley and wiek 2014 keeler et al 2015 the process that the research team followed to construct the formative scenarios is described next 3 2 1 step 1 variable identification proposed adaptation measures policy interventions and investments which may contribute independently to agricultural water demand agwd management were identified and cataloged in order to construct consistent and distinct water governance scenarios the semi participatory approach involved 15 individual interviews eight online discussion forums with about 8000 participants secondary sources from media based interviews government reports and documents and previous studies the individual interviews were recorded in person during january 2015 the interviewees were selected from a diverse range of water managers environmental activists and decision makers in iran the online discussions occurred through the telegram application which is the most popular phone based communication application among iranian citizens it provides a flexible affordable free and secure medium for stakeholders to express their ideas freely to persons outside of iran some forums involved official think tank and government advisors and others were unofficial discussion groups which support different stakeholder groups and their interests and values due to the nature of this research the individuals and organizations involved must remain anonymous this approach gathered data that fit the theoretical framework and provided a broad range of strategies for the different interfaces and domain activities the data gathered encompasses the three interfaces of socio economic formal and informal institutions built environment technological systems and environment ecological and five domains of supply delivery use outflow and cross cutting activities further the research team condensed the list of variables to include only 20 independent variables in the final set of variables based upon the following criteria 1 sustainability importance of the independent variable on agwd 2 systemic importance including the potential uncertainty and complexity that any single variable adds to the whole system for example projections for population growth have a high confidence or low degree of uncertainty therefore this variable and others like it were removed because they do not contribute significant uncertainty to the model 3 minimum redundancy for any variable that is already represented by other variables or if it is possible to combine two or more variables into a single variable for example variables like land consolidation irrigation scheduling and crop rotation programming were combined into a single variable called agricultural practice 4 maximum diversity across different interfaces socio economic technological ecological and activity domains supply delivery use outflow was evaluated iteratively by the researchers to have the most comprehensive set of variables two to three future projections that were drawn from the generated data were used to explore how the independent variables could change in the long term future and thus how the governance arrangement could change table 1 presents the variables selected and the future projections explored 3 2 2 step 2 system analysis the selected variables were scored for their cross influence on a scale from 0 no impact 1 indirect impact to 2 direct impact the scoring system accounts for the impact of variable a on variable b and a different score can be assigned to the impact of variable b on variable a subsequently this will yield a asymmetric impact matrix which includes impact relationships among all pairs of variables see appendix a for the completed impact matrix uploaded as research data this analyzes the key interconnections of the system and illustrates the level of activity influence or passivity sensitivity of each variable kuzdas and wiek 2014 michel et al 2018 it should be noted the cross impact and consistency scoring the next step were performed through an iterative process among the research team consequently the process involves a level of subjectivity where team members utilized their case specific knowledge about the variables to perform these tasks scholz and tietje 2002 3 2 3 step 3 consistency analysis the consistency of each scenario and logical coherence carpenter and rissman 2012 godet 2000 of paired variable projections were scored from 2 prevents the co occurrence to 2 required to co occur following tietje 2005 unlike previous analysis consistency scoring is a one way analysis because for each projection pair the plausibility of their co occurrence was scored only once for example the consistency score for having an effective water market without changing subsidies was assigned 1 which means this was deemed inconsistent but it s not impossible for those future projections to co occur the result is a triangular matrix see appendix b uploaded as research data this matrix was used to calculate additive and multiplicative consistency scores and number of inconsistencies for each scenario the different indices complement each other and support the selection of the most consistent scenarios which are neither too exclusive nor do they contain an abundance of major inconsistencies for instance the additive consistency index could compromise a major inconsistency between two future projections if the total consistency value is high enough for example for a given scenario if there are three interactions between future projections that are scored 2 prevents the co occurrence but all other scores are assigned a 2 required to co occur the additive consistency will be higher than many other scenarios without major inconsistencies in contrast multiplicative consistency could be too excluding since even one major inconsistency leads to total score of zero tietje 2005 a computational model using python programming language expedited the calculations the code is available in appendix c and is uploaded as research data the filtering criterion combined additive consistency 30 and the number of inconsistencies 2 to narrow the number of scenarios down from about 26 8 million initial scenarios to a smaller set of consistent scenarios one million which can be used in step 4 diversity analysis to summarize scenarios with an additive consistency above 30 were selected and had no more than one major inconsistency 3 2 4 step 4 diversity analysis while 96 of the scenarios were excluded based upon the consistency analysis the remaining consistent ones needed to be narrowed to a small set of plausible and distinctive scenarios for this purpose the distance to selected dts methodology was adapted and combined with a set of exclusive criteria to select the final scenarios tietje 2005 the most consistent scenario which is close to the status quo scenario was used as an anchor to find the second scenario to choose the second scenario a tradeoff needs to be considered between the consistency values and distance value harmonic mean distance from other selected scenarios since the intent of the study was to inform sustainable water governance we elected to focus on scenarios that exhibit strong coherence highly consistent while also adhering to the extent possible to sustainability principles foley and wiek 2014 white et al 2015 to do so in each round we chose scenarios that have the highest distance value from the most consistent scenarios while holding promise for a sustainable future this process was iterated until there was no scenario with harmonic mean distance greater than 50 while no unsustainable i e societal collapse scenarios were included it means that 50 similarity was set as the maximum permitted similarity between the signature scenarios 3 2 5 step 5 scenario interpretation as scholz and tietje 2002 claim the most natural way to interpret the scenarios is through deep discussions about future states of the system this method is consistent with our approach to transform the scenarios from operations on numbers to operation on concepts scholz and tietje 2002 this method also helps to communicate and validate the scenarios with targeted audiences more effectively accordingly key systemic features of our scenarios were shared with participants who deliberated on them and explained their vision of the zayandehrud basin in 2040 under each future scenario of the governance regime the timeframe was chosen to be long enough to extend beyond short term planning horizons and short enough so that the future projections are understandable to the current generation of decisions makers the interpretations used to elucidate each scenario focused on the following sustainability topics agricultural water demand ecological sustainability agriculture sector development welfare of rural communities food security conflict level a deliberative process among the research team produced a storyline for each scenario and those narratives along with some visualizations were used to refine participant perceptions of the scenarios 4 results scenario construction and selection the water governance system of zayandehrud watershed was explored thoroughly using the scenario planning methodology described above the major irrigation water demand management strategies were identified table 1 above and their dyads were studied to find their key interactions and to analyze this system of systems thoroughly furthermore five plausible and distinct scenarios were constructed and interpreted to address different approaches to irrigation water demand management in the zayandehrud watershed 2040 4 1 identified variables and system analysis from 52 initially catalogued variables 20 were selected based on the four criteria of sustainability and systemic importance maximum diversity and minimum redundancy however some of the filtered variables have been used frequently in previous scenario construction studies selected mitigation and adaptation strategies referred to as variables in the scenario construction procedure along with descriptions future projections and their domain of activity are listed in table 1 the system analysis categorized the variables into four levels of activity and passivity called active mediating passive and buffer variables fig 3 the impact analysis identified institutional reforms and the general approach to trade policy as key drivers of the system since they have high activity and low passivity scores therefore it is expected that any change in governance its hierarchy and integrity level and general food trade regulations would trigger substantial movement in other variables for instance the central food trade regulation approach is a key driver for other market variables like subsidies water markets and the water pricing system which can also stimulate change in agricultural and ecological variables the water allocation system and water transfer projects are assigned a mediating role see the upper right quadrant of fig 3 since they can highly influence other variables and be influenced by other variables at same time this analysis also shows that the food self sufficiency approach has the highest activity and passivity score in this system which implies its critical mediating role while the food self sufficiency approach can greatly affect the other water policies such as market regulation and agriculture practices it can also get influenced by any change in these policies on the other hand the adaptation strategies related to agricultural and efficiency and productivity fall in the third category sensitive policies including passive variables which are highly influenced by first and second groups however these have the least power to influence other variables the last category includes buffer variables which are neither drivers nor influence absorbers but exert an indirect impact on system outcome variables the results recognize no buffer variables this implies a high level of system complexity which means that none of these mitigatory actions happens in the vacuum without influencing or being influenced by other variables 4 2 selected scenarios five consistent systematically different scenarios were selected out of approximately 27 million scenarios algorithm generated by following the five step filtering procedure explained in section 3 a summary of the selected scenarios configuration of future projections is offered in table 2 below the consistency and diversity scores for each selected scenario shown in table 3 show no obstructive relations no 2 score additive scores above 45 and multiplicative consistencies greater than 1 5e 13 this provides confidence about the plausibility of the scenarios the high distance to selected dts values 60 and their low deviation 6 scores satisfy a high diversity level between the final scenarios kuzdas and wiek 2014 4 3 scenario interpretation the key systemic features of each scenario are depicted in fig 4 a e these diagrams along with deliberation and participatory research methods informed the following interpretations and insights about each scenario and the alternative approaches to ameliorating the ongoing water crisis in zayandehrud watershed 4 3 1 scenario 1 status quo continues this scenario carries forward the dominant governance system since the 1970s into the year 2040 fig 4a the central objective for iranian agricultural water management in this scenario is to safeguard food security by achieving self sufficiency and decreasing the nation s dependence on imported foods specifically staple crops the key challenge to overcome is water shortage and that is addressed through supply augmentation via large scale technical developments with a focus on building new infrastructure such as dams and water transfer tunnels this scenario is characterized by a top down governance system where agricultural water policies are made at the national level while regional and local water managers who mediate interactions between the farmers and policymakers have limited decision making authority farmers and other residents have minimum participation in national policy decisions which makes them highly dependent on government decisions and affords them little recourse this top down approach does not yield coordinated decision making across different levels of governance to support comprehensive mitigation strategies for instance the water management authority remains fragmented based on provincial political borders rather than watershed borders this exacerbates competition over limited resources among different stakeholders there are legally documented water rights which have been followed for several centuries that guide the distribution of water among farmers in zayandehrud watershed currently decisions about which farmers get water are made in an unclear and unfair process in which residential and industry water users have the highest priority while the remaining water is allocated to the agricultural sector based on government discretion in other words the current water allocation system doesn t comply with the traditional documented water sharing system which specifies the water apportioned each month to each of the 33 districts boluks along the river based on their water rights molle and mamanpoush 2012 as a result many downstream rightsholders receive almost no water moreover the gavkhooni wetland water rights are de prioritized in this scenario water shortages are addressed where possible through overexploitation of nonrenewable groundwater resources mahdavinia and mokhtar 2018 safe yield for the watershed in terms of meeting social and ecological water demand is not achieved to achieve food self sufficiency market manipulation tools are extensively used to facilitate domestic production and national security for instance trading of food products especially staple crops is highly regulated and strictly controlled by the central government therefore only the deficit gap between demand and domestic production is imported which is done directly by government or semi public companies the water pricing system is unchanged and calculates the surface water price as 1 3 of total production value while groundwater is free of charge with farmers only paying for the capital to drill wells and operate pumps market interventions that affect the final sale price of domestic products are not competitive with global prices so to support domestic production and control food price inflation the government compensates part of the production costs in the form of direct and indirect subsidies to farmers and customers restrictions on unauthorized water extraction are not prohibitive enough to dissuade farmers and the administration process is ineffective and often corrupted meaning that farmers create illegal wells 4 3 2 scenario 2 iranian capitalism reigns this scenario carries forward many economists notions of free market governance fig 4b the extensive market manipulation during the last decades is dissolved and deregulated markets correct for the value of limited resources like water chong and sunding 2006 madani 2014 rosegrant et al 2009 the core concept is that both the water and agricultural sector exist within deregulated conditions in which market equilibrium redefines the water governance system the water markets yielded positive outcomes in both ecological and socio economic systems the primary objective of this scenario is to provide a de minimis regulatory framework in which water creates the greatest economic value debaere 2014 this scenario is not plausible without effective foreign diplomacy efforts that provide stable and constructive economic relationships between iran and the vast majority of foreign nations water governance is still top down but with the central government s role and responsibilities curtailed to mediating market conditions monitoring and facilitating trade processes subsequently the central government works to remove regulations that hinder international and inter watershed food trading to create open markets where individuals and firms seek maximum economic profits government regulations have no impact on farm level decisions like crop choice irrigation methods total cultivated area and education all available water rights that were traditionally allocated are traded among farmers industries and even government entities throughout the watershed this water allocation system does not afford water rights to critical ecosystems like the gavkhooni wetland the volumetric value of allocated water is calculated and priced by water markets with high accuracy the water price covers all human related costs such as supply distribution and maintenance yet all forms of direct subsidies including energy agricultural equipment and other supplies like seed and fertilizer as well as indirect subsidies like specific food subsidies are totally removed 4 3 3 scenario 3 planned agricultural economy this scenario resonated with many participants and entailed reformed and integrated national planning efforts fig 4c water efficiency and agricultural and economic productivity are increased through integrated planning and strategic policies such a national integrated plan does not solve the ongoing water crisis but rather assures food self sufficiency and economic growth in the agricultural sector this scenario responds to the current lack of integration and shared objectives which do not encourage adaptive agricultural water management strategies this scenario focuses on achieving food self sufficiency and safeguarding people especially farmers from water scarcity through an integrated approach and comprehensive plan at the national level the planning efforts aim to develop a productive and water efficient agricultural sector to fulfill this goal a comprehensive cultivation plan is prepared dynamically based on soil properties available water and food demands to execute this plan incentive based policies like directed subsidies are used for energy equipment seeds and fertilizer water allocation is based on this comprehensive plan rather than traditional water rights similarly incentives are used to encourage the use of efficient irrigation technologies and improved practices in addition to a traditional education system the governing system uses a knowledge push approach to inform farmers about adaptive strategies development of large infrastructure is still followed intensively including new tunnel projects lining and covering channels and reservoirs to prevent extra evaporation and recycling the marginal quality effluent to be used as irrigation water on the other hand the extent of cultivated land is controlled and water resources are allocated to ensure safe yield of groundwater however wetland water rights are not a priority in this allocation system 4 3 4 scenario 4 interpreting traditions to shape the future the periodic cycles of drought in iran no longer create a crisis among farmers rather water management is understood as part of daily life by rural farmers darius the great s famous prayer from 500 bce that wished for the persian empire to be preserved from enemies drought and lies offers inspiration and a backdrop for the cultural significance of water people rediscover the important role of water in human flourishing in this region by returning to those origin stories this water governance system includes every citizen from kings to kids and employs all traditional sociocultural tools to establish a fair legitimate productive and most importantly sustainable governance system this unique water governance system that gave rise to the great civilization of persia and survived for thousands of years was abandoned by technocrats during the 19th and early 20th century this scenario expresses an idea for how a decentralized pluralistic governance system with minimum top down intervention might positively affect agricultural water management fig 4d the scenario revives a traditional water governance framework by acknowledging water resource ownerships and allowing the owners to govern the waterways that preserves their long term profits and celebrates farming as a way of life subsequently all kinds of subsidies and regulations are rescinded trade restrictions are removed and water is allocated per traditional water rights while the water pricing system remains intact new water transfer tunnel projects are canceled and once again qanats traditional underground tunnels become the dominant groundwater distribution system the governing structure is held by the collective local villagers farmers and water right holders there is no official mediating or watershed governing system at the federal level rather there is an extensive network of local research projects that are designed to share best practices and offer demonstration sites for farmers in other regions accordingly the education system that was once limited to intra family clan knowledge transfer is expanded to knowledge sharing between local communities 4 3 5 scenario 5 collaborative rural development the final scenario supports some interviewees idea that the most effective and least harmful strategy to manage agricultural water demand in this watershed is to downsize the agriculture sector by supporting alternative less water intensive businesses in rural communities fig 4e given the highly variable rainfall amounts related to climate change and resulting water crisis continued investments in the agricultural sector are neither economically nor environmentally defensible participants suggested downsizing agriculture from 20 of the labor force and 11 of gdp however this is not possible without a strategy to transition towards less water intensive employment otherwise higher unemployment rates than the current 12 unemployment rates will cause more social distress in the region the key goal in this scenario is to have flourishing and resilient rural communities with less reliance on income from agriculture this goal cannot be fulfilled without a close collaboration between all parties including the local population policy and lawmakers as well as academia and ngos this scenario requires an integrated effort to foster new economic opportunities by federal and state policy makers and ngos to support the robust local governing system the guiding vision for the collaboration and new industries would be to achieve sustainable development without compromising water and food security yet it must be noted that national food self sufficiency is not a central tenet of this plan traditional water allocation is modified to disincentivize the cultivation of marginal lands and greater value is placed on cultural uses for water as well as ecological water demand irrigation water is measured and priced properly to cover all supply and maintenance fees the life giving force of the river is reframed as a cultural attraction with daytime river cruises and restaurants competing for river front property in the heart of isfahan wetland water rights are secured by an allocation system and appreciation for the sightseeing tours to see exotic birds that provide new jobs water markets are effective and trade regulations support more positive virtual water import the subsidy option is also available to incentivize this transition from farming to rural industries despite the regulations and policies at the local level there is a democratic inclusive and legitimate water governing system which is run by farmers representatives and in coordination with businesses that benefit directly and indirectly from the river an elected board of representatives facilitates a collective decision making process as well as administers the rules and regulations this elected board cooperates closely with the court system to handle potential disputes elected boards across the regional engage in semi annual conferences to facilitate knowledge sharing and develop collaborative projects that span state boundaries 5 discussion scenarios presented here are intended to move decision makers beyond a binary selection of good or bad futures many water centric scenarios have fallen victim to this duality presenting two or maybe three options e g build the dam or not in contrast the future like the present is rarely so simple this study aims to open up those constrained decisions and place them within a broader decision making governance context that systematically connects the dots between economic technological societal and ecological forces to isolate any single adaptation choice and hold the rest of the system constant ignores the interrelations within socio eco techno systems sets to be clear there are quite a few alternative pathways and outcomes for iran and many other nations facing serious water resource management challenges by exploring several alternatives to water governance this research shows that there are far more choices than simply building a tunnel or not and such a narrow framing of alternatives has implications far beyond the mere presence or absence of a piece of infrastructure rather there are entirely different governance arrangements that can support socio technological changes and that combination has significant implications for the economic and ecological well being of the region our research shows that scenario 1 status quo continues is the most consistent failure scenario for zayandehrud watershed food self sufficiency is politicized and buttressed as a necessity of independence and geopolitical stability madani 2014 such stability will be supported by policies and regulations like protectionism that will decrease food trading develop of canals for water distribution and expanding irrigated land area underpriced irrigation water and indiscriminative subsidies molle and mamanpoush 2012 by 2040 it is plausible that socio economic sustainability of the zayandehrud watershed will be degraded while neither food security nor water security will be achieved heslot 2018 if food self sufficiency remains the central guiding policy in iran then planned agriculture scenario 3 would offer a means to secure production of essential crops without compromising the water security of the watershed however absolute food self sufficiency is not a plausible plan given current and future projections of water availability heslot 2018 mesgaran and azadi 2018 to achieve this goal planned agriculture pursues new heavy infrastructure projects to augment the irrigation water supply yet irrigation efficiency and water productivity are improved in the planned agriculture scenario through an integrated and dynamic national planning effort this comprehensive plan dictates who gets water and how much and what should be cultivated and how much this plan will be supported by incentive policies like subsidies and pre purchase plans the planned agriculture scenario portrays an extensive and costly governance scheme which is greatly dependent on supportive monetary policies in contrast to this extensive top down governance system scenario 2 capitalism reigns offers a minimalistic governance system in which water markets will determine the distribution of irrigation water food self sufficiency is no longer a central principle in the capitalism reigns scenario and a free trade environment facilitates the shift of water rights from small traditional farms to consolidated highly productive ones this means water will go where it yields the greatest value bekchanov et al 2015 debaere et al 2014 empirically demonstrated the positive impact of a cap and trade approach that was facilitated by a water market in seven different watersheds for instance total well pumping from the edwards aquifer in texas has generally decreased since 1990 while the population of the region increased by nearly 50 debaere et al 2014 subsequently it is expected that relatively lower world prices for certain commodity crops and small or even negative marginal profit will discourage new entrants to farming and existing small farmers may shift their investments from farming to other businesses nazemi et al 2018 therefore the demand for irrigation water will be slightly reduced and is replaced by industrial and or residential demand since traditional water rights are acknowledged in the capitalism reigns scenario it is expected that the gavkhooni wetland ecological water right will be recognized again the status quo stands in stark contrast to the traditional water allocation system in which a fair distribution of water was guaranteed scenario 4 interpreting traditions scenario offers a return to traditional cultural practices of community based traditions that celebrate and place great value on water yazdanpanah et al 2013b in this scenario as in the capitalism reins scenario ecological water rights gavkhooni water rights have been incorporated into the water allocation system the dominance of traditional water distribution networks qanats guarantees safe yield 3 3 the maximum amount of water that can be withdrawn yet still the supply is maintained and unimpaired for groundwater extraction molle and mamanpoush 2012 this is compatible with traditional family based subsistence farming practices therefore it is expected that domestic food production would decrease because it cannot compete with global prices which means the farmer income would also decline however the collective and fair governance system which is based on great respect for a community s values and traditions i e the respect for nature and contentment with simple country life can provide a high degree of stability and ecological and socio economic sustainability yazdanpanah et al 2013a collaborative rural development scenario 5 supports the idea of reducing the agricultural activities in zayandehrud watershed through a collaborative rural development plan to support farmers career shift from farming to less water intensive businesses which is an approach advocated by heslot 2018 such a scenario plausibly will allow rural communities to flourish and foster resilience against changing climatic and economic conditions through building local capacity for development louis and nazemi 2017 rug weaving is an ancient art and important industry in this watershed especially in rural areas and it might well be expected that by 2040 rug weaving workshops and other local crafts could be thriving reducing irrigation water consumption will increase the level of water in the river which is essential for absorbing eco tourism to this region abyareh 2009 with respect to ecological sustainability collaborative rural development is the only scenario which acknowledges the gavkhooni wetland water rights in the allocation system the capitalism reigns scenario may meet the wetland water rights intermittently because of shrinking of the agricultural sector although this is not guaranteed nikoui et al 2012 argue that incentivizing farmers to adopt water efficiency measures would help to save water to preserve the gavkhouni wetland although scenario 3 of this research proves that increasing the water efficiency and productivity does not necessarily secure the sustainability of wetlands since the water demand in this watershed is always greater than the supply furthermore increasing productivity and efficiency will incentivize farmers to put more land under cultivation nikouei et al 2012 safe yield in which annual groundwater withdrawals do not exceed the natural recharge rate is also considered a central governance principle in scenarios 3 4 and 5 this relieves stress on the aquifers but does not fully resolve the tension between agricultural water use and the ecological requirements of healthy wetlands even though each selected scenario represents a systematically different governance system four of them all except the status quo scenario contributes positively to managing agriculture water demand however the watershed experiences different socio economic conditions under each governance scenario for example it is expected that in the absence of supportive plans and limited capacity for job creation the capitalism reigns scenario which is grounded on free market principles will cause the most intensive transition for farmers who will lose their jobs mesgaran and azadi 2018 it may cause a long lag phase before efficient and productive farms can emerge this also can worsen water disputes and public dissatisfaction which are already a big issue in the watershed kuzdas et al 2016 the scenario collaborative rural development shares similar trade regulations with the capitalism reigns scenario the difference is that inexpensive water in addition to robust local governance facilitates the adaptation process and dampens the shock of market change when compared to the capitalism reigns scenario collaborative rural development causes a smoother transition and ends in more resilient rural communities yazdanpanah et al 2013b ricart et al 2019 studies ten successful cases which use different tools to promote stakeholder engagement they conclude that engagement of stakeholders in irrigation water governance will reduce tension between stakeholders and help with easier conflict resolution in these communities ricart et al 2019b the planned agriculture scenario causes the least shock to the agricultural sector it is anticipated that awd reduction is less noticeable than the other three scenarios while domestic food production is higher than the others although this scenario includes many supportive plans for farmers it is projected that it will not reduce water disputes since it does not recognize traditional water rights molle et al 2008 moreover dictating the national cultivation plan makes the governance system responsible for most risks and may generate greater protests if farmers are not satisfied with the outcome more accurate evaluation of the transition phase and its impact on different stakeholders requires a comprehensive study which was beyond the scope of this paper to deal with the challenging trade off between the comprehensiveness to include all important variables and their interconnections and coherence of governance scenarios to avoid too much complexity the scope of the current study focused on irrigation water demand and rural communities thus the impacts of selected scenarios on industry or residential water security was not assessed future studies can focus on urban water demand and or industrial water demand governance scenarios and a holistic study to develop signature scenarios which support the overall watershed sustainability moreover this study s model was kept as qualitative and conceptual as possible which helped to include many governance features that cannot be integrated to computational models future researches can acquire relevant data on water resource availability distribution and use by sector and develop a computational model to reassess the findings of this study in a quantitative framework 6 conclusion formative scenarios offer a means to explore the interplay between socio economic technical and ecological forces this approach moves away from assessing discrete interventions and engages with the complex geo political and societal context of regional water resources management this study walked through a methodical approach for constructing scenarios in a systematic process and then evaluated a set of distinct consistent and normative governance alternatives for agricultural water governance such a technique can help decision makers consider a greater range of choices and allow them to take into account more alternatives without applying strict boundaries to the analysis indeed the flexible participatory approach of this study also helped to develop scenarios that represent the watershed s diverse stakeholders and their different and conflicting interests and values it also provided these stakeholders with a great opportunity to communicate their concerns with each other which can induce and facilitate collective informed decision making in the zayandehrud watershed and other regions in search of approaches to sustainable water resources management each scenario also reflects a combination of mitigation policies and actions from the domains of supply delivery uses outflow and cross cutting aspects to fully account for the system s features the scenarios portrayed above are not the blue print for sustainable water resource management rather they offer critical reflection upon a diversity of alternatives it remains to be seen if key decision makers in iran and other water constrained regions move toward sustainable water resource management this research does not portend to know what will happen in the future rather our intention was to embrace uncertainty and complexity and explore alternative pathways and outcomes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors want to thank the participants who through they will

10762,there is an urgent need to consider adaptation strategies for agricultural water resources in response to the ever growing demand for freshwater around the world this is especially poignant in arid and semi arid regions like the middle east and north africa mena where water resources have been extremely limited historically today water resources are declining due to a variety of factors including climate change population growth and changing food preferences research on this topic typically seeks to assess the impact of discreet alternative interventions in isolation however it is necessary to analyze the broader factors affecting agricultural water management as interconnected components of a complex water governance system within a specific geographic context this research uses an exploratory formative scenario planning approach to a identify important adaptation strategies b use those adaptation strategies to construct a small set of coherent plausible and diverse regional agricultural water governance scenarios and c analyze future scenarios of the zayandehroud watershed in iran in the year 2040 the research shares five scenarios that exemplify divergent adaptation and mitigation approaches to agriculture water demand in zayandehroud watershed including adhering to the status quo each scenario embodies different economic and political priorities to reveal how those priorities impact the ecological social and economic sustainability of this watershed these scenarios provide insights into the long term implications of near term decisions about water and food security resilience of local communities and the ecological integrity of the regional watershed this research explores the conceptual relationships between components of the water governance system and demonstrates an approach to analyzing alternative constellations of factors that will impact agricultural water management policy makers can make more effective policies if they consider how to transform the broader system of regional water governance rather than only evaluating discrete agricultural water management projects on a project by project basis keywords adaptive governance scenario planning water market rural development local governance land use planning 1 introduction climate change and population growth are often the most discussed causes for global water scarcity in terms of supply uncertainty and increasing demand respectively yet water crises can also be attributed to governance including a broad range of political social economic and administrative systems that are in place to develop and manage water resources this is especially the case in developing countries where rigid and hierarchical governance systems which exercise monopolies via governmental control corporate contractors water market manipulation through trade policies incentives and water credits inhibit rational objective water policies rogers and hall 2003 in arid and semi arid regions characterized by low precipitation high evaporation and uneven temporal and spatial distribution of water resources agricultural water governance is of utmost importance since the decisions impact the dual goals of food security and water security for instance in the middle east and north africa mena region over 85 of available fresh water is being consumed by the agricultural sector to guarantee food security yet water demand far outstrips water availability bucknall 2007 shetty 2006 classic approaches to agricultural water management in these regions rely mostly on technologies and connected infrastructure to augment the irrigation water supply and to enhance the productivity and efficiency of irrigation the appeal of technological solutions can lead decisionmakers to overlook the potential of alternative solutions like market policies institutional reforms and social changes madani 2014 in fact adaptation processes can be constrained by a lack of political will and consensus oppositional cultural factors and the lack of stakeholder engagement ricart et al 2019b 2019a as an example intra basin competition over water resources can arise when public officials seek to implement short term visible outcomes for the landowning farmers that elected them thereby contributing to the persistence of technocratic approaches dietz et al 2003 in developing regions around the world international donors and other financial organizations historically have been strong external drivers of policy they can incentivize technology oriented solutions and centralized governance structures in order to control and protect their investments iglesias and garroteb 2015 performed a comprehensive study to identify agricultural water management adaptation strategies and evaluate their feasibility and effectiveness in europe iglesias and garrote 2015 the adaptation strategies they cataloged cannot be considered a comprehensive set of neutral and independent tools that can be implemented globally to mitigate the water management crisis boelens and vos 2012 explored the effects of discrete interventions that would affect water efficiency and enhance productivity yet they concluded that while those interventions represent important alternative decisions they need to be understood within complex social and power relationships in the specific geographic contexts where they are being implemented boelens and vos 2012 given the increasing vulnerability of water resources climate uncertainty and complex governance effective water management policies must account systematically for a wider range of adaptation strategies that embrace aspects of the built environment social institutions and socio ecological systems as well as different water activity domains including supply delivery use and outflow field 2014 larson et al 2013 white et al 2015 despite this need there is a dearth of studies that attend to the interplay between adaptation choices discrete interventions and geo political context and social relationships which are often neglected in these studies this means that the effectiveness and plausibility of a particular adaptation strategy is not considered in relation to other interventions despite boelens and vos 2012 arguments to the contrary to this point knieper and colleagues 2010 argue that there is a need for policy makers to explore alternative governance scenarios that attend to the technological and societal forces at work in their decisions foley and wiek 2014 knieper et al 2010 scenario planning offers a powerful tool to study the future states of a system by exploring alternative yet plausible and consistent futures that could evolve out of present conditions funke et al 2013 mahmoud et al 2009 stewart et al 2007 scenarios can help decision makers broadly defined to understand and analyze the key connections explore the uncertainties of a specific system to take a more holistic perspective and to assess coordinated actions in a highly uncertain environment henriques et al 2015 scenarios can be qualitative or quantitative based upon the nature of the data qualitative scenarios are more suitable for the analysis of complex systems with high degrees of uncertainty and when most of information cannot be readily quantified due to data uncertainties van notten et al 2003 on the other hand scenarios can be categorized as predictive explorative or normative based on the research question that the researcher aims to address while predictive scenarios seek to identify the most probable futures by answering questions related to what will happen explorative scenarios develop knowledge about what are the most plausible futures i e what can happen finally normative scenarios explore questions about the most preferable futures bishop et al 2007 this typology of scenario analysis is important to consider and will help the reader position our work within the field of scenario methodologies it also should be noted that the nature of scenarios as a type of foresight knowledge is non verifiable since it is not able to provide an exact representation of an observed reality so for qualitative scenarios quality criteria include logical coherence plausibility divergence and relevance to decision making rather than the accuracy of the prediction guimaraes pereira et al 2006 for example the national parks service uses scenarios to anticipate plausible but unprecedented conditions and expect surprises with respect to the effects of climate change on the national parks national park services 2013 this study offers a conceptual framework that attends to the interplay among multiple social political and technological factors and employs an explorative scenario development approach to study different constellations of those factors qualitatively the arrangement of those factors will inform distinct water governance scenarios some of which may contribute to key aspects of sustainability and less so for others the scenarios are not a blue print for sustainable water governance rather this study demonstrates conceptual relationships and explores the interplay of alternative strategy elements our research explores an important yet modest goal by addressing the question what adaptation policies technical and infrastructure investments can alleviate future water scarcity of this watershed how does each mitigation strategy promote or obstruct other choices how will understanding about these interplays guide us to delineate alternative water governance scenarios finally how will these alternative scenarios affect the ecosystems agricultural sector and rural communities this paper offers a small set of alternative scenarios which depict plausible comprehensive governance regimes that address agricultural water demand at its core is an exploration of the societal and technological transformations that may arise in parallel and ameliorate the conditions that are promulgating water wars across the global left unchecked the current rates of water overexploitation will lead to the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 ostrom 2009 with dire consequences for millions of people rather than focusing on silver bullet solutions to water crises this research treats water governance as a wicked problem that demands more holistic adaptive management strategies this study explores sustainable water governance by considering how alternative adaptation choices could function consistently without major obstructions to bring the people and places into focus next we introduce the zayandehrud basin in iran as a means of highlighting the key geopolitical factors unique to that watershed this case study will serve to illustrate the use of scenarios to explore potential approaches to the broader issues of water governance in arid and semi arid regions generally and the mena region specifically 2 case study context zayandehrud watershed the zayandehrud river originates from the zagros mountains in the northwest of iran and flows 250 miles through the arid and semi arid central plains before emptying into the gavkhooni swamp fig 1 the total basin area of 16 000 mi2 extends into the provinces of isfahan and chahar mahal charmahal province is located upstream of the river and its share of the river basin is just 7 of the land and 1 8 of the population mohajeri et al 2016 beside isfahan and charmahal provinces zayandehrud also provides residential water to residents of two arid neighbor cities of yazd and kashan currently more than one million about 20 residents of the basin depend on farming income and subsistence food supplies over an area of nearly 200 000 ha of cultivated land which is more than 90 irrigated food security concerns arose in the 1980 s during an eight year war between iraq and iran this event made food self sufficiency one of the highest national priorities regardless of severe water crises in most parts of the country self sufficiency 1 1 the terms in bracket refer to adaptation strategies and are identified as key variables listed in table 1 policies for food self sufficiency include high tariffs on imported foods and incentives such as subsidized water energy fertilizer and equipment to support domestic food production food trade regulation water pricing and subsidies subsequently the agriculture sector is expanding in this watershed even though it is a closed basin irrigated land area molle and mamanpoush 2012 the food self sufficiency incentives are not keyed to knowledge of the available water resources or their conservation therefore they prevent the agriculture sector from shifting toward more efficient and productive practices agricultural practices as a result despite the existence of severe water scarcity in the basin about 90 of its cultivated area is still supplied with water by flood irrigation irrigation system nikouei and ward 2013 shahdany et al 2018 the irrigation water storage and distribution networks are mostly open and uncovered canals and there is no infrastructure to gather treat and redistribute marginal quality water in farms storage and distribution system farms in close vicinity to the river rely on surface water 30 while other farms use spring water 6 and groundwater from wells 58 and qanats 6 for irrigating their farms felmeden 2014 a key historical and cultural feature of the agricultural water systems in iran are qanats which are underground horizontal tunnels excavated to convey groundwater from mountainous areas where the water table is closest to the surface to arid regions qanats minimize water contamination and evaporation unlike the pumping system qanats only extract renewable water yazdanpanah et al 2013a overdevelopment of upstream irrigated areas in addition to unauthorized groundwater extraction have disturbed the traditional qanat water allocation system substantially downstream farmers along the river as well as qanat water right holders no longer receive their full water rights water allocation this problem has led to widespread dissatisfaction and continuous protests protesters believe that the current water allocation system is unfair and water managers must stop pumping water to neighboring cities like yazd and kashan in fact angry farmers have frequently damaged the exporting water pipeline to those cities for instance as recently as october 2018 the water pipeline to the city of yazd was vandalized and ruptured by protesters 22 times according to the governor of yazd province bbc 2018 to satisfy increasing demand almost all river runoff is stored behind the chadegan dam three tunnels divert water from the neighboring watershed karoon while several new tunnels are under construction to increase the supply water transfer projects shown in fig 1 despite these efforts the gavkhooni wetland which iran committed to preserve under the ramsar convention has not been receiving its minimum water requirements to preserve ecological integrity since 1995 wetland water right the zayandehroud river passes through the city of isfahan the third most populous city in iran zayandehrud is a key feature of isfahan city a hub of tourism in iran many outstanding features of this ancient city such as bridges and palaces rely on the glory of this life giving river 2 2 the meaning of zayandehrud in farsi is the life giving river schramm and sattary 2014 the zayandehrud watershed was chosen as an illustrative case study due to its socioeconomic and ecological importance and as a complex case of agricultural water demand management a few scenario planning studies have been conducted on different aspects of the zayandehrud watershed gohari et al 2013 developed a system dynamics model to evaluate new water augmentation projects on supply demand dynamics in the zayandehrud watershed gohari et al 2013 safavi et al 2016 also developed an adaptive network based fussy inference system anfis model to evaluate the impact of climate change and supply augmentation projects on the near future condition 2015 2019 of this watershed felmeden 2014 developed three scenarios with special focus on integrated water management though that study offered very narrow recommendations this broad range of studies and the complex characteristics of the zayandehrud watershed make it an ideal case study to explore alternative governance arrangements through scenarios and thus offer findings for other watersheds in the mena region 3 research design and methods 3 1 theoretical framing this study draws upon elinor ostrom s 2009 scholarship on the governance of the commons and integrates aspects of the built environment socio economic and ecological environment into an analytical framework ostrom 2009 the built environment mostly embraces physical variables like technologies and infrastructures while socio economic conditions covers factors such as policies and regulations finally the ecological interface includes environmental conditions and systems those three categories were complemented by the work of keeler and colleagues 2015 which added phases of water governance including the five domains of supply delivery use outflow and cross cutting activities larson et al 2013 white et al 2015 these two frameworks together inform the theoretical framework for this paper s governance of agricultural water demand and demonstrate the conceptual alignment of the governance factors identified by ostrom with the five phases offered by keeler see fig 2 such an alignment allows this research to interrogate the interdependencies between and among the system elements and sustainability principles such as social institutions and water delivery or the built environment and socio ecological integrity 3 2 scenario construction methodology scenario development is usually a step wise process in which all tasks can be categorized into three standard groups idea generation integration and consistency checking bishop et al 2007 there are several available techniques that are used in each group and these can be adapted individually or in hybrid format based on the context nature of study and available resources generating techniques include collecting information from experts and or stakeholders integrating techniques are used to combine parts into wholes consistency techniques are utilized to secure the consistency between or within scenarios börjeson et al 2005 this research generated data from qualitative sources including individual interviews group discussions and desk research this research adapted a step wise formative scenario analysis methodology developed by scholz and tietje scholz and tietje 2002 tietje 2005 to integrate the information into a discrete set of governance oriented scenarios for the zayandehrud basin through 2040 the method was also used to secure consistency and diversity across the scenarios this exploratory approach helps to link the formative scenarios with expert and stakeholder knowledge to create a subset of signature scenarios which are normative comprehensible and informative for decision makers foley and wiek 2014 keeler et al 2015 the process that the research team followed to construct the formative scenarios is described next 3 2 1 step 1 variable identification proposed adaptation measures policy interventions and investments which may contribute independently to agricultural water demand agwd management were identified and cataloged in order to construct consistent and distinct water governance scenarios the semi participatory approach involved 15 individual interviews eight online discussion forums with about 8000 participants secondary sources from media based interviews government reports and documents and previous studies the individual interviews were recorded in person during january 2015 the interviewees were selected from a diverse range of water managers environmental activists and decision makers in iran the online discussions occurred through the telegram application which is the most popular phone based communication application among iranian citizens it provides a flexible affordable free and secure medium for stakeholders to express their ideas freely to persons outside of iran some forums involved official think tank and government advisors and others were unofficial discussion groups which support different stakeholder groups and their interests and values due to the nature of this research the individuals and organizations involved must remain anonymous this approach gathered data that fit the theoretical framework and provided a broad range of strategies for the different interfaces and domain activities the data gathered encompasses the three interfaces of socio economic formal and informal institutions built environment technological systems and environment ecological and five domains of supply delivery use outflow and cross cutting activities further the research team condensed the list of variables to include only 20 independent variables in the final set of variables based upon the following criteria 1 sustainability importance of the independent variable on agwd 2 systemic importance including the potential uncertainty and complexity that any single variable adds to the whole system for example projections for population growth have a high confidence or low degree of uncertainty therefore this variable and others like it were removed because they do not contribute significant uncertainty to the model 3 minimum redundancy for any variable that is already represented by other variables or if it is possible to combine two or more variables into a single variable for example variables like land consolidation irrigation scheduling and crop rotation programming were combined into a single variable called agricultural practice 4 maximum diversity across different interfaces socio economic technological ecological and activity domains supply delivery use outflow was evaluated iteratively by the researchers to have the most comprehensive set of variables two to three future projections that were drawn from the generated data were used to explore how the independent variables could change in the long term future and thus how the governance arrangement could change table 1 presents the variables selected and the future projections explored 3 2 2 step 2 system analysis the selected variables were scored for their cross influence on a scale from 0 no impact 1 indirect impact to 2 direct impact the scoring system accounts for the impact of variable a on variable b and a different score can be assigned to the impact of variable b on variable a subsequently this will yield a asymmetric impact matrix which includes impact relationships among all pairs of variables see appendix a for the completed impact matrix uploaded as research data this analyzes the key interconnections of the system and illustrates the level of activity influence or passivity sensitivity of each variable kuzdas and wiek 2014 michel et al 2018 it should be noted the cross impact and consistency scoring the next step were performed through an iterative process among the research team consequently the process involves a level of subjectivity where team members utilized their case specific knowledge about the variables to perform these tasks scholz and tietje 2002 3 2 3 step 3 consistency analysis the consistency of each scenario and logical coherence carpenter and rissman 2012 godet 2000 of paired variable projections were scored from 2 prevents the co occurrence to 2 required to co occur following tietje 2005 unlike previous analysis consistency scoring is a one way analysis because for each projection pair the plausibility of their co occurrence was scored only once for example the consistency score for having an effective water market without changing subsidies was assigned 1 which means this was deemed inconsistent but it s not impossible for those future projections to co occur the result is a triangular matrix see appendix b uploaded as research data this matrix was used to calculate additive and multiplicative consistency scores and number of inconsistencies for each scenario the different indices complement each other and support the selection of the most consistent scenarios which are neither too exclusive nor do they contain an abundance of major inconsistencies for instance the additive consistency index could compromise a major inconsistency between two future projections if the total consistency value is high enough for example for a given scenario if there are three interactions between future projections that are scored 2 prevents the co occurrence but all other scores are assigned a 2 required to co occur the additive consistency will be higher than many other scenarios without major inconsistencies in contrast multiplicative consistency could be too excluding since even one major inconsistency leads to total score of zero tietje 2005 a computational model using python programming language expedited the calculations the code is available in appendix c and is uploaded as research data the filtering criterion combined additive consistency 30 and the number of inconsistencies 2 to narrow the number of scenarios down from about 26 8 million initial scenarios to a smaller set of consistent scenarios one million which can be used in step 4 diversity analysis to summarize scenarios with an additive consistency above 30 were selected and had no more than one major inconsistency 3 2 4 step 4 diversity analysis while 96 of the scenarios were excluded based upon the consistency analysis the remaining consistent ones needed to be narrowed to a small set of plausible and distinctive scenarios for this purpose the distance to selected dts methodology was adapted and combined with a set of exclusive criteria to select the final scenarios tietje 2005 the most consistent scenario which is close to the status quo scenario was used as an anchor to find the second scenario to choose the second scenario a tradeoff needs to be considered between the consistency values and distance value harmonic mean distance from other selected scenarios since the intent of the study was to inform sustainable water governance we elected to focus on scenarios that exhibit strong coherence highly consistent while also adhering to the extent possible to sustainability principles foley and wiek 2014 white et al 2015 to do so in each round we chose scenarios that have the highest distance value from the most consistent scenarios while holding promise for a sustainable future this process was iterated until there was no scenario with harmonic mean distance greater than 50 while no unsustainable i e societal collapse scenarios were included it means that 50 similarity was set as the maximum permitted similarity between the signature scenarios 3 2 5 step 5 scenario interpretation as scholz and tietje 2002 claim the most natural way to interpret the scenarios is through deep discussions about future states of the system this method is consistent with our approach to transform the scenarios from operations on numbers to operation on concepts scholz and tietje 2002 this method also helps to communicate and validate the scenarios with targeted audiences more effectively accordingly key systemic features of our scenarios were shared with participants who deliberated on them and explained their vision of the zayandehrud basin in 2040 under each future scenario of the governance regime the timeframe was chosen to be long enough to extend beyond short term planning horizons and short enough so that the future projections are understandable to the current generation of decisions makers the interpretations used to elucidate each scenario focused on the following sustainability topics agricultural water demand ecological sustainability agriculture sector development welfare of rural communities food security conflict level a deliberative process among the research team produced a storyline for each scenario and those narratives along with some visualizations were used to refine participant perceptions of the scenarios 4 results scenario construction and selection the water governance system of zayandehrud watershed was explored thoroughly using the scenario planning methodology described above the major irrigation water demand management strategies were identified table 1 above and their dyads were studied to find their key interactions and to analyze this system of systems thoroughly furthermore five plausible and distinct scenarios were constructed and interpreted to address different approaches to irrigation water demand management in the zayandehrud watershed 2040 4 1 identified variables and system analysis from 52 initially catalogued variables 20 were selected based on the four criteria of sustainability and systemic importance maximum diversity and minimum redundancy however some of the filtered variables have been used frequently in previous scenario construction studies selected mitigation and adaptation strategies referred to as variables in the scenario construction procedure along with descriptions future projections and their domain of activity are listed in table 1 the system analysis categorized the variables into four levels of activity and passivity called active mediating passive and buffer variables fig 3 the impact analysis identified institutional reforms and the general approach to trade policy as key drivers of the system since they have high activity and low passivity scores therefore it is expected that any change in governance its hierarchy and integrity level and general food trade regulations would trigger substantial movement in other variables for instance the central food trade regulation approach is a key driver for other market variables like subsidies water markets and the water pricing system which can also stimulate change in agricultural and ecological variables the water allocation system and water transfer projects are assigned a mediating role see the upper right quadrant of fig 3 since they can highly influence other variables and be influenced by other variables at same time this analysis also shows that the food self sufficiency approach has the highest activity and passivity score in this system which implies its critical mediating role while the food self sufficiency approach can greatly affect the other water policies such as market regulation and agriculture practices it can also get influenced by any change in these policies on the other hand the adaptation strategies related to agricultural and efficiency and productivity fall in the third category sensitive policies including passive variables which are highly influenced by first and second groups however these have the least power to influence other variables the last category includes buffer variables which are neither drivers nor influence absorbers but exert an indirect impact on system outcome variables the results recognize no buffer variables this implies a high level of system complexity which means that none of these mitigatory actions happens in the vacuum without influencing or being influenced by other variables 4 2 selected scenarios five consistent systematically different scenarios were selected out of approximately 27 million scenarios algorithm generated by following the five step filtering procedure explained in section 3 a summary of the selected scenarios configuration of future projections is offered in table 2 below the consistency and diversity scores for each selected scenario shown in table 3 show no obstructive relations no 2 score additive scores above 45 and multiplicative consistencies greater than 1 5e 13 this provides confidence about the plausibility of the scenarios the high distance to selected dts values 60 and their low deviation 6 scores satisfy a high diversity level between the final scenarios kuzdas and wiek 2014 4 3 scenario interpretation the key systemic features of each scenario are depicted in fig 4 a e these diagrams along with deliberation and participatory research methods informed the following interpretations and insights about each scenario and the alternative approaches to ameliorating the ongoing water crisis in zayandehrud watershed 4 3 1 scenario 1 status quo continues this scenario carries forward the dominant governance system since the 1970s into the year 2040 fig 4a the central objective for iranian agricultural water management in this scenario is to safeguard food security by achieving self sufficiency and decreasing the nation s dependence on imported foods specifically staple crops the key challenge to overcome is water shortage and that is addressed through supply augmentation via large scale technical developments with a focus on building new infrastructure such as dams and water transfer tunnels this scenario is characterized by a top down governance system where agricultural water policies are made at the national level while regional and local water managers who mediate interactions between the farmers and policymakers have limited decision making authority farmers and other residents have minimum participation in national policy decisions which makes them highly dependent on government decisions and affords them little recourse this top down approach does not yield coordinated decision making across different levels of governance to support comprehensive mitigation strategies for instance the water management authority remains fragmented based on provincial political borders rather than watershed borders this exacerbates competition over limited resources among different stakeholders there are legally documented water rights which have been followed for several centuries that guide the distribution of water among farmers in zayandehrud watershed currently decisions about which farmers get water are made in an unclear and unfair process in which residential and industry water users have the highest priority while the remaining water is allocated to the agricultural sector based on government discretion in other words the current water allocation system doesn t comply with the traditional documented water sharing system which specifies the water apportioned each month to each of the 33 districts boluks along the river based on their water rights molle and mamanpoush 2012 as a result many downstream rightsholders receive almost no water moreover the gavkhooni wetland water rights are de prioritized in this scenario water shortages are addressed where possible through overexploitation of nonrenewable groundwater resources mahdavinia and mokhtar 2018 safe yield for the watershed in terms of meeting social and ecological water demand is not achieved to achieve food self sufficiency market manipulation tools are extensively used to facilitate domestic production and national security for instance trading of food products especially staple crops is highly regulated and strictly controlled by the central government therefore only the deficit gap between demand and domestic production is imported which is done directly by government or semi public companies the water pricing system is unchanged and calculates the surface water price as 1 3 of total production value while groundwater is free of charge with farmers only paying for the capital to drill wells and operate pumps market interventions that affect the final sale price of domestic products are not competitive with global prices so to support domestic production and control food price inflation the government compensates part of the production costs in the form of direct and indirect subsidies to farmers and customers restrictions on unauthorized water extraction are not prohibitive enough to dissuade farmers and the administration process is ineffective and often corrupted meaning that farmers create illegal wells 4 3 2 scenario 2 iranian capitalism reigns this scenario carries forward many economists notions of free market governance fig 4b the extensive market manipulation during the last decades is dissolved and deregulated markets correct for the value of limited resources like water chong and sunding 2006 madani 2014 rosegrant et al 2009 the core concept is that both the water and agricultural sector exist within deregulated conditions in which market equilibrium redefines the water governance system the water markets yielded positive outcomes in both ecological and socio economic systems the primary objective of this scenario is to provide a de minimis regulatory framework in which water creates the greatest economic value debaere 2014 this scenario is not plausible without effective foreign diplomacy efforts that provide stable and constructive economic relationships between iran and the vast majority of foreign nations water governance is still top down but with the central government s role and responsibilities curtailed to mediating market conditions monitoring and facilitating trade processes subsequently the central government works to remove regulations that hinder international and inter watershed food trading to create open markets where individuals and firms seek maximum economic profits government regulations have no impact on farm level decisions like crop choice irrigation methods total cultivated area and education all available water rights that were traditionally allocated are traded among farmers industries and even government entities throughout the watershed this water allocation system does not afford water rights to critical ecosystems like the gavkhooni wetland the volumetric value of allocated water is calculated and priced by water markets with high accuracy the water price covers all human related costs such as supply distribution and maintenance yet all forms of direct subsidies including energy agricultural equipment and other supplies like seed and fertilizer as well as indirect subsidies like specific food subsidies are totally removed 4 3 3 scenario 3 planned agricultural economy this scenario resonated with many participants and entailed reformed and integrated national planning efforts fig 4c water efficiency and agricultural and economic productivity are increased through integrated planning and strategic policies such a national integrated plan does not solve the ongoing water crisis but rather assures food self sufficiency and economic growth in the agricultural sector this scenario responds to the current lack of integration and shared objectives which do not encourage adaptive agricultural water management strategies this scenario focuses on achieving food self sufficiency and safeguarding people especially farmers from water scarcity through an integrated approach and comprehensive plan at the national level the planning efforts aim to develop a productive and water efficient agricultural sector to fulfill this goal a comprehensive cultivation plan is prepared dynamically based on soil properties available water and food demands to execute this plan incentive based policies like directed subsidies are used for energy equipment seeds and fertilizer water allocation is based on this comprehensive plan rather than traditional water rights similarly incentives are used to encourage the use of efficient irrigation technologies and improved practices in addition to a traditional education system the governing system uses a knowledge push approach to inform farmers about adaptive strategies development of large infrastructure is still followed intensively including new tunnel projects lining and covering channels and reservoirs to prevent extra evaporation and recycling the marginal quality effluent to be used as irrigation water on the other hand the extent of cultivated land is controlled and water resources are allocated to ensure safe yield of groundwater however wetland water rights are not a priority in this allocation system 4 3 4 scenario 4 interpreting traditions to shape the future the periodic cycles of drought in iran no longer create a crisis among farmers rather water management is understood as part of daily life by rural farmers darius the great s famous prayer from 500 bce that wished for the persian empire to be preserved from enemies drought and lies offers inspiration and a backdrop for the cultural significance of water people rediscover the important role of water in human flourishing in this region by returning to those origin stories this water governance system includes every citizen from kings to kids and employs all traditional sociocultural tools to establish a fair legitimate productive and most importantly sustainable governance system this unique water governance system that gave rise to the great civilization of persia and survived for thousands of years was abandoned by technocrats during the 19th and early 20th century this scenario expresses an idea for how a decentralized pluralistic governance system with minimum top down intervention might positively affect agricultural water management fig 4d the scenario revives a traditional water governance framework by acknowledging water resource ownerships and allowing the owners to govern the waterways that preserves their long term profits and celebrates farming as a way of life subsequently all kinds of subsidies and regulations are rescinded trade restrictions are removed and water is allocated per traditional water rights while the water pricing system remains intact new water transfer tunnel projects are canceled and once again qanats traditional underground tunnels become the dominant groundwater distribution system the governing structure is held by the collective local villagers farmers and water right holders there is no official mediating or watershed governing system at the federal level rather there is an extensive network of local research projects that are designed to share best practices and offer demonstration sites for farmers in other regions accordingly the education system that was once limited to intra family clan knowledge transfer is expanded to knowledge sharing between local communities 4 3 5 scenario 5 collaborative rural development the final scenario supports some interviewees idea that the most effective and least harmful strategy to manage agricultural water demand in this watershed is to downsize the agriculture sector by supporting alternative less water intensive businesses in rural communities fig 4e given the highly variable rainfall amounts related to climate change and resulting water crisis continued investments in the agricultural sector are neither economically nor environmentally defensible participants suggested downsizing agriculture from 20 of the labor force and 11 of gdp however this is not possible without a strategy to transition towards less water intensive employment otherwise higher unemployment rates than the current 12 unemployment rates will cause more social distress in the region the key goal in this scenario is to have flourishing and resilient rural communities with less reliance on income from agriculture this goal cannot be fulfilled without a close collaboration between all parties including the local population policy and lawmakers as well as academia and ngos this scenario requires an integrated effort to foster new economic opportunities by federal and state policy makers and ngos to support the robust local governing system the guiding vision for the collaboration and new industries would be to achieve sustainable development without compromising water and food security yet it must be noted that national food self sufficiency is not a central tenet of this plan traditional water allocation is modified to disincentivize the cultivation of marginal lands and greater value is placed on cultural uses for water as well as ecological water demand irrigation water is measured and priced properly to cover all supply and maintenance fees the life giving force of the river is reframed as a cultural attraction with daytime river cruises and restaurants competing for river front property in the heart of isfahan wetland water rights are secured by an allocation system and appreciation for the sightseeing tours to see exotic birds that provide new jobs water markets are effective and trade regulations support more positive virtual water import the subsidy option is also available to incentivize this transition from farming to rural industries despite the regulations and policies at the local level there is a democratic inclusive and legitimate water governing system which is run by farmers representatives and in coordination with businesses that benefit directly and indirectly from the river an elected board of representatives facilitates a collective decision making process as well as administers the rules and regulations this elected board cooperates closely with the court system to handle potential disputes elected boards across the regional engage in semi annual conferences to facilitate knowledge sharing and develop collaborative projects that span state boundaries 5 discussion scenarios presented here are intended to move decision makers beyond a binary selection of good or bad futures many water centric scenarios have fallen victim to this duality presenting two or maybe three options e g build the dam or not in contrast the future like the present is rarely so simple this study aims to open up those constrained decisions and place them within a broader decision making governance context that systematically connects the dots between economic technological societal and ecological forces to isolate any single adaptation choice and hold the rest of the system constant ignores the interrelations within socio eco techno systems sets to be clear there are quite a few alternative pathways and outcomes for iran and many other nations facing serious water resource management challenges by exploring several alternatives to water governance this research shows that there are far more choices than simply building a tunnel or not and such a narrow framing of alternatives has implications far beyond the mere presence or absence of a piece of infrastructure rather there are entirely different governance arrangements that can support socio technological changes and that combination has significant implications for the economic and ecological well being of the region our research shows that scenario 1 status quo continues is the most consistent failure scenario for zayandehrud watershed food self sufficiency is politicized and buttressed as a necessity of independence and geopolitical stability madani 2014 such stability will be supported by policies and regulations like protectionism that will decrease food trading develop of canals for water distribution and expanding irrigated land area underpriced irrigation water and indiscriminative subsidies molle and mamanpoush 2012 by 2040 it is plausible that socio economic sustainability of the zayandehrud watershed will be degraded while neither food security nor water security will be achieved heslot 2018 if food self sufficiency remains the central guiding policy in iran then planned agriculture scenario 3 would offer a means to secure production of essential crops without compromising the water security of the watershed however absolute food self sufficiency is not a plausible plan given current and future projections of water availability heslot 2018 mesgaran and azadi 2018 to achieve this goal planned agriculture pursues new heavy infrastructure projects to augment the irrigation water supply yet irrigation efficiency and water productivity are improved in the planned agriculture scenario through an integrated and dynamic national planning effort this comprehensive plan dictates who gets water and how much and what should be cultivated and how much this plan will be supported by incentive policies like subsidies and pre purchase plans the planned agriculture scenario portrays an extensive and costly governance scheme which is greatly dependent on supportive monetary policies in contrast to this extensive top down governance system scenario 2 capitalism reigns offers a minimalistic governance system in which water markets will determine the distribution of irrigation water food self sufficiency is no longer a central principle in the capitalism reigns scenario and a free trade environment facilitates the shift of water rights from small traditional farms to consolidated highly productive ones this means water will go where it yields the greatest value bekchanov et al 2015 debaere et al 2014 empirically demonstrated the positive impact of a cap and trade approach that was facilitated by a water market in seven different watersheds for instance total well pumping from the edwards aquifer in texas has generally decreased since 1990 while the population of the region increased by nearly 50 debaere et al 2014 subsequently it is expected that relatively lower world prices for certain commodity crops and small or even negative marginal profit will discourage new entrants to farming and existing small farmers may shift their investments from farming to other businesses nazemi et al 2018 therefore the demand for irrigation water will be slightly reduced and is replaced by industrial and or residential demand since traditional water rights are acknowledged in the capitalism reigns scenario it is expected that the gavkhooni wetland ecological water right will be recognized again the status quo stands in stark contrast to the traditional water allocation system in which a fair distribution of water was guaranteed scenario 4 interpreting traditions scenario offers a return to traditional cultural practices of community based traditions that celebrate and place great value on water yazdanpanah et al 2013b in this scenario as in the capitalism reins scenario ecological water rights gavkhooni water rights have been incorporated into the water allocation system the dominance of traditional water distribution networks qanats guarantees safe yield 3 3 the maximum amount of water that can be withdrawn yet still the supply is maintained and unimpaired for groundwater extraction molle and mamanpoush 2012 this is compatible with traditional family based subsistence farming practices therefore it is expected that domestic food production would decrease because it cannot compete with global prices which means the farmer income would also decline however the collective and fair governance system which is based on great respect for a community s values and traditions i e the respect for nature and contentment with simple country life can provide a high degree of stability and ecological and socio economic sustainability yazdanpanah et al 2013a collaborative rural development scenario 5 supports the idea of reducing the agricultural activities in zayandehrud watershed through a collaborative rural development plan to support farmers career shift from farming to less water intensive businesses which is an approach advocated by heslot 2018 such a scenario plausibly will allow rural communities to flourish and foster resilience against changing climatic and economic conditions through building local capacity for development louis and nazemi 2017 rug weaving is an ancient art and important industry in this watershed especially in rural areas and it might well be expected that by 2040 rug weaving workshops and other local crafts could be thriving reducing irrigation water consumption will increase the level of water in the river which is essential for absorbing eco tourism to this region abyareh 2009 with respect to ecological sustainability collaborative rural development is the only scenario which acknowledges the gavkhooni wetland water rights in the allocation system the capitalism reigns scenario may meet the wetland water rights intermittently because of shrinking of the agricultural sector although this is not guaranteed nikoui et al 2012 argue that incentivizing farmers to adopt water efficiency measures would help to save water to preserve the gavkhouni wetland although scenario 3 of this research proves that increasing the water efficiency and productivity does not necessarily secure the sustainability of wetlands since the water demand in this watershed is always greater than the supply furthermore increasing productivity and efficiency will incentivize farmers to put more land under cultivation nikouei et al 2012 safe yield in which annual groundwater withdrawals do not exceed the natural recharge rate is also considered a central governance principle in scenarios 3 4 and 5 this relieves stress on the aquifers but does not fully resolve the tension between agricultural water use and the ecological requirements of healthy wetlands even though each selected scenario represents a systematically different governance system four of them all except the status quo scenario contributes positively to managing agriculture water demand however the watershed experiences different socio economic conditions under each governance scenario for example it is expected that in the absence of supportive plans and limited capacity for job creation the capitalism reigns scenario which is grounded on free market principles will cause the most intensive transition for farmers who will lose their jobs mesgaran and azadi 2018 it may cause a long lag phase before efficient and productive farms can emerge this also can worsen water disputes and public dissatisfaction which are already a big issue in the watershed kuzdas et al 2016 the scenario collaborative rural development shares similar trade regulations with the capitalism reigns scenario the difference is that inexpensive water in addition to robust local governance facilitates the adaptation process and dampens the shock of market change when compared to the capitalism reigns scenario collaborative rural development causes a smoother transition and ends in more resilient rural communities yazdanpanah et al 2013b ricart et al 2019 studies ten successful cases which use different tools to promote stakeholder engagement they conclude that engagement of stakeholders in irrigation water governance will reduce tension between stakeholders and help with easier conflict resolution in these communities ricart et al 2019b the planned agriculture scenario causes the least shock to the agricultural sector it is anticipated that awd reduction is less noticeable than the other three scenarios while domestic food production is higher than the others although this scenario includes many supportive plans for farmers it is projected that it will not reduce water disputes since it does not recognize traditional water rights molle et al 2008 moreover dictating the national cultivation plan makes the governance system responsible for most risks and may generate greater protests if farmers are not satisfied with the outcome more accurate evaluation of the transition phase and its impact on different stakeholders requires a comprehensive study which was beyond the scope of this paper to deal with the challenging trade off between the comprehensiveness to include all important variables and their interconnections and coherence of governance scenarios to avoid too much complexity the scope of the current study focused on irrigation water demand and rural communities thus the impacts of selected scenarios on industry or residential water security was not assessed future studies can focus on urban water demand and or industrial water demand governance scenarios and a holistic study to develop signature scenarios which support the overall watershed sustainability moreover this study s model was kept as qualitative and conceptual as possible which helped to include many governance features that cannot be integrated to computational models future researches can acquire relevant data on water resource availability distribution and use by sector and develop a computational model to reassess the findings of this study in a quantitative framework 6 conclusion formative scenarios offer a means to explore the interplay between socio economic technical and ecological forces this approach moves away from assessing discrete interventions and engages with the complex geo political and societal context of regional water resources management this study walked through a methodical approach for constructing scenarios in a systematic process and then evaluated a set of distinct consistent and normative governance alternatives for agricultural water governance such a technique can help decision makers consider a greater range of choices and allow them to take into account more alternatives without applying strict boundaries to the analysis indeed the flexible participatory approach of this study also helped to develop scenarios that represent the watershed s diverse stakeholders and their different and conflicting interests and values it also provided these stakeholders with a great opportunity to communicate their concerns with each other which can induce and facilitate collective informed decision making in the zayandehrud watershed and other regions in search of approaches to sustainable water resources management each scenario also reflects a combination of mitigation policies and actions from the domains of supply delivery uses outflow and cross cutting aspects to fully account for the system s features the scenarios portrayed above are not the blue print for sustainable water resource management rather they offer critical reflection upon a diversity of alternatives it remains to be seen if key decision makers in iran and other water constrained regions move toward sustainable water resource management this research does not portend to know what will happen in the future rather our intention was to embrace uncertainty and complexity and explore alternative pathways and outcomes declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement the authors want to thank the participants who through they will

10763,the coastal area of the syrian akkar region is particularly suitable for intensive vegetable production and zucchini squash curcubita pepo l is one of the most profitable crops grown there local agricultural policies have been especially concerned at improving irrigation water management in the region by rationalizing water and nutrient use modernizing irrigation methods and minimizing the associated environmental risks the objective of this study was to compute the soil water balance in zucchini squash plots irrigated with furrow and drip methods using the simdualkc model during four growing seasons 2012 2015 the furrow plots treatment t0 represented the traditional irrigation practices in the study area while the drip plots treatments t1 and t2 followed alternative irrigation schemes the simdualkc model was able to simulate soil water contents measured in the field plots returning root mean square error values lower than 0 002 m3 m 3 and modelling efficiencies ranging from 0 166 to 0 732 the basal non stressed crop coefficients kcb varied from 0 18 to 0 22 0 85 to 0 98 and 0 56 to 0 71 during the initial mid season and end season stages respectively with the actual values kcb act often matching the potential ones the evaporation coefficients ke varied according to irrigation schedules and methods during the early crop stages but were minimized with full canopy development drip t1 presented always the highest water productivity wp indicators due to the higher frequency of irrigation events with less water applied per event in contrast furrow t0 resulted in substantial percolation losses which affected yields and wp hence model results evidenced the benefits of precise irrigation for zucchini squash production in the syrian akkar region further enhancing the need for sustainable water management practices in local production systems keywords evapotranspiration simdualkc soil water balance water productivity 1 introduction the cultivated land in the fertile syrian coastal area has been steadily expanding over the years due to several irrigation projects that improved water availability in the region chard 1981 amery 2002 irrigation now covers 29 65 500 ha of the cultivated coastal land 226 000 ha 3 7 of the syrian cultivated land with surface systems being traditionally adopted cbs 2017 while these systems can be regarded as very efficient if land is precisely levelled and water is applied uniformly pereira et al 2002 darouich et al 2014 the characteristics of small size local farming systems 1 3 ha in average have limited its correct management resulting in low water use efficiencies as a result modern methods such as drip irrigation have been slowly replacing the traditional systems covering now close to 43 29 000 ha of the irrigated area cbs 2017 drip irrigation methods by delivering small and precise water amounts with relative high frequency are especially suited to field and greenhouse grown vegetables which together with citrus are the main intensive irrigated farming systems in the syrian coastal area wattenbach 2006 the most prominent and profitable vegetables are tomato solanum lycopersicum l cucumber cucumis sativus l squash cucurbita pepo l and eggplant solanum melongena l however the estimated production area is associated with a certain uncertainly as these plants are often included in double cropping systems or partial cultivated under young new tree orchards despite the small size of local farming systems vegetables production contributes to the high share of very profitable crops grown in the region taking advantage of market opportunities with the proximity of highly dense urban areas as well as very favorable environmental and climate conditions the major production risks are associated with the price return of perishable crops wattenbach 2006 while the greatest environmental risks are the over fertilization of crops and consequent pollution of groundwater supplies with high concentrations of nitrate halwani et al 1999 abou zakhem and hafez 2007 kattaa et al 2010 improving land and water productivity in the syrian coastal agricultural area have thus become a top priority for the environmental protection of groundwater and downstream water bodies abou zakhem and hafez 2007 kattaa et al 2010 thomas et al 2003 several measures were implemented in the region as well as in other agricultural areas in syria with the aim of rationalizing agricultural water use improving irrigation systems performance increasing farmers income modernizing irrigation methods and techniques e g by converting the traditional surface systems to drip and improving fertigation techniques varela ortega and sagardoy 2003 darouich et al 2012 fader et al 2016 mourad and alshihabi 2016 abou zakhem et al 2019 this means that crop water requirements need to be properly assessed as well as the most suitable irrigation schedules irrigation timing length and quantity need to be accurately defined for improving irrigation water use maximizing yields and minimizing the associated environmental risks modeling can play here a fundamental role in complying with such objectives calibrated crop water simulation models are now seen as suitable tools for computing crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling raes 2002 pereira et al 2003 domínguez et al 2011 rosa et al 2012a vanuytrecht et al 2014 most of these models adopt the fao56 single crop coefficient kc approach allen et al 1998 which provides acceptable estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc rates on the other hand the fao56 dual kc approach which is less applied allows for the separate estimation of crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates through the partitioning of etc allen et al 1998 this approach is also usually considered more precise when estimating irrigation needs on a daily basis particularly when dealing with the impacts of soil wetting by rain or irrigation in a partially covered soil or when high frequency events take place allen et al 2005 the dual kc approach has been implemented in the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a which considers also crop density height ground cover irrigation methods and scheduling and management active ground cover mulching intercropping factors that may further affect etc the model has been applied with success for wheat maize tomato pepper and soybean in northern china zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2018 wei et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 maize in southern brazil martins et al 2013 wheat in northern syria rosa et al 2012b cotton in uzbekistan rosa et al 2012b potato in southern italy paredes et al 2018 and maize peach and olive in southern portugal paço et al 2012 2019 rosa et al 2016 as a result the simdualkc model may well constitute an important reference tool for improving irrigation water management in vegetable crops grown in the syrian coastal area however model applications focused on vegetable production have been quite limited so far and additional research is required hence the objectives of this study are i to simulate soil water contents in zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l plots irrigated with furrow and drip methods using the simdualkc model during four growing seasons 2012 2015 ii to estimate the daily etc rates and respective crop coefficients for zucchini squash grown in the akkar plain syria using the dual kc approach and iii to analyze the soil water balance from a water saving and economic perspective results of this study will help to improve irrigation water use efficiency in the syrian agricultural coastal area contributing to a better assessment of vegetables irrigation needs in the region 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 site description the field

the north the al janoubi river and its tributaries kalife and abo falat along the syrian lebanon border the bared river limiting the territory to the south and the ostouene river situated in between the previous two rivers thomas et al 2003 several wells provide for additional water resources which are used for irrigation of 6400 ha of agricultural land in latakia and 11 700 ha in tartus cbs 2017

treatments the experiment involved irrigation of zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l cv magda hybrid squash with different methods furrow and drip and schedules during four growing seasons 2012 2015 the experimental area 35 m 20 5 m was relatively flat with 0 005 and 0 002 slope in the west and south directions respectively a randomized complete block design was established with three treatments furrow t0 drip t1 drip t2 and four replicates per treatment fig 3 each plot size replicate was 2 25 m 15 m and included three cultivated rows with 0 75 m spacing between rows and 0 40 m between plants about 33 333 plants ha 1 non irrigated areas distanced each plot by 1 m the irrigation period lasted from plant transplantation to harvest table 2 the water was conveyed from a well to the field by a pvc mainline and distributed to three polyethylene manifold pipes fig 3 a drainage network was set at 1 25 1 75 m depth with drain pipes distancing 15 25 m the furrow t0 treatment represented the traditional irrigation scheme followed by farmers in the region the furrow basin 3 furrows per replicate distanced 0 75 m between each other was supplied by one pipe with a discharge of approximately 5 m3 h 1 irrigation was applied with an elapsed time of 0 5 h i e the average time for water to reach the end of the furrow basin table 3 presents the furrow irrigation amounts which were applied every 6 30 days depending on weather conditions the drip t1 and t2 treatments considered different schedules irrigation in drip t1 aimed to fulfil crop water needs and maximize water productivity

variables between treatments these plots included 3 laterals placed along the 3 plant rows in line drippers were spaced 0 5 m with a discharge rate of 8 l h 1 at 100 kpa irrigation in drip t1 was triggered when soil water depletion reached 25 42 of the readily available water raw depending on the crop stage water was then applied to fulfill 25 and 50 of raw for the initial and remaining crop stages respectively thus drip t1 irrigation registered a relatively high frequency 3 6 days and small irrigation depths per event 11 18 mm table 3 irrigation in drip t2 was triggered when soil water depletion reached 34 65 of raw also depending on the crop stage water was applied to fulfill 70 and 120 of raw for the initial and remaining crop stages respectively so irrigation frequency in drip t2 was slightly lower 5 12 days than in the previous treatment with higher amounts applied per event 27 45 mm table 3 every year the zucchini squash which variety is also referred to as cousa squash was planted in a nursery between january 10th and 20th and then transplanted to the experimental site in march the dates of the crop growth stages in each season are documented in table 2 manure 30 mg ha 1 was applied once before plantation besides that fertilization was applied in three batches along the growing season with n p and k units summing 120 60 and 90 kg ha 1 weed control was performed manually soil water contents were measured using a neutron probe with access tubes installed in the middle of the second row of each plot in the four replicates until a depth of 0 45 m crop height h and mean diameter were also monitored using a tape during each stage of the different growing seasons the fraction of ground cover fc was then estimated from the crop s mean diameter assuming a round shape of the plant s canopy and plant s spacing fruit were collected in all replicates at the end of each growing season and the fresh weight was recorded 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 model description the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a computes the soil water balance at the plot scale on a daily basis as follows 1 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t c a c t i d p i in which dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the rainfall mm ro is the runoff mm i is the net irrigation depth mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and dp is the deep percolation from the root zone mm all referring to day i or day i 1 crop evapotranspiration is computed according to the fao56 dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 thus estimating separately the components related to crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm 2 t c k c b e t o 3 e s k e e t o where kcb is the potential basal crop coefficient ke is the evaporation coefficient and eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm actual transpiration values tc act mm are obtained by introducing a dimensionless stress coefficient ks into eq 2 to account for the effect of soil water depletion on tc values 4 t c a c t k s t c k s k c b e t o k c b a c t e t o where kcb act is the actual basal crop coefficient and ks with varying values from 0 to 1 is defined as follows 5 k s t a w d r i t a w r a w in which taw and raw are respectively the total and readily available soil water relative to the rooting depth mm these are given by 6 t a w 1000 z r θ f c θ w p 7 r a w p t a w where θfc and θwp are the soil water contents at field capacity and the wilting point m3 m 3 respectively zr is the root depth m and p is the depletion fraction for no stress when soil depletion exceeds the depletion fraction for no stress i e the soil water content drops below raw tc values are reduced due to water stress ks 1 0 otherwise ks 1 0 and no water stress occurs additionally the model internally corrects the kcb values to local climatic conditions when the minimum relative humidity rhmin differs from 45 and or when the average wind speed differs from 2 m s 1 allen et al 1998 the kcb values are further adjusted to crop characteristics density and height using a density coefficient kd which accounts for the increase in kcb with the increase in the amount of vegetation allen and pereira 2009 soil evaporation is limited by the amount of energy available at the soil surface in conjunction with the energy consumed by transpiration and by water availability in the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 2005 es is thus maximum during the early crop stages when the topsoil is wetted by rain or irrigation and energy is largely available at the soil surface contrarily es is minimum when the crop fully shadows the soil limiting the energy available for evaporation and or when the surface soil layer is dry accordingly the evaporation coefficient ke in eq 3 is computed as follows allen et al 2005 8 k e k r k c m a x k c b m i n f e w k c m a x in which kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient with varying values from 0 to 1 kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following a rain or irrigation event and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation the kr is calculated using the two stage drying cycle approach where the first stage is the energy limited stage and the second is the water limited stage ritchie 1972 allen et al 1998 2005 9 k r 1 for d e i 1 rew 10 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i l rew where tew is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation soil layer when it has been completely wetted mm rew is the depth of water that can be easily evaporated without water availability restrictions mm and de is the evaporation layer depletion at the end of day i 1 mm de is computed through a daily water balance of the evaporation soil layer with the evaporation decreasing as the evaporable soil water decreases in the evaporation soil layer beyond rew finally for the remaining parameters in eq 1 dp is computed using the parametric time decay function proposed by liu et al 2006 which relates the soil water storage above field capacity with the draining time until θfc is reached 11 w a a d t b d where wa is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm ad is the soil water storage comprised between saturation and field capacity mm bd is an empirical dimensionless parameter and t is the time after an irrigation or rain that produces a storage above field capacity days ro is estimated using the curve number approach proposed by the usda scs 1972 cr is not considered in this study as the experimental area was limited downwards by a

calibrated procedures consisted of adjusting model parameters one at a time until deviations between measured and simulated soil water contents were minimized pereira et al 2015 a trial and error procedure was adopted the default kcb and p values relative to the initial mid season and end season crop stages were first adjusted then the deep percolation parameters ad and bd were modified finally the kcb and p values relative to the different crop stages were again adjusted until errors were minimized the soil evaporation parameters were found to provide reasonable results and were not modified the model performance was evaluated using various goodness of fit indicators including the regression coefficient b0 the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the modeling efficiency nse respectively given as loague and green 1991 legates and mccabe

is the number of observations b0 values close to 1 indicate that the predicted values are statistically close to the observed ones r2 values close to 1 indicate that the model explains well the variance of observations rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate small estimation errors and good model predictions legates and mccabe 1999 pbias values close to zero indicate that model simulations are accurate while positive or negative values indicate under or over estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 indicate that the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance hence the model predictions are good on the contrary if nse is less than zero the model predicted values are worse than simply using the observed mean nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 3 water productivity indicators the experimental results were further assessed using the water productivity indicators described in pereira et al 2009 2012 these include the water productivity relative to the total water used wpwu kg m 3 the irrigation water applied wpirrig kg m 3 the consumptive use wpet kg m 3 and transpiration wpt kg m 3 respectively given as 18 w p w u y a t w u 19 w p i r r i g y a i w u 20 w p e t y a e t c a c t 21 w p t y a t c a c t where ya is the actual measured yield kg ha 1 twu is the total water used given by the sum of effective p i and the variation of the soil water storage δsw m3 ha 1 iwu is the irrigation water use given by i m3 ha 1 etc act is the estimated actual evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 and tc act is again the estimated actual crop transpiration m3 ha 1 the economic water productivity ewp m 3 and the economic water productivity ratio ewpr were also computed as follows pereira et al 2009 2012 22 e w p v a l u e y a t w u 23 e w p r v a l u e y a c o s t t w u where value ya is the value of the achieved yield and cost twu is the cost of the irrigation water the ewpr shows the impacts of water prices on the economic return of irrigation the yield value was here set to 0 35 kg 1 maar 2017 corresponding to an inflation of the 2010 price multiplied by 10 as a result of speculation with the ongoing war in syria the price of the irrigation water was set to 0 055 m 3 maar 2017 increasing only 2 5 times as the product is supported supplied by the government 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water contents fig 4 shows the daily averages of the soil water contents measured in the root zone layer of each experimental treatment during the 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons and compares these values with the simdualkc simulations irrigation events and amounts are also given in the same figure the furrow t0 treatment registered less irrigation events 6 10 events and larger irrigation depths 74 mm per event table 3 measured and simulated soil water content values showed there the largest variations amongst treatments reaching values close to saturation immediately after irrigation events and then decreasing to values below field capacity due to water redistribution soil evaporation and crop transpiration drip t1 exhibited a contrasting behavior with measured and simulated soil water contents remaining close to field capacity due to the higher irrigation frequency 15 21 events and lower depths 11 18 mm applied per event table 3 finally measured and simulated soil water contents in drip t2 were in between the previous values due to the adopted irrigation schedule table 3 the simdualkc model was able to reproduce field measurements reasonably well during the 2012 growing season table 5 returning higher r2 values for drip t1 and t2 r2 0 542 0 669 than for furrow t0 r2 0 335 the error of the estimate was quite small resulting in rmse values lower than 0 002 mm for all treatments however the nrmse value revealed the lower accuracy of model simulations for furrow t0 nrmse 25 1 both the b0 and pbias values indicated a small under prediction of observations by the model in furrow t0 and drip t1 while observations were slightly overpredicted in drip t2 finally the nse value was found to be again lower for furrow t0 nse 0 166 and higher for drip t2 nse 0 662 the parameters calibrated during the 2012 growing season table 4 were validated during the following years 2013 2015 with the goodness of fit indicators generally improving when compared with the earlier year table 5 the r2 values varied from 0 554 to 0 810 which confirmed that the model could explain most of the variability of the observed data in the different treatments the error of the estimate was again quite small with the rmse values matching those obtained during calibration but this time also the normalized indicator nrmse resulted in values always lower than 13 3 the b0 and pbias values showed a tendency for the predicted values to be very close to observations with small exceptions e g drip t2 during the 2013 growing season also the nse values resulted in relatively high values ranging from 0 467 to 0 732 which indicate that the residual variance was much smaller than the measured data variance overall the general good agreement between simulated and measured data during the four seasons indicated that the model input parameters in table 4 were adequately fitted for simulating soil water dynamics in all experimental fields yet some exceptions were noticed with the nse values remaining lower than 0 6 in furrow t0 during the 2012 and 2013 seasons drip t1 during 2012 and 2014 and drip t2 during 2015 table 5 ramos et al 2012 discussed possible sources of error for explaining the deviations between measured and simulated soil water contents found in their study which included field measurement model inputs and model structure errors some of those causes can here also be considered namely those related to the quality of the measurement dataset particularly the representativeness of spatially averaged soil water contents measured over a certain soil volume with the neutron probe for describing the distribution of water under highly spatially non uniform irrigation systems drip and furrow the depth at which those measurements were taken likely misrepresenting smaller irrigation events such as in drip t1 and the number of measurements taken per growing season with smaller datasets e g 2012 possibly emphasizing the weight of existing outliers nonetheless most of the goodness of fit indicators were within the range of values reported in other successful simdualkc applications for vegetables zhang et al 2018 patil and tiwari 2019 as well as other crops zhao et al 2013 wu et al 2015 rosa et al 2016 paredes et al 2018 thus confirming the reliability of model simulations 3 2 potential and actual crop coefficients fig 5 presents the seasonal variation of the potential non stressed basal crop coefficients kcb the actual basal crop coefficients kcb act the soil evaporation coefficients ke and the actual crop coefficients kc act kcb act ke computed by simdualkc for zucchini squash during the 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons also included are the rainfall and irrigation events the kcb values for the different crop stages were first defined as in table 4 and then further adjusted to local weather conditions crop density and crop height following allen and pereira 2009 during the 2012 growing season the kcb values for the initial mid season and end season crop stages were set to 0 18 0 85 and 0 60 respectively during the following years the kcb values presented small variations due to climate variability but also to the dates of the crop stages that varied along the different seasons table 2 during the 2013 season the kcb values reached 0 18 0 89 and 0 68 during the initial mid season and end season crop stages respectively in 2014 those values matched 0 22 0 94 and 0 56 while in 2015 the corresponding values were 0 18 0 98 and 0 71 as such the kcb values found for zucchini squash grown in the syrian akkar plain were in accordance with allen et al 1998 who provided reference values of 0 15 0 90 and 0 70 for the same crop stages the kcb act values reflected some water stress along the growing seasons with a departure from the potential kcb values being noticed during 2012 2013 and 2014 for furrow t0 and during 2012 for drip t1 fig 5 in furrow t0 the longest water stress period was registered during the mid season stage of 2013 with the kcb values being reduced several times to a minimum of 0 54 equaling again the potential values with the increase of soil water contents after the following irrigation or rain events the ke values showed a decreasing trend from sowing to the beginning of the mid season stage fig 5 reaching then values close to zero with full canopy development when less energy was available at the soil surface for evaporation nonetheless the ke values were subjected to large variability dictated by the occurrence of rainfall or irrigation events this was particularly notorious during the 2012 growing season when the mid season stage was reached at a later date compared with other seasons finally the kc act curve naturally described the same trends observed for kcb act and ke yet fig 5 clearly shows that the drop of ke values during the crop development stages were somehow compensated by the increase of the kcb act values maintaining thus the kc act values relatively high note that the kc act curve for the syrian akkar plain found some correspondence with the one presented by mohammad 2004 for summer squash grown in irbid jordan this author reported kc values of 0 71 and 0 60 for the mid season and end season stages respectively which were lower than the ones found in this study but comparable nevertheless however for the initial season stage the kc value reported there kc 0 24 was considerably lower approaching only the kcb values found in this study i e without considering the evaporation component likewise amer 2011 reported kc act values for summer squash grown in menofia egypt which were close to the ones found in this study this authors reported kc act values ranging from 0 42 0 44 and 0 69 0 71 for drip and furrow irrigation during the initial crop stage respectively during the mid season stage the corresponding values increased to 1 01 1 03 and 1 06 1 10 falling then to 0 61 0 66 and 0 65 0 71 during the end season stage on the other hand rouphael and colla 2005 referred higher kc values ranging from 0 10 to 1 15 but for summer squash grown in greenhouse conditions in viterbo italy 3 3 soil water balance table 6 presents the soil water balance computed by simdualkc for zucchini squash grown in different experimental treatments during the 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons tc values varied from 193 to 281 mm the lowest value was obtained in 2012 when the crop cycle lasted only 61 days table 2 during the following seasons tc values were more equal 239 281 mm as well as the duration of the crop cycles 81 93 days approaching also the values reported by amer 2011 tp from 312 to 373 mm for a crop cycle of 93 days in menofia egypt as the zucchini squash rooting depth is relatively shallow 0 45 m irrigation schedules were always defined to maintain soil water contents at high levels and avoid the detrimental effects of water deficit on crop yields and fruit quality number diameter length and shape of fruits richard et al 2002 ertek et al 2004 nonetheless as described above the kcb act values occasionally departed from the potential values in furrow t0 and drip t1 when soil water depletion increased above raw however water stress levels were never very extensive and for that reason tc act values were only reduced up to 4 when compared with potential values on the other hand maintaining soil water contents at high levels resulted in considerable losses of water through deep percolation table 6 in furrow t0 dp cumulative values ranged from 287 mm to 551 mm i e 50 64 of the total water applied by both irrigation and rainfall however as shown in fig 6 most of the percolated water 78 92 was actually originated from irrigation for 2013 2015 since in 2012 no noticeable rainfall events occurred these results showed the inefficiency of the irrigation schedule representing the traditional furrow scheme used in the syrian akkar plain resulting also in substantial yield losses see section 3 4 drip t2 also produced very high dp cumulative values ranging from 190 to 412 mm i e 1 0 1 5 times higher than the corresponding tc values here most of the percolated water was again from irrigation 58 86 these results thus show that despite the introduction of a more modern irrigation method water losses can still be substantial if the system is poorly managed darouich et al 2014 finally drip t1 resulted in lower dp cumulative values 60 mm 141 mm due to the higher frequency of irrigation events and lower depths applied per event contrarily to the previous treatments most of percolated values were found after rainfall events with water losses from irrigation totalizing only 29 48 of the total dp values fig 6 in all experimental treatments cumulative values of soil evaporation were relatively low summing less than 45 mm per season this was mainly due to the short duration of crop seasons less than 3 months and the relatively fast and total coverage fc 0 99 of the soil surface by the plant canopy which limited the available energy for evaporation 3 4 yields and water productivity indicators table 7 presents the anova table with the analysis of variance for the effects of the different treatments and growing seasons on zucchini squash yields statistics showed a significant difference in the average between treatments and between years while for the interaction between both factors only a significant value was recorded at the 99 level of confidence this indicated that yield responded to the irrigation treatments as well as to season variability as demonstrated by the statistical analysis yields varied significantly between treatments with drip t1 always returning the highest marketable yields in this treatment zucchini squash yields averaged 31 4 mg ha 1 ranging from 20 6 mg ha 1 in 2014 to 38 9 mg ha 1 in 2013 table 8 amer 2011 reported comparable yields for menofia egypt with yields 25 0 to 45 7 mg ha 1 depending on the seasonal irrigation depth and irrigation method there the highest yields were obtained for drip irrigation with a seasonal depth close to 300 mm also ertek et al 2004 reported zucchini squash yields from 22 4 44 7 mg ha 1 in turkey finding a positive linear relation between irrigation water plant water consumption fruit traits and yield zotarelli et al 2008 further presented marketable yields from 20 to 43 mg ha 1 for zucchini squash grown in florida usa however drip t1 yields were still below those reported by paris et al 1986 for goldy courgette curcubita pepo l cv goldy who obtained for the same plant density marketable yields from 43 5 51 3 mg ha 1 in two outdoor locations on the other hand drip t1 yields were much higher than those reported by al omran et al 2005 for saudi arabia 9 90 28 30 mg ha 1 as well as by el mageed and semida 2015 for cairo egypt 7 5 14 0 mg ha 1 in both these locations growth conditions were affected by salinity the furrow t0 treatment returned the lowest marketable yields with the average of 18 5 mg ha 1 range from 11 7 21 3 mg ha 1 approaching the national average 17 mg ha 1 in syria cbs 2017 drip t2 resulted in slightly higher yields than in furrow t0 with the average reaching 24 5 mg ha 1 range from 16 1 32 4 mg ha 1 the explanation for the lower yields in these two experimental treatments should be associated with the substantial percolation amounts estimated by simdualkc during the four growing seasons fig 6 the percolated water likely ended up promoting leaching of nutrients from the root zone layers reducing their availability when compared with the drip t1 treatment for example ramos et al 2012 found that the movement of nitrogen n out of the root zone in irrigated sorghum was dependent on the amount of water flowing through the root zone the amount of n applied the form of n in the fertilizer and the timing and number of fertigation events the same considerations should be assumed here an alternative explanation could be associated with the higher irrigation amounts applied in these two treatments with too much water aggravating root and stem rot diseases richard et al 2002 reducing courgette yields the water productivity of the water used wpwu given by the ratio between yield and the total water applied pereira et al 2012 reached the highest values also in drip t1 which range was from 5 5 kg m 3 in 2014 to 9 6 kg m 3 in 2013 table 8 when considering only the water productivity of irrigation water wpirrig given by the ratio between yield and the irrigation water applied pereira et al 2012 the values were slightly higher than the previous ones ranging now from 7 5 kg m 3 in 2014 to 14 1 kg m 3 in 2013 these values were comparable to amer 2011 whose wpirrig value reached 14 6 kg m 3 and to ertek et al 2004 whose wpirri values ranged from 7 8 9 8 kg m 3 similar conclusions were extracted for wpet and wpt once again furrow t0 led to the lowest wpwu wpirrig wpet and wpt values with these varying from 1 9 to 3 0 kg m 3 2 3 to 3 8 kg m 3 4 2 to 6 7 kg m 3 and 4 9 to 8 1 kg m 3 respectively table 8 likewise drip t2 indicators were quite low when compared with those in drip t1 these lower values can only be compared to al omran et al 2005 and el mageed and semida 2015 despite obtained under saline conditions 1 37 3 64 kg m 3 also zotarelli et al 2008 reported a wide variation of wpwu values going from 4 3 57 kg m 3 due to irrigation treatments schedules and depths applied that varied from 66 to 482 mm of water applied in the studied area the wpwu values were thus much affected by the irrigation regime with percolated water contributing substantially to such low values optimizing irrigation schedules seems thus essential for improving irrigation water efficiency in the syrian akkar plain minimizing losses while fulfilling crop water requirements drip t1 applied 38 1 56 6 less water than furrow t0 allowing a higher irrigation frequency that made possible lower irrigation depths per event the amount of percolation water was then reduced substantially possibly minimizing also leaching and returning higher yields and higher wpwu wpirrig wpet and wpt values economically drip t1 was also more benefic with the economical water productivity ewp values here computed as the ratio between yield value and total water applied pereira et al 2012 varying from 1 9 to 3 3 m 3 table 8 for the furrow irrigation treatment ewp values only reached 0 7 1 0 m 3 depending on the growing season nonetheless this indicator cannot be considered here in absolute terms given the current fluctuation of prices with the ongoing war in syria likewise the economic water productivity ratio ewpr here computed as the ratio between yield value and water cost pereira et al 2012 was higher for drip t1 48 0 90 0 than in all other treatments table 8 showing the profitability of zucchini squash production in the syrian akkar plain region these values were also much higher than those found for other strategic crops like wheat and cotton grown in semi arid regions in syria which ewpr values were estimated to be 2 7 and 2 2 respectively darouich et al 2014 2017 4 conclusions the akkar plain in the syrian coastal area offers great potential for intensive vegetable production agricultural policies implemented in the region have been aimed at improving irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency through the rationalization of irrigation and fertilization practices and modernization of irrigation systems and methods the conversion of traditional surface systems to drip irrigation has been one of the main objectives of those policies as the latter system is usually considered as the most effective way to convey directly water and nutrients to plants saving important amounts of water and increasing yields the modernization of irrigation methods in the syrian akkar plain has provided the context for this research which demonstrated the usefulness of the simdualkc model in computing zucchini squash irrigation needs and comparing different management practices irrigation methods and scheduling during four growing seasons the model was able to simulate soil water contents in different experimental plots with the level of agreement between measured and simulated data returning rmse values lower than 0 002 m3 m 3 and nse values from 0 166 to 0 732 nsemean 0 573 the drip t1 treatment through the application of small irrigation depths with a relatively high frequency was able to maintain soil water contents high while reducing percolation losses on the other hand the furrow t0 treatment reproducing the traditional irrigation scheme led to substantial percolation losses and reduced yields different water productivity indices were also computed with all highlighting the advantages of drip t1 compared to furrow nevertheless the importance of an adequate system management was also demonstrated with the drip t2 treatment which promoted also substantial percolation losses leading to similar results as furrow t0 hence this study further showed that those agricultural policies aiming at converting traditional surface systems to modern drip irrigation methods need to be supported by proper agronomist services capable of advising farmers in that transition at risk of producing no effect on water savings this study further presents kcb values for the initial mid season and end season stages of zucchini squash that should be considered when computing crop irrigation needs in the syrian akkar plain this is fundamental for the sustainability of vegetable production in the region for improving land productivity and irrigation water use efficiency and for minimizing the environmental problems typically associated with irrigation of intensive production

10763,the coastal area of the syrian akkar region is particularly suitable for intensive vegetable production and zucchini squash curcubita pepo l is one of the most profitable crops grown there local agricultural policies have been especially concerned at improving irrigation water management in the region by rationalizing water and nutrient use modernizing irrigation methods and minimizing the associated environmental risks the objective of this study was to compute the soil water balance in zucchini squash plots irrigated with furrow and drip methods using the simdualkc model during four growing seasons 2012 2015 the furrow plots treatment t0 represented the traditional irrigation practices in the study area while the drip plots treatments t1 and t2 followed alternative irrigation schemes the simdualkc model was able to simulate soil water contents measured in the field plots returning root mean square error values lower than 0 002 m3 m 3 and modelling efficiencies ranging from 0 166 to 0 732 the basal non stressed crop coefficients kcb varied from 0 18 to 0 22 0 85 to 0 98 and 0 56 to 0 71 during the initial mid season and end season stages respectively with the actual values kcb act often matching the potential ones the evaporation coefficients ke varied according to irrigation schedules and methods during the early crop stages but were minimized with full canopy development drip t1 presented always the highest water productivity wp indicators due to the higher frequency of irrigation events with less water applied per event in contrast furrow t0 resulted in substantial percolation losses which affected yields and wp hence model results evidenced the benefits of precise irrigation for zucchini squash production in the syrian akkar region further enhancing the need for sustainable water management practices in local production systems keywords evapotranspiration simdualkc soil water balance water productivity 1 introduction the cultivated land in the fertile syrian coastal area has been steadily expanding over the years due to several irrigation projects that improved water availability in the region chard 1981 amery 2002 irrigation now covers 29 65 500 ha of the cultivated coastal land 226 000 ha 3 7 of the syrian cultivated land with surface systems being traditionally adopted cbs 2017 while these systems can be regarded as very efficient if land is precisely levelled and water is applied uniformly pereira et al 2002 darouich et al 2014 the characteristics of small size local farming systems 1 3 ha in average have limited its correct management resulting in low water use efficiencies as a result modern methods such as drip irrigation have been slowly replacing the traditional systems covering now close to 43 29 000 ha of the irrigated area cbs 2017 drip irrigation methods by delivering small and precise water amounts with relative high frequency are especially suited to field and greenhouse grown vegetables which together with citrus are the main intensive irrigated farming systems in the syrian coastal area wattenbach 2006 the most prominent and profitable vegetables are tomato solanum lycopersicum l cucumber cucumis sativus l squash cucurbita pepo l and eggplant solanum melongena l however the estimated production area is associated with a certain uncertainly as these plants are often included in double cropping systems or partial cultivated under young new tree orchards despite the small size of local farming systems vegetables production contributes to the high share of very profitable crops grown in the region taking advantage of market opportunities with the proximity of highly dense urban areas as well as very favorable environmental and climate conditions the major production risks are associated with the price return of perishable crops wattenbach 2006 while the greatest environmental risks are the over fertilization of crops and consequent pollution of groundwater supplies with high concentrations of nitrate halwani et al 1999 abou zakhem and hafez 2007 kattaa et al 2010 improving land and water productivity in the syrian coastal agricultural area have thus become a top priority for the environmental protection of groundwater and downstream water bodies abou zakhem and hafez 2007 kattaa et al 2010 thomas et al 2003 several measures were implemented in the region as well as in other agricultural areas in syria with the aim of rationalizing agricultural water use improving irrigation systems performance increasing farmers income modernizing irrigation methods and techniques e g by converting the traditional surface systems to drip and improving fertigation techniques varela ortega and sagardoy 2003 darouich et al 2012 fader et al 2016 mourad and alshihabi 2016 abou zakhem et al 2019 this means that crop water requirements need to be properly assessed as well as the most suitable irrigation schedules irrigation timing length and quantity need to be accurately defined for improving irrigation water use maximizing yields and minimizing the associated environmental risks modeling can play here a fundamental role in complying with such objectives calibrated crop water simulation models are now seen as suitable tools for computing crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling raes 2002 pereira et al 2003 domínguez et al 2011 rosa et al 2012a vanuytrecht et al 2014 most of these models adopt the fao56 single crop coefficient kc approach allen et al 1998 which provides acceptable estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc rates on the other hand the fao56 dual kc approach which is less applied allows for the separate estimation of crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates through the partitioning of etc allen et al 1998 this approach is also usually considered more precise when estimating irrigation needs on a daily basis particularly when dealing with the impacts of soil wetting by rain or irrigation in a partially covered soil or when high frequency events take place allen et al 2005 the dual kc approach has been implemented in the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a which considers also crop density height ground cover irrigation methods and scheduling and management active ground cover mulching intercropping factors that may further affect etc the model has been applied with success for wheat maize tomato pepper and soybean in northern china zhao et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 2018 wei et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 maize in southern brazil martins et al 2013 wheat in northern syria rosa et al 2012b cotton in uzbekistan rosa et al 2012b potato in southern italy paredes et al 2018 and maize peach and olive in southern portugal paço et al 2012 2019 rosa et al 2016 as a result the simdualkc model may well constitute an important reference tool for improving irrigation water management in vegetable crops grown in the syrian coastal area however model applications focused on vegetable production have been quite limited so far and additional research is required hence the objectives of this study are i to simulate soil water contents in zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l plots irrigated with furrow and drip methods using the simdualkc model during four growing seasons 2012 2015 ii to estimate the daily etc rates and respective crop coefficients for zucchini squash grown in the akkar plain syria using the dual kc approach and iii to analyze the soil water balance from a water saving and economic perspective results of this study will help to improve irrigation water use efficiency in the syrian agricultural coastal area contributing to a better assessment of vegetables irrigation needs in the region 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 site description the field experiment was carried out at the zahid research center 34 41 37 n 35 59 16 e 12 m a s l in the western part of the akkar plain tartus governorate syria from april 2012 to june 2015 fig 1 the akkar plain is located on a narrow coastal area of fertile land between the cities of trípoli lebanon and tartus syria several rivers cross the region including the al abrash river limiting the territory to the north the al janoubi river and its tributaries kalife and abo falat along the syrian lebanon border the bared river limiting the territory to the south and the ostouene river situated in between the previous two rivers thomas et al 2003 several wells provide for additional water resources which are used for irrigation of 6400 ha of agricultural land in latakia and 11 700 ha in tartus cbs 2017 the groundwater table depth varies between 10 and 20 m abou zakhem and hafez 2007 the climate in the region is classified as hot summer mediterranean climate csa the mean annual surface air temperature is 19 3 c with the mean daily temperatures at the coolest january and warmest august months reaching 11 5 and 27 0 c respectively the mean annual precipitation is 930 mm occurring mostly

rainfall p mm the soil in the study area was classified as a vertisol iuss working group 2014 with the main soil physical and chemical properties presented in table 1 2 1 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment involved irrigation of zucchini squash cucurbita pepo l cv magda hybrid squash with different methods furrow and drip and schedules during four growing seasons 2012 2015 the experimental area 35 m 20 5 m was relatively flat with 0 005 and 0 002 slope in the west and south directions respectively a randomized complete block design was established with three treatments furrow t0 drip t1 drip t2 and four replicates per treatment fig 3 each plot size replicate was 2 25 m 15 m and included three cultivated rows with 0 75 m spacing between rows and 0 40 m between plants about 33 333 plants ha 1 non irrigated areas distanced each plot by 1 m the irrigation period lasted from plant transplantation to harvest table 2 the water was conveyed from a well to the field by a pvc mainline and distributed to three polyethylene manifold pipes fig 3 a drainage network was set at 1 25 1 75 m depth with drain pipes distancing 15 25 m the furrow t0 treatment represented the traditional irrigation scheme followed by farmers in the region the furrow basin 3 furrows per replicate distanced 0 75 m between each other was supplied by one pipe with a discharge of approximately 5 m3 h 1 irrigation was applied with an elapsed time of 0 5 h i e the average time for water to reach the end of the furrow basin table 3 presents the furrow irrigation amounts which were applied every 6 30 days depending on weather conditions the drip t1 and t2 treatments considered different schedules irrigation in drip t1 aimed to fulfil crop water needs and maximize water productivity indicators section 2 3 irrigation in drip t2 aimed to produce percolation losses by exceeding the available soil water storage capacity irrigation depth and frequency constituted thus the major variables between treatments these plots included 3 laterals placed along the 3 plant rows in line drippers were spaced 0 5 m with a discharge rate of 8 l h 1 at 100 kpa irrigation in drip t1 was triggered when soil water depletion reached 25 42 of the readily available water raw depending on the crop stage water was then applied to fulfill 25 and 50 of raw for the initial and remaining crop stages respectively thus drip t1 irrigation registered a relatively high frequency 3 6 days and small irrigation depths per event 11 18 mm table 3 irrigation in drip t2 was triggered when soil water depletion reached 34 65 of raw also depending on the crop stage water was applied to fulfill 70 and 120 of raw for the initial and remaining crop stages respectively so irrigation frequency in drip t2 was slightly lower 5 12 days than in the previous treatment with higher amounts applied per event 27 45 mm table 3 every year the zucchini squash which variety is also referred to as cousa squash was planted in a nursery between january 10th and 20th and then transplanted to the experimental site in march the dates of the crop growth stages in each season are documented in table 2 manure 30 mg ha 1 was applied once before plantation besides that fertilization was applied in three batches along the growing season with n p and k units summing 120 60 and 90 kg ha 1 weed control was performed manually soil water contents were measured using a neutron probe with access tubes installed in the middle of the second row of each plot in the four replicates until a depth of 0 45 m crop height h and mean diameter were also monitored using a tape during each stage of the different growing seasons the fraction of ground cover fc was then estimated from the crop s mean diameter assuming a round shape of the plant s canopy and plant s spacing fruit were collected in all replicates at the end of each growing season and the fresh weight was recorded 2 2 modeling approach 2 2 1 model description the simdualkc model rosa et al 2012a computes the soil water balance at the plot scale on a daily basis as follows 1 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t c a c t i d p i in which dr is the root zone depletion mm p is the rainfall mm ro is the runoff mm i is the net irrigation depth mm cr is the capillary rise from the groundwater table mm etc act is the actual crop evapotranspiration mm and dp is the deep percolation from the root zone mm all referring to day i or day i 1 crop evapotranspiration is computed according to the fao56 dual kc approach allen et al 1998 2005 thus estimating separately the components related to crop transpiration tc mm and soil evaporation es mm 2 t c k c b e t o 3 e s k e e t o where kcb is the potential basal crop coefficient ke is the evaporation coefficient and eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm actual transpiration values tc act mm are obtained by introducing a dimensionless stress coefficient ks into eq 2 to account for the effect of soil water depletion on tc values 4 t c a c t k s t c k s k c b e t o k c b a c t e t o where kcb act is the actual basal crop coefficient and ks with varying values from 0 to 1 is defined as follows 5 k s t a w d r i t a w r a w in which taw and raw are respectively the total and readily available soil water relative to the rooting depth mm these are given by 6 t a w 1000 z r θ f c θ w p 7 r a w p t a w where θfc and θwp are the soil water contents at field capacity and the wilting point m3 m 3 respectively zr is the root depth m and p is the depletion fraction for no stress when soil depletion exceeds the depletion fraction for no stress i e the soil water content drops below raw tc values are reduced due to water stress ks 1 0 otherwise ks 1 0 and no water stress occurs additionally the model internally corrects the kcb values to local climatic conditions when the minimum relative humidity rhmin differs from 45 and or when the average wind speed differs from 2 m s 1 allen et al 1998 the kcb values are further adjusted to crop characteristics density and height using a density coefficient kd which accounts for the increase in kcb with the increase in the amount of vegetation allen and pereira 2009 soil evaporation is limited by the amount of energy available at the soil surface in conjunction with the energy consumed by transpiration and by water availability in the surface soil layer allen et al 1998 2005 es is thus maximum during the early crop stages when the topsoil is wetted by rain or irrigation and energy is largely available at the soil surface contrarily es is minimum when the crop fully shadows the soil limiting the energy available for evaporation and or when the surface soil layer is dry accordingly the evaporation coefficient ke in eq 3 is computed as follows allen et al 2005 8 k e k r k c m a x k c b m i n f e w k c m a x in which kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient with varying values from 0 to 1 kc max is the maximum value of kc i e kcb ke following a rain or irrigation event and few is the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to radiation and wetted by rain or irrigation the kr is calculated using the two stage drying cycle approach where the first stage is the energy limited stage and the second is the water limited stage ritchie 1972 allen et al 1998 2005 9 k r 1 for d e i 1 rew 10 k r tew d e i 1 tew rew for d e i l rew where tew is the maximum depth of water that can be evaporated from the evaporation soil layer when it has been completely wetted mm rew is the depth of water that can be easily evaporated without water availability restrictions mm and de is the evaporation layer depletion at the end of day i 1 mm de is computed through a daily water balance of the evaporation soil layer with the evaporation decreasing as the evaporable soil water decreases in the evaporation soil layer beyond rew finally for the remaining parameters in eq 1 dp is computed using the parametric time decay function proposed by liu et al 2006 which relates the soil water storage above field capacity with the draining time until θfc is reached 11 w a a d t b d where wa is the actual soil water storage in the root zone mm ad is the soil water storage comprised between saturation and field capacity mm bd is an empirical dimensionless parameter and t is the time after an irrigation or rain that produces a storage above field capacity days ro is estimated using the curve number approach proposed by the usda scs 1972 cr is not considered in this study as the experimental area was limited downwards by a drainage system 2 2 2 model setup the following data were used as inputs to the simdualkc model i daily values of tmin and tmax ºc u2 m s 1 rhmin isun h and p mm measured in a local weather station

drip and fw 1 00 for furrow irrigation 2 2 3 model calibration and validation the simdualkc model was calibrated during the 2012 growing season and validated during the following years 2013 2015 calibrated procedures consisted of adjusting model parameters one at a time until deviations between measured and simulated soil water contents were minimized pereira et al 2015 a trial and error procedure was adopted the default kcb and p values relative to the initial mid season and end season crop stages were first adjusted then the deep percolation parameters ad and bd were modified finally the kcb and p values relative to the different crop stages were again adjusted until errors were minimized the soil evaporation parameters were found to provide reasonable results and were not modified the model performance was evaluated using various goodness of fit indicators including the regression coefficient b0 the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the ratio of the rmse to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse the percent bias of estimation pbias and the modeling efficiency nse respectively given as loague and green 1991 legates and mccabe

is the number of observations b0 values close to 1 indicate that the predicted values are statistically close to the observed ones r2 values close to 1 indicate that the model explains well the variance of observations rmse and nrmse values close to zero indicate small estimation errors and good model predictions legates and mccabe 1999 pbias values close to zero indicate that model simulations are accurate while positive or negative values indicate under or over estimation bias respectively nse values close to 1 indicate that the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance hence the model predictions are good on the contrary if nse is less than zero the model predicted values are worse than simply using the observed mean nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 3 water productivity indicators the experimental results were further assessed using the water productivity indicators described in pereira et al 2009 2012 these include the water productivity relative to the total water used wpwu kg m 3 the irrigation water applied wpirrig kg m 3 the consumptive use wpet kg m 3 and transpiration wpt kg m 3 respectively given as 18 w p w u y a t w u 19 w p i r r i g y a i w u 20 w p e t y a e t c a c t 21 w p t y a t c a c t where ya is the actual measured yield kg ha 1 twu is the total water used given by the sum of effective p i and the variation of the soil water storage δsw m3 ha 1 iwu is the irrigation water use given by i m3 ha 1 etc act is the estimated actual evapotranspiration m3 ha 1 and tc act is again the estimated actual crop transpiration m3 ha 1 the economic water productivity ewp m 3 and the economic water productivity ratio ewpr were also computed as follows pereira et al 2009 2012 22 e w p v a l u e y a t w u 23 e w p r v a l u e y a c o s t t w u where value ya is the value of the achieved yield and cost twu is the cost of the irrigation water the ewpr shows the impacts of water prices on the economic return of irrigation the yield value was here set to 0 35 kg 1 maar 2017 corresponding to an inflation of the 2010 price multiplied by 10 as a result of speculation with the ongoing war in syria the price of the irrigation water was set to 0 055 m 3 maar 2017 increasing only 2 5 times as the product is supported supplied by the government 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil water contents fig 4 shows the daily averages of the soil water contents measured in the root zone layer of each experimental treatment during the 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons and compares these values with the simdualkc simulations irrigation events and amounts are also given in the same figure the furrow t0 treatment registered less irrigation events 6 10 events and larger irrigation depths 74 mm per event table 3 measured and simulated soil water content values showed there the largest variations amongst treatments reaching values close to saturation immediately after irrigation events and then decreasing to values below field capacity due to water redistribution soil evaporation and crop transpiration drip t1 exhibited a contrasting behavior with measured and simulated soil water contents remaining close to field capacity due to the higher irrigation frequency 15 21 events and lower depths 11 18 mm applied per event table 3 finally measured and simulated soil water contents in drip t2 were in between the previous values due to the adopted irrigation schedule table 3 the simdualkc model was able to reproduce field measurements reasonably well during the 2012 growing season table 5 returning higher r2 values for drip t1 and t2 r2 0 542 0 669 than for furrow t0 r2 0 335 the error of the estimate was quite small resulting in rmse values lower than 0 002 mm for all treatments however the nrmse value revealed the lower accuracy of model simulations for furrow t0 nrmse 25 1 both the b0 and pbias values indicated a small under prediction of observations by the model in furrow t0 and drip t1 while observations were slightly overpredicted in drip t2 finally the nse value was found to be again lower for furrow t0 nse 0 166 and higher for drip t2 nse 0 662 the parameters calibrated during the 2012 growing season table 4 were validated during the following years 2013 2015 with the goodness of fit indicators generally improving when compared with the earlier year table 5 the r2 values varied from 0 554 to 0 810 which confirmed that the model could explain most of the variability of the observed data in the different treatments the error of the estimate was again quite small with the rmse values matching those obtained during calibration but this time also the normalized indicator nrmse resulted in values always lower than 13 3 the b0 and pbias values showed a tendency for the predicted values to be very close to observations with small exceptions e g drip t2 during the 2013 growing season also the nse values resulted in relatively high values ranging from 0 467 to 0 732 which indicate that the residual variance was much smaller than the measured data variance overall the general good agreement between simulated and measured data during the four seasons indicated that the model input parameters in table 4 were adequately fitted for simulating soil water dynamics in all experimental fields yet some exceptions were noticed with the nse values remaining lower than 0 6 in furrow t0 during the 2012 and 2013 seasons drip t1 during 2012 and 2014 and drip t2 during 2015 table 5 ramos et al 2012 discussed possible sources of error for explaining the deviations between measured and simulated soil water contents found in their study which included field measurement model inputs and model structure errors some of those causes can here also be considered namely those related to the quality of the measurement dataset particularly the representativeness of spatially averaged soil water contents measured over a certain soil volume with the neutron probe for describing the distribution of water under highly spatially non uniform irrigation systems drip and furrow the depth at which those measurements were taken likely misrepresenting smaller irrigation events such as in drip t1 and the number of measurements taken per growing season with smaller datasets e g 2012 possibly emphasizing the weight of existing outliers nonetheless most of the goodness of fit indicators were within the range of values reported in other successful simdualkc applications for vegetables zhang et al 2018 patil and tiwari 2019 as well as other crops zhao et al 2013 wu et al 2015 rosa et al 2016 paredes et al 2018 thus confirming the reliability of model simulations 3 2 potential and actual crop coefficients fig 5 presents the seasonal variation of the potential non stressed basal crop coefficients kcb the actual basal crop coefficients kcb act the soil evaporation coefficients ke and the actual crop coefficients kc act kcb act ke computed by simdualkc for zucchini squash during the 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons also included are the rainfall and irrigation events the kcb values for the different crop stages were first defined as in table 4 and then further adjusted to local weather conditions crop density and crop height following allen and pereira 2009 during the 2012 growing season the kcb values for the initial mid season and end season crop stages were set to 0 18 0 85 and 0 60 respectively during the following years the kcb values presented small variations due to climate variability but also to the dates of the crop stages that varied along the different seasons table 2 during the 2013 season the kcb values reached 0 18 0 89 and 0 68 during the initial mid season and end season crop stages respectively in 2014 those values matched 0 22 0 94 and 0 56 while in 2015 the corresponding values were 0 18 0 98 and 0 71 as such the kcb values found for zucchini squash grown in the syrian akkar plain were in accordance with allen et al 1998 who provided reference values of 0 15 0 90 and 0 70 for the same crop stages the kcb act values reflected some water stress along the growing seasons with a departure from the potential kcb values being noticed during 2012 2013 and 2014 for furrow t0 and during 2012 for drip t1 fig 5 in furrow t0 the longest water stress period was registered during the mid season stage of 2013 with the kcb values being reduced several times to a minimum of 0 54 equaling again the potential values with the increase of soil water contents after the following irrigation or rain events the ke values showed a decreasing trend from sowing to the beginning of the mid season stage fig 5 reaching then values close to zero with full canopy development when less energy was available at the soil surface for evaporation nonetheless the ke values were subjected to large variability dictated by the occurrence of rainfall or irrigation events this was particularly notorious during the 2012 growing season when the mid season stage was reached at a later date compared with other seasons finally the kc act curve naturally described the same trends observed for kcb act and ke yet fig 5 clearly shows that the drop of ke values during the crop development stages were somehow compensated by the increase of the kcb act values maintaining thus the kc act values relatively high note that the kc act curve for the syrian akkar plain found some correspondence with the one presented by mohammad 2004 for summer squash grown in irbid jordan this author reported kc values of 0 71 and 0 60 for the mid season and end season stages respectively which were lower than the ones found in this study but comparable nevertheless however for the initial season stage the kc value reported there kc 0 24 was considerably lower approaching only the kcb values found in this study i e without considering the evaporation component likewise amer 2011 reported kc act values for summer squash grown in menofia egypt which were close to the ones found in this study this authors reported kc act values ranging from 0 42 0 44 and 0 69 0 71 for drip and furrow irrigation during the initial crop stage respectively during the mid season stage the corresponding values increased to 1 01 1 03 and 1 06 1 10 falling then to 0 61 0 66 and 0 65 0 71 during the end season stage on the other hand rouphael and colla 2005 referred higher kc values ranging from 0 10 to 1 15 but for summer squash grown in greenhouse conditions in viterbo italy 3 3 soil water balance table 6 presents the soil water balance computed by simdualkc for zucchini squash grown in different experimental treatments during the 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 growing seasons tc values varied from 193 to 281 mm the lowest value was obtained in 2012 when the crop cycle lasted only 61 days table 2 during the following seasons tc values were more equal 239 281 mm as well as the duration of the crop cycles 81 93 days approaching also the values reported by amer 2011 tp from 312 to 373 mm for a crop cycle of 93 days in menofia egypt as the zucchini squash rooting depth is relatively shallow 0 45 m irrigation schedules were always defined to maintain soil water contents at high levels and avoid the detrimental effects of water deficit on crop yields and fruit quality number diameter length and shape of fruits richard et al 2002 ertek et al 2004 nonetheless as described above the kcb act values occasionally departed from the potential values in furrow t0 and drip t1 when soil water depletion increased above raw however water stress levels were never very extensive and for that reason tc act values were only reduced up to 4 when compared with potential values on the other hand maintaining soil water contents at high levels resulted in considerable losses of water through deep percolation table 6 in furrow t0 dp cumulative values ranged from 287 mm to 551 mm i e 50 64 of the total water applied by both irrigation and rainfall however as shown in fig 6 most of the percolated water 78 92 was actually originated from irrigation for 2013 2015 since in 2012 no noticeable rainfall events occurred these results showed the inefficiency of the irrigation schedule representing the traditional furrow scheme used in the syrian akkar plain resulting also in substantial yield losses see section 3 4 drip t2 also produced very high dp cumulative values ranging from 190 to 412 mm i e 1 0 1 5 times higher than the corresponding tc values here most of the percolated water was again from irrigation 58 86 these results thus show that despite the introduction of a more modern irrigation method water losses can still be substantial if the system is poorly managed darouich et al 2014 finally drip t1 resulted in lower dp cumulative values 60 mm 141 mm due to the higher frequency of irrigation events and lower depths applied per event contrarily to the previous treatments most of percolated values were found after rainfall events with water losses from irrigation totalizing only 29 48 of the total dp values fig 6 in all experimental treatments cumulative values of soil evaporation were relatively low summing less than 45 mm per season this was mainly due to the short duration of crop seasons less than 3 months and the relatively fast and total coverage fc 0 99 of the soil surface by the plant canopy which limited the available energy for evaporation 3 4 yields and water productivity indicators table 7 presents the anova table with the analysis of variance for the effects of the different treatments and growing seasons on zucchini squash yields statistics showed a significant difference in the average between treatments and between years while for the interaction between both factors only a significant value was recorded at the 99 level of confidence this indicated that yield responded to the irrigation treatments as well as to season variability as demonstrated by the statistical analysis yields varied significantly between treatments with drip t1 always returning the highest marketable yields in this treatment zucchini squash yields averaged 31 4 mg ha 1 ranging from 20 6 mg ha 1 in 2014 to 38 9 mg ha 1 in 2013 table 8 amer 2011 reported comparable yields for menofia egypt with yields 25 0 to 45 7 mg ha 1 depending on the seasonal irrigation depth and irrigation method there the highest yields were obtained for drip irrigation with a seasonal depth close to 300 mm also ertek et al 2004 reported zucchini squash yields from 22 4 44 7 mg ha 1 in turkey finding a positive linear relation between irrigation water plant water consumption fruit traits and yield zotarelli et al 2008 further presented marketable yields from 20 to 43 mg ha 1 for zucchini squash grown in florida usa however drip t1 yields were still below those reported by paris et al 1986 for goldy courgette curcubita pepo l cv goldy who obtained for the same plant density marketable yields from 43 5 51 3 mg ha 1 in two outdoor locations on the other hand drip t1 yields were much higher than those reported by al omran et al 2005 for saudi arabia 9 90 28 30 mg ha 1 as well as by el mageed and semida 2015 for cairo egypt 7 5 14 0 mg ha 1 in both these locations growth conditions were affected by salinity the furrow t0 treatment returned the lowest marketable yields with the average of 18 5 mg ha 1 range from 11 7 21 3 mg ha 1 approaching the national average 17 mg ha 1 in syria cbs 2017 drip t2 resulted in slightly higher yields than in furrow t0 with the average reaching 24 5 mg ha 1 range from 16 1 32 4 mg ha 1 the explanation for the lower yields in these two experimental treatments should be associated with the substantial percolation amounts estimated by simdualkc during the four growing seasons fig 6 the percolated water likely ended up promoting leaching of nutrients from the root zone layers reducing their availability when compared with the drip t1 treatment for example ramos et al 2012 found that the movement of nitrogen n out of the root zone in irrigated sorghum was dependent on the amount of water flowing through the root zone the amount of n applied the form of n in the fertilizer and the timing and number of fertigation events the same considerations should be assumed here an alternative explanation could be associated with the higher irrigation amounts applied in these two treatments with too much water aggravating root and stem rot diseases richard et al 2002 reducing courgette yields the water productivity of the water used wpwu given by the ratio between yield and the total water applied pereira et al 2012 reached the highest values also in drip t1 which range was from 5 5 kg m 3 in 2014 to 9 6 kg m 3 in 2013 table 8 when considering only the water productivity of irrigation water wpirrig given by the ratio between yield and the irrigation water applied pereira et al 2012 the values were slightly higher than the previous ones ranging now from 7 5 kg m 3 in 2014 to 14 1 kg m 3 in 2013 these values were comparable to amer 2011 whose wpirrig value reached 14 6 kg m 3 and to ertek et al 2004 whose wpirri values ranged from 7 8 9 8 kg m 3 similar conclusions were extracted for wpet and wpt once again furrow t0 led to the lowest wpwu wpirrig wpet and wpt values with these varying from 1 9 to 3 0 kg m 3 2 3 to 3 8 kg m 3 4 2 to 6 7 kg m 3 and 4 9 to 8 1 kg m 3 respectively table 8 likewise drip t2 indicators were quite low when compared with those in drip t1 these lower values can only be compared to al omran et al 2005 and el mageed and semida 2015 despite obtained under saline conditions 1 37 3 64 kg m 3 also zotarelli et al 2008 reported a wide variation of wpwu values going from 4 3 57 kg m 3 due to irrigation treatments schedules and depths applied that varied from 66 to 482 mm of water applied in the studied area the wpwu values were thus much affected by the irrigation regime with percolated water contributing substantially to such low values optimizing irrigation schedules seems thus essential for improving irrigation water efficiency in the syrian akkar plain minimizing losses while fulfilling crop water requirements drip t1 applied 38 1 56 6 less water than furrow t0 allowing a higher irrigation frequency that made possible lower irrigation depths per event the amount of percolation water was then reduced substantially possibly minimizing also leaching and returning higher yields and higher wpwu wpirrig wpet and wpt values economically drip t1 was also more benefic with the economical water productivity ewp values here computed as the ratio between yield value and total water applied pereira et al 2012 varying from 1 9 to 3 3 m 3 table 8 for the furrow irrigation treatment ewp values only reached 0 7 1 0 m 3 depending on the growing season nonetheless this indicator cannot be considered here in absolute terms given the current fluctuation of prices with the ongoing war in syria likewise the economic water productivity ratio ewpr here computed as the ratio between yield value and water cost pereira et al 2012 was higher for drip t1 48 0 90 0 than in all other treatments table 8 showing the profitability of zucchini squash production in the syrian akkar plain region these values were also much higher than those found for other strategic crops like wheat and cotton grown in semi arid regions in syria which ewpr values were estimated to be 2 7 and 2 2 respectively darouich et al 2014 2017 4 conclusions the akkar plain in the syrian coastal area offers great potential for intensive vegetable production agricultural policies implemented in the region have been aimed at improving irrigation water and nutrient use efficiency through the rationalization of irrigation and fertilization practices and modernization of irrigation systems and methods the conversion of traditional surface systems to drip irrigation has been one of the main objectives of those policies as the latter system is usually considered as the most effective way to convey directly water and nutrients to plants saving important amounts of water and increasing yields the modernization of irrigation methods in the syrian akkar plain has provided the context for this research which demonstrated the usefulness of the simdualkc model in computing zucchini squash irrigation needs and comparing different management practices irrigation methods and scheduling during four growing seasons the model was able to simulate soil water contents in different experimental plots with the level of agreement between measured and simulated data returning rmse values lower than 0 002 m3 m 3 and nse values from 0 166 to 0 732 nsemean 0 573 the drip t1 treatment through the application of small irrigation depths with a relatively high frequency was able to maintain soil water contents high while reducing percolation losses on the other hand the furrow t0 treatment reproducing the traditional irrigation scheme led to substantial percolation losses and reduced yields different water productivity indices were also computed with all highlighting the advantages of drip t1 compared to furrow nevertheless the importance of an adequate system management was also demonstrated with the drip t2 treatment which promoted also substantial percolation losses leading to similar results as furrow t0 hence this study further showed that those agricultural policies aiming at converting traditional surface systems to modern drip irrigation methods need to be supported by proper agronomist services capable of advising farmers in that transition at risk of producing no effect on water savings this study further presents kcb values for the initial mid season and end season stages of zucchini squash that should be considered when computing crop irrigation needs in the syrian akkar plain this is fundamental for the sustainability of vegetable production in the region for improving land productivity and irrigation water use efficiency and for minimizing the environmental problems typically associated with irrigation of intensive production

10764,in this study the effectiveness of a bivariate analysis of agricultural drought characteristics for irrigation planning was evaluated the case study was conducted in locations in central italy and was based on olive crops which are widely grown in that area under rainfed or deficit irrigation regimes for each locality the available time series of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were used to simulate the daily soil water dynamics swt for olive crops the simulation was performed assuming 10 irrigation strategies different for both the volume and date of the interventions by applying the theory of runs to swt with a threshold corresponding to the readily available water the agricultural drought events in the time series were identified and characterised by their duration d days and severity s i e the cumulative evapotranspiration deficit in mm for each locality and strategy a 2 parameter gamma distribution was fitted to both d and s whilst their dependence structure was modelled by a gumbel copula the evaluation of the best irrigation strategy in each locality was obtained by comparing the contour lines of the pairs d s having a 10 year return period for the condition d d and s s results showed a great influence of both climate and irrigation strategy on the joint distribution of d and s some strategies despite a very similar behaviour in the severity differed a lot in terms of the associated values of duration thus denoting different dynamics of water stress more or less intense among the single irrigation strategies the optimal one was usually represented by an application at the end of june among the double irrigation strategies the optimal one involved two interventions one at the end of june and one at the end of july these results were also discussed taking into account the corresponding probability of consecutive severe drought events keywords risk of water deficit copula joint return periods transition probabilities deficit irrigation olive crops 1 introduction drought risk analysis makes an important contribution to water resource planning and management in a given region however as with many other natural hazards drought has a typical multivariate nature tsakiris et al 2016 i e it is characterised by the contemporary presence of multiple characteristics correlated with each other e g duration severity areal extension and peak in this situation a traditional univariate risk analysis based on the frequency or probability distribution of single characteristics may lead to misleading inadequate or incomplete interpretations of the phenomenon chen et al 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 the probabilistic joint analysis of two or more correlated random variables can be effectively carried out by the copula functions nelsen 1999 which have been widely applied in the last decade in economical and hydrological contexts copulas are functions that join univariate probability distributions to form multivariate probability distributions enabling modelling of the dependence structure among random variables independently of their univariate distributions joe 1997 applications of copulas to improve meteorological drought modelling or to explore changes in its characteristics are common in the scientific literature most examples shiau 2006 mirakbari et al 2010 ganguli and janga reddy 2012 mirabbasi et al 2012 yusof et al 2013 zin et al 2013 zhang et al 2013a tosunoglu and can 2016 refer to bivariate analyses of drought severity and duration where the index adopted for the definition of drought events is the well known standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 on the basis of spi or other standardised indices multi variable models which include other characteristics such as the peak and or area extension of drought events have been also proposed serinaldi et al 2009 chen et al 2011 ma et al 2013 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 ge et al 2016 hao et al 2017 hydrological droughts have also been extensively modelled by copulas in most cases the drought characteristics were derived by applying a given truncation level to the streamflow time series and then modelled by bivariate shiau et al 2007 zhang et al 2013b or multivariate song and singh 2010 salvadori and de michele 2007 copulas to describe their joint probabilistic behaviour of course the same models are valid for analysing the risk associated with flood events copula models also offer the possibility of combining different types of droughts to extract better information or derive new drought indices examples can be found in kao and govindaraju 2010 wong et al 2013 and hao and aghakouchak 2013 the latter authors proposed a multiple drought index by combining probabilistically the spi and the standardized soil moisture index ssi the applications of copula models for a specific analysis of drought or water stress conditions in the agricultural context are still very limited this is likely due to the fact that an appropriate characterisation of those phenomena requires the quantification more or less explicit of a complex variable such as the soil moisture availability in relation to its impact on crop productivity mishra and singh 2010 for example zhang et al 2017 investigated the synchronous asynchronous occurrence of rainfall and evapotranspiration to analyse water shortage risk in an irrigation district of china in cisty et al 2016 the rainfall and evapotranspiration time series were jointly analysed to identify the potential irrigation periods in a region of slovakia vergni et al 2015 analysed the bivariate probability of drought onset and severity in sunflowers in central italy on the basis of a simulated soil water balance madadgar et al 2017 proposed a copula based model for the determination of the conditional probability of crop yield with respect to precipitation or soil moisture conditions in this study a bivariate analysis of drought duration and severity in olive crops under different irrigation strategies was carried out the aim is to provide a further contribution to the identification and application of suitable copula models for agricultural drought risk analysis showing how this approach can be used for the effective planning of irrigation or in the design of irrigation systems the two most innovative aspects included in the study are 1 the use of a non standardised variable for the characterisation of agricultural drought characteristics in fact the impact of a certain drought condition on crops depends on the actual soil moisture availability more than its departure from a normal condition 2 the identification of the best long term irrigation strategy based on the evaluation of the corresponding joint probability of drought severity and duration the methodology is demonstrated by a case study of some localities in central italy and olive crops which are widely grown in that area under rainfed or deficit irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the analysis focused on some localities of central italy fig 1 where olives are traditionally grown extensively and under rainfed conditions however irrigation of olive orchards is becoming more and more important due to the increment of intensive orchards which require more water than extensive ones and due to the necessity to standardise and stabilise productivity in dry years steduto et al 2012 these changes make it opportune to include such crops in irrigation management plans and to improve the knowledge of the characteristics of water stress conditions the occurrence and duration of the olive phenological stages are typical of the other mediterranean regions steduto et al 2012 the stages most sensitive to water deficits are flowering may and subsequent fruit set may june however also the initial rapid fruit growth june and the stage of active oil accumulation august september are quite sensitive gucci et al 2007 olive harvesting begins in late october early november and usually continues until mid december the climatic data daily precipitation and minimum and maximum daily temperature for the localities studied were obtained from both the italian national hydrographic and oceanographic service and the regional hydrographic services the length of the available time series and some summary statistics are presented in table 1 other agroclimatic data wind speed air relative humidity and solar radiation useful for accurate estimation of the evapotranspiration were only available for some localities and for short time series and were not considered in the analysis on the other hand an accurate determination of the actual evapotranspiration rates is important for seasonal irrigation scheduling but not as important for long term irrigation planning moreover the probabilistic approach on which the study is based takes advantage more of the sample size than the accuracy of the variables examined the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was therefore estimated by the hargreaves and samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 allen et al 1998 using only daily minimum and maximum temperature the use of this equation in irrigation planning can be considered reliable as demonstrated by studies conducted in a wide range of climatic conditions e g hargreaves and allen 2003 almorox et al 2015 all the localities considered are characterised by a mediterranean climate with cold winters and hot summers in particular the period between may and september can be considered the typical irrigation season due the frequent occurrence of water stress conditions i e periods characterised by negative cumulative differences between precipitation and evapotranspiration despite the moderate distances between the localities fig 1 they showed fairly wide variability in climatic and agro climatic values table 1 mainly due to the influence of the complex orography of the two regions fig 1 the mean annual precipitation ranges from 707 8 compignano to 1007 4 mm gubbio while in the may september period this ranges from 237 4 scerni to 344 3 mm gubbio the locality of gubbio is therefore the wettest while the lower values for both periods considered are found in the localities of compignano scerni chieti and orvieto table 1 also shows the mean annual and may september non stressed olive evapotranspiration etm calculated from the daily values estimated by the method described in section 2 2 the mean annual non stressed olive evapotranspiration etm ranges from 475 4 chieti to 604 7 mm compignano while that in the may september period ranges from 316 7 chieti to 414 2 mm compignano 2 2 soil water balance simulation and calculation of drought characteristics daily precipitation and evapotranspiration data were input into a single layer bucket soil water balance model to simulate the daily time series of the available soil water in the root zone sw mm for olives the soil water balance model follows the scheme suggested in the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 the precipitation volume that is actually added and stored in the soil effective precipitation depends on many factors such as the characteristics of the soil humidity texture management and slope the precipitation amount and other environmental factors in this study the effective precipitation was roughly estimated excluding the daily precipitation amounts lower than 5 mm and reducing larger amounts by 20 xiloyannis et al 2004 for the sake of simplicity a 1 m soil depth with 15 of available water content awc i e total available water taw of 150 mm was considered for all the stations indeed for olives most of the absorbing roots are usually in the first 1 m depth steduto et al 2012 moreover despite the high spatial variability of soil texture an awc of 15 represents a plausible average value for the regions considered ballabio et al 2016 the crop coefficients for olives required for the calculation of the non stressed i e potential crop etm were taken from the fao 56 guidelines and a threshold level of swmin 0 25 taw 37 5 mm was adopted as the critical point beginning of water stress i e actual evapotranspiration eta etm the soil water balance model was applied continuously throughout the time series starting from an initial condition of full recharge of the soil water i e swini taw this simulation was performed according to 10 different irrigation strategies table 2 strategy 1 group 0 is rainfed strategies 2 5 group 1 involve a single irrigation at the end of one of the months between may and august and strategies 6 10 group 2 consider two irrigations one at the end of each of two months between may and august consecutive or not the irrigation volume of each application was assumed to equal 50 mm applied in 15 days thus simulating a drip irrigation system distributing a daily irrigation volume of 3 3 mm d 1 which is approximately the maximum potential evapotranspiration of olive crops in the period between may and august only these months were considered in the scheduling of irrigations because they are characterised by the highest probability of water deficits as illustrated in fig 2 which shows the mean daily water deficits average of all stations for each month moreover as described above the stages most sensitive to water stress occur in this period the seasonal irrigation volumes reported in table 2 are usually insufficient to prevent the occurrence of water deficit however they are in agreement with gucci et al 2007 who showed that for central italy volumes less than 100 mm are usually sufficient to obtain satisfactory yields about 80 of those attainable with full irrigation moreover regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies are considered important for improving the oil quality servili et al 2007 the drought events were identified by applying the theory of runs yevjevich 1967 to the daily time series of sw mannocchi et al 2009 todisco et al 2009 2013 using the threshold level swmin thus a drought event corresponds to a continuous period during which sw swmin and it can be characterised in terms of duration and severity the duration d days is simply the sum of consecutive days in which sw swmin or equivalently eta etm the severity s mm was computed as the sum of the evapotranspiration deficits etm eta during the event this definition of severity is different from that adopted in other papers e g mannocchi et al 2009 where the severity was defined as the sum of swmin sw for the duration of the drought event of course the two different measures of severity are highly correlated but the severity based on the cumulated evapotranspiration deficit has some advantages it is not directly dependent on soil characteristics i e taw and it can be interpreted as the hypothetical irrigation volume required to prevent the occurrence of the drought event theoretically the variable d has no upper bound while s has an upper bound given by the summation of etm during the drought event under a theoretical constant condition of eta 0 2 3 univariate distributions of water stress duration d and severity s the first step of the analysis consisted of the identification of adequate marginal cumulative distributions fd d and fs s for d and s respectively the variable d appears as a discrete variable but this is an artifact dependent on the application of a discrete i e daily soil water balance therefore it was assumed that both d and s are continuous random variables different 2 parameter continuous distributions i e the exponential exp the gamma gam the weibull wei and the pareto par have been evaluated for the description of d and s in relation to given locations and scenarios estimating the distribution parameters by a maximum log likelihood method on the basis of sample observations identification of the best fitting distribution was first obtained by applying the kolmogorov smirnov ks test at a 0 01 significance level the null hypothesis h0 tested by the ks test was that the d or s samples derived from a given distribution whose parameters were necessarily estimated from the available samples themselves in this circumstance correct estimates of the p values associated with h0 were obtained by a montecarlo simulation involving 5000 randomly drawn samples details about this procedure can be found in vergni et al 2017 a further criterion of choice was based on the comparison of the distributions tested in terms of root mean square error rmse computed between observed and theoretical quantiles vergni et al 2016 2 4 joint distribution and return periods of agricultural drought characteristics 2 4 1 basic theory of copula a brief description of copula functions and of their properties limited to the bivariate case is provided here more details can be found in joe 1997 genest and favre 2007 and salvadori and de michele 2007 let x and y be continuous random correlated variables with cumulative distribution functions f x x p x x and f y y p y y respectively according to sklar 1959 there exists a unique function c called copula such that 1 p x x y y c f x x f y y where c u v p u u v v is the distribution of the pairs u v f x x f y y whose margins are uniform on 0 1 in addition if the probability density functions pdfs f x x and f y y of x and y exist then the joint pdf of the two variables can be expressed as 2 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where c u v is defined as 3 c u v 2 c u v u v a set of copula models was initially examined to identify the model providing the best overall description of the dependence structure between d and s taking into account the literature where similar variables were considered e g janga reddy and ganguli 2012 this set included elliptical copulas student t copula archimedean copulas frank clayton and the plackett and extreme value copulas galambos the gumbel copula which belongs to both archimedean and extreme value classes was also considered details of their definitions and properties can be found in shiau 2006 chen et al 2011 and other references 2 4 2 estimation of copula parameters and goodness of fit of copula models in this paper the copula parameters were estimated by the maximum pseudo likelihood mpl method which only relies on the ranks of sample observations of the random variables x and y genest and favre 2007 this technique usually provides a better goodness of fit than method of moment approaches such as those based on kendall s tau or spearman s rho kojadinovic and yan 2010 the mpl method is based on the maximisation of the following expression 4 l θ i 1 n log c θ u i v i i 1 n log c θ r i n 1 s i n 1 where cθ u v is the density function of the candidate copula model with vector of parameters θ n is the sample size ri is the rank of the observation xi among x1 xn and si is the rank of the observation yi among y1 yn the scaled ranks r i n 1 and s i n 1 are also commonly referred to as pseudo observations the greater the value obtained from eq 4 the better the adaptation of the specific parameterised copula therefore the log likelihood eq 4 was considered as a first comparative measure of goodness of fit a more objective evaluation of the goodness of fit was obtained by comparing the pre selected copula models with the empirical copula c e u v whose formal definition is 5 c e u v 1 n i 1 n i r i n 1 u i s i n 1 v i where i a is the characteristic function of set a having the value 0 if a is false and value 1 if a is true according to genest and favre 2007 the empirical copula provides the best empirically based representation of the unknown copula c the comparisons were performed by calculating the cramer von mises statistic sn genest et al 2009 6 s n i 1 n c e u i v i c θ u i v i 2 where c θ u v is the candidate copula model with vector of parameters θ the lower the value of sn the better the goodness of fit moreover a bootstrap approach based on 1000010 000 repetitions was applied to estimate the p values associated with the sn statistic hofert et al 2017 in the analysis of extreme events it is also important to evaluate the reliability of a certain copula model in the description of the tail dependence among variables joe 1997 salvadori and de michele 2007 tail dependence refers to the concordance between extreme values in the lower and upper tails of the multivariate distribution with regard to the drought characteristics considered here the analysis of the upper tail dependence has a higher importance than lower tail dependence the upper tail dependence coefficient λu can be defined as 7 λ u lim t 1 p f x x t f y y t we say that x y is upper tail dependent if λu 0 and upper tail independent if λu 0 the λu can be also defined in terms of copula cθ t t 8 λ u lim t 1 1 2 t c θ t t 1 t eq 8 enables the parametric estimate of λu when cθ t t is replaced by a given fitted copula to obtain a non parametric estimation of upper tail dependence the cfg estimator λ ˆ u c f g was employed frahm et al 2005 9 λ ˆ u c f g 2 2 exp 1 n i 1 n log log 1 u i log 1 v i log 1 max u i v i 2 where ui ri n 1 and vi si n 1 the cfg estimator λ ˆ u c f g is based on the assumption that the empirical copula can be approximated by an extreme value copula however it also works well when this hypothesis is not fulfilled except in the case when the real upper tail dependence is null frahm et al 2005 2 4 3 joint probability and return periods by combining the best fitting marginal distributions and the best fitting copula model a complete copula model was obtained which has been used to estimate for each locality and scheduling strategy the joint probabilities 10 p d d s s c f d d f s s and the joint return periods tds year for the condition d d and s s this return period is formally defined as 11 t d s 1 f 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s where f year 1 is the expected frequency of drought events which can be estimated from the available samples shiau et al 2007 3 results and discussion taking into account the number of scenarios and localities 10 and 8 respectively 80 samples of pairs d s were analysed the size of the samples i e number of drought events ranged between 81 strategy 6 at penne and 227 strategy 3 at compignano first some information about the variability of both d and s with the irrigation strategy and the climate locality is presented the first type of information is presented in fig 3 which shows the boxplots obtained by averaging the data from all stations grouped by scheduling and variable d in fig 3a and s in fig 3b the vertical dashed lines separate the three strategy groups defined in table 2 it is evident that the strategy has a minimal effect on the median values of both d and s while it has a more significant impact on the 3rd quartiles and on the extreme values which as expected tend to decrease from group 0 to group 2 the values given above each boxplot represent the average frequency f year 1 of water stress events for the corresponding strategy this frequency presents a limited variability among strategies the minimum frequency of 2 1 year 1 is observed for the strategy 6 characterised by two irrigations one at the end of may and on at the end of june it can be noticed that the maximum average frequency f 2 7 year 1 is found for some strategies 3 and 4 belonging to the group 1 and that this frequency is slightly higher than that of the rainfed approach this can be attributed to the fact that irrigation can temporarily interrupt an on going drought event but if dry climatic conditions persist a new drought event can occur thus the number of events as well as their frequency increases however for each drought event lower values of both d and s are expected the effect of the climate on d s and on the event frequency is illustrated in fig 4 which shows the boxplots obtained by averaging the data of all strategies grouped by locality and variable d in fig 4a and s in fig 4b also in this case the median values of both d and s are poorly affected by the climatic conditions while a larger variability is observed for the 3rd quartiles and for the maximum values the minimum and maximum average frequencies are observed for the chieti and compignano localities respectively a further analysis showed that under rainfed conditions 68 of events begin in the period between may and august and that another 26 occur in the period between september and october likely as a consequence of previously accumulated water deficits this temporal distribution of the water stress events confirms the adequacy of the may august period as a probable irrigation season 3 1 marginal distribution for d and s the distributions tested were the exponential exp the gamma gam the weibull wei and the pareto par their parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood method and the most suitable distribution was identified by the procedures described in materials and methods the goodness of fit of the above mentioned marginal distributions for d and s is summarised in table 3 which shows the mean values of rmse and the percentage of samples for which the null hypothesis of the ks test was not rejected at the 0 01 significance level for d all the distributions tested show satisfactory performances however the gamma distribution has the lowest rmse and the highest percentage of non rejection of the ks test null hypothesis for s the gamma distribution has decisively a better goodness of fit than the other distributions tested despite some variability in the rmse therefore the gamma distribution was selected as marginal distribution for both d and s the cumulative gamma distribution for a generic variable x has the following expression 12 g x 1 β α γ α 0 x x α e x β d x where α 0 and β 0 are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ α is the gamma function 3 2 copula model for d and s the nature of the dependence structure between d and s was first explored by a graphical analysis of the scatter plots of the pseudo observations u v where u and v are the scaled ranks of d and s respectively in fact this type of plot provides a faithful description of the empirical copula genest and favre 2007 the plots presented in fig 5 black dots show some examples of this analysis for the locality of orvieto and the strategies 1 3 and 7 but the plots are very similar for the other cases based on fig 5 the existence of a positive and significant correlation between d and s is evident the average kendall τ correlation coefficient computed from the whole dataset is 0 84 the goodness of fit test described in materials and methods was applied to the 80 samples of pseudo observations u v for each of the six pre selected copula models student t franck clayton plackett galambos and gumbel the summarised results are presented in table 4 based on the log likelihood value the best goodness of fit is provided by the gumbel copula followed by the galambos and franck copulas all the copulas considered have similar performances in terms of statistic sn with the exception of the poor performance of the clayton copula with slightly lower i e better values for the galambos and gumbel copulas the frank copula exhibits the highest number of significant sn values therefore from the analysis of the overall fitting the galambos gumbel and frank copulas seem to provide similar performances a further criterion of choice was based on the analysis of the upper tail dependence for these copulas it should be noted that the frank copula does not admit tail dependence i e the limit indicated by eq 8 is always zero while for the galambos and gumbel copulas λu is greater than 0 and depends on the copula parameter θ λu 2 21 θ the graphical analysis of the plot of pseudo observations black dots for the examples in fig 5 indicates the presence of a certain concentration of points corresponding to extremely high values thus suggesting the existence of upper tail dependence also the non parametric estimation of λ ˆ u c f g obtained from the 80 observed samples indicates the presence of upper tail dependence λ ˆ u c f g 0 therefore the frank copula despite a good description of the overall dependence structure does not appear to be a correct choice for the analysis of extreme events which are usually the focus of a risk assessment the final choice between the galambos and the gumbel copulas was obtained by a graphical comparison between the 80 values of λ ˆ u c f g and the corresponding λu fig 6 from which it is evident that the gumbel copula is a better choice than the galambos the overall goodness of fit of the gumbel copula can be also observed in the examples presented in fig 5 where the pseudo observations black dots are plotted together with an equivalent number of pairs u v randomly generated from the corresponding parameterised gumbel copula empty dots therefore the dependence structure between d and s was always modelled by the gumbel copula whose general equation is 13 c u v e x p ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where θ is the copula parameter here estimated by the mpl method for a given sample of pseudo observations by replacing u and v in eq 13 with the parameterised cumulative gamma distributions eq 12 of d and s respectively the complete copula models dependence structure marginal distributions were obtained 3 3 example of application of the copula model for irrigation planning the direct application of the copula model eq 13 enables the estimation of the joint probability p d d s s for a given locality and irrigation strategy a graphical example of this result is presented in the contour graphs of fig 7 for the localities of compignano and gubbio and for strategy 1 rainfed and strategy 7 these two localities are characterised by quite different climatic conditions drier in compignano than in gubbio table 1 and of course the water stress expected under strategy 1 and 7 is very different due to these differences the same water stress condition d s corresponds to very different values of the cumulative joint probability p d d s s in particular it is interesting to observe that the adoption of strategy 7 in compignano fig 7b leads to a probabilistic behaviour of the drought events similar to that expected under rainfed conditions in gubbio fig 7c the copula models were finally applied to investigate the effect of the climate and the irrigation strategy on the d and s values expected for a given return period with this aim a tds of 10 years was considered in eq 11 using an iterative procedure to retrieve the corresponding pairs of d and s in particular since various combinations of duration and severity can have the same return period this comparison is typically performed using contour lines fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 shows a comparison of the contour lines related to the rainfed strategy in the different localities of course the drought risk can be considered higher when both d and s are higher for example it is evident that the risk is higher in compignano and orvieto than in any other locality in particular in these localities drought events having a severity of about 300 mm and duration of about 150 days are expected every 10 years other comparisons such as those characterised by intersecting contour lines e g terni vs scerni spoleto vs chieti lead to more interesting observations in general it can be assumed that the higher the drought severity the higher is the impact on the crop for this reason the drought risk under rainfed conditions can be considered lower in chieti than in spoleto and lower in scerni than in terni but the contour lines of spoleto and terni also indicate that in these localities high levels of severity can be reached with relatively short durations denoting an higher probability of intense events less tolerable by crops steduto et al 2012 these observations underline the importance of multivariate analyses for a proper understanding of the drought phenomenon fig 9 shows the contour lines of the pairs d s having a 10 year return focusing on the differences between the irrigation strategies on the basis of the above mentioned criteria the best strategies at each location and for each group 1 or 2 interventions have been marked in bold for group 1 strategy 3 irrigation at the end of june usually leads to the lowest values of both d and s in some localities strategy 4 e g chieti penne gubbio and orvieto and strategy 2 e g terni led to results very similar to those of strategy 3 for group 1 as expected the worst strategy is 5 irrigation at the end of august due to irrigation occurring too late in the season when a significant deficit has already been accumulated for group 2 the best strategy is usually 7 irrigation at the end of both june and july even if the strategies 6 and 9 frequently lead to similar results both strategies 8 and 10 are usually not very effective since they include as with strategy 5 irrigation at the end of august 3 4 probability of consecutive severe drought events in the previous sections drought events with given characteristics d and s were analysed without taking their time sequence into account however the time sequence is relevant to drought analysis and water resource management this type of analysis is often considered in literature with the aim of identifying suitable drought forecasting models usually based on the application of markov chains and on standardised indices e g paulo et al 2005 a fundamental step in the definition of this type of model is the quantification of the transition probabilities from one drought class to another a similar approach is considered here discussing in more detail the results presented in the previous sections and in particular also taking into account the impact of the different strategies on the occurrence of consecutive severe drought events for this purpose the drought events de were arbitrarily classified in three duration classes low l if d 10 days medium m if 10 d 50 days and high h if d 50 days in the literature e g paulo et al 2005 the drought classes have usually been defined in terms of severity but in the present study the duration is more convenient since the same classes can be adopted to classify the non drought events nde that by definition always follows a drought event the severity for a nde is always 0 moreover once the duration class of the de is defined the corresponding probabilistic behaviour of the severity can be easily described thanks to the identified copula functions in fact the conditional probability of severity given that the drought duration exceeding a certain threshold d is 14 p s s d d f s s c f d d f s s 1 f d d to explore the probability of consecutive severe drought events the following transition probabilities p1 and p2 were estimated by a sample frequency analysis for each strategy and location p1 is the probability that a high duration de at time t is followed by a low duration nde at time t 1 15 p1 p ndet 1 l det h the higher the value of p1 the greater is the expected impact because there are fewer possibilities for the crop to recover after the stress period the previous condition is further aggravated if at the time t 2 a de of class h or m occurs therefore this transition probability has also been evaluated as p2 16 p2 p det 2 h or det 2 m det h and ndet 1 l as for p1 the higher the p2 value the worse is the expected overall impact of drought conditions for the sake of simplicity the values of p1 and p2 for each strategy are only presented in fig 10 for the exemplificative location compignano for which the estimation of the transition probabilities is more reliable thanks to the relevant number of drought events the information obtained from fig 10 can be used for a more detailed evaluation of the strategies which according to the previous analysis presented in fig 9 have similar performances e g 2 and 3 for group 1 and 6 7 9 for group 2 the results presented in fig 10 indicate that for strategy 3 the occurrence of severe consecutive drought events is slightly higher than for strategy 2 therefore the overall and long term effect of strategy 2 could be more favourable than that obtained with strategy 3 among the strategies 6 7 and 9 strategy 6 clearly has the lowest values of both p1 and p2 and could therefore be a better strategy than 7 4 conclusions the use of multivariate probabilistic models is becoming common in hydrological studies in this paper a bivariate risk analysis of the duration d and severity s of agricultural drought conditions in olive crops has been described in relation to some localities in central italy the analysis was mainly conducted to show the potential of this type of approach as a tool for the long term planning of irrigation the joint distribution and joint return periods of d and s for olive crops in different localities under different irrigation strategies were analysed and discussed the best irrigation strategies were identified by evaluating the corresponding contour lines of pairs d s having a 10 year return period for the condition d d and s s the lower the values of both d and s the better the strategy among the single irrigation strategies the optimal one is usually represented by an application at the end of june strategy 3 but similar performance can be obtained by an application at the end of may strategy 2 among the double irrigation strategies the optimal one involved two interventions one at the end of june and one at the end of july strategy 7 but similar results are obtained by strategy 6 applications both at the end of may and june considering in the analysis also the possible reduction of the probability of consecutive severe drought events it was instead found that strategy 2 could be better than 3 and that strategy 6 is certainly better than 7 in the paper the effectiveness of the different irrigation strategies was simply assessed on the basis of the joint probabilistic behaviour of the water stress duration and severity without considering the complex physiological implications further advances could be obtained by introducing other variables in the joint analysis for example by taking into account that sensitivity to water stress varies with the crop phenological stage fernandez and moreno 1999 the date of occurrence of water stress could be a useful variable in the development of a more informative three dimensional copula model as an alternative the severity of drought events could be quantified by taking into account suitable weights e g the yield response factors reported by steduto et al 2012 to better calibrate the drought severity to the potential impact on yield in general this type of analysis would benefit from qualitative and or quantitative information on yields in order to obtain a link between the joint probability of drought characteristics and the expected impact on crop productivity declaration of competing interest

10764,in this study the effectiveness of a bivariate analysis of agricultural drought characteristics for irrigation planning was evaluated the case study was conducted in locations in central italy and was based on olive crops which are widely grown in that area under rainfed or deficit irrigation regimes for each locality the available time series of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures were used to simulate the daily soil water dynamics swt for olive crops the simulation was performed assuming 10 irrigation strategies different for both the volume and date of the interventions by applying the theory of runs to swt with a threshold corresponding to the readily available water the agricultural drought events in the time series were identified and characterised by their duration d days and severity s i e the cumulative evapotranspiration deficit in mm for each locality and strategy a 2 parameter gamma distribution was fitted to both d and s whilst their dependence structure was modelled by a gumbel copula the evaluation of the best irrigation strategy in each locality was obtained by comparing the contour lines of the pairs d s having a 10 year return period for the condition d d and s s results showed a great influence of both climate and irrigation strategy on the joint distribution of d and s some strategies despite a very similar behaviour in the severity differed a lot in terms of the associated values of duration thus denoting different dynamics of water stress more or less intense among the single irrigation strategies the optimal one was usually represented by an application at the end of june among the double irrigation strategies the optimal one involved two interventions one at the end of june and one at the end of july these results were also discussed taking into account the corresponding probability of consecutive severe drought events keywords risk of water deficit copula joint return periods transition probabilities deficit irrigation olive crops 1 introduction drought risk analysis makes an important contribution to water resource planning and management in a given region however as with many other natural hazards drought has a typical multivariate nature tsakiris et al 2016 i e it is characterised by the contemporary presence of multiple characteristics correlated with each other e g duration severity areal extension and peak in this situation a traditional univariate risk analysis based on the frequency or probability distribution of single characteristics may lead to misleading inadequate or incomplete interpretations of the phenomenon chen et al 2011 hao and aghakouchak 2013 the probabilistic joint analysis of two or more correlated random variables can be effectively carried out by the copula functions nelsen 1999 which have been widely applied in the last decade in economical and hydrological contexts copulas are functions that join univariate probability distributions to form multivariate probability distributions enabling modelling of the dependence structure among random variables independently of their univariate distributions joe 1997 applications of copulas to improve meteorological drought modelling or to explore changes in its characteristics are common in the scientific literature most examples shiau 2006 mirakbari et al 2010 ganguli and janga reddy 2012 mirabbasi et al 2012 yusof et al 2013 zin et al 2013 zhang et al 2013a tosunoglu and can 2016 refer to bivariate analyses of drought severity and duration where the index adopted for the definition of drought events is the well known standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 on the basis of spi or other standardised indices multi variable models which include other characteristics such as the peak and or area extension of drought events have been also proposed serinaldi et al 2009 chen et al 2011 ma et al 2013 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 ge et al 2016 hao et al 2017 hydrological droughts have also been extensively modelled by copulas in most cases the drought characteristics were derived by applying a given truncation level to the streamflow time series and then modelled by bivariate shiau et al 2007 zhang et al 2013b or multivariate song and singh 2010 salvadori and de michele 2007 copulas to describe their joint probabilistic behaviour of course the same models are valid for analysing the risk associated with flood events copula models also offer the possibility of combining different types of droughts to extract better information or derive new drought indices examples can be found in kao and govindaraju 2010 wong et al 2013 and hao and aghakouchak 2013 the latter authors proposed a multiple drought index by combining probabilistically the spi and the standardized soil moisture index ssi the applications of copula models for a specific analysis of drought or water stress conditions in the agricultural context are still very limited this is likely due to the fact that an appropriate characterisation of those phenomena requires the quantification more or less explicit of a complex variable such as the soil moisture availability in relation to its impact on crop productivity mishra and singh 2010 for example zhang et al 2017 investigated the synchronous asynchronous occurrence of rainfall and evapotranspiration to analyse water shortage risk in an irrigation district of china in cisty et al 2016 the rainfall and evapotranspiration time series were jointly analysed to identify the potential irrigation periods in a region of slovakia vergni et al 2015 analysed the bivariate probability of drought onset and severity in sunflowers in central italy on the basis of a simulated soil water balance madadgar et al 2017 proposed a copula based model for the determination of the conditional probability of crop yield with respect to precipitation or soil moisture conditions in this study a bivariate analysis of drought duration and severity in olive crops under different irrigation strategies was carried out the aim is to provide a further contribution to the identification and application of suitable copula models for agricultural drought risk analysis showing how this approach can be used for the effective planning of irrigation or in the design of irrigation systems the two most innovative aspects included in the study are 1 the use of a non standardised variable for the characterisation of agricultural drought characteristics in fact the impact of a certain drought condition on crops depends on the actual soil moisture availability more than its departure from a normal condition 2 the identification of the best long term irrigation strategy based on the evaluation of the corresponding joint probability of drought severity and duration the methodology is demonstrated by a case study of some localities in central italy and olive crops which are widely grown in that area under rainfed or deficit irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the analysis focused on some localities of central italy fig 1 where olives are traditionally grown extensively and under rainfed conditions however irrigation of olive orchards is becoming more and more important due to the increment of intensive orchards which require more water than extensive ones and due to the necessity to standardise and stabilise productivity in dry years steduto et al 2012 these changes make it opportune to include such crops in irrigation management plans and to improve the knowledge of the characteristics of water stress conditions the occurrence and duration of the olive phenological stages are typical of the other mediterranean regions steduto et al 2012 the stages most sensitive to water deficits are flowering may and subsequent fruit set may june however also the initial rapid fruit growth june and the stage of active oil accumulation august september are quite sensitive gucci et al 2007 olive harvesting begins in late october early november and usually continues until mid december the climatic data daily precipitation and minimum and maximum daily temperature for the localities studied were obtained from both the italian national hydrographic and oceanographic service and the regional hydrographic services the length of the available time series and some summary statistics are presented in table 1 other agroclimatic data wind speed air relative humidity and solar radiation useful for accurate estimation of the evapotranspiration were only available for some localities and for short time series and were not considered in the analysis on the other hand an accurate determination of the actual evapotranspiration rates is important for seasonal irrigation scheduling but not as important for long term irrigation planning moreover the probabilistic approach on which the study is based takes advantage more of the sample size than the accuracy of the variables examined the daily reference evapotranspiration et0 was therefore estimated by the hargreaves and samani equation hargreaves and samani 1985 allen et al 1998 using only daily minimum and maximum temperature the use of this equation in irrigation planning can be considered reliable as demonstrated by studies conducted in a wide range of climatic conditions e g hargreaves and allen 2003 almorox et al 2015 all the localities considered are characterised by a mediterranean climate with cold winters and hot summers in particular the period between may and september can be considered the typical irrigation season due the frequent occurrence of water stress conditions i e periods characterised by negative cumulative differences between precipitation and evapotranspiration despite the moderate distances between the localities fig 1 they showed fairly wide variability in climatic and agro climatic values table 1 mainly due to the influence of the complex orography of the two regions fig 1 the mean annual precipitation ranges from 707 8 compignano to 1007 4 mm gubbio while in the may september period this ranges from 237 4 scerni to 344 3 mm gubbio the locality of gubbio is therefore the wettest while the lower values for both periods considered are found in the localities of compignano scerni chieti and orvieto table 1 also shows the mean annual and may september non stressed olive evapotranspiration etm calculated from the daily values estimated by the method described in section 2 2 the mean annual non stressed olive evapotranspiration etm ranges from 475 4 chieti to 604 7 mm compignano while that in the may september period ranges from 316 7 chieti to 414 2 mm compignano 2 2 soil water balance simulation and calculation of drought characteristics daily precipitation and evapotranspiration data were input into a single layer bucket soil water balance model to simulate the daily time series of the available soil water in the root zone sw mm for olives the soil water balance model follows the scheme suggested in the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 the precipitation volume that is actually added and stored in the soil effective precipitation depends on many factors such as the characteristics of the soil humidity texture management and slope the precipitation amount and other environmental factors in this study the effective precipitation was roughly estimated excluding the daily precipitation amounts lower than 5 mm and reducing larger amounts by 20 xiloyannis et al 2004 for the sake of simplicity a 1 m soil depth with 15 of available water content awc i e total available water taw of 150 mm was considered for all the stations indeed for olives most of the absorbing roots are usually in the first 1 m depth steduto et al 2012 moreover despite the high spatial variability of soil texture an awc of 15 represents a plausible average value for the regions considered ballabio et al 2016 the crop coefficients for olives required for the calculation of the non stressed i e potential crop etm were taken from the fao 56 guidelines and a threshold level of swmin 0 25 taw 37 5 mm was adopted as the critical point beginning of water stress i e actual evapotranspiration eta etm the soil water balance model was applied continuously throughout the time series starting from an initial condition of full recharge of the soil water i e swini taw this simulation was performed according to 10 different irrigation strategies table 2 strategy 1 group 0 is rainfed strategies 2 5 group 1 involve a single irrigation at the end of one of the months between may and august and strategies 6 10 group 2 consider two irrigations one at the end of each of two months between may and august consecutive or not the irrigation volume of each application was assumed to equal 50 mm applied in 15 days thus simulating a drip irrigation system distributing a daily irrigation volume of 3 3 mm d 1 which is approximately the maximum potential evapotranspiration of olive crops in the period between may and august only these months were considered in the scheduling of irrigations because they are characterised by the highest probability of water deficits as illustrated in fig 2 which shows the mean daily water deficits average of all stations for each month moreover as described above the stages most sensitive to water stress occur in this period the seasonal irrigation volumes reported in table 2 are usually insufficient to prevent the occurrence of water deficit however they are in agreement with gucci et al 2007 who showed that for central italy volumes less than 100 mm are usually sufficient to obtain satisfactory yields about 80 of those attainable with full irrigation moreover regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies are considered important for improving the oil quality servili et al 2007 the drought events were identified by applying the theory of runs yevjevich 1967 to the daily time series of sw mannocchi et al 2009 todisco et al 2009 2013 using the threshold level swmin thus a drought event corresponds to a continuous period during which sw swmin and it can be characterised in terms of duration and severity the duration d days is simply the sum of consecutive days in which sw swmin or equivalently eta etm the severity s mm was computed as the sum of the evapotranspiration deficits etm eta during the event this definition of severity is different from that adopted in other papers e g mannocchi et al 2009 where the severity was defined as the sum of swmin sw for the duration of the drought event of course the two different measures of severity are highly correlated but the severity based on the cumulated evapotranspiration deficit has some advantages it is not directly dependent on soil characteristics i e taw and it can be interpreted as the hypothetical irrigation volume required to prevent the occurrence of the drought event theoretically the variable d has no upper bound while s has an upper bound given by the summation of etm during the drought event under a theoretical constant condition of eta 0 2 3 univariate distributions of water stress duration d and severity s the first step of the analysis consisted of the identification of adequate marginal cumulative distributions fd d and fs s for d and s respectively the variable d appears as a discrete variable but this is an artifact dependent on the application of a discrete i e daily soil water balance therefore it was assumed that both d and s are continuous random variables different 2 parameter continuous distributions i e the exponential exp the gamma gam the weibull wei and the pareto par have been evaluated for the description of d and s in relation to given locations and scenarios estimating the distribution parameters by a maximum log likelihood method on the basis of sample observations identification of the best fitting distribution was first obtained by applying the kolmogorov smirnov ks test at a 0 01 significance level the null hypothesis h0 tested by the ks test was that the d or s samples derived from a given distribution whose parameters were necessarily estimated from the available samples themselves in this circumstance correct estimates of the p values associated with h0 were obtained by a montecarlo simulation involving 5000 randomly drawn samples details about this procedure can be found in vergni et al 2017 a further criterion of choice was based on the comparison of the distributions tested in terms of root mean square error rmse computed between observed and theoretical quantiles vergni et al 2016 2 4 joint distribution and return periods of agricultural drought characteristics 2 4 1 basic theory of copula a brief description of copula functions and of their properties limited to the bivariate case is provided here more details can be found in joe 1997 genest and favre 2007 and salvadori and de michele 2007 let x and y be continuous random correlated variables with cumulative distribution functions f x x p x x and f y y p y y respectively according to sklar 1959 there exists a unique function c called copula such that 1 p x x y y c f x x f y y where c u v p u u v v is the distribution of the pairs u v f x x f y y whose margins are uniform on 0 1 in addition if the probability density functions pdfs f x x and f y y of x and y exist then the joint pdf of the two variables can be expressed as 2 f x y x y c f x x f y y f x x f y y where c u v is defined as 3 c u v 2 c u v u v a set of copula models was initially examined to identify the model providing the best overall description of the dependence structure between d and s taking into account the literature where similar variables were considered e g janga reddy and ganguli 2012 this set included elliptical copulas student t copula archimedean copulas frank clayton and the plackett and extreme value copulas galambos the gumbel copula which belongs to both archimedean and extreme value classes was also considered details of their definitions and properties can be found in shiau 2006 chen et al 2011 and other references 2 4 2 estimation of copula parameters and goodness of fit of copula models in this paper the copula parameters were estimated by the maximum pseudo likelihood mpl method which only relies on the ranks of sample observations of the random variables x and y genest and favre 2007 this technique usually provides a better goodness of fit than method of moment approaches such as those based on kendall s tau or spearman s rho kojadinovic and yan 2010 the mpl method is based on the maximisation of the following expression 4 l θ i 1 n log c θ u i v i i 1 n log c θ r i n 1 s i n 1 where cθ u v is the density function of the candidate copula model with vector of parameters θ n is the sample size ri is the rank of the observation xi among x1 xn and si is the rank of the observation yi among y1 yn the scaled ranks r i n 1 and s i n 1 are also commonly referred to as pseudo observations the greater the value obtained from eq 4 the better the adaptation of the specific parameterised copula therefore the log likelihood eq 4 was considered as a first comparative measure of goodness of fit a more objective evaluation of the goodness of fit was obtained by comparing the pre selected copula models with the empirical copula c e u v whose formal definition is 5 c e u v 1 n i 1 n i r i n 1 u i s i n 1 v i where i a is the characteristic function of set a having the value 0 if a is false and value 1 if a is true according to genest and favre 2007 the empirical copula provides the best empirically based representation of the unknown copula c the comparisons were performed by calculating the cramer von mises statistic sn genest et al 2009 6 s n i 1 n c e u i v i c θ u i v i 2 where c θ u v is the candidate copula model with vector of parameters θ the lower the value of sn the better the goodness of fit moreover a bootstrap approach based on 1000010 000 repetitions was applied to estimate the p values associated with the sn statistic hofert et al 2017 in the analysis of extreme events it is also important to evaluate the reliability of a certain copula model in the description of the tail dependence among variables joe 1997 salvadori and de michele 2007 tail dependence refers to the concordance between extreme values in the lower and upper tails of the multivariate distribution with regard to the drought characteristics considered here the analysis of the upper tail dependence has a higher importance than lower tail dependence the upper tail dependence coefficient λu can be defined as 7 λ u lim t 1 p f x x t f y y t we say that x y is upper tail dependent if λu 0 and upper tail independent if λu 0 the λu can be also defined in terms of copula cθ t t 8 λ u lim t 1 1 2 t c θ t t 1 t eq 8 enables the parametric estimate of λu when cθ t t is replaced by a given fitted copula to obtain a non parametric estimation of upper tail dependence the cfg estimator λ ˆ u c f g was employed frahm et al 2005 9 λ ˆ u c f g 2 2 exp 1 n i 1 n log log 1 u i log 1 v i log 1 max u i v i 2 where ui ri n 1 and vi si n 1 the cfg estimator λ ˆ u c f g is based on the assumption that the empirical copula can be approximated by an extreme value copula however it also works well when this hypothesis is not fulfilled except in the case when the real upper tail dependence is null frahm et al 2005 2 4 3 joint probability and return periods by combining the best fitting marginal distributions and the best fitting copula model a complete copula model was obtained which has been used to estimate for each locality and scheduling strategy the joint probabilities 10 p d d s s c f d d f s s and the joint return periods tds year for the condition d d and s s this return period is formally defined as 11 t d s 1 f 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s where f year 1 is the expected frequency of drought events which can be estimated from the available samples shiau et al 2007 3 results and discussion taking into account the number of scenarios and localities 10 and 8 respectively 80 samples of pairs d s were analysed the size of the samples i e number of drought events ranged between 81 strategy 6 at penne and 227 strategy 3 at compignano first some information about the variability of both d and s with the irrigation strategy and the climate locality is presented the first type of information is presented in fig 3 which shows the boxplots obtained by averaging the data from all stations grouped by scheduling and variable d in fig 3a and s in fig 3b the vertical dashed lines separate the three strategy groups defined in table 2 it is evident that the strategy has a minimal effect on the median values of both d and s while it has a more significant impact on the 3rd quartiles and on the extreme values which as expected tend to decrease from group 0 to group 2 the values given above each boxplot represent the average frequency f year 1 of water stress events for the corresponding strategy this frequency presents a limited variability among strategies the minimum frequency of 2 1 year 1 is observed for the strategy 6 characterised by two irrigations one at the end of may and on at the end of june it can be noticed that the maximum average frequency f 2 7 year 1 is found for some strategies 3 and 4 belonging to the group 1 and that this frequency is slightly higher than that of the rainfed approach this can be attributed to the fact that irrigation can temporarily interrupt an on going drought event but if dry climatic conditions persist a new drought event can occur thus the number of events as well as their frequency increases however for each drought event lower values of both d and s are expected the effect of the climate on d s and on the event frequency is illustrated in fig 4 which shows the boxplots obtained by averaging the data of all strategies grouped by locality and variable d in fig 4a and s in fig 4b also in this case the median values of both d and s are poorly affected by the climatic conditions while a larger variability is observed for the 3rd quartiles and for the maximum values the minimum and maximum average frequencies are observed for the chieti and compignano localities respectively a further analysis showed that under rainfed conditions 68 of events begin in the period between may and august and that another 26 occur in the period between september and october likely as a consequence of previously accumulated water deficits this temporal distribution of the water stress events confirms the adequacy of the may august period as a probable irrigation season 3 1 marginal distribution for d and s the distributions tested were the exponential exp the gamma gam the weibull wei and the pareto par their parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood method and the most suitable distribution was identified by the procedures described in materials and methods the goodness of fit of the above mentioned marginal distributions for d and s is summarised in table 3 which shows the mean values of rmse and the percentage of samples for which the null hypothesis of the ks test was not rejected at the 0 01 significance level for d all the distributions tested show satisfactory performances however the gamma distribution has the lowest rmse and the highest percentage of non rejection of the ks test null hypothesis for s the gamma distribution has decisively a better goodness of fit than the other distributions tested despite some variability in the rmse therefore the gamma distribution was selected as marginal distribution for both d and s the cumulative gamma distribution for a generic variable x has the following expression 12 g x 1 β α γ α 0 x x α e x β d x where α 0 and β 0 are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ α is the gamma function 3 2 copula model for d and s the nature of the dependence structure between d and s was first explored by a graphical analysis of the scatter plots of the pseudo observations u v where u and v are the scaled ranks of d and s respectively in fact this type of plot provides a faithful description of the empirical copula genest and favre 2007 the plots presented in fig 5 black dots show some examples of this analysis for the locality of orvieto and the strategies 1 3 and 7 but the plots are very similar for the other cases based on fig 5 the existence of a positive and significant correlation between d and s is evident the average kendall τ correlation coefficient computed from the whole dataset is 0 84 the goodness of fit test described in materials and methods was applied to the 80 samples of pseudo observations u v for each of the six pre selected copula models student t franck clayton plackett galambos and gumbel the summarised results are presented in table 4 based on the log likelihood value the best goodness of fit is provided by the gumbel copula followed by the galambos and franck copulas all the copulas considered have similar performances in terms of statistic sn with the exception of the poor performance of the clayton copula with slightly lower i e better values for the galambos and gumbel copulas the frank copula exhibits the highest number of significant sn values therefore from the analysis of the overall fitting the galambos gumbel and frank copulas seem to provide similar performances a further criterion of choice was based on the analysis of the upper tail dependence for these copulas it should be noted that the frank copula does not admit tail dependence i e the limit indicated by eq 8 is always zero while for the galambos and gumbel copulas λu is greater than 0 and depends on the copula parameter θ λu 2 21 θ the graphical analysis of the plot of pseudo observations black dots for the examples in fig 5 indicates the presence of a certain concentration of points corresponding to extremely high values thus suggesting the existence of upper tail dependence also the non parametric estimation of λ ˆ u c f g obtained from the 80 observed samples indicates the presence of upper tail dependence λ ˆ u c f g 0 therefore the frank copula despite a good description of the overall dependence structure does not appear to be a correct choice for the analysis of extreme events which are usually the focus of a risk assessment the final choice between the galambos and the gumbel copulas was obtained by a graphical comparison between the 80 values of λ ˆ u c f g and the corresponding λu fig 6 from which it is evident that the gumbel copula is a better choice than the galambos the overall goodness of fit of the gumbel copula can be also observed in the examples presented in fig 5 where the pseudo observations black dots are plotted together with an equivalent number of pairs u v randomly generated from the corresponding parameterised gumbel copula empty dots therefore the dependence structure between d and s was always modelled by the gumbel copula whose general equation is 13 c u v e x p ln u θ ln v θ 1 θ where θ is the copula parameter here estimated by the mpl method for a given sample of pseudo observations by replacing u and v in eq 13 with the parameterised cumulative gamma distributions eq 12 of d and s respectively the complete copula models dependence structure marginal distributions were obtained 3 3 example of application of the copula model for irrigation planning the direct application of the copula model eq 13 enables the estimation of the joint probability p d d s s for a given locality and irrigation strategy a graphical example of this result is presented in the contour graphs of fig 7 for the localities of compignano and gubbio and for strategy 1 rainfed and strategy 7 these two localities are characterised by quite different climatic conditions drier in compignano than in gubbio table 1 and of course the water stress expected under strategy 1 and 7 is very different due to these differences the same water stress condition d s corresponds to very different values of the cumulative joint probability p d d s s in particular it is interesting to observe that the adoption of strategy 7 in compignano fig 7b leads to a probabilistic behaviour of the drought events similar to that expected under rainfed conditions in gubbio fig 7c the copula models were finally applied to investigate the effect of the climate and the irrigation strategy on the d and s values expected for a given return period with this aim a tds of 10 years was considered in eq 11 using an iterative procedure to retrieve the corresponding pairs of d and s in particular since various combinations of duration and severity can have the same return period this comparison is typically performed using contour lines fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 shows a comparison of the contour lines related to the rainfed strategy in the different localities of course the drought risk can be considered higher when both d and s are higher for example it is evident that the risk is higher in compignano and orvieto than in any other locality in particular in these localities drought events having a severity of about 300 mm and duration of about 150 days are expected every 10 years other comparisons such as those characterised by intersecting contour lines e g terni vs scerni spoleto vs chieti lead to more interesting observations in general it can be assumed that the higher the drought severity the higher is the impact on the crop for this reason the drought risk under rainfed conditions can be considered lower in chieti than in spoleto and lower in scerni than in terni but the contour lines of spoleto and terni also indicate that in these localities high levels of severity can be reached with relatively short durations denoting an higher probability of intense events less tolerable by crops steduto et al 2012 these observations underline the importance of multivariate analyses for a proper understanding of the drought phenomenon fig 9 shows the contour lines of the pairs d s having a 10 year return focusing on the differences between the irrigation strategies on the basis of the above mentioned criteria the best strategies at each location and for each group 1 or 2 interventions have been marked in bold for group 1 strategy 3 irrigation at the end of june usually leads to the lowest values of both d and s in some localities strategy 4 e g chieti penne gubbio and orvieto and strategy 2 e g terni led to results very similar to those of strategy 3 for group 1 as expected the worst strategy is 5 irrigation at the end of august due to irrigation occurring too late in the season when a significant deficit has already been accumulated for group 2 the best strategy is usually 7 irrigation at the end of both june and july even if the strategies 6 and 9 frequently lead to similar results both strategies 8 and 10 are usually not very effective since they include as with strategy 5 irrigation at the end of august 3 4 probability of consecutive severe drought events in the previous sections drought events with given characteristics d and s were analysed without taking their time sequence into account however the time sequence is relevant to drought analysis and water resource management this type of analysis is often considered in literature with the aim of identifying suitable drought forecasting models usually based on the application of markov chains and on standardised indices e g paulo et al 2005 a fundamental step in the definition of this type of model is the quantification of the transition probabilities from one drought class to another a similar approach is considered here discussing in more detail the results presented in the previous sections and in particular also taking into account the impact of the different strategies on the occurrence of consecutive severe drought events for this purpose the drought events de were arbitrarily classified in three duration classes low l if d 10 days medium m if 10 d 50 days and high h if d 50 days in the literature e g paulo et al 2005 the drought classes have usually been defined in terms of severity but in the present study the duration is more convenient since the same classes can be adopted to classify the non drought events nde that by definition always follows a drought event the severity for a nde is always 0 moreover once the duration class of the de is defined the corresponding probabilistic behaviour of the severity can be easily described thanks to the identified copula functions in fact the conditional probability of severity given that the drought duration exceeding a certain threshold d is 14 p s s d d f s s c f d d f s s 1 f d d to explore the probability of consecutive severe drought events the following transition probabilities p1 and p2 were estimated by a sample frequency analysis for each strategy and location p1 is the probability that a high duration de at time t is followed by a low duration nde at time t 1 15 p1 p ndet 1 l det h the higher the value of p1 the greater is the expected impact because there are fewer possibilities for the crop to recover after the stress period the previous condition is further aggravated if at the time t 2 a de of class h or m occurs therefore this transition probability has also been evaluated as p2 16 p2 p det 2 h or det 2 m det h and ndet 1 l as for p1 the higher the p2 value the worse is the expected overall impact of drought conditions for the sake of simplicity the values of p1 and p2 for each strategy are only presented in fig 10 for the exemplificative location compignano for which the estimation of the transition probabilities is more reliable thanks to the relevant number of drought events the information obtained from fig 10 can be used for a more detailed evaluation of the strategies which according to the previous analysis presented in fig 9 have similar performances e g 2 and 3 for group 1 and 6 7 9 for group 2 the results presented in fig 10 indicate that for strategy 3 the occurrence of severe consecutive drought events is slightly higher than for strategy 2 therefore the overall and long term effect of strategy 2 could be more favourable than that obtained with strategy 3 among the strategies 6 7 and 9 strategy 6 clearly has the lowest values of both p1 and p2 and could therefore be a better strategy than 7 4 conclusions the use of multivariate probabilistic models is becoming common in hydrological studies in this paper a bivariate risk analysis of the duration d and severity s of agricultural drought conditions in olive crops has been described in relation to some localities in central italy the analysis was mainly conducted to show the potential of this type of approach as a tool for the long term planning of irrigation the joint distribution and joint return periods of d and s for olive crops in different localities under different irrigation strategies were analysed and discussed the best irrigation strategies were identified by evaluating the corresponding contour lines of pairs d s having a 10 year return period for the condition d d and s s the lower the values of both d and s the better the strategy among the single irrigation strategies the optimal one is usually represented by an application at the end of june strategy 3 but similar performance can be obtained by an application at the end of may strategy 2 among the double irrigation strategies the optimal one involved two interventions one at the end of june and one at the end of july strategy 7 but similar results are obtained by strategy 6 applications both at the end of may and june considering in the analysis also the possible reduction of the probability of consecutive severe drought events it was instead found that strategy 2 could be better than 3 and that strategy 6 is certainly better than 7 in the paper the effectiveness of the different irrigation strategies was simply assessed on the basis of the joint probabilistic behaviour of the water stress duration and severity without considering the complex physiological implications further advances could be obtained by introducing other variables in the joint analysis for example by taking into account that sensitivity to water stress varies with the crop phenological stage fernandez and moreno 1999 the date of occurrence of water stress could be a useful variable in the development of a more informative three dimensional copula model as an alternative the severity of drought events could be quantified by taking into account suitable weights e g the yield response factors reported by steduto et al 2012 to better calibrate the drought severity to the potential impact on yield in general this type of analysis would benefit from qualitative and or quantitative information on yields in order to obtain a link between the joint probability of drought characteristics and the expected impact on crop productivity declaration of competing interest
