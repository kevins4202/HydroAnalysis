15005,carbapenems are last resort antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections unsuccessfully treated by most common categories of antibiotics in humans most of their dosage is secreted unchanged as waste thereby making its way into the urban water system there are two major knowledge gaps addressed in this study to gain a better understanding of the effects of their residual concentrations on the environment and environmental microbiome development of a uhplc ms ms method of detection and quantification from raw domestic wastewater via direct injection and study of their stability in sewer environment during the transportation from domestic sewers to wastewater treatment plants the uhplc ms ms method was developed for four carbapenems meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem and validation was performed in the range of 0 5 10 μg l for all analytes with limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq values ranging from 0 2 0 5 μg l and 0 8 1 6 μg l respectively laboratory scale rising main rm and gravity sewer gs bioreactors were employed to culture mature biofilms with real wastewater as the feed batch tests were conducted in rm and gs sewer bioreactors fed with carbapenem spiked wastewater to evaluate the stability of carbapenems and compared against those in a control reactor ctl without sewer biofilms over a duration of 12 h significantly higher degradation was observed for all carbapenems in rm and gs reactors 60 80 as opposed to ctl reactor 5 15 which indicates that sewer biofilms play a significant role in the degradation first order kinetics model was applied to the concentration data along with friedman s test and dunn s multiple comparisons analysis to establish degradation patterns and differences in the degradation observed in sewer reactors as per friedman s test there was a statistically significant difference in the degradation of carbapenems observed depending on the reactor type p 0 0017 0 0289 the results from dunn s test indicate that the degradation in the ctl reactor was statistically different from that observed in either rm p 0 0033 0 1088 or gs p 0 0162 0 1088 with the latter two showing insignificant difference in the degradation rates observed p 0 2850 0 5930 the findings contribute to the understanding about the fate of carbapenems in urban wastewater and the potential application of wastewater

belonging to the wider beta lactam antibiotic category which are used to treat multi drug resistant pathogens they are used as last resort antibiotics due to their effectiveness and broad spectrum of activity against gram negative gram positive and anaerobic bacteria wang et al 2020 in recent years pathogenic bacteria have developed resistance to carbapenems carbapenem resistant bacteria with the evidence of carbapenem resistance genes and resistant bacterial isolates in a range of environmental compartments such as wastewater and wastewater impacted marine coastal zones luczkiewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 hospital wastewater chandran et al 2014 rivers and lakes zurfluh et al 2013 sediments marathe et al 2017 soil wang and sun 2014 sludge zhang et al 2019 animal feces and feed getahun e agga 2021 environmental water shah and zahra 2014 drinking water and seepage walsh et al 2011 some gram negative pathogens known to possess carbapenem resistance genes like acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and esbl producing enterobacteriaceae have been identified as water borne ramírez castillo et al 2015 carbapenem resistant gram negative pathogens are of serious concern as they in turn account for total antibiotic resistance adegoke et al 2020 environmental water matrices must therefore be premeditated in estimating emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance pertaining to carbapenem resistant pathogenic bacteria adegoke et al 2020 it is known that microbial communities adapt and evolve with selective environmental pressures resulting from a range of sources including antibiotics studies have also shown that very low environmental concentrations of antimicrobials even below the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of microbes can favor the development of antibiotic resistance bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 gullberg et al 2011 at sub mic level resistance development is not drastic however it can slowly alter the growth and genetic mutations of microbes whereby maintenance and selection for resistant bacteria becomes plausible gullberg et al 2011 for instance the lowest mics for doripenem meropenem and ertapenem have been shown to be 2 μg l for all however the concentrations for resistance selection predicted no effect concentrations were reported to be as low as 0 125 μg l for doripenem ertapenem and 0 064 μg l for meropenem respectively bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 while the data linking observed antibiotic levels to resistance selection is presently lacking for carbapenems the inevitability of resistance development and transfer for carbapenems within environment cannot be ignored sewer networks may serve as a source of transportation and spread of carbapenem residues and carbapenem resistant pathogens from the hospitals manufacturing plants and community into the environment these can also act as a host of antibiotic residues and resistance genes which can potentially turn it into a hotspot for resistance accrual and proliferation mclellan and roguet 2019 sewer networks are essentially composed of major structural elements like pumping stations gravity sewers gs rising main sewers rm and some other components e g manholes septic tanks etc that aid in the transportation from domestic households to wwtps they essentially are dynamic bioreactors with complex physical chemical and biological processes hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 biofilms on the walls of the sewer networks are formed by various biotic and abiotic factors within wastewater that continually reside and transfer through the channels inherent wastewater parameters e g ph dissolved oxygen organic matter solids nutrients and temperature along with the physical factors like pipe dimensions flow rates and hydraulic retention time hrt of wastewater can all impact biofilm development composition and activities schilperoort et al 2012 sharma et al 2013 research has shown that the transformation and degradation of chemical compounds pharmaceuticals hazardous chemicals drugs metabolites and population biomarkers are not only dependent on the characteristics of the carrying wastewater but also that of the highly reactive biofilm activity in sewers mccall et al 2016b o brien et al 2019 much research has been conducted in recent years to delineate the impacts of wastewater properties sewer biofilms and sediments on the in sewer transformation of various wbe biomarkers gao et al 2018 jelic et al 2015b li et al 2018a mccall et al 2016a however the same cannot be said for antibiotics especially the last resort categories like carbapenems as their in sewer degradation and transformation data is absent to study the transformation or degradation of antibiotics like carbapenems sophisticated analytical methods are important due to the required analyte detection capabilities reliability and sensitivity analytical methods have previously been developed for carbapenems in a range of environmental matrices like river water swine wastewater wang et al 2020 drinking water ben jaballah 2022 voigt et al 2020 and lagoon water bedding soil silage liu et al 2017 whereby no carbapenems were observed from river and swine wastewater wang et al 2020 while only one positive silage sample was identified in the second study with an observed concentration of 68 μg kg of ertapenem liu et al 2017 no detection method of carbapenems from domestic wastewater has yet been published however several studies have reported the presence of carbapenem resistance genes carbapenemases in wastewater and wwtps araújo et al 2021 hoelle et al 2019 hrenovic et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 making wastewater a vital matrix to study and evaluate carbapenem residues and resistance the quality of wastewater can be greatly variable due to geographical factors its composition concentration and flow rate friedler et al 2013 some major components of wastewater that can influence the behavior of targeted chemical compounds may include organic materials pesticides fat oil detergents solvents nutrients nitrogen phosphorus ammonium metals mercury lead copper nickel acids bases and microorganisms henze and comeau 2008 to address issues concerning the complexity of the matrix and variability of analyte behavior within the matrix matrix matched quantification has been performed in some recent biological studies kumar et al 2021 liu et al 2019 for a last resort antibiotic colistin similar approach can be applied to quantify carbapenems from wastewater to address the effects of matrix during quantitation quantification methods have been developed for individual carbapenem members from biological matrices barco et al 2015 koal et al 2006 martens lobenhoffer and bode böger 2017 or in combination with one or two other members lefeuvre et al 2017 liu et al 2017 rehm and rentsch 2020 multiple carbapenems have been quantified simultaneously using an in house developed method from river and swine wastewater by one study wang et al 2020 however this study did not incorporate a crucial carbapenem member ertapenem imipenem was the first carbapenem member to be formulated and extensive resistance to it has been reported in recent years kwon et al 2007 oteo et al 2008 zilberberg et al 2010 which has limited its use considering practical factors pertaining to the availability of standards unavailability of faropenem and applicability of current research to future studies only meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem were selected for this study this study therefore aims to develop and validate a method of detection and quantification for carbapenems meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem in wastewater by direct injection using uhplc ms ms and then employ the method to investigate the degradation of carbapenems in domestic wastewater with the presence of sewer biofilms batch tests employed the systematic spiking of carbapenems in wastewater and laboratory scale sewer reactors to determine the degradation of carbapenems in the presence or absence of different types of sewer biofilms findings of this study not only improve the wbe back estimation of carbapenem use by reducing the uncertainties related to biomarker losses in sewers but also contribute to the understanding about the fate of carbapenems in urban wastewater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and standards all chemicals and solvents used for extraction purposes were of lc ms grade these were all used without further purification methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from merck millipore darmstadt germany while formic acid lc ms grade was obtained from thermo fischer scientific pty ltd australia ultrapure water was obtained from milli q iq 7000 ultrapure lab water system installed with emd millipore millipak 0 22 µm filter the reference standards for doripenem 98 purity meropenem 98 purity biapenem 98 purity and ertapenem sodium 98 purity were obtained from sapphire bioscience pty ltd australia stock solutions of mixed reference standards were prepared in milli q water at a concentration of 1 mg ml and stored as multiple aliquots at 20 c for a maximum of one week standards were diluted with milli q water freshly on the day for both calibration and sample analyses 2 2 analytical instrumentation uhplc ms ms a waters acquity ultra high performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a absciex qtrap5500 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms was used to analyze carbapenems separation was carried out using a waters acquity beh c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm id 1 7 μm particle size coupled with an acquity uhplc beh c18 vanguard pre column 5 mm 2 1 mm id 1 7 μm particle size for carbapenems quantification eluents of two mobile phases 0 1 formic acid in water a 0 1 formic acid in acetonitrile b were passed through the column at a flow rate of 0 3 ml min in the following time dependent gradient proportion time min b initial 0 5 1 0 5 3 0 1 30 3 0 3 5 30 and 3 6 5 0 1 the injection volume was 10 μl and the column temperature was 30 c detection was performed through multiple reaction monitoring mrm in the positive ionization mode signal intensity and ms ms fragmentation were optimized using a 10 μg ml solution of a mixed carbapenem standard solution infused using a sge syringe needle trajan scientific australia optimized ionization parameters for all carbapenems included a source temperature of 650 c an ion spray voltage of 5500 v and a curtain gas of 30 psi the analytes were quantified by an external standard method using the highest intensity precursor ion transition table 1 ab sciex analyst software v 1 6 2 was used for calibration data analysis and quantitation purposes 2 3 uhplc ms ms method validation validation was performed by evaluating selectivity linearity calibration curves limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq accuracy recovery precision cv and stability selectivity was identified by analysing 6 individual blank matrix samples wastewater via direct injection to study any interference around the retention times of the target analytes calibration curves were initially generated in both blank matrix and water and matrix effects calculation was performed as per eq 1 these were identified to be significant meropenem 18 1 enhancement doripenem 10 6 suppression biapenem 17 2 enhancement ertapenem 6 9 suppression hence matrix matched calibration was considered more appropriate for quantification to ensure compensation for wastewater induced matrix effects on all analytes 1 m a t r i x e f f e c t s a n a l y t e r e s p o n s e i n w a s t e w a t e r a n a l y t e r e s p o n s e i n w a t e r 1 100 linearity calibration curves was thereby performed by analysing carbapenem standards spiked at concentrations of 0 5 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 μg l in blank matrix matrix matched all quantification was carried out by external calibration curves lod and loq were calculated as the lowest concentrations with a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively intra and inter day accuracy recovery and precision were calculated by analysing 6 identically prepared blank matrix wastewater samples spiked at 4 different concentrations of a mixed carbapenem standard solution 1 0 2 5 5 0 and 10 μg l these were analysed in three separate runs over two different days and measured concentrations were expressed as recovery percentages and relative coefficient of variation cv respectively 2 4 sewer reactor setup operation and parameter testing the laboratory scale sewer bioreactors were employed to mimic the rising main rm and gravity sewer gs conditions figure s2 briefly both reactors had a liquid capacity of 0 75 l rm 80 mm d 150 mm h gs 80 mm d 200 mm h 150 mm water depth plus 50 mm head space and were made of perspex the rm reactor was operated under anaerobic conditions to mimic anaerobic sewers by keeping the setup airtight while the gs reactor was kept partially filled with wastewater to allow a gas phase and to mimic gravity sewers with both anaerobic and aerobic sections biofilm carriers of 10 mm diameter were suspended on three stainless steel rods to aid with the surface availability for biofilm growth the total biofilm area in each reactor was approximately 0 05 m2 while the area to volume ratio was 70 9 m2 m3 the sewer reactors were shown to have biological activities similar to typical real sewer conditions choi et al 2020 li et al 2018b o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 shi et al 2022 biofilm cultivation was achieved by regular feeding the rm and gs reactors with domestic wastewater for 6 months while no flow was subjected to the control reactor to maintain biofilm free conditions the feed wastewater was collected fortnightly from the inlet of wollongong wwtp australia the typical wastewater properties measured are outlined in table 2 wastewater was stored at 4 c after every fortnightly collection and was fed into the reactors every 6 h a typical hrt of wastewater in sewers after being heated up to room temperature 22 c using a water bath set at 35 c with titanium heating coils using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s all pumping events were set to last for 2 min to account for a feed volume equivalent to the reactor volume 0 75 l and magnetic stirring mls8 velp scientifica italy was performed at 250 rpm in each reactor to facilitate continuous mixing of wastewater biofilm activity was verified in rm and gs reactors by testing for relevant parameters ph do tss vss sulfate soluble cod and total cod to ensure a steady condition prior to batch tests for carbapenem degradation 2 5 reactor batch tests for carbapenem degradability batch tests were performed in triplicate by feeding wastewater spiked to 10 μg l with mixed standard solution of carbapenems prepared in water and was immediately pumped into the reactors using the peristaltic pump to avoid any undue degradation or transformation within the wastewater the control reactor figure s2 was treated the same as the other reactors and fed with spiked raw wastewater the only difference being the absence of the biofilm component continuous mixing was ensured in all reactors 250 rpm to maintain homogeneity of the resident wastewater after the feeding event reached the appropriate volume of each reactor the pumping was halted and samples were withdrawn at 0 0 5 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h following the pumping event in addition ph and sulfate reduction was monitored for the first hour to inform on the biological activity of the biofilm in both reactors collected samples were immediately filtered using 0 22 μm pes membrane filter sarstedt australia into 1 5 ml hplc vials and frozen at 20 c prior to uhplc ms ms analysis 2 6 data analysis the degradability of all four carbapenems in sewer reactors were assessed by comparing the concentration observed at time point t c t with that observed at time point 0 initial spiked concentration c 0 for all analytes via uhplc ms ms percentage compared to initial concentration of all analytes at any given time point was thus calculated as c t c 0 10 0 first order kinetics one phase degradation were applied to the above calculated concentration data using graphpad prism 9 version 9 3 1 to determine the best fit for degradability of all target analytes i e carbapenems the goodness of fit for all analytes was examined by their respective r2 values for the simplification of equation used and further calculations the plateau was set to 0 and all values were interpreted by the model accordingly the equation used to calculate concentration of carbapenems at a given time using the one phase degradation model li et al 2018b is as shown in eq 2 below 2 c t c 0 e k t c 0 e k w w k b i o t where k h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant representing the overall degradation of carbapenems observed in sewer reactors chemical and or biological kww h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in wastewater alone and was estimated based on the data obtained from the control reactor kbio h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in the presence of sewer biofilms i e rm and gs reactors and was estimated using data obtained from rm and gs bioreactors kbio h 1 can be classified under two categories depending on the biofilm type as highlighted in eq 3 below 3 k b i o k b i o a n k b i o a where kbio an h 1 is the degradation rate constant in the presence of anerobic biofilm rm while kbio a h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in the presence of aerobic biofilm gs furthermore half life data t 50 was obtained from the one phase degradation model also t 10 and t 90 were calculated as shown below in eq 4 and 5 4 t 10 l n 0 1 k 5 t 90 l n 0 9 k friedman s test non parametric coupled with dunn s multiple comparisons was performed to compare impacts of sewer conditions rm gs and ctl on the degradation of all carbapenems using graphpad prism 9 version 9 3 1 p values obtained from this analysis were interpreted to outline significance in degradation observed between reactor types 3 results and discussion 3 1 uhplc ms ms method development and sample preparation as the developed method follows direct injection methodology samples were filtered with 0 22 μm pes membrane filter to ensure suitability and cleaner extracts for uhplc ms ms analysis ms parameters were optimized by injecting a 10 μg ml carbapenem mixed standard solution prepared in water in a steam of lc flow rate of 0 3 μl min the ms scans were all acquired using a positive electrospray ionization mode for better sensitivity and resolution as all analytes exhibited the most intense ms signal for their singly positively charged ion m h as similarly evidenced by previous research carlier et al 2014 pickering and brown 2013 wang et al 2020 compound identity and retention time was confirmed by using their respective two transitions of highest intensities while compound quantification was carried using only the transition of the highest intensity the transitions and optimized ms parameters used for all target analytes are presented in table 1 after several iterations of chromatography columns elution mobile phase types composition and elution gradient data not shown all targeted carbapenems compounds were found to elute under optimized conditions section 2 2 by 3 4 min selected lc column acquity beh allowed for good separation and resolution for all target analytes allowing for a total method run time of only 5 minutes including column re equilibration time during optimization the addition of acid in both the mobile phases 0 1 formic acid was adopted as it significantly improved lc peak shape and enhanced intensity of the ms signal refer to figure s3 for uhplc chromatograms of all carbapenems analysed the analytical instrumentation uhplc ms ms possesses the disadvantage of a relatively higher limit of detection and quantification usually in µg l range when the direct injection is performed complex sample matrices like urban wastewater can also affect the integrity of the instrument and analytical column s performance via the direct injection methodology the expected concentrations of carbapenems in real wastewater may be lower than the spiking concentration in this study for greater sample clean up and successful quantification of carbapenems at realistic and lower soluble concentrations sophisticated and targeted sample preparation techniques like solid phase extraction can be employed for future studies 3 2 uhplc ms ms method validation the results from the method validation are summarized in table 3 matrix blank wastewater samples analysed for specificity showed no interference within 1 minute of the retention time of any target analyte thereby verifying selectivity of the method developed calibration curves generated in blank matrix showed a good linear fit for all analytes with r2 ranging from 0 9986 to 0 9996 intra and inter day accuracy and precision measured at 1 2 5 5 and 10 μg l concentration was under the recommended range with recoveries ranging from 93 9 to 109 8 and cv ranging between 5 1 13 4 for all analytes the analytes all showed stability 95 over a period of 24 h in blank matrix at neutral ph refer to the table s2 and s3 for full validation data including the 24 h stability analysis and figure s4 for matrix matched calibration curves for all carbapenems 3 3 biological activities and biofilm characterization in sewer reactors this study for the first time revealed the degradation of carbapenems under the influence of sewer biofilms in real wastewater it is well known that transformation and degradation of chemical compounds like population biomarkers is enhanced by the activity of the predominant microbial communities found in biofilms i e sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea li et al 2019 mccall et al 2016a mccall et al 2016b for instance studies have reported a higher transformation rate of some biomarkers amphetamine 6 acetylcodeine norketamine mephedrone in sewer in the presence of biofilms in comparison to chemical or physical processes gao et al 2017b mccall et al 2016b this study showed the significant role of sewer biofilms in enhancing the degradation of carbapenems the measured degradation kinetics can be applied to the back estimation of wastewater based epidemiology for a higher accuracy two sewer reactors with biofilms rm and gs were used in this study along with a control reactor ctl to assess the role of biofilms in the degradation of carbapenems figure s2 the reactivity and maturity of biofilm in both reactors was verified by evaluating their sulfate reduction rates figure s1 ph and cod over a duration of 6 h typical hrt for sewers the results from preliminary sewer tests are summarized in table s1 the obtained results confirmed that the reactors showed suitability for testing and had attained semi steady state in terms of sulfate reducing rate jiang et al 2011 li et al 2018b rm sewers usually form anaerobic biofilms due to being fully filled with wastewater gs on the other hand being partially filled with wastewater and relying on gravity driven flow facilitates both anaerobic and aerobic conditions hvitved jacobsen 2001 rm reactor induced to anaerobic conditions showed biological activities of sulfate reducing bacteria 5 0 mg s l h and tcod scod in the range of 300 500 mg l and 50 150 mg l respectively which is comparable with previous studies o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 additionally gs reactor is known to incorporate both aerobic and anaerobic conditions which can be confirmed by its low sulfate reduction 2 7 mg s l h o brien et al 2017 dissolved oxygen measured in the wastewater in gs was slightly lower than that in wastewater alone 0 6 mg l which points towards oxygen consumption due to aerobic activity as was highlighted by previous research o brien et al 2017 the results all verified the biofilm conditions for a similar laboratory scale bioreactor setup and typical real sewer conditions choi et al 2020 o brien et al 2017 shi et al 2022 in addition sulfate reduction rate and ph were monitored over the first 1 h of each of the triplicate batch tests to inform on biological activities of the biofilm the results also indicated that presence of carbapenems at the spiked concentration did not influence the biological activity of sewer biofilms factors affecting the integrity and composition of biofilms in turn affect the degradation transformation of chemical compounds like antibiotics one study evaluated the role of aerobic or anaerobic biofilms on the transformation of biomarkers and concluded that the microbial transformation is dependent on the redox condition for most of the evaluated biomarkers morphine glucuronide codeine narcodeine ramin et al 2016 similarly another study evaluated the effects wastewater conditions like ph temperature and suspended solids on the transformation of biomarkers and concluded that the rate of biological and ph induced transformation was quite significant in comparison to that of temperature and suspended solids related activity li et al 2021 real sewers were employed for a range of experiments to study the transformation of chemical compounds under uncontrolled and or limited conditions gao et al 2019 jelic et al 2015a li et al 2019 however studying in sewer stability of antibiotics poses great challenges with difficulties in practical conduct control quantification and interpretation of results pilot sewers were employed for some studies to evaluate chemical transformation of compounds but similar restrictions follow their employability in studies along with accessibility related concerns gao et al 2018 li et al 2018a in comparison laboratory scale sewer reactors can be operated under well controlled conditions with a range of operational and wastewater properties feed biofilms hrt temperature ph etc choi et al 2020 jiang et al 2011 jiang et al 2009 various studies have employed the use of laboratory scale rm and gs reactors and assessed the stability of targeted compounds by comparing the sewer type rm vs gs sewer condition anaerobic vs aerobic biomass suspended sludge vs biofilm and wastewater properties gao et al 2017a mccall et al 2016b o brien et al 2017 ramin et al 2017 ramin et al 2016 thai et al 2014 however the degradation data obtained in this study is only reproducible to an extent as the a v ratio of a typical sewer is about 2 10 times lower than that of the laboratory sewer reactors 70 9 m2 m3 employed in this study o brien et al 2017 a high a v ratio may enable greater interaction between the biofilm component and carbapenems potentially triggering higher degradation in rm gs more research is needed to identify the significance and impact of differing a v ratios on biofilm induced degradation of carbapenems thai et al 2014 not much evidence exists at present to investigate stability or degradation of compounds in larger sewer systems like pressure sewers with dynamic hydraulics and controlled hrt hence real sewer research is crucial to validate the data obtained from laboratory scale setups li et al 2018b 3 4 degradation of carbapenems in sewer reactors the degradation of four carbapenem members namely meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem was investigated in two bioreactor types rm and gs mimicking typical sewer conditions in comparison to wastewater only condition ctl reactor without sewer biofilms fig 1 studying the degradation of vital last resort antibiotics like carbapenems within the sewer network addresses a multitude of concerns surrounding their environmental presence and persistence and consequential selection for clinically highly relevant antibiotic resistances carbapenem resistance is an severe emerging issue owing to its accompanied extensive drug resistance and potential to lead to total drug resistance via exposure to residual antibiotics mutagens metals and biocides adegoke et al 2020 it has therefore become vital to understand the distribution of their concentrations in the environment and their relative impact on environmental microbiome dissemination of resistance genes and residual antibiotics may be facilitated into the environment via wastewater and sewer networks adegoke et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 degradation of carbapenems within sewers whether chemical or biological may help counteract the selection of resistance amongst microbial communities within the sewer environment this may also prevent transfer of resistance from environmental microbiome to the pathogens of concern via horizontal gene transfer due to a decline in the exposed carbapenem concentrations all of the above further emphasize the need for more focused research in this area for the observed results it was noted that one phase degradation model fits well with the degradation data from all three sewer reactors fig 1 the r2 values for all analytes in rm and gs reactors were 0 81 indicating a strong compliance to the first order kinetics model while the results from run s test p values imply that the deviation of results from the chosen regression model was insignificant table 4 r2 for ctl reactor results were low 0 5357 due to the little variability of the temporal concentrations of analytes with higher stability from their relative concentrations it is evident that 60 80 of degradation was observed within rm and gs reactors over the testing duration of 12 h as opposed to the ctl reactor which only showed a degradation in the range of 5 15 for all carbapenems the results are consistent with other previous studies where degradation was observed for different antibiotics pharmaceutical compounds illicit drugs and their metabolites in laboratory scale sewer reactors in the presence of biofilms li et al 2018b o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 table 4 shows the values of degradation constants k ww k bio an and k bio a estimated for all carbapenems using the model as per eq 1 and 2 from the observed data it can be clearly established that the degradation rate observed in wastewater alone ctl was much lower than the degradation rate in either rm k bio an or gs k bio a fig 2 also the degradation rate in rm k bio an is higher than gs k bio a for meropenem doripenem and biapenem this implies the anaerobic biofilms and microorganisms in rm sewers might lead to higher degradation of these three carbapenem members the lowest degradation rate observed was for ertapenem with k ww of 0 0058 h 1 while biapenem showed the highest degradation in wastewater with a k ww of 0 0183 h 1 as can be confirmed by the degradation trend established above however ertapenem showed comparable or slightly higher degradation rate in both rm k bio an 0 1037 h 1 and gs k bio a 0 1142 h 1 amongst all other carbapenem members it is interesting that biological degradation for ertapenem in gs is higher than rm which shows the significant role of the type of sewer biofilms and the diverse degradation patterns even within the same carbapenem antibiotic group studies conducted with laboratory scale sewer reactors at room temperature found that some chemicals remain stable with little to no degradation observed in rm gs ctl acesulfame atenolol carbamazepine gabapentin ibuprofen o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 some unstable under all conditions frusemide 76 degradation in 12 h iopromide 50 degradation in 16 h o brien et al 2017 while the others are comparatively stable in wastewater ctl than in sewer environment caffeine 87 99 degradation in 12 h in gs rm codeine 89 98 degradation in gs rm banks et al 2018 o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 all carbapenems showed 10 degradation t 10 after the first hour under rising main condition t 10 0 8 1 0 h with their values comparable to the t 10 observed in gravity sewer 0 9 1 1 h table 4 meropenem doripenem and biapenem showed longer half lives by 0 9 1 4 h in gravity sewer as opposed to rising main sewer in contrast ertapenem was slightly more stable under rm condition t 50 rm 6 3 h t 50 gs 5 8 h none of the carbapenems showed 90 degradation t 90 within the testing duration of 12 h the trend observed in the t 10 values for all carbapenem members except for ertapenem were consistent with respect to their t 90 values i e all except for ertapenem t 90 rm 16 8 18 6 h showed higher stability under gs environment t 90 gs 19 5 23 2 h under control condition meropenem doripenem and biapenem showed 10 degradation within the testing duration which is nearly 7 8 times longer than in sewer biofilm reactors t 10 ctl 5 8 6 4 h ertapenem showed a higher stability with t 10 18 1 h in the control reactor the half lives for all members within ctl environment ranged from 38 0 to 119 3 h while their t 90 values ranged from 126 2 to 396 4 h with the highest and the lowest stabilities observed for ertapenem and biapenem respectively typically one way anova and two way anova analysis are performed to identify differences between two or more variable groups respectively in this instance two way anova would be appropriate to compare the degradation observed between the three variable groups i e rm gs and ctl reactors however two way anova assumes that the population from which the samples were drawn is normally distributed i e it follows gaussian distribution which in turn implies that distribution of sample means is close to a normal gaussian distribution this underlying assumption isn t compliant with the observations from this degradation study as the regression analysis clearly shows that the variability between reactors was significant with significant loss of concentrations of targeted carbapenems observed in reactors with and without biofilms hence non parametric analysis was chosen for the given data to compare the significance of degradation between reactors non parametric test was performed for three matched groups rm gs ctl and friedman s test p values were obtained as a result table 5 however this test ranks the values from low to high and only looks at the distribution of sum of ranks between groups hence it cannot be used to compare degradability between individual reactors for that purpose dunn s multiple comparisons test was used to determine the significance of degradation observed between the reactors with biofilm rm gs and that without ctl table 5 as per friedman s test there was a statistically significant difference in the degradation of carbapenems observed depending on the reactor type p 0 0017 0 0289 furthermore the results from dunn s test indicate that the degradation in the ctl reactor was statistically different from that observed in either rm p 0 0033 0 1088 or gs p 0 0162 0 1088 with the latter two showing non significant difference in the degradation rates observed p 0 2850 0 5930 another approach to draw a comparison is to assume an approximate gaussian distribution of data and perform parametric analysis tukey s multiple comparisons test was therefore conducted with two way anova in graphpad prism 9 table s4 the p values obtained in the test for ctl vs rm or ctl vs gs showed statistical difference p 0 05 with values ranging from 0 003 0 03 however values obtained from the rm vs gs analysis obtained p values in the range of 0 75 0 94 for different carbapenems showing no statistical significance p 0 05 in the degradation rate hence tukey s test further establishes that the degradation observed between rm and gs was similar to one another but significantly different to that detected in the ctl reactor no in sewer research has been performed for carbapenems till date thus making it impossible to perform comparative analysis properties like ph do hrt and sewer conditions anaerobic aerobic can also influence the biofilm conditions and thus the stability of target analytes jelic et al 2015a mccall et al 2016c for instance in sample stability studies have demonstrated that ph fluctuations can play a significant role in deciding the fate of chemical compounds prone to hydrolysis baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 senta et al 2014 changes in temperature can alter dissolved oxygen viscosity diffusion and hence have a combined impact on the in sewer processes and the rate of degradation of chemical compounds baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 li et al 2021 senta et al 2014 some studies have also demonstrated that analyte sorption does not affect their transformation in wastewater matrices to a significant extent baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 chen et al 2013 mccall et al 2016b it is also known that sewage hrt can determine the rate of degradation of population biomarkers and potentially antibiotics depending on their residence times and duration of contact with biofilms li et al 2018b hence future research needs to evaluate the impacts of inherent wastewater properties on the degradation of carbapenems in sewer it has been clearly established that the degradation of carbapenems in reactors with biofilms rm gs was significantly higher than that observed in the biofilm free reactor ctl the observed degradation could be due to a multitude of factors chemical or biological the complexity of the matrix along with the presence of biofilm plays a significant role in determining the fate and transformation of carbapenems however the underlying mechanisms such as microbial induced degradation and bioaccumulation cannot be disregarded unfortunately there is a significant lack of data on the transformation products of carbapenems in the sewer which constitutes a major gap in our understanding future studies can therefore work on analysing individual biofilm carriers to establish the extent of sorption of carbapenems onto biofilms plus evaluate the magnitude of degradation enzymes released into the reservoir volume facilitating the decomposition of carbapenems 4 conclusions this study established and validated an analytical method uhplc ms ms of carbapenem in wastewater to assess the degradation of four carbapenem members meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem in sewer reactors with different biofilms the degradation of target analytes was determined and compared between reactors with anaerobic aerobic biofilms and in wastewater only the conclusions are the uhplc ms ms direct injection method was developed and validated in the range of 0 5 10 μg l for four carbapenem members with lod and loq values ranging from 0 2 0 5 μg l and 0 8 1 6 μg l respectively both rising main and gravity sewer biofilms significantly enhanced the degradation of carbapenems in wastewater from 5 15 to 60 80 in 12 hours the degradation rate constant for biofilm reactors k bio 0 07 0 11 was significantly higher than the degradation rate constant for biofilm free reactor k ww 0 005 0 01 with p 0 002 0 030 for different carbapenems the degradation pattern of meropenem doripenem and biapenem was similar with biological degradation in rising main sewer reactor slightly higher than that in gravity sewer reactor however the biodegradation of ertapenem is opposite to this pattern the findings suggest that sewer conditions play an important role in the extent of antibiotic degradation during the wastewater transportation in sewers further study about the effects of other environmental or wastewater parameters is required to ensure a more

15005,carbapenems are last resort antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections unsuccessfully treated by most common categories of antibiotics in humans most of their dosage is secreted unchanged as waste thereby making its way into the urban water system there are two major knowledge gaps addressed in this study to gain a better understanding of the effects of their residual concentrations on the environment and environmental microbiome development of a uhplc ms ms method of detection and quantification from raw domestic wastewater via direct injection and study of their stability in sewer environment during the transportation from domestic sewers to wastewater treatment plants the uhplc ms ms method was developed for four carbapenems meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem and validation was performed in the range of 0 5 10 μg l for all analytes with limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq values ranging from 0 2 0 5 μg l and 0 8 1 6 μg l respectively laboratory scale rising main rm and gravity sewer gs bioreactors were employed to culture mature biofilms with real wastewater as the feed batch tests were conducted in rm and gs sewer bioreactors fed with carbapenem spiked wastewater to evaluate the stability of carbapenems and compared against those in a control reactor ctl without sewer biofilms over a duration of 12 h significantly higher degradation was observed for all carbapenems in rm and gs reactors 60 80 as opposed to ctl reactor 5 15 which indicates that sewer biofilms play a significant role in the degradation first order kinetics model was applied to the concentration data along with friedman s test and dunn s multiple comparisons analysis to establish degradation patterns and differences in the degradation observed in sewer reactors as per friedman s test there was a statistically significant difference in the degradation of carbapenems observed depending on the reactor type p 0 0017 0 0289 the results from dunn s test indicate that the degradation in the ctl reactor was statistically different from that observed in either rm p 0 0033 0 1088 or gs p 0 0162 0 1088 with the latter two showing insignificant difference in the degradation rates observed p 0 2850 0 5930 the findings contribute to the understanding about the fate of carbapenems in urban wastewater and the potential application of wastewater

belonging to the wider beta lactam antibiotic category which are used to treat multi drug resistant pathogens they are used as last resort antibiotics due to their effectiveness and broad spectrum of activity against gram negative gram positive and anaerobic bacteria wang et al 2020 in recent years pathogenic bacteria have developed resistance to carbapenems carbapenem resistant bacteria with the evidence of carbapenem resistance genes and resistant bacterial isolates in a range of environmental compartments such as wastewater and wastewater impacted marine coastal zones luczkiewicz et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 hospital wastewater chandran et al 2014 rivers and lakes zurfluh et al 2013 sediments marathe et al 2017 soil wang and sun 2014 sludge zhang et al 2019 animal feces and feed getahun e agga 2021 environmental water shah and zahra 2014 drinking water and seepage walsh et al 2011 some gram negative pathogens known to possess carbapenem resistance genes like acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and esbl producing enterobacteriaceae have been identified as water borne ramírez castillo et al 2015 carbapenem resistant gram negative pathogens are of serious concern as they in turn account for total antibiotic resistance adegoke et al 2020 environmental water matrices must therefore be premeditated in estimating emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance pertaining to carbapenem resistant pathogenic bacteria adegoke et al 2020 it is known that microbial communities adapt and evolve with selective environmental pressures resulting from a range of sources including antibiotics studies have also shown that very low environmental concentrations of antimicrobials even below the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of microbes can favor the development of antibiotic resistance bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 gullberg et al 2011 at sub mic level resistance development is not drastic however it can slowly alter the growth and genetic mutations of microbes whereby maintenance and selection for resistant bacteria becomes plausible gullberg et al 2011 for instance the lowest mics for doripenem meropenem and ertapenem have been shown to be 2 μg l for all however the concentrations for resistance selection predicted no effect concentrations were reported to be as low as 0 125 μg l for doripenem ertapenem and 0 064 μg l for meropenem respectively bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 while the data linking observed antibiotic levels to resistance selection is presently lacking for carbapenems the inevitability of resistance development and transfer for carbapenems within environment cannot be ignored sewer networks may serve as a source of transportation and spread of carbapenem residues and carbapenem resistant pathogens from the hospitals manufacturing plants and community into the environment these can also act as a host of antibiotic residues and resistance genes which can potentially turn it into a hotspot for resistance accrual and proliferation mclellan and roguet 2019 sewer networks are essentially composed of major structural elements like pumping stations gravity sewers gs rising main sewers rm and some other components e g manholes septic tanks etc that aid in the transportation from domestic households to wwtps they essentially are dynamic bioreactors with complex physical chemical and biological processes hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 biofilms on the walls of the sewer networks are formed by various biotic and abiotic factors within wastewater that continually reside and transfer through the channels inherent wastewater parameters e g ph dissolved oxygen organic matter solids nutrients and temperature along with the physical factors like pipe dimensions flow rates and hydraulic retention time hrt of wastewater can all impact biofilm development composition and activities schilperoort et al 2012 sharma et al 2013 research has shown that the transformation and degradation of chemical compounds pharmaceuticals hazardous chemicals drugs metabolites and population biomarkers are not only dependent on the characteristics of the carrying wastewater but also that of the highly reactive biofilm activity in sewers mccall et al 2016b o brien et al 2019 much research has been conducted in recent years to delineate the impacts of wastewater properties sewer biofilms and sediments on the in sewer transformation of various wbe biomarkers gao et al 2018 jelic et al 2015b li et al 2018a mccall et al 2016a however the same cannot be said for antibiotics especially the last resort categories like carbapenems as their in sewer degradation and transformation data is absent to study the transformation or degradation of antibiotics like carbapenems sophisticated analytical methods are important due to the required analyte detection capabilities reliability and sensitivity analytical methods have previously been developed for carbapenems in a range of environmental matrices like river water swine wastewater wang et al 2020 drinking water ben jaballah 2022 voigt et al 2020 and lagoon water bedding soil silage liu et al 2017 whereby no carbapenems were observed from river and swine wastewater wang et al 2020 while only one positive silage sample was identified in the second study with an observed concentration of 68 μg kg of ertapenem liu et al 2017 no detection method of carbapenems from domestic wastewater has yet been published however several studies have reported the presence of carbapenem resistance genes carbapenemases in wastewater and wwtps araújo et al 2021 hoelle et al 2019 hrenovic et al 2017 rodríguez et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 making wastewater a vital matrix to study and evaluate carbapenem residues and resistance the quality of wastewater can be greatly variable due to geographical factors its composition concentration and flow rate friedler et al 2013 some major components of wastewater that can influence the behavior of targeted chemical compounds may include organic materials pesticides fat oil detergents solvents nutrients nitrogen phosphorus ammonium metals mercury lead copper nickel acids bases and microorganisms henze and comeau 2008 to address issues concerning the complexity of the matrix and variability of analyte behavior within the matrix matrix matched quantification has been performed in some recent biological studies kumar et al 2021 liu et al 2019 for a last resort antibiotic colistin similar approach can be applied to quantify carbapenems from wastewater to address the effects of matrix during quantitation quantification methods have been developed for individual carbapenem members from biological matrices barco et al 2015 koal et al 2006 martens lobenhoffer and bode böger 2017 or in combination with one or two other members lefeuvre et al 2017 liu et al 2017 rehm and rentsch 2020 multiple carbapenems have been quantified simultaneously using an in house developed method from river and swine wastewater by one study wang et al 2020 however this study did not incorporate a crucial carbapenem member ertapenem imipenem was the first carbapenem member to be formulated and extensive resistance to it has been reported in recent years kwon et al 2007 oteo et al 2008 zilberberg et al 2010 which has limited its use considering practical factors pertaining to the availability of standards unavailability of faropenem and applicability of current research to future studies only meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem were selected for this study this study therefore aims to develop and validate a method of detection and quantification for carbapenems meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem in wastewater by direct injection using uhplc ms ms and then employ the method to investigate the degradation of carbapenems in domestic wastewater with the presence of sewer biofilms batch tests employed the systematic spiking of carbapenems in wastewater and laboratory scale sewer reactors to determine the degradation of carbapenems in the presence or absence of different types of sewer biofilms findings of this study not only improve the wbe back estimation of carbapenem use by reducing the uncertainties related to biomarker losses in sewers but also contribute to the understanding about the fate of carbapenems in urban wastewater systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals reagents and standards all chemicals and solvents used for extraction purposes were of lc ms grade these were all used without further purification methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from merck millipore darmstadt germany while formic acid lc ms grade was obtained from thermo fischer scientific pty ltd australia ultrapure water was obtained from milli q iq 7000 ultrapure lab water system installed with emd millipore millipak 0 22 µm filter the reference standards for doripenem 98 purity meropenem 98 purity biapenem 98 purity and ertapenem sodium 98 purity were obtained from sapphire bioscience pty ltd australia stock solutions of mixed reference standards were prepared in milli q water at a concentration of 1 mg ml and stored as multiple aliquots at 20 c for a maximum of one week standards were diluted with milli q water freshly on the day for both calibration and sample analyses 2 2 analytical instrumentation uhplc ms ms a waters acquity ultra high performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a absciex qtrap5500 triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer uhplc ms ms was used to analyze carbapenems separation was carried out using a waters acquity beh c18 column 100 mm 2 1 mm id 1 7 μm particle size coupled with an acquity uhplc beh c18 vanguard pre column 5 mm 2 1 mm id 1 7 μm particle size for carbapenems quantification eluents of two mobile phases 0

3 0 1 30 3 0 3 5 30 and 3 6 5 0 1 the injection volume was 10 μl and the column temperature was 30 c detection was performed through multiple reaction monitoring mrm in the positive ionization mode signal intensity and ms ms fragmentation were optimized using a 10 μg ml solution of a mixed carbapenem standard solution infused using a sge syringe needle trajan scientific australia optimized ionization parameters for all carbapenems included a source temperature of 650 c an ion spray voltage of 5500 v and a curtain gas of 30 psi the analytes were quantified by an external standard method using the highest intensity precursor ion transition table 1 ab sciex analyst software v 1 6 2 was used for calibration data analysis and quantitation purposes 2 3 uhplc ms ms method validation validation was performed by evaluating selectivity linearity calibration curves limit of detection lod limit of quantification loq accuracy recovery precision cv and stability selectivity was identified by analysing 6 individual blank matrix samples wastewater via direct injection to study any interference around the retention times of the target analytes calibration curves were initially generated in both blank matrix and water and matrix effects calculation was performed as per eq 1 these were identified to be significant meropenem 18 1 enhancement doripenem 10 6 suppression biapenem 17 2 enhancement ertapenem 6 9 suppression hence matrix matched calibration was considered more appropriate for quantification to ensure compensation for wastewater induced matrix effects on all analytes 1 m a t r i x e f f e c t s a n a l y t e r e s p o n s e i n w a s t e w a t e r a n a l y t e r e s p o n s e i n w a t e r 1 100 linearity calibration curves was thereby performed by analysing carbapenem standards spiked at concentrations of 0 5 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 μg l in blank matrix matrix matched all quantification was carried out by external calibration curves lod and loq were calculated as the lowest concentrations with a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively intra and inter day accuracy recovery and precision were calculated by analysing 6 identically prepared blank matrix wastewater samples spiked at 4 different concentrations of a mixed carbapenem standard solution 1 0 2 5 5 0 and 10 μg l these were analysed in three separate runs over two different days and measured concentrations were expressed as recovery percentages and relative coefficient of variation cv respectively 2 4 sewer reactor setup operation and parameter testing the laboratory scale sewer bioreactors were employed to mimic the rising main rm and gravity sewer gs conditions figure s2 briefly both reactors had a liquid capacity of 0 75 l rm 80 mm d 150 mm h gs 80 mm d 200 mm h 150 mm water depth plus 50 mm head space and were made of perspex the rm reactor was operated under anaerobic conditions to mimic anaerobic sewers by keeping the setup airtight while the gs reactor was kept partially filled with wastewater to allow a gas phase and to mimic gravity sewers with both anaerobic and aerobic sections biofilm carriers of 10 mm diameter were suspended on three stainless steel rods to aid with the surface availability for biofilm growth the total biofilm area in each reactor was approximately 0 05 m2 while the area to volume ratio was 70 9 m2 m3 the sewer reactors were shown to have biological activities similar to typical real sewer conditions choi et al 2020 li et al 2018b o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 shi et al 2022 biofilm cultivation was achieved by regular feeding the rm and gs reactors with domestic wastewater for 6 months while no flow was subjected to the control reactor to maintain biofilm free conditions the feed wastewater was collected fortnightly from the inlet of wollongong wwtp australia the typical wastewater properties measured are outlined in table 2 wastewater was stored at 4 c after every fortnightly collection and was fed into the reactors every 6 h a typical hrt of wastewater in sewers after being heated up to room temperature 22 c using a water bath set at 35 c with titanium heating coils using a peristaltic pump masterflex l s all pumping events were set to last for 2 min to account for a feed volume equivalent to the reactor volume 0 75 l and magnetic stirring mls8 velp scientifica italy was performed at 250 rpm in each reactor to facilitate continuous mixing of wastewater biofilm activity was verified in rm and gs reactors by testing for relevant parameters ph do tss vss sulfate soluble cod and total cod to ensure a steady condition prior to batch tests for carbapenem degradation 2 5 reactor batch tests for carbapenem degradability batch tests were performed in triplicate by feeding wastewater spiked to 10 μg l with mixed standard solution of carbapenems prepared in water and was immediately pumped into the reactors using the peristaltic pump to avoid any undue degradation or transformation within the wastewater the control reactor figure s2 was treated the same as the other reactors and fed with spiked raw wastewater the only difference being the absence of the biofilm component continuous mixing was ensured in all reactors 250 rpm to maintain homogeneity of the resident wastewater after the feeding event reached the appropriate volume of each reactor the pumping was halted and samples were withdrawn at 0 0 5 1 2 3 6 9 and 12 h following the pumping event in addition ph and sulfate reduction was monitored for the first hour to inform on the biological activity of the biofilm in both reactors collected samples were immediately filtered using 0 22 μm pes membrane filter sarstedt australia into 1 5 ml hplc vials and frozen at 20 c prior to uhplc ms ms analysis 2 6 data analysis the degradability of all four carbapenems in sewer reactors were assessed by comparing the concentration observed at time point t c t with that observed at time point 0 initial spiked concentration c 0 for all analytes via uhplc ms ms percentage compared to initial concentration of all analytes at any given time point was thus calculated as c t c 0 10 0 first order kinetics one phase degradation were applied to the above calculated concentration data using graphpad prism 9 version 9 3 1 to determine the best fit for degradability of all target analytes i e carbapenems the goodness of fit for all analytes was examined by their respective r2 values for the simplification of equation used and further calculations the plateau was set to 0 and all values were interpreted by the model accordingly the equation used to calculate concentration of carbapenems at a given time using the one phase degradation model li et al 2018b is as shown in eq 2 below 2 c t c 0 e k t c 0 e k w w k b i o t where k h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant representing the overall degradation of carbapenems observed in sewer reactors chemical and or biological kww h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in wastewater alone and was estimated based on the data obtained from the control reactor kbio h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in the presence of sewer biofilms i e rm and gs reactors and was estimated using data obtained from rm and gs bioreactors kbio h 1 can be classified under two categories depending on the biofilm type as highlighted in eq 3 below 3 k b i o k b i o a n k b i o a where kbio an h 1 is the degradation rate constant in the presence of anerobic biofilm rm while kbio a h 1 refers to the degradation rate constant in the presence of aerobic biofilm gs furthermore half life data t 50 was obtained from the one phase degradation model also t 10 and t 90 were calculated as shown below in eq 4 and 5 4 t 10 l n 0 1 k 5 t 90 l n 0 9 k friedman s test non parametric coupled with dunn s multiple comparisons was performed to compare impacts of sewer conditions rm gs and ctl on the degradation of all carbapenems using graphpad prism 9 version 9 3 1 p values obtained from this analysis were interpreted to outline significance in degradation observed between reactor types 3 results and discussion 3 1 uhplc ms ms method development and sample preparation as the developed method follows direct injection methodology samples were filtered with 0 22 μm pes membrane filter to ensure suitability and cleaner extracts for uhplc ms ms analysis ms parameters were optimized by injecting a 10 μg ml carbapenem mixed standard solution prepared in water in a steam of lc flow rate of 0 3 μl min the ms scans were all acquired using a positive electrospray ionization mode for better sensitivity and resolution as all analytes exhibited the most intense ms signal for their singly positively charged ion m h as similarly evidenced by previous research carlier et al 2014 pickering and brown 2013 wang et al 2020 compound identity and retention time was confirmed by using their respective two transitions of highest intensities while compound quantification was carried using only the transition of the highest intensity the transitions and optimized ms parameters used for all target analytes are presented in table 1 after several iterations of chromatography columns elution mobile phase types composition and elution gradient data not shown all targeted carbapenems compounds were found to elute under optimized conditions section 2 2 by 3 4 min selected lc column acquity beh allowed for good separation and resolution for all target analytes allowing for a total method run time of only 5 minutes including column re equilibration time during optimization the addition of acid in both the mobile phases 0 1 formic acid was adopted as it significantly improved lc peak shape and enhanced intensity of the ms signal refer to figure s3 for uhplc chromatograms of all carbapenems analysed the analytical instrumentation uhplc ms ms possesses the disadvantage of a relatively higher limit of detection and quantification usually in µg l range when the direct injection is performed complex sample matrices like urban wastewater can also affect the integrity of the instrument and analytical column s performance via the direct injection methodology the expected concentrations of carbapenems in real wastewater may be lower than the spiking concentration in this study for greater sample clean up and successful quantification of carbapenems at realistic and lower soluble concentrations sophisticated and targeted sample preparation techniques like solid phase extraction can be employed for future studies 3 2 uhplc ms ms method validation the results from the method validation are summarized in table 3 matrix blank wastewater samples analysed for specificity showed no interference within 1 minute of the retention time of any target analyte thereby verifying selectivity of the method developed calibration curves generated in blank matrix showed a good linear fit for all analytes with r2 ranging from 0 9986 to 0 9996 intra and inter day accuracy and precision measured at 1 2 5 5 and 10 μg l concentration was under the recommended range with recoveries ranging from 93 9 to 109 8 and cv ranging between 5 1 13 4 for all analytes the analytes all showed stability 95 over a period of 24 h in blank matrix at neutral ph refer to the table s2 and s3 for full validation data including the 24 h stability analysis and figure s4 for matrix matched calibration curves for all carbapenems 3 3 biological activities and biofilm characterization in sewer reactors this study for the first time revealed the degradation of carbapenems under the influence of sewer biofilms in real wastewater it is well known that transformation and degradation of chemical compounds like population biomarkers is enhanced by the activity of the predominant microbial communities found in biofilms i e sulfate reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea li et al 2019 mccall et al 2016a mccall et al 2016b for instance studies have reported a higher transformation rate of some biomarkers amphetamine 6 acetylcodeine norketamine mephedrone in sewer in the presence of biofilms in comparison to chemical or physical processes gao et al 2017b mccall et al 2016b this study showed the significant role of sewer biofilms in enhancing the degradation of carbapenems the measured degradation kinetics can be applied to the back estimation of wastewater based epidemiology for a higher accuracy two sewer reactors with biofilms rm and gs were used in this study along with a control reactor ctl to assess the role of biofilms in the degradation of carbapenems figure s2 the reactivity and maturity of biofilm in both reactors was verified by evaluating their sulfate reduction rates figure s1 ph and cod over a duration of 6 h typical hrt for sewers the results from preliminary sewer tests are summarized in table s1 the obtained results confirmed that the reactors showed suitability for testing and had attained semi steady state in terms of sulfate reducing rate jiang et al 2011 li et al 2018b rm sewers usually form anaerobic biofilms due to being fully filled with wastewater gs on the other hand being partially filled with wastewater and relying on gravity driven flow facilitates both anaerobic and aerobic conditions hvitved jacobsen 2001 rm reactor induced to anaerobic conditions showed biological activities of sulfate reducing bacteria 5 0 mg s l h and tcod scod in the range of 300 500 mg l and 50 150 mg l respectively which is comparable with previous studies o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 additionally gs reactor is known to incorporate both aerobic and anaerobic conditions which can be confirmed by its low sulfate reduction 2 7 mg s l h o brien et al 2017 dissolved oxygen measured in the wastewater in gs was slightly lower than that in wastewater alone 0 6 mg l which points towards oxygen consumption due to aerobic activity as was highlighted by previous research o brien et al 2017 the results all verified the biofilm conditions for a similar laboratory scale bioreactor setup and typical real sewer conditions choi et al 2020 o brien et al 2017 shi et al 2022 in addition sulfate reduction rate and ph were monitored over the first 1 h of each of the triplicate batch tests to inform on biological activities of the biofilm the results also indicated that presence of carbapenems at the spiked concentration did not influence the biological activity of sewer biofilms factors affecting the integrity and composition of biofilms in turn affect the degradation transformation of chemical compounds like antibiotics one study evaluated the role of aerobic or anaerobic biofilms on the transformation of biomarkers and concluded that the microbial transformation is dependent on the redox condition for most of the evaluated biomarkers morphine glucuronide codeine narcodeine ramin et al 2016 similarly another study evaluated the effects wastewater conditions like ph temperature and suspended solids on the transformation of biomarkers and concluded that the rate of biological and ph induced transformation was quite significant in comparison to that of temperature and suspended solids related activity li et al 2021 real sewers were employed for a range of experiments to study the transformation of chemical compounds under uncontrolled and or limited conditions gao et al 2019 jelic et al 2015a li et al 2019 however studying in sewer stability of antibiotics poses great challenges with difficulties in practical conduct control quantification and interpretation of results pilot sewers were employed for some studies to evaluate chemical transformation of compounds but similar restrictions follow their employability in studies along with accessibility related concerns gao et al 2018 li et al 2018a in comparison laboratory scale sewer reactors can be operated under well controlled conditions with a range of operational and wastewater properties feed biofilms hrt temperature ph etc choi et al 2020 jiang et al 2011 jiang et al 2009 various studies have employed the use of laboratory scale rm and gs reactors and assessed the stability of targeted compounds by comparing the sewer type rm vs gs sewer condition anaerobic vs aerobic biomass suspended sludge vs biofilm and wastewater properties gao et al 2017a mccall et al 2016b o brien et al 2017 ramin et al 2017 ramin et al 2016 thai et al 2014 however the degradation data obtained in this study is only reproducible to an extent as the a v ratio of a typical sewer is about 2 10 times lower than that of the laboratory sewer reactors 70 9 m2 m3 employed in this study o brien et al 2017 a high a v ratio may enable greater interaction between the biofilm component and carbapenems potentially triggering higher degradation in rm gs more research is needed to identify the significance and impact of differing a v ratios on biofilm induced degradation of carbapenems thai et al 2014 not much evidence exists at present to investigate stability or degradation of compounds in larger sewer systems like pressure sewers with dynamic hydraulics and controlled hrt hence real sewer research is crucial to validate the data obtained from laboratory scale setups li et al 2018b 3 4 degradation of carbapenems in sewer reactors the degradation of four carbapenem members namely meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem was investigated in two bioreactor types rm and gs mimicking typical sewer conditions in comparison to wastewater only condition ctl reactor without sewer biofilms fig 1 studying the degradation of vital last resort antibiotics like carbapenems within the sewer network addresses a multitude of concerns surrounding their environmental presence and persistence and consequential selection for clinically highly relevant antibiotic resistances carbapenem resistance is an severe emerging issue owing to its accompanied extensive drug resistance and potential to lead to total drug resistance via exposure to residual antibiotics mutagens metals and biocides adegoke et al 2020 it has therefore become vital to understand the distribution of their concentrations in the environment and their relative impact on environmental microbiome dissemination of resistance genes and residual antibiotics may be facilitated into the environment via wastewater and sewer networks adegoke et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 degradation of carbapenems within sewers whether chemical or biological may help counteract the selection of resistance amongst microbial communities within the sewer environment this may also prevent transfer of resistance from environmental microbiome to the pathogens of concern via horizontal gene transfer due to a decline in the exposed carbapenem concentrations all of the above further emphasize the need for more focused research in this area for the observed results it was noted that one phase degradation model fits well with the degradation data from all three sewer reactors fig 1 the r2 values for all analytes in rm and gs reactors were 0 81 indicating a strong compliance to the first order kinetics model while the results from run s test p values imply that the deviation of results from the chosen regression model was insignificant table 4 r2 for ctl reactor results were low 0 5357 due to the little variability of the temporal concentrations of analytes with higher stability from their relative concentrations it is evident that 60 80 of degradation was observed within rm and gs reactors over the testing duration of 12 h as opposed to the ctl reactor which only showed a degradation in the range of 5 15 for all carbapenems the results are consistent with other previous studies where degradation was observed for different antibiotics pharmaceutical compounds illicit drugs and their metabolites in laboratory scale sewer reactors in the presence of biofilms li et al 2018b o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 table 4 shows the values of degradation constants k ww k bio an and k bio a estimated for all carbapenems using the model as per eq 1 and 2 from the observed data it can be clearly established that the degradation rate observed in wastewater alone ctl was much lower than the degradation rate in either rm k bio an or gs k bio a fig 2 also the degradation rate in rm k bio an is higher than gs k bio a for meropenem doripenem and biapenem this implies the anaerobic biofilms and microorganisms in rm sewers might lead to higher degradation of these three carbapenem members the lowest degradation rate observed was for ertapenem with k ww of 0 0058 h 1 while biapenem showed the highest degradation in wastewater with a k ww of 0 0183 h 1 as can be confirmed by the degradation trend established above however ertapenem showed comparable or slightly higher degradation rate in both rm k bio an 0 1037 h 1 and gs k bio a 0 1142 h 1 amongst all other carbapenem members it is interesting that biological degradation for ertapenem in gs is higher than rm which shows the significant role of the type of sewer biofilms and the diverse degradation patterns even within the same carbapenem antibiotic group studies conducted with laboratory scale sewer reactors at room temperature found that some chemicals remain stable with little to no degradation observed in rm gs ctl acesulfame atenolol carbamazepine gabapentin ibuprofen o brien et al 2017 thai et al 2014 some unstable under all conditions frusemide 76 degradation in 12 h iopromide 50 degradation in 16 h o brien et al 2017 while the others are comparatively stable in wastewater ctl than in sewer environment caffeine 87 99 degradation in 12 h in gs rm codeine 89 98 degradation in gs rm banks et al 2018 o brien et al 2019 o brien et al 2017 all carbapenems showed 10 degradation t 10 after the first hour under rising main condition t 10 0 8 1 0 h with their values comparable to the t 10 observed in gravity sewer 0 9 1 1 h table 4 meropenem doripenem and biapenem showed longer half lives by 0 9 1 4 h in gravity sewer as opposed to rising main sewer in contrast ertapenem was slightly more stable under rm condition t 50 rm 6 3 h t 50 gs 5 8 h none of the carbapenems showed 90 degradation t 90 within the testing duration of 12 h the trend observed in the t 10 values for all carbapenem members except for ertapenem were consistent with respect to their t 90 values i e all except for ertapenem t 90 rm 16 8 18 6 h showed higher stability under gs environment t 90 gs 19 5 23 2 h under control condition meropenem doripenem and biapenem showed 10 degradation within the testing duration which is nearly 7 8 times longer than in sewer biofilm reactors t 10 ctl 5 8 6 4 h ertapenem showed a higher stability with t 10 18 1 h in the control reactor the half lives for all members within ctl environment ranged from 38 0 to 119 3 h while their t 90 values ranged from 126 2 to 396 4 h with the highest and the lowest stabilities observed for ertapenem and biapenem respectively typically one way anova and two way anova analysis are performed to identify differences between two or more variable groups respectively in this instance two way anova would be appropriate to compare the degradation observed between the three variable groups i e rm gs and ctl reactors however two way anova assumes that the population from which the samples were drawn is normally distributed i e it follows gaussian distribution which in turn implies that distribution of sample means is close to a normal gaussian distribution this underlying assumption isn t compliant with the observations from this degradation study as the regression analysis clearly shows that the variability between reactors was significant with significant loss of concentrations of targeted carbapenems observed in reactors with and without biofilms hence non parametric analysis was chosen for the given data to compare the significance of degradation between reactors non parametric test was performed for three matched groups rm gs ctl and friedman s test p values were obtained as a result table 5 however this test ranks the values from low to high and only looks at the distribution of sum of ranks between groups hence it cannot be used to compare degradability between individual reactors for that purpose dunn s multiple comparisons test was used to determine the significance of degradation observed between the reactors with biofilm rm gs and that without ctl table 5 as per friedman s test there was a statistically significant difference in the degradation of carbapenems observed depending on the reactor type p 0 0017 0 0289 furthermore the results from dunn s test indicate that the degradation in the ctl reactor was statistically different from that observed in either rm p 0 0033 0 1088 or gs p 0 0162 0 1088 with the latter two showing non significant difference in the degradation rates observed p 0 2850 0 5930 another approach to draw a comparison is to assume an approximate gaussian distribution of data and perform parametric analysis tukey s multiple comparisons test was therefore conducted with two way anova in graphpad prism 9 table s4 the p values obtained in the test for ctl vs rm or ctl vs gs showed statistical difference p 0 05 with values ranging from 0 003 0 03 however values obtained from the rm vs gs analysis obtained p values in the range of 0 75 0 94 for different carbapenems showing no statistical significance p 0 05 in the degradation rate hence tukey s test further establishes that the degradation observed between rm and gs was similar to one another but significantly different to that detected in the ctl reactor no in sewer research has been performed for carbapenems till date thus making it impossible to perform comparative analysis properties like ph do hrt and sewer conditions anaerobic aerobic can also influence the biofilm conditions and thus the stability of target analytes jelic et al 2015a mccall et al 2016c for instance in sample stability studies have demonstrated that ph fluctuations can play a significant role in deciding the fate of chemical compounds prone to hydrolysis baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 senta et al 2014 changes in temperature can alter dissolved oxygen viscosity diffusion and hence have a combined impact on the in sewer processes and the rate of degradation of chemical compounds baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 li et al 2021 senta et al 2014 some studies have also demonstrated that analyte sorption does not affect their transformation in wastewater matrices to a significant extent baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 chen et al 2013 mccall et al 2016b it is also known that sewage hrt can determine the rate of degradation of population biomarkers and potentially antibiotics depending on their residence times and duration of contact with biofilms li et al 2018b hence future research needs to evaluate the impacts of inherent wastewater properties on the degradation of carbapenems in sewer it has been clearly established that the degradation of carbapenems in reactors with biofilms rm gs was significantly higher than that observed in the biofilm free reactor ctl the observed degradation could be due to a multitude of factors chemical or biological the complexity of the matrix along with the presence of biofilm plays a significant role in determining the fate and transformation of carbapenems however the underlying mechanisms such as microbial induced degradation and bioaccumulation cannot be disregarded unfortunately there is a significant lack of data on the transformation products of carbapenems in the sewer which constitutes a major gap in our understanding future studies can therefore work on analysing individual biofilm carriers to establish the extent of sorption of carbapenems onto biofilms plus evaluate the magnitude of degradation enzymes released into the reservoir volume facilitating the decomposition of carbapenems 4 conclusions this study established and validated an analytical method uhplc ms ms of carbapenem in wastewater to assess the degradation of four carbapenem members meropenem doripenem biapenem and ertapenem in sewer reactors with different biofilms the degradation of target analytes was determined and compared between reactors with anaerobic aerobic biofilms and in wastewater only the conclusions are the uhplc ms ms direct injection method was developed and validated in the range of 0 5 10 μg l for four carbapenem members with lod and loq values ranging from 0 2 0 5 μg l and 0 8 1 6 μg l respectively both rising main and gravity sewer biofilms significantly enhanced the degradation of carbapenems in wastewater from 5 15 to 60 80 in 12 hours the degradation rate constant for biofilm reactors k bio 0 07 0 11 was significantly higher than the degradation rate constant for biofilm free reactor k ww 0 005 0 01 with p 0 002 0 030 for different carbapenems the degradation pattern of meropenem doripenem and biapenem was similar with biological degradation in rising main sewer reactor slightly higher than that in gravity sewer reactor however the biodegradation of ertapenem is opposite to this pattern the findings suggest that sewer conditions play an important role in the extent of antibiotic degradation during the wastewater transportation in sewers further study about the effects of other environmental or wastewater parameters is required to ensure a more

15006,many european lakes have suffered from reed die back since the 1950s previous studies have concluded that this is due to a combination of several interacting factors but possibly also a single threat with high impact might be responsible for the phenomenon in this study we investigated 14 lakes in the berlin area differing in reed development and sulphate concentration from 2000 to 2020 to unravel the decline of reed beds in some of the lakes with coal mining activities in the upper watershed we compiled a comprehensive data set thus the littoral zone of the lakes was divided into 1302 segments considering the reed ratio relative to segment area water quality parameters littoral characteristics and bank usage of the lakes which all have been monitored for 20 years we ran two way panel regressions with a within estimator to consider the spatial variation between and within the segments over time the regression results revealed a strong negative relationship between reed ratio and sulphate concentrations p 0 001 as well as tree shading p 0 001 and a strong positive relationship with brushwood fascines p 0 001 taking only sulphate into account reeds would have covered an additional area of 5 5 ha or 22 6 in 2020 total reed area 24 3 ha in the absence of increased sulphate concentrations in conclusion changes in water quality upstream the catchment cannot be ignored in the development of management plans for downstream lakes graphical abstract keywords bank infiltration biodiversity monitoring water pollution panel data restoration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction massive reed die back in european lakes has been observed since the 1950s ostendorp 1989 brix 1999 e g in germany sukopp and markstein 1989 hungary tóth 2016 italy gigante et al 2011 poland pieczyńska et al 1988 and switzerland hürlimann 1951 the reasons for the declining reed beds are multiple and individual factors have been well studied during the last decades fig 1 including stabilisation and regulation of the water levels for shipping agriculture and drinking water supply which have been identified as severe threats rea 1996 coops et al 2004 tóth 2016 due to lowered water level fluctuations in spring and low autumn water levels reed germination seedling growth and vertical clonal expansion are limited coops and hosper 2002 consequently less reeds can develop and the reed stands decline in size grazing by greylag geese anser anser l bakker et al 2018 or muskrat ondatra zibethicus l vermaat et al 2016 ship induced waves gabel et al 2017 mechanical damage ostendorp et al 1995 shadowing sender and grabowski 2016 concrete walls sukopp and markstein 1989 reduced oxygen supply due to gas system blockage by callus armstrong et al 1996 phytotoxin formation armstrong and armstrong 2001 lamers et al 2002 by organic matter accumulation under anaerobic conditions picek et al 2000 pathogenes nechwatal et al 2005 cerri et al 2017 insects and flooding events ostendorp et al 2003 as well as long term pressure by lakeside house density vermaat et al 2016 are reasons for the reed die back furthermore eutrophication of lakes also affects reed stands and has been identified as a direct and indirect factor involved in the die back for example higher nutrient levels causing a downgrade of reed stem morphology which increases the vulnerability of the individual plants has been observed klötzli 1971 sukopp and markstein 1989 also the quality of the accumulated sediments within reed stands has been identified as an indirect threat kubín and melzer 1997 picek et al 2000 but is seemingly only of temporary importance ostendorp et al 2001 reed decline has additional ecological consequences for the littoral zone that may make it less suitable for nesting by reed warblers ostendorp et al 1995 nemeth and dvorak 2022 major attempts have been made to restore reed stands to improve their freshwater ecosystem functions bring back habitats for sea birds decrease shoreline erosion and reduce high nutrient loads tools like brushwood facines schoonees et al 2019 and breakwater dams are common countermeasures introduced to protect residual and replanted reed plants stabilise shoreline morphology and prevent sediment erosion by wave dissipation structures ostendorp et al 1995 horiuchi et al 2011 the planted reed seedlings have to be protected from grazing to guarantee the expansion of the reeds by e g managing goose populations or creating unattractive surroundings to the birds bakker et al 2018 mechanical stress has to be reduced for restoration to be successful however restoration success has often been limited and contradicting results have been obtained specifically regarding the effect of eutrophication on reed die back therefore also further factors or their complex interaction should be taken into account to explain the die back rea 1996 coops and hosper 2002 ostendorp et al 2001 despite the fact that different efforts have been made to stabilise and increase reed stands a decline of the reed area along the shoreline of some riverine lakes in the urban area of berlin has been documented since 2010 this despite beginning recovery after a long period of die back in parallel with this an abrupt rise of sulphate concentration in the river spree has been observed for more than a decade this is due to abandonment of large coal mining pits in the upper catchment roesel and zak 2022 it is important to note that rising sulphate concentrations in freshwaters is not only local they have increased globally over the last decades even though a strong reduction in atmospheric sulphur deposition has occurred across large parts of north america and europe due large scale wetland drainage and nitrate pollution of ground water zak et al 2021 as well as seasonal drying kerr et al 2012 for management reasons the origin of sulphur is important to know heinrich et al 2021 in this study the influence of water quality littoral zone characteristics and anthropogenic usage on the development of the reed ratio was investigated for a 20 year period taking also increasing sulphate concentrations into account we used the particular location of the berlin district where lakes fed by the river spree are influenced by the mining area thus being exposed to sulphate pollution whereas the lakes fed by river havel and river dahme are only partly mixed with water from the river spree and thus less sulphate polluted this spatial difference and the 20 years of observation of changing reed stands water quality littoral and bank characteristics were used in panel regression analyses 2 methods and material 2 1 study site the investigation examined the reed bed of 14 lakes along four rivers in berlin germany where nine lakes are located in the western part of berlin and fed by the river havel divided into the upper havel and the lower havel where the river spree flows into the havel lake nieder neuendorfer see upper havel 1 and 2 and lake tegeler see are part of the upper havel lower havel 1 2 3 and 4 and lake wannsee are part of the lower havel five lakes are located in the south eastern part of berlin lake daemeritzsee and lake mueggelsee are fed by the river spree as well as lake seddinsee into which water is led from the river spree the last three lakes are located close by the south eastern lakes but are fed by the river dahme the river spree directly connects the lusatian mining district with the german capital berlin fig 2 all the studied sites are heavily impaired by human activities both regarding their structure and water quality status bank filtration via wells a common practice for drinking water abstraction in the berlin area since the beginning of 20th century driescher et al 1993 occurred during the observation time at seven out of 14 lakes the wells were mostly located parallel to the shoreline blue dots in fig 2 wells occur at 20 of the shoreline of the studied lakes in addition three out of the 14 lakes are polluted by high sulphate loads originating from the acid mine drainage affected river spree 2 2 empirical data description for this study we created a comprehensive data set including reed area water quality data littoral zone characteristics and information about the anthropogenic usage of the shoreline the spatial references are 1302 segments along the shoreline total length 168 km covering the potential zone of reed growth from the shoreline until 1 5 m water depth 404 4 ha in total the position of the shoreline was calculated as the mean water level of the reference year 2010 separating the lakeside littoral and the shoreside banks the shoreline was divided with exceptions into 100 meter long sections that divided the littoral zone in segments at once fig 3 data on the segments and the mean water level of 2010 were provided by berliner wasserbetriebe the city centre of berlin was excluded from the mapping because the river spree does not follow a lake definition anymore for our data set we also excluded berlin lakes with absence of information on the water quality the littoral zone or anthropogenic usage the segment areas were observed in five time periods p containing the average over five years each p1 1996 2000 p2 2001 2005 p3 2006 2010 p4 2011 2015 and p5 2016 2020 as the variable of interest reed ratio was calculated as the percentage of every segment after clipping the gis layer of reed by the gis layer of segments every segment is characterised by the below mentioned variables for each time period and did not change over time see sections 2 2 2 to 2 2 4 in total 6510 observations 1302 segments and 5 time periods for 11 time variant parameters were included in the study 2 2 1 segment vegetation we used the monitored vegetation in the littoral zone along the shoreline mapped by fietz 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 for every time period in the analysis the basis of the mapping was cir aerial photos with a spatial resolution of 1 5000 2000 2005 20 cm 2010 2020 and 10 cm 2015 taking always in august the mapped areas with common reed phragmites australis and floating leaf plants including nuphar lutea and nymphaea alba were respectively selected from the mapping and matched to the corresponding segments because the study segments covered the littoral zone only waterside growing plants were included as the variable of interest the reed ratio on each segment was calculated to account for differences in segment area size as an exploratory variable the floating leaf plant ratio for each segment was calculated in the same way in addition floating leaf plants and the sum of both vegetation types were used as dependent variables in a comparative analysis hereinafter referred to as floating leaf plant ratio and total vegetation 2 2 2 water quality the water quality of the lakes was described by the influencing variables electrical conductivity μ s cm nitrate nitrogen mg l ph total phosphorus mg l oxygen mg l sulphate mg l and water temperature c determined at 14 measuring points between 01 1996 and 12 2020 fig 2 the mean values over five years from every measuring point and for every time period p1 p5 were used for all water quality variables the segments were attributed to the closest measuring point great circle distance the monitoring data were provided by the berlin senatsverwaltung für umwelt mobilität verbraucher und klimaschutz and the landesamt für umwelt brandenburg 2 2 3 littoral zone characteristics the littoral the potential zone of reed growth was characterised by bank vegetation and the ratio of the protected area supported by brushwood fascines for every segment the ratio of trees growing directly at the shoreline was mapped from aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 black white 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 coloured to consider the shading effect of the trees the flight photos were taken in april 1999 and august 2004 2010 2015 2020 have a spatial resolution of 1 10000 1999 25 cm 2004 and 20 cm 2010 2015 2020 due to wave related mechanical damage of the reed stems brushwood fascines were installed to protect the reed beds this variable is defined as the ratio of the protected area to the segment area and was mapped from the same aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 as mentioned above the protected area was defined as the zone between the brushwood fascines and the shoreline 2 2 4 human usage the shore and the littoral are affected with different intensities by human activities such as recreation e g swimming and sailing buildings wells for bank filtration and other infrastructure as influencing variables we included piers and different intensities of bank usage five classes both mapped from aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 the same orthophotos were used for mapping of trees and brushwood fascines see section 2 2 3 we used only the area of piers covering the segment area the ratio of pier area to segment area was included in the study to consider different segment areas the bank usage classes were class 0 unused forest border on the shore bank class 1 slightly used mainly forest border on the shore bank with scattered private beaches and piers class 2 partly used by private beaches and piers on a paved bank with vegetation and scattered buildings nearby class 3 private use of expanded piers on paved bank partly vegetated or wide beaches adjoined private houses and gardens or roads and class 4 commercial use of a segment scaled beach or expanded sailing infrastructure complete paved bank and without bank vegetation as an time invariant variable we used the distance from the segments centroid to the nearest well for an additional analysis information on the shape of the wells was provided by berliner wasserbetriebe 2 3 regression models we ran panel regression models with reed ratio as the dependent variable and water quality parameters littoral zone characteristics including floating leaf plant ratio and anthropogenic usage parameters as explanatory variables the models were estimated with ordinary least squares ols and standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity for robustness we also used standard errors clustered at the level of lakes or lake sections table s3 the ols models used the time variation across 20 years of the dependent and explanatory variables within each segment wooldridge 2019 the models eliminated all time invariant differences between observations because we included fixed effects for segments and periods thus we explain only changes within the observations within variation we designed our fixed effects models to study the cause of changes of the reed ratio within a segment the models strictly followed the identification of this effect the effects of all time invariant factors are excluded and will not affect the regression results the within estimator ols models with segment and period fixed effects took the following form 1 r e e d i t α i δ t β s u l p h a t e i t x i t γ ϵ i t where r e e d i t describes the reed ratio in a segment i 1 1302 in a time period t 2000 2020 α i are segment fixed effects δ t are time period fixed effects the coefficient of interest the effect of mean sulphate concentration is described by β and is thus included in every model specification vector x includes the explanatory variables of water quality littoral and bank characteristics ϵ i t describes an error term due to cross sectional and temporal variation of the variables a panel regression using the within estimator is best suited to cope with such within variations wooldridge 2019 table 2 the result of the hausman test also recommended a two way panel regression with fixed effects hausman 1978 the test was used to compare the fixed effects with the random effects estimators the random effects model assumes that unobserved effects are uncorrelated with each explanatory variable the null hypothesis of the hausman test was rejected chi square 450 69 df 14 p value 0 001 therefore we chose the model with fixed effects within estimator we also estimated coefficients from random effects pooled ols and ols regressions non panel including standardised coefficients table s2 five different specifications of the panel regression were run to test the hypothesis sulphate was included as the main explanatory variable in all specifications excepting the fifth the first specification included variables from the littoral zone and anthropogenic usage the second specification considered water quality variables except electrical conductivity as this is strongly correlated with sulphate correlation coefficient 0 89 p value 0 001 and may generate collinearity problems the third specification included all independent variables describing water quality parameters littoral and bank characteristics the fourth specification included the floating leaf plant ratio finally the fifth specification excluded sulphate the distance of wells for bank filtration see section 2 1 is a time invariant variable and was not considered in the main panel regression but in separate panel regressions with subsamples the subsampling divided the panel data set into one part n 645 where the well distance is less equal than the median of 0 64 km and in a second part n 657 where the well distance is greater than the median the subsampled regressions were specified as described by eq 1 and also estimated with ols and standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity all statistical analyses were done in r version 4 2 0 run by rstudio version 1 4 1717 integrated development environment for r rstudio pbc boston ma 3 results 3 1 reed development as a general trend the reed area at the lakes in berlin increased from 2000 and onwards from 24 0 to 37 5 ha in 2010 followed by a decrease to 24 3 ha in 2020 table 1 however the reed area did not change in a similar way for all lakes the reed ratio at the lakes fed by river spree and lower havel followed the described trend whereas the reed decline at the lakes fed by river dahme was already observed after 2005 for the upper havel the reed ratio fluctuated sightly fig 4a at lake level the reed ratio ranged between on average a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 14 9 despite the different trends of reed development for the four rivers nearly all the lakes excepting lake tegeler see reed ratio increased over time and lake zeuthener see reed ratio decreased during the observation time exhibited similar trends table 1 for the panel regressions the within variation of the reed ratio at segment level was most important based on the ratio of mean coverage to segment area of 6 3 the corresponding within standard deviation of 5 3 indicated a substantial level of variation over time table 2 3 2 exploratory variables the individual location of the lakes yielded different trends of the sulphate concentration over time the mean sulphate concentrations of lakes fed by river spree river dahme and lower havel increased whereas the concentration decreased in the upper havel lakes fig 4b the difference in sulphate concentrations between the two lake types increased over time standard deviations 28 1 to 63 7 and was greatest in the last period the lakes fed by river spree showed the highest sulphate concentrations with a steep increase after 2010 the descriptive statistics show a substantial level of 25 4 mg l within variation of the mean sulphate concentration table 2 other water quality variables differed slightly between the study sites thus the study lakes were slightly alkaline and had similar water temperatures and concentrations of dissolved oxygen table s1 furthermore all the lakes were highly eutrophic excepting lake tegel due to the presence of a phosphorus elimination plant ladwig et al 2018 during the observation time total phosphorus concentrations decreased after 2005 until 2015 and increased slightly afterwards in all rivers fig 5a nitrate nitrogen concentrations decreased between the first and the second study period in all rivers and increased until 2015 except lower havel where the nitrate nitrogen concentration decreased in the last period fig 5b the within variation level for all water quality variables was suitable for running panel regressions table 2 the scale of littoral and bank characteristics also changed over time on average trees covered 60 of the segment shorelines the length of the vegetated shoreline decreased from 107 5 to 95 8 km during the observation time in total but varied between the four lake systems fig 5c however the individual tree ratio varied within the segments over time standard deviation 14 making the tree variable suitable for the panel regressions the total sum of brushwood fascines length increased over time from 16 5 2000 to 20 7 km 2020 and the protected area increased from 34 2 2000 to 39 7 ha 2020 with small differences between the four lake systems fig 5d on average 6 8 of the segment area between the shoreline and the fascines is protected the within standard deviation of 5 0 indicates an suitable variation of the variable use in the panel regressions the mean ratio of floating leaf plants for the segment area increased over time from 3 8 2000 to 10 7 2020 in total and increased also in the four lake systems fig 5e the variable with a within standard variation of 6 6 is suitable for the panel regression table 2 the study lakes have an average pier area of 52 ha corresponding to 1 1 of the segment area during the last 20 years the area of piers has increased from 50 1 2000 to 53 3 ha 2020 representing not only new piers but also a rebuilding of piers at the same place within standard deviation 0 5 table 2 the filtration wells were on average located 1 km min 0 02 km max 5 7 km median 0 64 km from the nearest segment the spatial distribution of the wells differed for the four lake systems 16 19 23 and 24 of the shoreline of the lakes of the upper havel dahme spree and lower havel were joined by parallel located wells respectively 3 3 panel regression results statistical analysis revealed the impact of sulphate on reed development table 3 taking temporal and spatial differences into account as well as other lake and bank properties fascines trees usage classes piers nitrate nitrogen total phosphorus oxygen ph temperature and floating leaf plants all time invariant variables are absorbed by fixed effects of the models e g geographical position of the segments geological bedrock water level regulation geographical orientation and shallow water zone which do not vary over time the panel regressions showed a strong negative relationship between sulphate and the reed ratio for all four specifications p 0 001 table 3 an increase of 10 mg l sulphate comes along with an on average 0 3 to 0 4 percentage points lower reed ratio compared to the fixed effects models used as our baseline the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficients for sulphate did not change in the random effects model or in the pooled ols model that explored between instead of within variation table s2 excepting nitrogen the coefficients and r2 did not change in the fifth specification without sulphate compared to the fourth specification the regression results revealed further factors that influenced the reed ratio of the lakes in berlin thus tree coverage was negatively correlated with the reed ratio an increase of tree coverage of 10 percentage points at the shoreline led to 0 3 percentage points lower reed coverage in the average segment fascines were strongly positively correlated with the reed ratio based on the coefficient a rise of 10 percentage points of area protected by fascines entailed a 2 0 percentage points increase of reed in the segment human usage had almost no impact on the reed ratio the exception was a positive and statistically significant effect of usage class 1 slightly used the base category was class 0 non used the coefficients for usage classes 2 3 and 4 were positive most of the time but not statistically significant at the 5 level piers had a negative influence on reed but the effect was not significant for any of the specifications also other water quality variables affected the reed ratio oxygen and temperature were positively and phosphorus and ph negatively correlated with the reed ratio but not significantly so except from oxygen floating leaf plants were negatively correlated with and statistically significant for reed whereas the effect of sulphate did not change to test the robustness further estimations were run with floating leaf plants and the total ratio of vegetation as dependent variables table s4 here sulphate was also negatively correlated with the ratio of floating leaf plants and total vegetation the regression coefficients for sulphate differ across the two subsamples defined by the distance to the nearest well table 4 for subsample 1 sulphate is significantly negatively correlated with the reed ratio whereas sulphate is not significantly correlated with the reed ratio in subsample 2 sulphate negatively influences the reed ratio if the nearest well is located sufficiently close to the segment the coefficients of the variables sulphate trees and fascines had similar levels of significance and affect directions across all specifications also when using different estimators table s2 this indicates that our model provided reliable and robust results 4 discussion the presence of common reed in the littoral zone of lakes in berlin was determined by several factors including water quality intensity of human usage and the characteristics of the bank and the littoral krauss et al 2013 our findings support to the knowledge that changes in reed presence changes are a result of multiple unfavourable conditions rather than a single influencing parameter we considered multiple variables using a comprehensive data set encompassing 11 time variant parameters and ran two way panel regression models with fixed effects our discoveries demonstrated the highly significant impact of increased sulphate concentrations on reed growth in all scenario calculations for the studied lakes however we also discuss the role of factors other than sulphate furthermore we used the different spatial positions of the lakes to cover a large gradient of sulphate pollution where lakes in close proximity to the lusatian mining area were most and lakes fed by the upper havel the least affected by sulphate figs 2 and 4 confirming that the landscape north of berlin is not affected by lignite mining on the other hand lake mueggelsee which is connected to the river spree was highly impaired by mining originated sulphate from the lusatian region the original sulphate concentration of up to 2000 mg l roesel and zak 2022 decreased downstream of the mining district but when reaching berlin the sulphate concentrations were still higher than 250 mg l thereby exceeding the german drinking water limits friedland et al 2021 zak et al 2021 the river dahme and lower havel were partly affected by water from the mining district due to mixing with water from the river spree the sulphate concentrations increased in the river havel due to the spree inflow after passing the city centre due to dilution with non mining affected water from the watershed the sulphate concentrations slowly decreased downstream the lower havel to values lower than 150 mg l fig 2 the path of sulphate demonstrated its long lifetime in aquatic ecosystems thus the sulphate concentration can be used as a marker for mining activities and to demonstrate the persistent impact of mining naicker et al 2003 the negative correlation between sulphate concentrations and reed development was surprising as reed is known to be tolerant of high salt stress chambers 1997 zak et al 2021 moreover sulphate is often used as a tracer as it needs distinct environmental conditions to exhibit chemical reactions and precipitate as a stable mineral such as iron ii sulphide roesel and zak 2022 generally sulphate per se is not toxic to reed plants chambers 1997 and is stable in the presence of oxygen however under anaerobic conditions and at high sulphate concentrations formation of phytotoxic sulphide is likely to take place in the reed bed sediment armstrong et al 1996 anaerobic conditions occur in the bank sediment when high amounts of organic matter accumulate in the littoral zone of the lakes in berlin hoffmann and gunkel 2011 and rapidly degrade the fine particulate organic matter reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment massmann et al 2008 and thus leads to redox conditions of the filtrate in the first infiltration decimeter of the sediment where oxygen is completely consumed filter et al 2017 high organic content and anaerobic conditions promote the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria massmann et al 2008 and provide optimal conditions for sulphate reduction iron is ubiquitous and able to rapidly bind sulphide that protects common reed for toxic sulphide concentrations under redox conditions within the bank sediments ferric iron fe iii is reduced to ferrous iron fe ii farnsworth and hering 2011 and is able to react with sulphide lamers et al 2013 however this process might be disturbed in some of the sulphate polluted lakes like lake mueggelsee due to groundwater abstraction for drinking water production via wells nearby the lake shores fig 2 groundwater abstraction changes the water flow thus the seepage of iron enriched groundwater into the lake sediments is lowered and instead iron poor and sulphate enriched surface water flows into the sediment due to bank infiltration the daily sulphate load into the sediment was increased by a factor 6 from approximately 0 8 g m2 only diffusion for flux calculations see zak et al 2006 to 5 g m2 taking a bank infiltration rate of about 2 cm day gillefalk et al 2019 and the current sulphate concentrations of 250 mg l into account at the low bank infiltration of 2 cm day it seems unlikely that a larger fraction of the sediment would become aerobic implying that sulphate reduction will likely increase as sulphate rather than organic carbon was found to be the limiting factor even in the less organic rich sediments of the river spree zak et al 2006 if iron is not available in sufficient amounts or sulphide concentrations are higher than the iron concentration sulphide cannot be completely bound by iron consequently leading to a toxic environment and reed die back hotes et al 2005 iron deficiency may also reduce the chlorophyll content in reed leaves chlorosis causing reduced reed vitality and eventually also a reed decline lamers et al 2013 the smaller reed decline in the dahme lakes despite of rising sulphate concentrations coincides with a lower number of wells data analysis implies that wells near the bank intensify the effect of sulphate enriched water in the rooted sediment layer table 4 the significance of presumed sulphide toxicity must be proven by in situ investigations of the iron sulphur cycling in lake sediments other factors than sulphate have been shown to contribute to reed development some of these are quantitatively even more important than sulphate for example trees along the shore and fascines see table s2 the negative effect of trees on reed growth is in line with the observation of previous studies shoreline and littoral vegetation can act as competitors and suppress reed growth by shading reviewed in packer et al 2017 because reed may be shade intolerant under a dense canopy such as that of trees albert et al 2013 and bushes ostendorp 1989 the positive effects of fascines has not been extensively examined but has been demonstrated for submerged plants vermaat and de bruyne 1993 and was described to be best adapted to the special situation at the havel by ostendorp 1995 in order to protect the reed plants against mechanical damage by waves our results demonstrate a significantly positive effect of brushwood fascines and with this provide yet unpublished evidence of the suitability of this shoreline protection measure however further research to identify the relevant processes is required to our knowledge the increase that we found in the floating leaf plant ratio table 1 as well as the strong negative relationship with reed table 3 and s4 in the urban lakes of berlin have hitherto gone noticed seen in the light of our results though we assume the existence of spatial concurrence between both vegetation types in the littoral zone however further research is required to provide further evidence of this it is noticeable that the phosphorus and nitrogen nitrate concentrations were not significantly correlated with the reed ratio in this study despite that eutrophication has previously been found to be an impact factor on reed die back sukopp and markstein 1989 kubín and melzer 1997 though mainly in an indirect way brix 1999 on the other hand ostendorp et al 2001 could not confirm a general influence of eutrophication on reed decline we used the regression coefficient to calculate the mean reed area loss caused by increased sulphate concentrations for a conservative calculation the sulphate coefficient 0 03 of specification 3 was used and multiplied by 45 5 mg l showing a mean sulphate increase over time leading to a reed decrease of 1 4 next the reed decreased value 1 4 was multiplied by the mean segment area 3106 m2 and divided by 100 in the last step the calculated value was multiplied by the number of segments 1302 resulting in a reed area of 5 5 ha hence under the described conditions and using the estimated coefficient an increase of reed area of 5 5 ha would grow without the increase of mean sulphate concentrations of 45 mg l considering this calculation and based on the regression coefficients of fascines 0 2 and trees 0 03 respectively 3 4 ha or 1 4 ha smaller reed area would grow without the 4 2 km installed fascines or if 11 7 km of vegetated shoreline were not decreased until 2020 overall there is a large spatial restoration potential as the area theoretically covered by reed beds would account for 404 ha i e 17 times more than the current reed coverage until a water depth of 1 50 meter krauss et al 2013 5 conclusions the decreasing reed area at freshwater lakes in berlin is the result of multiple factors including rising sulphate concentrations fascines and tree shading seems to be more relevant for the reed decline than the current rise of sulphate concentrations despite the relationship between reed ratio and each of the three factors was highly significant p 0 001 management plans to combat the reed decline even further should include mitigation measures in the upper catchment as sulphate pollution is expected to continue to rise over the next years to decades due to ongoing mining and reclamation activities future investigations need to clarify first if bank infiltration fosters iron deficiency and thus sulphide toxicity in the reed banks and second it must be elucidated how other factors not investigated in this study e g grazing explain the differences in reed development between freshwater lakes of the berlin area credit authorship contribution statement lydia k roesel conceptualization

15006,many european lakes have suffered from reed die back since the 1950s previous studies have concluded that this is due to a combination of several interacting factors but possibly also a single threat with high impact might be responsible for the phenomenon in this study we investigated 14 lakes in the berlin area differing in reed development and sulphate concentration from 2000 to 2020 to unravel the decline of reed beds in some of the lakes with coal mining activities in the upper watershed we compiled a comprehensive data set thus the littoral zone of the lakes was divided into 1302 segments considering the reed ratio relative to segment area water quality parameters littoral characteristics and bank usage of the lakes which all have been monitored for 20 years we ran two way panel regressions with a within estimator to consider the spatial variation between and within the segments over time the regression results revealed a strong negative relationship between reed ratio and sulphate concentrations p 0 001 as well as tree shading p 0 001 and a strong positive relationship with brushwood fascines p 0 001 taking only sulphate into account reeds would have covered an additional area of 5 5 ha or 22 6 in 2020 total reed area 24 3 ha in the absence of increased sulphate concentrations in conclusion changes in water quality upstream the catchment cannot be ignored in the development of management plans for downstream lakes graphical abstract keywords bank infiltration biodiversity monitoring water pollution panel data restoration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction massive reed die back in european lakes has been observed since the 1950s ostendorp 1989 brix 1999 e g in germany sukopp and markstein 1989 hungary tóth 2016 italy gigante et al 2011 poland pieczyńska et al 1988 and switzerland hürlimann 1951 the reasons for the declining reed beds are multiple and individual factors have been well studied during the last decades fig 1 including stabilisation and regulation of the water levels for shipping agriculture and drinking water supply which have been identified as severe threats rea 1996 coops et al 2004 tóth 2016 due to lowered water level fluctuations in spring and low autumn water levels reed germination seedling growth and vertical clonal expansion are limited coops and hosper 2002 consequently less reeds can develop and the reed stands decline in size grazing by greylag geese anser anser l bakker et al 2018 or muskrat ondatra zibethicus l vermaat et al 2016 ship induced waves gabel et al 2017 mechanical damage ostendorp et al 1995 shadowing sender and grabowski 2016 concrete walls sukopp and markstein 1989 reduced oxygen supply due to gas system blockage by callus armstrong et al 1996 phytotoxin formation armstrong and armstrong 2001 lamers et al 2002 by organic matter accumulation under anaerobic conditions picek et al 2000 pathogenes nechwatal et al 2005 cerri et al 2017 insects and flooding events ostendorp et al 2003 as well as long term pressure by lakeside house density vermaat et al 2016 are reasons for the reed die back furthermore eutrophication of lakes also affects reed stands and has been identified as a direct and indirect factor involved in the die back for example higher nutrient levels causing a downgrade of reed stem morphology which increases the vulnerability of the individual plants has been observed klötzli 1971 sukopp and markstein 1989 also the quality of the accumulated sediments within reed stands has been identified as an indirect threat kubín and melzer 1997 picek et al 2000 but is seemingly only of temporary importance ostendorp et al 2001 reed decline has additional ecological consequences for the littoral zone that may make it less suitable for nesting by reed warblers ostendorp et al 1995 nemeth and dvorak 2022 major attempts have been made to restore reed stands to improve their freshwater ecosystem functions bring back habitats for sea birds decrease shoreline erosion and reduce high nutrient loads tools like brushwood facines schoonees et al 2019 and breakwater dams are common countermeasures introduced to protect residual and replanted reed plants stabilise shoreline morphology and prevent sediment erosion by wave dissipation structures ostendorp et al 1995 horiuchi et al 2011 the planted reed seedlings have to be protected from grazing to guarantee the expansion of the reeds by e g managing goose populations or creating unattractive surroundings to the birds bakker et al 2018 mechanical stress has to be reduced for restoration to be successful however restoration success has often been limited and contradicting results have been obtained specifically regarding the effect of eutrophication on reed die back therefore also further factors or their complex interaction should be taken into account to explain the die back rea 1996 coops and hosper 2002 ostendorp et al 2001 despite the fact that different efforts have been made to stabilise and increase reed stands a decline of the reed area along the shoreline of some riverine lakes in the urban area of berlin has been documented since 2010 this despite beginning recovery after a long period of die back in parallel with this an abrupt rise of sulphate concentration in the river spree has been observed for more than a decade this is due to abandonment of large coal mining pits in the upper catchment roesel and zak 2022 it is important to note that rising sulphate concentrations in freshwaters is not only local they have increased globally over the last decades even though a strong reduction in atmospheric sulphur deposition has occurred across large parts of north america and europe due large scale wetland drainage and nitrate pollution of ground water zak et al 2021 as well as seasonal drying kerr et al 2012 for management reasons the origin of sulphur is important to know heinrich et al 2021 in this study the influence of water quality littoral zone characteristics and anthropogenic usage on the development of the reed ratio was investigated for a 20 year period taking also increasing sulphate concentrations into account we used the particular location of the berlin district where lakes fed by the river spree are influenced by the mining area thus being exposed to sulphate pollution whereas the lakes fed by river havel and river dahme are only partly mixed with water from the river spree and thus less sulphate polluted this spatial difference and the 20 years of observation of changing reed stands water quality littoral and bank characteristics were used in panel regression analyses 2 methods and material 2 1 study site the investigation examined the reed bed of 14 lakes along four rivers in berlin germany where nine lakes are located in the western part of berlin and fed by the river havel divided into the upper havel and the lower havel where the river spree flows into the havel lake nieder neuendorfer see upper havel 1 and 2 and lake tegeler see are part of the upper havel lower havel 1 2 3 and 4 and lake wannsee are part of the lower havel five lakes are located in the south eastern part of berlin lake daemeritzsee and lake mueggelsee are fed by the river spree as well as lake seddinsee into which water is led from the river spree the last three lakes are located close by the south eastern lakes but are fed by the river dahme the river spree directly connects the lusatian mining district with the german capital berlin fig 2 all the studied sites are heavily impaired by human activities both regarding their structure and water quality status bank filtration via wells a common practice for drinking water abstraction in the berlin area since the beginning of 20th century driescher et al 1993 occurred during the observation time at seven out of 14 lakes the wells were mostly located parallel to the shoreline blue dots in fig 2 wells occur at 20 of the shoreline of the studied lakes in addition three out of the 14 lakes are polluted by high sulphate loads originating from the acid mine drainage affected river spree 2 2 empirical data description for this study we created a comprehensive data set including reed area water quality data littoral zone characteristics and information about the anthropogenic usage of the shoreline the spatial references are 1302 segments along the shoreline total length 168 km covering the potential zone of reed growth from the shoreline until 1 5 m water depth 404 4 ha in total the position of the shoreline was calculated as the mean water level of the reference year 2010 separating the lakeside littoral and the shoreside banks the shoreline was divided with exceptions into 100 meter long sections that divided the littoral zone in segments at once fig 3 data on the segments and the mean water level of 2010 were provided by berliner wasserbetriebe the city centre of berlin was excluded from the mapping because the river spree does not follow a lake definition anymore for our data set we also excluded berlin lakes with absence of information on the water quality the littoral zone or anthropogenic usage the segment areas were observed in five time periods p containing the average over five years each p1 1996 2000 p2 2001 2005 p3 2006 2010 p4 2011 2015 and p5 2016 2020 as the variable of interest reed ratio was calculated as the percentage of every segment after clipping the gis layer of reed by the gis layer of segments every segment is characterised by the below mentioned variables for each time period and did not change over time see sections 2 2 2 to 2 2 4 in total 6510 observations 1302 segments and 5 time periods for 11 time variant parameters were included in the study 2 2 1 segment vegetation we used the monitored vegetation in the littoral zone along the shoreline mapped by fietz 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 for every time period in the analysis the basis of the mapping was cir aerial photos with a spatial resolution of 1 5000 2000 2005 20 cm 2010 2020 and 10 cm 2015 taking always in august the mapped areas with common reed phragmites australis and floating leaf plants including nuphar lutea and nymphaea alba were respectively selected from the mapping and matched to the corresponding segments because the study segments covered the littoral zone only waterside growing plants were included as the variable of interest the reed ratio on each segment was calculated to account for differences in segment area size as an exploratory variable the floating leaf plant ratio for each segment was calculated in the same way in addition floating leaf plants and the sum of both vegetation types were used as dependent variables in a comparative analysis hereinafter referred to as floating leaf plant ratio and total vegetation 2 2 2 water quality the water quality of the lakes was described by the influencing variables electrical conductivity μ s cm nitrate nitrogen mg l ph total phosphorus mg l oxygen mg l sulphate mg l and water temperature c determined at 14 measuring points between 01 1996 and 12 2020 fig 2 the mean values over five years from every measuring point and for every time period p1 p5 were used for all water quality variables the segments were attributed to the closest measuring point great circle distance the monitoring data were provided by the berlin senatsverwaltung für umwelt mobilität verbraucher und klimaschutz and the landesamt für umwelt brandenburg 2 2 3 littoral zone characteristics the littoral the potential zone of reed growth was characterised by bank vegetation and the ratio of the protected area supported by brushwood fascines for every segment the ratio of trees growing directly at the shoreline was mapped from aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 black white 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 coloured to consider the shading effect of the trees the flight photos were taken in april 1999 and august 2004 2010 2015 2020 have a spatial resolution of 1 10000 1999 25 cm 2004 and 20 cm 2010 2015 2020 due to wave related mechanical damage of the reed stems brushwood fascines were installed to protect the reed beds this variable is defined as the ratio of the protected area to the segment area and was mapped from the same aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 as mentioned above the protected area was defined as the zone between the brushwood fascines and the shoreline 2 2 4 human usage the shore and the littoral are affected with different intensities by human activities such as recreation e g swimming and sailing buildings wells for bank filtration and other infrastructure as influencing variables we included piers and different intensities of bank usage five classes both mapped from aerial orthophotos of berlin in 1999 2004 2010 2015 and 2020 the same orthophotos were used for mapping of trees and brushwood fascines see section 2 2 3 we used only the area of piers covering the segment area the ratio of pier area to segment area was included in the study to consider different segment areas the bank usage classes were class 0 unused forest border on the shore bank class 1 slightly used mainly forest border on the shore bank with scattered private beaches and piers class 2 partly used by private beaches and piers on a paved bank with vegetation and scattered buildings nearby class 3 private use of expanded piers on paved bank partly vegetated or wide beaches adjoined private houses and gardens or roads and class 4 commercial use of a segment scaled beach or expanded sailing infrastructure complete paved bank and without bank vegetation as an time invariant variable we used the distance from the segments centroid to the nearest well for an additional analysis information on the shape of the wells was provided by berliner wasserbetriebe 2 3 regression models we ran panel regression models with reed ratio as the dependent variable and water quality parameters littoral zone characteristics including floating leaf plant ratio and anthropogenic usage parameters as explanatory variables the models were estimated with ordinary least squares ols and standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity for robustness we also used standard errors clustered at the level of lakes or lake sections table s3 the ols models used the time variation across 20 years of the dependent and explanatory variables within each segment wooldridge 2019 the models eliminated all time invariant differences between observations because we included fixed effects for segments and periods thus we explain only changes within the observations within variation we designed our fixed effects models to study the cause of changes of the reed ratio within a segment the models strictly followed the identification of this effect the effects of all time invariant factors are excluded and will not affect the regression results the within estimator ols models with segment and period fixed effects took the following form 1 r e e d i t α i δ t β s u l p h a t e i t x i t γ ϵ i t where r e e d i t describes the reed ratio in a segment i 1 1302 in a time period t 2000 2020 α i are segment fixed effects δ t are time period fixed effects the coefficient of interest the effect of mean sulphate concentration is described by β and is thus included in every model specification vector x includes the explanatory variables of water quality littoral and bank characteristics ϵ i t describes an error term due to cross sectional and temporal variation of the variables a panel regression using the within estimator is best suited to cope with such within variations wooldridge 2019 table 2 the result of the hausman test also recommended a two way panel regression with fixed effects hausman 1978 the test was used to compare the fixed effects with the random effects estimators the random effects model assumes that unobserved effects are uncorrelated with each explanatory variable the null hypothesis of the hausman test was rejected chi square 450 69 df 14 p value 0 001 therefore we chose the model with fixed effects within estimator we also estimated coefficients from random effects pooled ols and ols regressions non panel including standardised coefficients table s2 five different specifications of the panel regression were run to test the hypothesis sulphate was included as the main explanatory variable in all specifications excepting the fifth the first specification included variables from the littoral zone and anthropogenic usage the second specification considered water quality variables except electrical conductivity as this is strongly correlated with sulphate correlation coefficient 0 89 p value 0 001 and may generate collinearity problems the third specification included all independent variables describing water quality parameters littoral and bank characteristics the fourth specification included the floating leaf plant ratio finally the fifth specification excluded sulphate the distance of wells for bank filtration see section 2 1 is a time invariant variable and was not considered in the main panel regression but in separate panel regressions with subsamples the subsampling divided the panel data set into one part n 645 where the well distance is less equal than the median of 0 64 km and in a second part n 657 where the well distance is greater than the median the subsampled regressions were specified as described by eq 1 and also estimated with ols and standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity all statistical analyses were done in r version 4 2 0 run by rstudio version 1 4 1717 integrated development environment for r rstudio pbc boston ma 3 results 3 1 reed development as a general trend the reed area at the lakes in berlin increased from 2000 and onwards from 24 0 to 37 5 ha in 2010 followed by a decrease to 24 3 ha in 2020 table 1 however the reed area did not change in a similar way for all lakes the reed ratio at the lakes fed by river spree and lower havel followed the described trend whereas the reed decline at the lakes fed by river dahme was already observed after 2005 for the upper havel the reed ratio fluctuated sightly fig 4a at lake level the reed ratio ranged between on average a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 14 9 despite the different trends of reed development for the four rivers nearly all the lakes excepting lake tegeler see reed ratio increased over time and lake zeuthener see reed ratio decreased during the observation time exhibited similar trends table 1 for the panel regressions the within variation of the reed ratio at segment level was most important based on the ratio of mean coverage to segment area of 6 3 the corresponding within standard deviation of 5 3 indicated a substantial level of variation over time table 2 3 2 exploratory variables the individual location of the lakes yielded different trends of the sulphate concentration over time the mean sulphate concentrations of lakes fed by river spree river dahme and lower havel increased whereas the concentration decreased in the upper havel lakes fig 4b the difference in sulphate concentrations between the two lake types increased over time standard deviations 28 1 to 63 7 and was greatest in the last period the lakes fed by river spree showed the highest sulphate concentrations with a steep increase after 2010 the descriptive statistics show a substantial level of 25 4 mg l within variation of the mean sulphate concentration table 2 other water quality variables differed slightly between the study sites thus the study lakes were slightly alkaline and had similar water temperatures and concentrations of dissolved oxygen table s1 furthermore all the lakes were highly eutrophic excepting lake tegel due to the presence of a phosphorus elimination plant ladwig et al 2018 during the observation time total phosphorus concentrations decreased after 2005 until 2015 and increased slightly afterwards in all rivers fig 5a nitrate nitrogen concentrations decreased between the first and the second study period in all rivers and increased until 2015 except lower havel where the nitrate nitrogen concentration decreased in the last period fig 5b the within variation level for all water quality variables was suitable for running panel regressions table 2 the scale of littoral and bank characteristics also changed over time on average trees covered 60 of the segment shorelines the length of the vegetated shoreline decreased from 107 5 to 95 8 km during the observation time in total but varied between the four lake systems fig 5c however the individual tree ratio varied within the segments over time standard deviation 14 making the tree variable suitable for the panel regressions the total sum of brushwood fascines length increased over time from 16 5 2000 to 20 7 km 2020 and the protected area increased from 34 2 2000 to 39 7 ha 2020 with small differences between the four lake systems fig 5d on average 6 8 of the segment area between the shoreline and the fascines is protected the within standard deviation of 5 0 indicates an suitable variation of the variable use in the panel regressions the mean ratio of floating leaf plants for the segment area increased over time from 3 8 2000 to 10 7 2020 in total and increased also in the four lake systems fig 5e the variable with a within standard variation of 6 6 is suitable for the panel regression table 2 the study lakes have an average pier area of 52 ha corresponding to 1 1 of the segment area during the last 20 years the area of piers has increased from 50 1 2000 to 53 3 ha 2020 representing not only new piers but also a rebuilding of piers at the same place within standard deviation 0 5 table 2 the filtration wells were on average located 1 km min 0 02 km max 5 7 km median 0 64 km from the nearest segment the spatial distribution of the wells differed for the four lake systems 16 19 23 and 24 of the shoreline of the lakes of the upper havel dahme spree and lower havel were joined by parallel located wells respectively 3 3 panel regression results statistical analysis revealed the impact of sulphate on reed development table 3 taking temporal and spatial differences into account as well as other lake and bank properties fascines trees usage classes piers nitrate nitrogen total phosphorus oxygen ph temperature and floating leaf plants all time invariant variables are absorbed by fixed effects of the models e g geographical position of the segments geological bedrock water level regulation geographical orientation and shallow water zone which do not vary over time the panel regressions showed a strong negative relationship between sulphate and the reed ratio for all four specifications p 0 001 table 3 an increase of 10 mg l sulphate comes along with an on average 0 3 to 0 4 percentage points lower reed ratio compared to the fixed effects models used as our baseline the magnitude and statistical significance of the coefficients for sulphate did not change in the random effects model or in the pooled ols model that explored between instead of within variation table s2 excepting nitrogen the coefficients and r2 did not change in the fifth specification without sulphate compared to the fourth specification the regression results revealed further factors that influenced the reed ratio of the lakes in berlin thus tree coverage was negatively correlated with the reed ratio an increase of tree coverage of 10 percentage points at the shoreline led to 0 3 percentage points lower reed coverage in the average segment fascines were strongly positively correlated with the reed ratio based on the coefficient a rise of 10 percentage points of area protected by fascines entailed a 2 0 percentage points increase of reed in the segment human usage had almost no impact on the reed ratio the exception was a positive and statistically significant effect of usage class 1 slightly used the base category was class 0 non used the coefficients for usage classes 2 3 and 4 were positive most of the time but not statistically significant at the 5 level piers had a negative influence on reed but the effect was not significant for any of the specifications also other water quality variables affected the reed ratio oxygen and temperature were positively and phosphorus and ph negatively correlated with the reed ratio but not significantly so except from oxygen floating leaf plants were negatively correlated with and statistically significant for reed whereas the effect of sulphate did not change to test the robustness further estimations were run with floating leaf plants and the total ratio of vegetation as dependent variables table s4 here sulphate was also negatively correlated with the ratio of floating leaf plants and total vegetation the regression coefficients for sulphate differ across the two subsamples defined by the distance to the nearest well table 4 for subsample 1 sulphate is significantly negatively correlated with the reed ratio whereas sulphate is not significantly correlated with the reed ratio in subsample 2 sulphate negatively influences the reed ratio if the nearest well is located sufficiently close to the segment the coefficients of the variables sulphate trees and fascines had similar levels of significance and affect directions across all specifications also when using different estimators table s2 this indicates that our model provided reliable and robust results 4 discussion the presence of common reed in the littoral zone of lakes in berlin was determined by several factors including water quality intensity of human usage and the characteristics of the bank and the littoral krauss et al 2013 our findings support to the knowledge that changes in reed presence changes are a result of multiple unfavourable conditions rather than a single influencing parameter we considered multiple variables using a comprehensive data set encompassing 11 time variant parameters and ran two way panel regression models with fixed effects our discoveries demonstrated the highly significant impact of increased sulphate concentrations on reed growth in all scenario calculations for the studied lakes however we also discuss the role of factors other than sulphate furthermore we used the different spatial positions of the lakes to cover a large gradient of sulphate pollution where lakes in close proximity to the lusatian mining area were most and lakes fed by the upper havel the least affected by sulphate figs 2 and 4 confirming that the landscape north of berlin is not affected by lignite mining on the other hand lake mueggelsee which is connected to the river spree was highly impaired by mining originated sulphate from the lusatian region the original sulphate concentration of up to 2000 mg l roesel and zak 2022 decreased downstream of the mining district but when reaching berlin the sulphate concentrations were still higher than 250 mg l thereby exceeding the german drinking water limits friedland et al 2021 zak et al 2021 the river dahme and lower havel were partly affected by water from the mining district due to mixing with water from the river spree the sulphate concentrations increased in the river havel due to the spree inflow after passing the city centre due to dilution with non mining affected water from the watershed the sulphate concentrations slowly decreased downstream the lower havel to values lower than 150 mg l fig 2 the path of sulphate demonstrated its long lifetime in aquatic ecosystems thus the sulphate concentration can be used as a marker for mining activities and to demonstrate the persistent impact of mining naicker et al 2003 the negative correlation between sulphate concentrations and reed development was surprising as reed is known to be tolerant of high salt stress chambers 1997 zak et al 2021 moreover sulphate is often used as a tracer as it needs distinct environmental conditions to exhibit chemical reactions and precipitate as a stable mineral such as iron ii sulphide roesel and zak 2022 generally sulphate per se is not toxic to reed plants chambers 1997 and is stable in the presence of oxygen however under anaerobic conditions and at high sulphate concentrations formation of phytotoxic sulphide is likely to take place in the reed bed sediment armstrong et al 1996 anaerobic conditions occur in the bank sediment when high amounts of organic matter accumulate in the littoral zone of the lakes in berlin hoffmann and gunkel 2011 and rapidly degrade the fine particulate organic matter reduces the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment massmann et al 2008 and thus leads to redox conditions of the filtrate in the first infiltration decimeter of the sediment where oxygen is completely consumed filter et al 2017 high organic content and anaerobic conditions promote the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria massmann et al 2008 and provide optimal conditions for sulphate reduction iron is ubiquitous and able to rapidly bind sulphide that protects common reed for toxic sulphide concentrations under redox conditions within the bank sediments ferric iron fe iii is reduced to ferrous iron fe ii farnsworth and hering 2011 and is able to react with sulphide lamers et al 2013 however this process might be disturbed in some of the sulphate polluted lakes like lake mueggelsee due to groundwater abstraction for drinking water production via wells nearby the lake shores fig 2 groundwater abstraction changes the water flow thus the seepage of iron enriched groundwater into the lake sediments is lowered and instead iron poor and sulphate enriched surface water flows into the sediment due to bank infiltration the daily sulphate load into the sediment was increased by a factor 6 from approximately 0 8 g m2 only diffusion for flux calculations see zak et al 2006 to 5 g m2 taking a bank infiltration rate of about 2 cm day gillefalk et al 2019 and the current sulphate concentrations of 250 mg l into account at the low bank infiltration of 2 cm day it seems unlikely that a larger fraction of the sediment would become aerobic implying that sulphate reduction will likely increase as sulphate rather than organic carbon was found to be the limiting factor even in the less organic rich sediments of the river spree zak et al 2006 if iron is not available in sufficient amounts or sulphide concentrations are higher than the iron concentration sulphide cannot be completely bound by iron consequently leading to a toxic environment and reed die back hotes et al 2005 iron deficiency may also reduce the chlorophyll content in reed leaves chlorosis causing reduced reed vitality and eventually also a reed decline lamers et al 2013 the smaller reed decline in the dahme lakes despite of rising sulphate concentrations coincides with a lower number of wells data analysis implies that wells near the bank intensify the effect of sulphate enriched water in the rooted sediment layer table 4 the significance of presumed sulphide toxicity must be proven by in situ investigations of the iron sulphur cycling in lake sediments other factors than sulphate have been shown to contribute to reed development some of these are quantitatively even more important than sulphate for example trees along the shore and fascines see table s2 the negative effect of trees on reed growth is in line with the observation of previous studies shoreline and littoral vegetation can act as competitors and suppress reed growth by shading reviewed in packer et al 2017 because reed may be shade intolerant under a dense canopy such as that of trees albert et al 2013 and bushes ostendorp 1989 the positive effects of fascines has not been extensively examined but has been demonstrated for submerged plants vermaat and de bruyne 1993 and was described to be best adapted to the special situation at the havel by ostendorp 1995 in order to protect the reed plants against mechanical damage by waves our results demonstrate a significantly positive effect of brushwood fascines and with this provide yet unpublished evidence of the suitability of this shoreline protection measure however further research to identify the relevant processes is required to our knowledge the increase that we found in the floating leaf plant ratio table 1 as well as the strong negative relationship with reed table 3 and s4 in the urban lakes of berlin have hitherto gone noticed seen in the light of our results though we assume the existence of spatial concurrence between both vegetation types in the littoral zone however further research is required to provide further evidence of this it is noticeable that the phosphorus and nitrogen nitrate concentrations were not significantly correlated with the reed ratio in this study despite that eutrophication has previously been found to be an impact factor on reed die back sukopp and markstein 1989 kubín and melzer 1997 though mainly in an indirect way brix 1999 on the other hand ostendorp et al 2001 could not confirm a general influence of eutrophication on reed decline we used the regression coefficient to calculate the mean reed area loss caused by increased sulphate concentrations for a conservative calculation the sulphate coefficient 0 03 of specification 3 was used and multiplied by 45 5 mg l showing a mean sulphate increase over time leading to a reed decrease of 1 4 next the reed decreased value 1 4 was multiplied by the mean segment area 3106 m2 and divided by 100 in the last step the calculated value was multiplied by the number of segments 1302 resulting in a reed area of 5 5 ha hence under the described conditions and using the estimated coefficient an increase of reed area of 5 5 ha would grow without the increase of mean sulphate concentrations of 45 mg l considering this calculation and based on the regression coefficients of fascines 0 2 and trees 0 03 respectively 3 4 ha or 1 4 ha smaller reed area would grow without the 4 2 km installed fascines or if 11 7 km of vegetated shoreline were not decreased until 2020 overall there is a large spatial restoration potential as the area theoretically covered by reed beds would account for 404 ha i e 17 times more than the current reed coverage until a water depth of 1 50 meter krauss et al 2013 5 conclusions the decreasing reed area at freshwater lakes in berlin is the result of multiple factors including rising sulphate concentrations fascines and tree shading seems to be more relevant for the reed decline than the current rise of sulphate concentrations despite the relationship between reed ratio and each of the three factors was highly significant p 0 001 management plans to combat the reed decline even further should include mitigation measures in the upper catchment as sulphate pollution is expected to continue to rise over the next years to decades due to ongoing mining and reclamation activities future investigations need to clarify first if bank infiltration fosters iron deficiency and thus sulphide toxicity in the reed banks and second it must be elucidated how other factors not investigated in this study e g grazing explain the differences in reed development between freshwater lakes of the berlin area credit authorship contribution statement lydia k roesel conceptualization

15007,perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a class of permanent organic pollutants is frequently detected in surface and ground water with the latter made up primarily of porous media such as soils sediments and aquifers that harbor microbial communities therefore we investigated the effects of pfoa on water ecosystems and found that under stimulation by 2 4 μm pfoa denitrifiers were significantly enriched due to their hosting antibiotic resistant genes args which were 1 45 times more abundant than the control furthermore denitrifying metabolism was enhanced by fe ii electron donation specifically 2 4 μm pfoa significantly enhanced the removal of total inorganic nitrogen by 178 6 the microbial community became predominated by denitrifying bacteria 67 8 abundance notably the nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing nrfo bacteria dechloromonas acidovorax bradyrhizorium etc were significantly enriched the selective pressures of pfoa driving the enrichment of denitrifiers were twofold first the toxic pfoa induced denitrifying bacteria to produce args mainly including the efflux occupying 55 4 and antibiotic inactivation occupying 41 2 types which improved microbial tolerance to pfoa the risk of horizontal args transmission was elevated as the overall number of horizontally transmissible args increased by 47 1 second fe ii electrons were transported via the porin cytochrome c extracellular electrons transfer system eet promoting the expression of nitrate reductases which in turn further enhanced denitrification in summary pfoa regulated the microbial community structure and influenced microbial tn removal functions and increased the contribution of args by the denitrifier hosts but the pfoa induced production of args may pose a serious ecological threat that needs to be comprehensively investigated graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa porous media denitrifiers antibiotic resistant genes args denitrification fe ii data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is one of the most frequently detected perfluoroalkyl substances pfas in the environment chen et al 2021b xiao et al 2015 given its advantageous properties such as hydrophobicity thermal stability and acid and base resistance pfoa is widely used in food packaging firefighting foams surfactants and other industrial applications gagliano et al 2020 wang et al 2017 however due to the high energy of the c f bond 485 kj mol l 1 and the strong electronegativity of the f atom natural processes have difficulty eliminating pfoa in fact pfoa is the final degradation product of various perfluorinated compound precursors lindstrom et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 pfoa is easily bioaccumulated in both aquatic and terrestrial organisms and can lead to many human diseases such as kidney cancer neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity li et al 2018b vieira et al 2013 xiang et al 2020 zareitalabad et al 2013 therefore pfoa was added to the stockholm convention list of persistent organic pollutants pops in 2019 unep 2019 making its use and production explicitly restricted since the start of the 21st century contamination and risks related to pfas have been widely investigated pfoa has been detected globally in soil air and water environments due to its ultra long half life and accumulation from numerous pfas precursors via transformation wang et al 2017 pfoa concentrations of 0 11 0 97 mg l 1 have been observed in natural rivers which are even higher than those in municipal wastewaters 0 09 0 92 mg l 1 han and currell 2017 yuan et al 2022 more recently with the migration of pfoa from the surface to the subsurface ug l 1 levels have also been detected in groundwater environments li et al 2020 as the main constituent part of ground water porous media such as soils sediments and aquifers are some of the most sensitive habitats affected by pfoa chen et al 2013 higgins and luthy 2006 xiao et al 2015 porous media form complex environments where solid liquid and gas media intermingle pfoa can interact with phospholipids on cell membranes and inhibit cell membrane synthesis liao et al 2010 and disrupt the balance of oxidative systems and produce excess ros causing oxidative damage and dna breakage even resulting in apoptosis liu et al 2016 these environmental selection pressures exerted by toxic pfoa can significantly alter microbial community structures one study reported that soil with 1000 mg kg 1 pfoa became significantly enriched with proteobacteria within 15 days cai et al 2020 similarly the microbial community in soil contaminated with pfoa for many years was also dominated by proteobacteria these trends occurred because the proteobacteria phospholipid bilayer readily interacts with pfoa making proteobacteria more sensitive to pfoa contamination and more likely to elicit response behavior senevirathna et al 2022 wojcik et al 2018 our previous study also found that pfoa contamination caused significant enrichment in proteobacteria during migration in porous media reaching a remarkably high abundance greater than 91 more interestingly pfoa induced a significant enrichment in antibiotic resistance genes args especially efflux args more importantly pfoa was able to induce an increase in vertically transmissible args and these vertically transferable args were mediated by human pathogenic bacteria chen et al 2022 undoubtedly posing a great threat to human health sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 in recent years studies have identified denitrifying bacteria as the primary hosts of antibiotic resistance genes dang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 denitrifying bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes play an important role in maintaining denitrification when exposed to environmental stress dang et al 2021 denitrification is an important component of the complex nitrogen cycle in nature it is the biochemical reduction of no3 or no2 to gaseous n molecular n2 or oxides of nitrogen by bacteria which is essential for the removal of nitrogen from natural water systems kuypers et al 2018 denitrification can be divided into heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification depending on the microbial action pang and wang 2021 as important carriers of args denitrifiers are affected by organic electron donors organic acids saccharides aromatic compounds etc inorganic electron donors hydrogen gas fe ii mn ii etc and electron transfer efficiency all of which can affect denitrification processes in the environment pang and wang 2021 yang et al 2020b pfoa as a persistent toxic pollutant can significantly alter microbial community structures and stimulate changes in microbial community metabolic functions which may have important effects on nitrogen transformation processes in the environment especially denitrification chen et al 2021a yang et al 2020a however to date few studies have reported on the effects of pfoa on denitrification in this study a porous media environment experiencing long term infusion with surface water containing trace pfoa was simulated using this experiment the effects and mechanisms of microbial community regulation and metabolic function changes on nitrogen transformation caused by the migration of pfoa through the stratum were investigated using various spectroscopic energy spectroscopic and macro transcriptomic assays this study comprehensively revealed the indirect effects of pfoa in the environment and provided a scientific and theoretical basis for an improved understanding of the ecological effects of pfoa 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 to simulate

represents most of the water penetrated soil the ph of synthetic water was 6 5 and the synthetic water was purged with nitrogen to lower do to under 1 mg l 1 in the effluent of the column ph increased slightly to 6 7 and do remained at 1 0 mg l 1 pfoa from the μg l 1 to mg l 1 levels have been measured in water environments due to pfoa s extreme stability lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 in this work pfoa in the synthetic water was set at 2 4 μm which was in the frequently reported pfoa concentration range han et al 2017 yuan et al 2022 according to measurements reported from real water

and discussion 3 1 pfoa stimulated denitrifier enrichment 3 1 1 pfoa induced denitrifier enrichment similar to previous studies in this study the trace amounts of pfoa imposed non negligible stress on microbial communities in porous media significantly affecting community succession fig 1 it is noteworthy that 26 of the top 30 most abundant genera possessed denitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction or dissimilatory nitrate reduction functions in specific 18 genera with denitrification functions became more enriched under pfoa stress including methylophilus 13 3 vs 0 2 dechloromons 8 3 vs 0 5 delftia 3 1 vs 0 1 acinetobater 1 4 vs 0 1 etc the total abundance of denitrifiers reached 67 8 under pfoa stress indicating that pfoa induced the community to become predominated by denitrifiers this may have been because the cell membrane phospholipid components of denitrifiers belonging to proteobacteria 91 6 vs 57 3 see fig s2 were more susceptible to the effects of pfoa wojcik et al 2018 so they were able to sense and respond to pfoa stress in time which in turn led to a significant increase in their abundance in addition denitrifiers are the microbial group that adept at args production and transmission which enhances their environmental adaptability towards both antibiotics and other persistent organics li et al 2023 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 florfenicol could significantly enhance the abundance of args in denitrifiers wang et al 2020 sulfamethoxazole smx could also induce denitrifiers to become enriched in args li et al 2023 and promote the horizontal transmission of args zhang et al 2023 pfoa caused microbial aggregations to form on the surface of the medium see fig s3a b and the biomass per unit weight of quartz sand aggregates increased by 49 2 under the pfoa stress i e from 1 18 to 1 76 mg g 1 of sand fig s3c the aggregating microbes facilitated the formation of biofilms which improved the tolerance of microbes to pfoa and improved their survival van acker et al 2014 the formation of biofilms was further supported by the eps measurements as shown in fig s3d and s3e the content of polysaccharides and proteins per unit biomass increased by 1278 and 619 respectively these results revealed that in the face of the toxicity of pfoa microorganisms form natural protective layers by upregulating the production of eps which in turn reduces the harmful effects of pfoa and ensures sustained microbial activity soleimani et al 2013 3 1 2 nitrogen conversion and loss with the succession of communities towards enrichment with nitrogen cycling microorganisms the concentrations of ammonia 2 mg l 1 and nitrate 2 mg l 1 in the influent were significantly different than the effluent due to the metabolism of microorganisms generally the inorganic nitrogen species in the column effluents i e ammonia nitrite and nitrate were all lower with pfoa stimulation as shown in fig 2 for nh4 n pfoa resulted in a 40 decrease indicating that the regulation of the community and microbial enrichment by pfoa promoted the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen in contrast there was negligible anammox reaction in the column according to the microbial community and n conversion functional genes analyses as shown in fig s4b only 4 anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aaob were identified from the biomass and their total abundance was reduced dramatically under pfoa stress becoming almost un detectable fig s4a besides transcriptomic results showed that the anammox functional genes hzs and hdh were not obviously expressed in either of the protocols fig s4c the anammox reaction is very sensitive to no2 n and nh4 n concentrations and ratios rivett et al 2008 wu et al 2022 so the recharging water of this work was not suitable for aaob accumulation importantly while 1 2 mg l 1 nitrites accumulated in the control no nitrite could be detected in the pfoa treatment this implied that the enrichment of nitrogen cycling bacteria under the pfoa stress promoted nitrogen cycling likewise no3 was reduced more completely under pfoa stress which further indicated denitrification was enhanced based on the concentrations of nitrogenous substances in the feed water and effluent the nitrogen mass balance could be analyzed using eqs s1 s7 cai et al 2022 rittmann and mccarty 2001 as shown in fig s5 the efficiency of denitrification under pfoa stress was 4 4 times greater than that of the control and the efficiency of assimilation n presented in the column was also 1 5 times higher indicating that pfoa stimulated the activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria and subsequently enhanced nitrogen removal as a result pfoa induced a more efficient conversion of inorganic nitrogen and tin removal was enhanced by 178 6 when the reaction was running stably 15 days the promotion of denitrification by pfoa contributed to increasing consumption of organic carbon fig s6 because most of the enriched denitrifying bacteria were heterotrophs including methylophilus dechloromons and pelomonas upon reaching the steady state toc was maintained at 1 8 mg l 1 in the pfoa treatment which was significantly lower than the control 2 3 mg l 1 3 2 denitrifiers were the main arg hosts 3 2 1 pfoa caused elevated arg production to tolerate pfoa toxicity the bacteria biomass residing in the porous media adapted to carry 45 5 more args as shown in fig 3 a the increase in args was likely a response to the pfoa driven increase in microbial intracellular ros levels chen et al 2022 which increased by 31 3 as shown in fig s7 mges analysis further illustrated the effect of pfoa stress on the arg transfer pathway in this system 65 hgt arg encoding plasmids were detected the top 20 most abundant plasmids accounting for 82 3 of the total abundance are shown in fig s8 compared to the control the abundance of plasmids for hgt arg was greatly altered under pfoa stress with nc 013856 1 nc 013858 1 and nc 013856 1 significantly decreasing and nz cm002758 1 nz cm000959 1 and nc 016626 1 significantly increasing overall as shown in fig 3a pfoa resulted in a slight increase in the relative abundance of hgt args the high abundance of hrt args increased the spread of resistance genes among community members due to the ability to overcome barriers between species amarasiri et al 2020 interestingly fig 3b shows that although the absolute abundance of args increased significantly due to pfoa the types of args became less varied i e there were 113 in the control but 96 in the pfoa treatment and the number of hgt args types dropped from 47 to 36 these results illustrated that more hgt arg types were eliminated under pfoa stress but the targeted enrichment of certain hgt arg types further enhanced the effective resistance of these microorganisms to pfoa 3 2 2 host analysis of dngs and args the host analysis of genes encoding functional enzymes in the denitrification pathway and args further revealed the relationship between community structure and denitrification as shown in fig 4 the abundances of most genera 17 19 with both functional genes encoding denitrifying enzymes and antibiotic resistance genes args increased significantly under pfoa stress including dechloromonas acidovorax acinetobacter delftia etc for example dechloromonas possesses the dngs nasa napa napb nirb nird nirs norc norb and nosz and the args oxa 85 and oxa 61 which belongs to antibiotic inactivation resistance mechanism delftia possesses the dngs narg narh nasa narj nirb nird and norr and the args amrb and oxa 134 which belong to antibiotic efflux and antibiotic inactivation resistance mechanisms respectively in contrast the abundance of several microorganisms 3 5 with genes encoding denitrifying enzymes gradually decreased under pfoa stress including phenylobacterium novosphingobium and thaurea because they did not carry any args more notably the abundances of all microorganisms that did not have both genes encoding denitrifying enzymes and args 6 6 dramatically decreased under pfoa stress including mycobacterium sediminibacterium and enhydrobacter the details of dngs and args abundances from the top 30 genera are given in table s2 pfoa is considered a forever organic and exhibited negligible biodegradation during the study fig s9 lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the results showed that denitrifiers carrying args were enriched because they were more tolerant to pfoa except for denitrifying bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob comammox nitrospira and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were barely detectable in the community however the functional genera that played major roles in nitrogen removal were the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera whose abundances increased significantly under pfoa stress fig s4a b the transcriptome results indicated that the reduction of ammonia was mainly related to the active expression of ammonia monooxygenases amo fig s4c it appeared that more activity in the functional genera related to nitrification favored the advanced denitrification and tn removal under pfoa stress 3 3 fe ii enhanced denitrifying activity 3 3 1 verifying nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing bacteria as shown in fig 1 a variety of nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing bacteria nrfob became much more abundant under pfoa stimulation including azohydromonas 9 8 vs 7 8 dechloromonas 8 3 vs 0 5 acidovorax 7 2 vs 0 7 bradyrhizorium 1 0 vs 0 3 etc nrfob are microorganisms that mediate denitrification coupled with fe ii oxidation under anoxic conditions liu et al 2019 because they are not restricted to environments that have light and oxygen they are more abundant than phototrophic and microaerophilic bacteria emerson 2012 kappler and straub 2005 numerous studies have shown that nrfob can directly reduce nitrate via the denitrification pathway and that the intermediate products of denitrification nitrite and no can rapidly chemically oxidize fe ii to fe iii resulting in encrustation on the cell surface li et al 2018a nordhoff et al 2017 indeed the concentrations of fe and nitrogenous substances in the influent were similar to those in the surface water environment as can be seen in fig 5 the iron film on the cell surface in the pfoa treatment is much clearer than in the control group the tem mapping showed that the amount of fe reached 0 14 of the total cell surface elements in the pfoa group whereas no fe was detected in the control group si was the main compositional element of the unavoidable quartz sand fragments that mixed in the biomass this result directly confirmed the occurrence of abiotic fe ii oxidation by no2 under pfoa stress which significantly accelerated the removal of nitrogen from the system 3 3 2 fe ii electron donation pathways increased expression of outer membrane porin and cytochrome c cyt c improved microbial extracellular electron transfer eet for denitrification shi et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 nrfob achieved enzymatic fe ii oxidation via cyt c on the outer membrane the electrons from fe ii were directly transferred to nitrate or its intermediates through the porin cyt c eet system as evidenced by the up regulated expression of the gene encoding porin tables s3 and the one encoding cyt c tables s14 liu et al 2014 extracellular electron transfer enhanced the expression of the genes encoding nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir and nitric oxide reductase nor details in fig s10 the log2foldchange log2fc values of the majority of the functional genes such as narg narh and nari reached 4 while the log2fc of the functional genes nirs and norb reached 5 since nos is a weak competitor for electrons compared to other denitrifying functional enzymes wei et al 2022 nos was inhibited when the supply of electron equivalents was limited resulting in its encoded functional gene logfc value being reduced moreover microbes had significantly up regulated tca cycles details in table s5 under pfoa stress under pfoa stress microbes used acetate to produce more nadh as an electron donor for nitrate reduction the produced nitrite and other intermediates rapidly oxidized fe ii to fe iii in the periplasm and the fe iii was transported out of the cell by porin where it encrusted on the cell surface as seen in tem image of the iron film in fig 6 importantly the reaction between fe ii and nitrate did not occur under normoxic nor anoxic conditions even though the reaction was thermodynamically feasible li et al 2018a this further illustrated that nrfob enriched under pfoa stress played a crucial role in nitrogen removal 3 3 3 state of fe in biomass sem and xrd analysis further revealed the fugacity of fe in the porous media and the morphologies of its oxidation products fe2 was continuously injected into the system as feso4 7h2o 0 5 mg l 1 as shown in fig 7 a sem mapping revealed that fe was enriched and immobilized throughout the whole biofilm under the effects of pfoa this result fully demonstrated the critical role of nrfob under pfoa stress compared to the control group where no fe was detected xrd patterns fig 7b showed that classic goethite phases fe2o3 and feooh were formed which had been described as the final products of the oxidation of fe ii by nitrite during the reduction of heterotrophic nitrate li et al 2018a nordhoff et al 2017 based on the xps of biofilms the semi quantitative results showed an increase in the peak area percentage of fe iii under the influence of pfoa from 40 2 control to 80 6 shown in fig s11 this indicated that the pfoa stress significantly promoted the oxidation of fe ii which was attributed to the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria especially nrfob under pfoa stress the oxidation of fe ii provided more electrons for denitrification while significantly increasing the expression of denitrification functional enzymes theoretically the oxidation of 1 mol of fe ii to fe iii in the reaction of fe ii with no2 provides 1 mol of electrons for the reduction of no2 to nitrogenous gases so to completely oxidize the fe ii of 0 5 mg l 1 feso4 7h2o in solution to fe iii 0 086 mg l 1 of no2 must be reduced which has a weaker effect compared to the effect of pfoa on promoting microbial denitrification by increasing the expression of denitrifying enzymes and extracellular electron transfer the possible reaction processes for nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing are as follows no3 toc denitrifiers no2 other intermediates fe2 no2 h2o feooh no other nitrogenous gases 3 4 pfoa microbial selective pressure mechanisms overall as shown in fig 8 the selection pressure exerted by pfoa regulated the microbial community resulting in the significant enrichment of denitrifying bacteria the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria was enabled by their production of args which increased their tolerance to pfoa moreover microorganisms produced more eps which increased their resistance to pfoa the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria enhanced the nitrogen cycle specifically the low concentration of fe ii in the environment was oxidized by nrfob and the generated electrons were transported through the porin cyt c extracellular electron transport system which enhanced the expression of reductase and intensified denitrification this showed that trace levels of pfoa could directly affect the microbial community of porous media and dramatically alter the function of the community which significantly promoted the denitrification process reduced the accumulation of nitrite and ensured the safety of groundwater quality however the large number of antibiotic resistance genes induced by trace pfoa could pose a serious threat to groundwater quality so the ecological impact of pfoa needs to be comprehensively evaluated 4 conclusions in this study in an experiment simulating the selective pressure of pfoa on the microbial community in porous media we observed for the first time that denitrifier enrichment reaching 67 8 was related to carrying args and the transfer of ferric electrons the toxic pfoa stimulation induced the production of args in denitrifiers the increase in expression of efflux and antibiotic inactivation args indicated selection for the pfoa resistance in denitrifiers the porin cyt c eet promoted electron transfer which facilitated fe ii oxidation and also enhanced the expression of the reductases nar nir and nor as well as nitrogen cycling processes especially denitrification meanwhile the enrichment of nrfob enabled the oxidation of fe ii to goethite phases fe2o3 and feooh and attachment to the cell surface therefore the alteration of the microbial community in porous media by trace pfoa levels at low fe ii concentrations enhanced denitrification by microorganisms however the resulting biological risks such as args enrichment and transmission deserve further in depth research

15007,perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a class of permanent organic pollutants is frequently detected in surface and ground water with the latter made up primarily of porous media such as soils sediments and aquifers that harbor microbial communities therefore we investigated the effects of pfoa on water ecosystems and found that under stimulation by 2 4 μm pfoa denitrifiers were significantly enriched due to their hosting antibiotic resistant genes args which were 1 45 times more abundant than the control furthermore denitrifying metabolism was enhanced by fe ii electron donation specifically 2 4 μm pfoa significantly enhanced the removal of total inorganic nitrogen by 178 6 the microbial community became predominated by denitrifying bacteria 67 8 abundance notably the nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing nrfo bacteria dechloromonas acidovorax bradyrhizorium etc were significantly enriched the selective pressures of pfoa driving the enrichment of denitrifiers were twofold first the toxic pfoa induced denitrifying bacteria to produce args mainly including the efflux occupying 55 4 and antibiotic inactivation occupying 41 2 types which improved microbial tolerance to pfoa the risk of horizontal args transmission was elevated as the overall number of horizontally transmissible args increased by 47 1 second fe ii electrons were transported via the porin cytochrome c extracellular electrons transfer system eet promoting the expression of nitrate reductases which in turn further enhanced denitrification in summary pfoa regulated the microbial community structure and influenced microbial tn removal functions and increased the contribution of args by the denitrifier hosts but the pfoa induced production of args may pose a serious ecological threat that needs to be comprehensively investigated graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa porous media denitrifiers antibiotic resistant genes args denitrification fe ii data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa is one of the most frequently detected perfluoroalkyl substances pfas in the environment chen et al 2021b xiao et al 2015 given its advantageous properties such as hydrophobicity thermal stability and acid and base resistance pfoa is widely used in food packaging firefighting foams surfactants and other industrial applications gagliano et al 2020 wang et al 2017 however due to the high energy of the c f bond 485 kj mol l 1 and the strong electronegativity of the f atom natural processes have difficulty eliminating pfoa in fact pfoa is the final degradation product of various perfluorinated compound precursors lindstrom et al 2011 xiao et al 2018 pfoa is easily bioaccumulated in both aquatic and terrestrial organisms and can lead to many human diseases such as kidney cancer neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity li et al 2018b vieira et al 2013 xiang et al 2020 zareitalabad et al 2013 therefore pfoa was added to the stockholm convention list of persistent organic pollutants pops in 2019 unep 2019 making its use and production explicitly restricted since the start of the 21st century contamination and risks related to pfas have been widely investigated pfoa has been detected globally in soil air and water environments due to its ultra long half life and accumulation from numerous pfas precursors via transformation wang et al 2017 pfoa concentrations of 0 11 0 97 mg l 1 have been observed in natural rivers which are even higher than those in municipal wastewaters 0 09 0 92 mg l 1 han and currell 2017 yuan et al 2022 more recently with the migration of pfoa from the surface to the subsurface ug l 1 levels have also been detected in groundwater environments li et al 2020 as the main constituent part of ground water porous media such as soils sediments and aquifers are some of the most sensitive habitats affected by pfoa chen et al 2013 higgins and luthy 2006 xiao et al 2015 porous media form complex environments where solid liquid and gas media intermingle pfoa can interact with phospholipids on cell membranes and inhibit cell membrane synthesis liao et al 2010 and disrupt the balance of oxidative systems and produce excess ros causing oxidative damage and dna breakage even resulting in apoptosis liu et al 2016 these environmental selection pressures exerted by toxic pfoa can significantly alter microbial community structures one study reported that soil with 1000 mg kg 1 pfoa became significantly enriched with proteobacteria within 15 days cai et al 2020 similarly the microbial community in soil contaminated with pfoa for many years was also dominated by proteobacteria these trends occurred because the proteobacteria phospholipid bilayer readily interacts with pfoa making proteobacteria more sensitive to pfoa contamination and more likely to elicit response behavior senevirathna et al 2022 wojcik et al 2018 our previous study also found that pfoa contamination caused significant enrichment in proteobacteria during migration in porous media reaching a remarkably high abundance greater than 91 more interestingly pfoa induced a significant enrichment in antibiotic resistance genes args especially efflux args more importantly pfoa was able to induce an increase in vertically transmissible args and these vertically transferable args were mediated by human pathogenic bacteria chen et al 2022 undoubtedly posing a great threat to human health sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 in recent years studies have identified denitrifying bacteria as the primary hosts of antibiotic resistance genes dang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 denitrifying bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance genes play an important role in maintaining denitrification when exposed to environmental stress dang et al 2021 denitrification is an important component of the complex nitrogen cycle in nature it is the biochemical reduction of no3 or no2 to gaseous n molecular n2 or oxides of nitrogen by bacteria which is essential for the removal of nitrogen from natural water systems kuypers et al 2018 denitrification can be divided into heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification depending on the microbial action pang and wang 2021 as important carriers of args denitrifiers are affected by organic electron donors organic acids saccharides aromatic compounds etc inorganic electron donors hydrogen gas fe ii mn ii etc and electron transfer efficiency all of which can affect denitrification processes in the environment pang and wang 2021 yang et al 2020b pfoa as a persistent toxic pollutant can significantly alter microbial community structures and stimulate changes in microbial community metabolic functions which may have important effects on nitrogen transformation processes in the environment especially denitrification chen et al 2021a yang et al 2020a however to date few studies have reported on the effects of pfoa on denitrification in this study a porous media environment experiencing long term infusion with surface water containing trace pfoa was simulated using this experiment the effects and mechanisms of microbial community regulation and metabolic function changes on nitrogen transformation caused by the migration of pfoa through the stratum were investigated using various spectroscopic energy spectroscopic and macro transcriptomic assays this study comprehensively revealed the indirect effects of pfoa in the environment and provided a scientific and theoretical basis for an improved understanding of the ecological effects of pfoa 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 to simulate porous media layers six plexiglass columns height 100 mm inner diameter 50 mm were filled with 0 38 porosity quartz sand 0 25 0 35 mm a stainless screen 60 mesh was crimped and fixed at the bottom of

represents most of the water penetrated soil the ph of synthetic water was 6 5 and the synthetic water was purged with nitrogen to lower do to under 1 mg l 1 in the effluent of the column ph increased slightly to 6 7 and do remained at 1 0 mg l 1 pfoa from the μg l 1 to mg l 1 levels have been measured in water environments due to pfoa s extreme stability lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 in this work pfoa in the synthetic water was set at 2 4 μm which was in the frequently reported pfoa concentration range han et al 2017 yuan et al 2022 according to measurements reported from real water

and discussion 3 1 pfoa stimulated denitrifier enrichment 3 1 1 pfoa induced denitrifier enrichment similar to previous studies in this study the trace amounts of pfoa imposed non negligible stress on microbial communities in porous media significantly affecting community succession fig 1 it is noteworthy that 26 of the top 30 most abundant genera possessed denitrification assimilatory nitrate reduction or dissimilatory nitrate reduction functions in specific 18 genera with denitrification functions became more enriched under pfoa stress including methylophilus 13 3 vs 0 2 dechloromons 8 3 vs 0 5 delftia 3 1 vs 0 1 acinetobater 1 4 vs 0 1 etc the total abundance of denitrifiers reached 67 8 under pfoa stress indicating that pfoa induced the community to become predominated by denitrifiers this may have been because the cell membrane phospholipid components of denitrifiers belonging to proteobacteria 91 6 vs 57 3 see fig s2 were more susceptible to the effects of pfoa wojcik et al 2018 so they were able to sense and respond to pfoa stress in time which in turn led to a significant increase in their abundance in addition denitrifiers are the microbial group that adept at args production and transmission which enhances their environmental adaptability towards both antibiotics and other persistent organics li et al 2023 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2023 florfenicol could significantly enhance the abundance of args in denitrifiers wang et al 2020 sulfamethoxazole smx could also induce denitrifiers to become enriched in args li et al 2023 and promote the horizontal transmission of args zhang et al 2023 pfoa caused microbial aggregations to form on the surface of the medium see fig s3a b and the biomass per unit weight of quartz sand aggregates increased by 49 2 under the pfoa stress i e from 1 18 to 1 76 mg g 1 of sand fig s3c the aggregating microbes facilitated the formation of biofilms which improved the tolerance of microbes to pfoa and improved their survival van acker et al 2014 the formation of biofilms was further supported by the eps measurements as shown in fig s3d and s3e the content of polysaccharides and proteins per unit biomass increased by 1278 and 619 respectively these results revealed that in the face of the toxicity of pfoa microorganisms form natural protective layers by upregulating the production of eps which in turn reduces the harmful effects of pfoa and ensures sustained microbial activity soleimani et al 2013 3 1 2 nitrogen conversion and loss with the succession of communities towards enrichment with nitrogen cycling microorganisms the concentrations of ammonia 2 mg l 1 and nitrate 2 mg l 1 in the influent were significantly different than the effluent due to the metabolism of microorganisms generally the inorganic nitrogen species in the column effluents i e ammonia nitrite and nitrate were all lower with pfoa stimulation as shown in fig 2 for nh4 n pfoa resulted in a 40 decrease indicating that the regulation of the community and microbial enrichment by pfoa promoted the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen in contrast there was negligible anammox reaction in the column according to the microbial community and n conversion functional genes analyses as shown in fig s4b only 4 anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria aaob were identified from the biomass and their total abundance was reduced dramatically under pfoa stress becoming almost un detectable fig s4a besides transcriptomic results showed that the anammox functional genes hzs and hdh were not obviously expressed in either of the protocols fig s4c the anammox reaction is very sensitive to no2 n and nh4 n concentrations and ratios rivett et al 2008 wu et al 2022 so the recharging water of this work was not suitable for aaob accumulation importantly while 1 2 mg l 1 nitrites accumulated in the control no nitrite could be detected in the pfoa treatment this implied that the enrichment of nitrogen cycling bacteria under the pfoa stress promoted nitrogen cycling likewise no3 was reduced more completely under pfoa stress which further indicated denitrification was enhanced based on the concentrations of nitrogenous substances in the feed water and effluent the nitrogen mass balance could be analyzed using eqs s1 s7 cai et al 2022 rittmann and mccarty 2001 as shown in fig s5 the efficiency of denitrification under pfoa stress was 4 4 times greater than that of the control and the efficiency of assimilation n presented in the column was also 1 5 times higher indicating that pfoa stimulated the activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria and subsequently enhanced nitrogen removal as a result pfoa induced a more efficient conversion of inorganic nitrogen and tin removal was enhanced by 178 6 when the reaction was running stably 15 days the promotion of denitrification by pfoa contributed to increasing consumption of organic carbon fig s6 because most of the enriched denitrifying bacteria were heterotrophs including methylophilus dechloromons and pelomonas upon reaching the steady state toc was maintained at 1 8 mg l 1 in the pfoa treatment which was significantly lower than the control 2 3 mg l 1 3 2 denitrifiers were the main arg hosts 3 2 1 pfoa caused elevated arg production to tolerate pfoa toxicity the bacteria biomass residing in the porous media adapted to carry 45 5 more args as shown in fig 3 a the increase in args was likely a response to the pfoa driven increase in microbial intracellular ros levels chen et al 2022 which increased by 31 3 as shown in fig s7 mges analysis further illustrated the effect of pfoa stress on the arg transfer pathway in this system 65 hgt arg encoding plasmids were detected the top 20 most abundant plasmids accounting for 82 3 of the total abundance are shown in fig s8 compared to the control the abundance of plasmids for hgt arg was greatly altered under pfoa stress with nc 013856 1 nc 013858 1 and nc 013856 1 significantly decreasing and nz cm002758 1 nz cm000959 1 and nc 016626 1 significantly increasing overall as shown in fig 3a pfoa resulted in a slight increase in the relative abundance of hgt args the high abundance of hrt args increased the spread of resistance genes among community members due to the ability to overcome barriers between species amarasiri et al 2020 interestingly fig 3b shows that although the absolute abundance of args increased significantly due to pfoa the types of args became less varied i e there were 113 in the control but 96 in the pfoa treatment and the number of hgt args types dropped from 47 to 36 these results illustrated that more hgt arg types were eliminated under pfoa stress but the targeted enrichment of certain hgt arg types further enhanced the effective resistance of these microorganisms to pfoa 3 2 2 host analysis of dngs and args the host analysis of genes encoding functional enzymes in the denitrification pathway and args further revealed the relationship between community structure and denitrification as shown in fig 4 the abundances of most genera 17 19 with both functional genes encoding denitrifying enzymes and antibiotic resistance genes args increased significantly under pfoa stress including dechloromonas acidovorax acinetobacter delftia etc for example dechloromonas possesses the dngs nasa napa napb nirb nird nirs norc norb and nosz and the args oxa 85 and oxa 61 which belongs to antibiotic inactivation resistance mechanism delftia possesses the dngs narg narh nasa narj nirb nird and norr and the args amrb and oxa 134 which belong to antibiotic efflux and antibiotic inactivation resistance mechanisms respectively in contrast the abundance of several microorganisms 3 5 with genes encoding denitrifying enzymes gradually decreased under pfoa stress including phenylobacterium novosphingobium and thaurea because they did not carry any args more notably the abundances of all microorganisms that did not have both genes encoding denitrifying enzymes and args 6 6 dramatically decreased under pfoa stress including mycobacterium sediminibacterium and enhydrobacter the details of dngs and args abundances from the top 30 genera are given in table s2 pfoa is considered a forever organic and exhibited negligible biodegradation during the study fig s9 lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 the results showed that denitrifiers carrying args were enriched because they were more tolerant to pfoa except for denitrifying bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob comammox nitrospira and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob were barely detectable in the community however the functional genera that played major roles in nitrogen removal were the ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa nitrosopumilus and nitrososphaera whose abundances increased significantly under pfoa stress fig s4a b the transcriptome results indicated that the reduction of ammonia was mainly related to the active expression of ammonia monooxygenases amo fig s4c it appeared that more activity in the functional genera related to nitrification favored the advanced denitrification and tn removal under pfoa stress 3 3 fe ii enhanced denitrifying activity 3 3 1 verifying nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing bacteria as shown in fig 1 a variety of nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing bacteria nrfob became much more abundant under pfoa stimulation including azohydromonas 9 8 vs 7 8 dechloromonas 8 3 vs 0 5 acidovorax 7 2 vs 0 7 bradyrhizorium 1 0 vs 0 3 etc nrfob are microorganisms that mediate denitrification coupled with fe ii oxidation under anoxic conditions liu et al 2019 because they are not restricted to environments that have light and oxygen they are more abundant than phototrophic and microaerophilic bacteria emerson 2012 kappler and straub 2005 numerous studies have shown that nrfob can directly reduce nitrate via the denitrification pathway and that the intermediate products of denitrification nitrite and no can rapidly chemically oxidize fe ii to fe iii resulting in encrustation on the cell surface li et al 2018a nordhoff et al 2017 indeed the concentrations of fe and nitrogenous substances in the influent were similar to those in the surface water environment as can be seen in fig 5 the iron film on the cell surface in the pfoa treatment is much clearer than in the control group the tem mapping showed that the amount of fe reached 0 14 of the total cell surface elements in the pfoa group whereas no fe was detected in the control group si was the main compositional element of the unavoidable quartz sand fragments that mixed in the biomass this result directly confirmed the occurrence of abiotic fe ii oxidation by no2 under pfoa stress which significantly accelerated the removal of nitrogen from the system 3 3 2 fe ii electron donation pathways increased expression of outer membrane porin and cytochrome c cyt c improved microbial extracellular electron transfer eet for denitrification shi et al 2016 as shown in fig 6 nrfob achieved enzymatic fe ii oxidation via cyt c on the outer membrane the electrons from fe ii were directly transferred to nitrate or its intermediates through the porin cyt c eet system as evidenced by the up regulated expression of the gene encoding porin tables s3 and the one encoding cyt c tables s14 liu et al 2014 extracellular electron transfer enhanced the expression of the genes encoding nitrate reductase nar nitrite reductase nir and nitric oxide reductase nor details in fig s10 the log2foldchange log2fc values of the majority of the functional genes such as narg narh and nari reached 4 while the log2fc of the functional genes nirs and norb reached 5 since nos is a weak competitor for electrons compared to other denitrifying functional enzymes wei et al 2022 nos was inhibited when the supply of electron equivalents was limited resulting in its encoded functional gene logfc value being reduced moreover microbes had significantly up regulated tca cycles details in table s5 under pfoa stress under pfoa stress microbes used acetate to produce more nadh as an electron donor for nitrate reduction the produced nitrite and other intermediates rapidly oxidized fe ii to fe iii in the periplasm and the fe iii was transported out of the cell by porin where it encrusted on the cell surface as seen in tem image of the iron film in fig 6 importantly the reaction between fe ii and nitrate did not occur under normoxic nor anoxic conditions even though the reaction was thermodynamically feasible li et al 2018a this further illustrated that nrfob enriched under pfoa stress played a crucial role in nitrogen removal 3 3 3 state of fe in biomass sem and xrd analysis further revealed the fugacity of fe in the porous media and the morphologies of its oxidation products fe2 was continuously injected into the system as feso4 7h2o 0 5 mg l 1 as shown in fig 7 a sem mapping revealed that fe was enriched and immobilized throughout the whole biofilm under the effects of pfoa this result fully demonstrated the critical role of nrfob under pfoa stress compared to the control group where no fe was detected xrd patterns fig 7b showed that classic goethite phases fe2o3 and feooh were formed which had been described as the final products of the oxidation of fe ii by nitrite during the reduction of heterotrophic nitrate li et al 2018a nordhoff et al 2017 based on the xps of biofilms the semi quantitative results showed an increase in the peak area percentage of fe iii under the influence of pfoa from 40 2 control to 80 6 shown in fig s11 this indicated that the pfoa stress significantly promoted the oxidation of fe ii which was attributed to the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria especially nrfob under pfoa stress the oxidation of fe ii provided more electrons for denitrification while significantly increasing the expression of denitrification functional enzymes theoretically the oxidation of 1 mol of fe ii to fe iii in the reaction of fe ii with no2 provides 1 mol of electrons for the reduction of no2 to nitrogenous gases so to completely oxidize the fe ii of 0 5 mg l 1 feso4 7h2o in solution to fe iii 0 086 mg l 1 of no2 must be reduced which has a weaker effect compared to the effect of pfoa on promoting microbial denitrification by increasing the expression of denitrifying enzymes and extracellular electron transfer the possible reaction processes for nitrate reduction ferrous oxidizing are as follows no3 toc denitrifiers no2 other intermediates fe2 no2 h2o feooh no other nitrogenous gases 3 4 pfoa microbial selective pressure mechanisms overall as shown in fig 8 the selection pressure exerted by pfoa regulated the microbial community resulting in the significant enrichment of denitrifying bacteria the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria was enabled by their production of args which increased their tolerance to pfoa moreover microorganisms produced more eps which increased their resistance to pfoa the enrichment of denitrifying bacteria enhanced the nitrogen cycle specifically the low concentration of fe ii in the environment was oxidized by nrfob and the generated electrons were transported through the porin cyt c extracellular electron transport system which enhanced the expression of reductase and intensified denitrification this showed that trace levels of pfoa could directly affect the microbial community of porous media and dramatically alter the function of the community which significantly promoted the denitrification process reduced the accumulation of nitrite and ensured the safety of groundwater quality however the large number of antibiotic resistance genes induced by trace pfoa could pose a serious threat to groundwater quality so the ecological impact of pfoa needs to be comprehensively evaluated 4 conclusions in this study in an experiment simulating the selective pressure of pfoa on the microbial community in porous media we observed for the first time that denitrifier enrichment reaching 67 8 was related to carrying args and the transfer of ferric electrons the toxic pfoa stimulation induced the production of args in denitrifiers the increase in expression of efflux and antibiotic inactivation args indicated selection for the pfoa resistance in denitrifiers the porin cyt c eet promoted electron transfer which facilitated fe ii oxidation and also enhanced the expression of the reductases nar nir and nor as well as nitrogen cycling processes especially denitrification meanwhile the enrichment of nrfob enabled the oxidation of fe ii to goethite phases fe2o3 and feooh and attachment to the cell surface therefore the alteration of the microbial community in porous media by trace pfoa levels at low fe ii concentrations enhanced denitrification by microorganisms however the resulting biological risks such as args enrichment and transmission deserve further in depth research

15008,rapid sand filters rsf are an established and widely applied technology for groundwater treatment yet the underlying interwoven biological and physical chemical reactions controlling the sequential removal of iron ammonia and manganese remain poorly understood to resolve the contribution and interactions between the individual reactions we studied two full scale drinking water treatment plant configurations namely i one dual media anthracite and quartz sand filter and ii two single media quartz sand filters in series in situ and ex situ activity tests were combined with mineral coating characterization and metagenome guided metaproteomics along the depth of each filter both plants exhibited comparable performances and process compartmentalization with most of ammonium and manganese removal occurring only after complete iron depletion the homogeneity of the media coating and genome based microbial composition within each compartment highlighted the effect of backwashing namely the complete vertical mixing of the filter media in stark contrast to this homogeneity the removal of the contaminants was strongly stratified within each compartment and decreased along the filter height this apparent and longstanding conflict was resolved by quantifying the expressed proteome at different filter heights revealing a consistent stratification of proteins catalysing ammonia oxidation and protein based relative abundances of nitrifying genera up to 2 orders of magnitude difference between top and bottom samples this implies that microorganisms adapt their protein pool to the available nutrient load at a faster rate than the backwash mixing frequency ultimately these results show the unique and complementary potential of metaproteomics to understand metabolic adaptations and interactions in highly dynamic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater sand filter metaproteomics manganese ammonium iron

available on request 1 introduction anaerobic groundwater is an excellent drinking water source due to its microbiological safety stable temperature and composition giordano 2009 katsanou and karapanagioti 2019 de vet 2011 rapid sand filters rsfs preceded by an aeration step are the most commonly applied technology for groundwater treatment the main groundwater contaminants soluble iron fe2 ammonium nh4 and manganese mn2 are sequentially removed in a combination of interdependent biological and physical chemical reactions bourgine et al 1994 while the latter have been the subject of decades of research our understanding of the microbiology involved in the removal of groundwater contaminants is still limited according to recent research fe2 is oxidized through a combination of chemical and biological processes van beek et al 2012 mn2 is mainly removed through chemical autocatalytic oxidation and to some extent biologically breda et al 2019 and nh4 removal is exclusively biological tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 however not only the impact of microbial activity on the removal processes and their stratification along the height of rsfs is largely unknown but also the individual physiologies of the involved microorganisms remain elusive gülay et al 2016 deepening our knowledge of the underlying microbiology is paramount to improve current rsf operation and to design and implement novel resource efficient systems the first characterization of nitrifying biomass stratification in rsfs dates back to the beginning of this century kihn et al 2000 in their pioneering work kihn and colleagues observed an uneven distribution of nitrifying activity along a full scale rsf using ex situ batch incubations subsequently molecular methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization lydmark et al 2006 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing qin et al 2007 and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis w de vet et al 2009 have been used to investigate the diversity of nitrifying bacteria and to estimate the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea furthermore quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has been applied to determine the distribution of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in rsfs bai et al 2013 linking absolute microbial abundances to in situ ammonium removal capacity tatari et al 2016 2017 recently shotgun metagenomics has established itself as the predominant approach for the characterization of the composition and functional potential of complex microbiomes and led to remarkable discoveries in rsfs such as the complete oxidation of ammonia by a single organism comammox palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2016 or the metabolic coupling between methane and ammonia oxidizing communities poghosyan et al 2020 on the contrary information about biological iron and manganese oxidation in rsfs is scarce primarily due to our limited understanding of the underlying metabolic pathways ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 romano et al 2017 in spite of this the presence and importance of iron and manganese oxidizing organisms in rsfs has repeatedly been shown by culture dependent burger et al 2008 nitzsche et al 2015 qin et al 2009 yang et al 2014 and culture independent studies bruins et al 2017 gülay et al 2018 marcus et al 2017 yang et al 2020 ex situ batch incubations breda et al 2019 and metagenomics hu et al 2020 palomo et al 2016 however mechanistic insights linking filter performance with actual microbial activities have not been established to date recent technical advancements made the characterization of the entire pool of proteins expressed in complex communities feasible van den bossche et al 2021 wilmes and bond 2004 proteins are the biological entities catalyzing metabolic reactions thus beyond genome based approaches their identification and quantification allow for the simultaneous resolution of the identity and actual metabolic function of core community members kleiner 2019 protein abundances also provide a more accurate estimation of the relative biomass contribution of different populations in a community kleikamp et al 2021 kleiner et al 2017 over the past decades metaproteomics has been successfully applied to characterize microbiomes from different environments including wastewater kleikamp et al 2022 and freshwater hanson and madsen 2015 ecosystems moreover differential protein expression has been used to characterize microbiomes physiological responses to rapid environmental changes chirania et al 2022 wilmes et al 2015 making metaproteomics particularly relevant to study dynamic environments such as rsf systems rsfs are regularly backwashed to remove particles that have been trapped during operation as a result biomass colonized filter media grains are displaced along the filter height and exposed to different substrate loads at every cycle ramsay et al 2021 consistently metagenome based studies commonly report even distributions of core taxa along filter heights bai et al 2013 tatari et al 2017 and conventional rsfs models consider them as homogeneous systems uhl and gimbel 2000 in contrast and irrespective of the backwash contaminant removal stratification along the filter is commonly reported gude et al 2016 tatari et al 2016 within this framework we hypothesize that genetically homogeneous rsfs microbial communities hold the ability to rapidly modify their pool of expressed proteins to metabolically respond to the environmental conditions encountered at a given filter height to this end we quantified the in situ removal of iron manganese and ammonium and resolved the taxonomy and function of the microbial communities along the filter height of two full scale rsf plants one dual media anthracite

corportaion massachusetts usa according to the manufacturer s protocol an aliquot corresponding to approximately 250 ng of protein digest was analyzed with a shotgun proteomics approach as described by kleikamp et al kleikamp et al 2021 briefly the peptides were analyzed using a nano liquid chromatography system consisting of an easy nano lc 1200 equipped with an acclaim pepmap rslc rp c18

peptide spectrum matches were filtered for 5 false discovery rate fdr and protein identifications with at least 2 unique peptides were considered as significant functional annotations ko identifiers

for diamond annotations the lineage of the lowest common ancestor was determined from the top 10 sequence alignments comparison of the relative abundance of proteins between samples was performed using relative spectral counts i e normalized spectral counts defined as spectral counts per protein divided by the molecular weight divided by the sum of spectral counts of all proteins of all samples since protein extraction was performed from filter media of equal mass 150 mg per sample the protein abundance of sample sf t was multiplied upfront by 0 76 to correct for the density difference between anthracite 1 3 g cm3 and quartz sand 1 7 g cm3 for sake of simplicity further corrections for differences in nutrient loads between systems resulting from different superficial velocities and filter volumes table 1 were omitted as they did not yield significantly different results to identify the functional guilds of interest all proteins were taxonomically classified using their best hit in the ncbi and kegg database and subsequently grouped at genus level and the resulting genera were manually classified based on their most probable energy source iron nitrogen or others based on the literature table s3 similarly the contribution of a specific protein was estimated by summing up the relative abundances of all proteins with the same annotation raw data is attached in table s5 3 results 3 1 in situ oxidation of fe2 nh4 mn2 display similar compartmentalization in both configurations the concentration profiles of ammonium iron and manganese along the studied treatment processes are shown in fig 2 a and 2b iron was completely removed 0 04 mg fe2 l in the top layer of the single filter system i e anthracite layer sf t and in the first filter of the double filter system df1 consistently manganese consumption only started after iron depletion in both systems namely in sf m and df2 t and was complete 0 002 mg mn2 l at the end of each treatment process in analogy most ammonium was removed after iron depletion with 30 removal in sf t and df1 the observed process compartmentalization was also reflected in each filter section in the total mass of iron and manganese oxides the end products of fe2 and mn2 oxidation van beek et al 2012 fig 2c d the coating in sf t and df1 mainly consisted of iron 118 8 mgfe gmedia while the coating in sf m sf b and df2 mainly consisted of manganese 33 6 mgmn gmedia in sf anthracite and quartz sand remained clearly separated after over one year of operation despite frequent backwashing cycles nevertheless trace amounts of anthracite particles were found in the lower filter sections and might explain the slightly higher iron coating content in sf m and sf b as compared to df2 fig 2c d overall concentration profiles and coating composition results revealed similar compartmentalization of removal processes in the two dwtps irrespective of dual media single filter or single media double filter configurations 3 2 ex situ nh4 and mn2 removal mechanisms and rates reflect in situ compartmentalization 3 2 1 manganese is chemically oxidized or adsorbed depending on filter media coating the manganese removal capacity of the filter media in the different sections was quantified in batch activity tests fig 3 a and 3c complete mn2 removal was observed with manganese coated media from the later sections of both treatments i e sf m sf b and df2 contrastingly it remained incomplete with iron coated media from the first treatment sections i e sf t and df1 to further characterize the removal mechanism desorption experiments were performed by submerging drained media in demineralized water eley and nicholson 1993 mn2 desorption was observed exclusively with iron rich media fig 3b and 3d suggesting that mn2 is adsorbed by iron oxides bibak 1994 while it is oxidized on manganese oxide coated particles first order oxidation rate constants were calculated for manganese oxidizing media fig 3e as manganese oxidation is known to occur mainly physicochemically and to linearly depend on mn2 concentration breda et al 2019 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 removal rate constants were similar in both systems 0 010 0 013 min 1 in sf m and sf b 0 014 0 016 min 1 in df2 consistent with the comparable total amounts of manganese oxide coating the catalyst of manganese oxidation breda et al 2019 moreover the rate constants were comparable in all sections devoid of iron oxides despite decreasing manganese concentrations along the filter height fig 2 likely this is the result of media mixing during frequent backwash events 3 2 2 ammonia oxidation is biological compartmentalized and stratified within each compartment the maximum volumetric ammonia oxidation rates along the filter heights were tested ex situ in batch experiments fig 4 a the biological nature of ammonia oxidation was validated with penicillin amended batch tests fig 4b consistent with the measured ammonium concentration profiles along the two treatments fig 2a and 2b the maximum ammonium removal rates were significantly lower in the sections where iron is present 4 5 4 7 g nh4 mmedia 3 h sf t df1 t and df1 m compared to the downstream sections where iron was depleted 15 62 g nh4 mmedia 3 h sf m sf b and throughout df2 moreover in contrast to the relatively uniform chemical manganese oxidation rate constants fig 3e the biological ammonium removal rates displayed a decreasing trend likely reflecting the decreasing substrate availability along the filter height fig 4a 3 3 taxonomic and functional analysis bridge plant operation with microbial physiology 3 3 1 metagenomic based microbial composition reflects process compartmentalization to resolve the phylum level taxonomic profile of the microbial community in the rapid sand filters we sequenced the metagenome of each section the metagenome was subsequently also used as a reference database for metaproteomics see next section the analysis yielded an average of 7 106 3 1 106 paired end reads per sample after quality filtering table s1 we used de novo assembly to process the trimmed reads resulting in 1 105 5 8 104 contigs 0 5 kb with an average n50 of 1118 215 bases notably samples from the lower sections of each filter sf m sf b and df2 b produced the shortest contigs with an average length of less than 1 kb we also predicted an average of 1 8 106 1 106 coding sequences per sample on the assembled contigs bacteria accounted for 91 2 1 9 of the total contigs in all samples while archaea accounted for 1 and the remainder remained unclassified 75 4 3 7 of the bacterial contigs were classified at phylum level fig 5 proteobacteria 45 7 12 1 and nitrospirae 18 8 10 8 dominated all sections followed by planctomycetes and acidobacteria that were present in all sections except for sf t verrucomicrobia and bacteroidetes were found in sf t and df1 and actinobacteria only in df1 importantly contigs associated with the nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae families fig s2 were more abundant in the upper parts of the filters where the actual removal of ammonium occurred in analogy contigs assigned to phyla or families known to contribute to iron oxidation were present in all compartments but were mainly present in the anthracite layer of sf where iron removal occurs overall the composition of the microbial communities reflected the observed activity compartmentalization figs 2 and 4 and this was especially evident in the dual filter system featuring a uniform community composition within each filter i e df1 and df2 despite the potential mixing effect of backwash an analogous compartmentalization was also observed between the anthracite sf t and sand layers sf m sf b in sf 3 3 2 differential protein abundance explains biological activity stratification the proteome of each section was quantified to estimate the relative contribution of known nitrogen and iron metabolizing guilds to the total biomass as well as the distribution of core nitrogen iron and manganese transforming enzymes per sample we obtained on average 176 79 individual protein groups that contained at least two unique peptides and false discover rate fdr 1 table s4 the guilds of interest were identified by taxonomically grouping all proteins at genus level and subsequently classifying the resulting genera based on their most probable energy source i e iron nitrogen or others fig 6 and table s3 based on the reported physiologies of the respective genus the relative contribution of individual proteins of interest was estimated by grouping all proteins with the same ko number and summing up all the corresponding relative abundances the protein based quantification of nitrogen metabolizing guilds revealed a clear increase in their relative abundance in the lower sections of sf and in df2 with a marked stratification in df2 fig 6 in analogy with the ex situ activities fig 4a the genes of core nitrogen metabolisms nitrification denitrification and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra were present in all samples figure 7a table s2 and the abundance of the corresponding proteins was higher in the downstream sections of both systems specifically the key proteins for nitrification ammonia monooxygenase amoabc and nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab were present in all samples conversely hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao was found at much lower abundances and only in some sections while its coding gene hao was ubiquitously present in terms of denitrification nitrite reductase nirk or nirs was the only detected protein even if most genes i e nitrate reductase narghi nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz were found in the metagenome of all sections in analogy dnra genes were found in most metagenomes but none of the corresponding proteins were detected data not shown table s2 consistent with the iron concentration profiles and the coating composition along sf fig 2 putative iron oxidizers were most abundant in the first section of sf sf t fig 6 in turn surprisingly low abundance of iron oxidizers was found in df1 despite all iron being removed in this filter this observation coincides with low overall biomass abundances in df1 t and df1 m calculated as the sum of normalized spectral counts of each section divided by the sum of spectral counts of all samples combined as compared to the other filters fig s3 genes encoding for putative iron oxidizing proteins cyc2 cyc1 mtoabc based on fegenie garber et al 2020 were present in all sections yet the corresponding proteins were only found in sf and df2 fig 7 b other putative iron oxidizing genes i e foxabc foxeyz and pioabc garber et al 2020 were not detected in any sample lastly putative manganese oxidizing genes were spread across all samples with no evident correlation with filter operation but no expressed proteins were detected 4 discussion two full scale drinking water treatment plants were chosen to unravel the interaction between physicochemical and biological processes and their distribution along the height of rapid sand filters rsfs while treating groundwater with similar compositions the first plant employed a single filter with an anthracite layer on top of a quartz sand core and the second comprised a double filter configuration containing quartz sand only in situ and ex situ quantification of iron manganese and ammonium removals were combined with the characterization of the corresponding filter media coating genomic and proteomic profiling along the filter height was used to compare the metabolic potential i e genes encoding for certain proteins with the actual metabolism i e expressed proteins of the underlying microbial communities 4 1 backwash driven filter media mixing results in compartments with homogeneous coating and genetic fingerprints both sand filtration systems exhibited highly comparable operational performances and harboured microbial communities with surprisingly similar taxonomic and functional profiles iron was removed in the first sections being it the anthracite top layer in the single filter system or the first filter in the double filter configuration while ammonium and manganese removal occurred primarily in the downstream sections fig 2 spatial separation between iron and manganese removal has often been reported in rapid sand filters bourgine et al 1994 gouzinis et al 1998 and it is commonly attributed to the different ph oxidation reduction potentials required for their oxidation and precipitation pacini et al 2005 also the mineral coating composition is often used as a proxy to localize where removals occur during the lifespan of a filter gülay et al 2014 consistently we observed the process compartmentalization clearly reflected in the coating composition of the filter media of both studied systems iron and manganese oxides dominated the first and the downstream sections of each system respectively fig 2 with coating amounts comparable to other dwtps breda et al 2019 moreover both the manganese coating mass and the removal rate constants were rather constant in all sections devoid of iron fig 3 as the physicochemical oxidation of manganese is directly proportional to the available concentration of manganese breda et al 2019 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 manganese oxide coating was expected to decrease along the filter height in contrast we observed homogeneity of coating thickness within the manganese removing compartments of both filter systems which is likely the result of filter media mixing during backwash ramsay et al 2021 the observed compartmentalization of in situ removal rates and metal oxide coating types was also supported by the taxonomic classification of the shotgun metagenomics derived contigs fig 5 and by the distribution of genes encoding for proteins involved in the oxidation of iron ammonium and manganese fig 7 the relative abundance of families commonly associated to the oxidation of iron gallionellaceae gülay et al 2018 and nitrogen nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae fowler et al 2018b in rsfs were higher in the top and downstream sections of each dwtp respectively fig s1 moreover their distribution within each compartment was relatively homogeneous fig 5 suggesting that microbial growth on the available substrates in each section is slower compared to the frequency of backwash filter media mixing similar spatial separation between iron and ammonium removal bourgine et al 1994 w de vet et al 2009 sharma et al 2005 but low heterogeneity in genome based microbial community compositions have been observed along the height of different filters previously bai et al 2013 tatari et al 2017 w de vet et al 2009 ascribed this phenomenon to the accumulation of iron hydroxide flocks in the filter media and phosphate de vet et al 2012 or copper wagner et al 2016 limitation have also been shown to hinder nitrification in rsfs while the direct impact of iron oxides needs further investigation our work allows to rule out the impact of nutrient limitations in the investigated dwtps as full nitrification was not suppressed but simply spatially delayed taken together these results provide solid evidence that irrespective of treatment configuration being it a dual media single filter or single media double filter setup processes compartmentalize along filter heights the fact that anthracite and quartz sand remained clearly separated in the single filter after over one year of operation also proves the effectiveness of dual media filtration in spatially separating processes and its equivalence to two filters in series moreover the homogeneity of media coating and genome based microbial community composition within each compartment highlights the process wise relevance of backwashing filter media mixing 4 2 protein abundance profiles reflect biological activity stratification and substrate gradients in stark contrast to the clear intra compartment homogeneity in situ iron ammonium and manganese concentration profiles fig 2 and ex situ biological ammonium oxidation rates displayed a strongly stratified profile within the different filter compartments fig 4 to investigate the discrepancy between the stratified activities and the homogeneous metagenome based distribution of iron ammonia and manganese oxidizing genes fig 7 we employed shotgun metaproteomics to quantify the relative abundance of the encoded proteins along the filter heights as proxy for in situ biological activity stratification patterns in ex situ and in situ ammonia oxidation rates similar to the ones observed in sf and df have been reported in sand filters treating water with tatari et al 2013 2016 and without lee et al 2014 iron and have been attributed to the progressive decrease in ammonium concentration along the filter height w de vet rietveld et al 2009 we detected higher protein based relative abundances of putative nitrifying microorganisms in the downstream sections where most ammonia oxidation occurs and we even observed a clear stratification in df2 where all three investigated filter sections were devoid of iron fig 6 importantly the same decreasing trend could also be observed in the abundance of the core enzymes of nitrification i e ammonia monooxygenase amoabc nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab and nitrifier assigned nitrite reductase nirk used here as proxy for the actual nitrifying activity of the microbial community fig 7 in analogy the protein based relative abundance of putative iron oxidizing bacteria was the highest in the anthracite layer of sf fig 6 the only section where contigs of the gallionellaceae family the most common iron oxidizing bacteria de vet et al 2011 were found in terms of specific enzymes the only detected fe oxidizing protein with a proven function was the c type cytochrome cyc2 castelle et al 2008 a protein reported to be conserved in most neutrophilic iron oxidizers mcallister et al 2020 no other iron oxidizing protein was detected and likely due to the still limited biochemical characterization of this process only few of the known iron oxidizing genes reviewed by garber et al 2020 were found the surprisingly low relative abundance of proteins assigned to putative iron oxidizers in df1 fig 6 could in principle suggest a dominance of abiotic processes controlling iron oxidation in this filter however the overall protein recovery in df1 was significantly lower than in all other sections this could possibly be ascribed to iron oxides hindering protein extraction as seen by barco edwards 2014 yet this was not encountered in the iron removing sf t section thus the reason for the low protein yield in df1 as well as the extend of contribution of biological iron oxidation to overall iron removal deserve further investigation ultimately the absence of proteins involved in manganese oxidation despite the presence of the corresponding genes suggests an abiotic dominated process in strong agreement with the homogeneously distributed first order rate constants fig 3 in conclusion the quantification of expressed proteins allowed us to resolve the often reported dichotomy between on the one hand the intra compartment homogeneity of the mineral coating and genome based microbial community composition and on the other the marked stratification of the concentration profiles and biological activities we hypothesize that backwashing results in mixing and homogenization of the filter media and thereby exposes the attached microorganisms to a different substrate load in response microorganisms adjust their metabolic fluxes by adapting their protein pool at a faster rate than the mixing frequency conversely the actual microbial growth between mixing is minimal and does not result in detectable changes at the genome level beyond rapid sand filters these results prove the potential of metagenome guided metaproteomics as a powerful tool to understand metabolic interactions in highly dynamic ecosystems 5 conclusions in this work we compared two full scale drinking water treatment plants to resolve the interaction between the physicochemical and biological processes controlling ammonium iron and manganese removal the first plant employed a dual bed anthracite and quartz sand single filter the second two single bed quartz sand filters in series both plants treated groundwater with similar chemical composition the combination of biological activity measurements mineral coating characterization and multi omics profiling led to the following conclusions both systems exhibited comparable performances and clear process compartmentalization with iron being fully removed in the first sections and ammonium and manganese primarily in the downstream ones the mineral composition of the media coating reflected the compartmentalization of processes i e iron and manganese oxides dominated the first and downstream sections of each system respectively the homogeneity of media coating and genome based composition of the microbial communities within each compartment highlighted the process wise relevance of backwashing filter media mixing only protein abundance profiles reflected the intra compartment removal stratification strongly highlighting the potential of metaproteomic approaches for studying highly dynamic ecosystems dual media single filters and series of single media filters are equivalent from an operational and ecological perspective and anthracite and sand remain separated despite frequent backwashing ultimately the combination of in situ and ex situ physical chemical and biological analysis with metagenomics guided metaproteomics allowed to resolve the apparent and longstanding conflict between the vertical homogeneity of filter media characteristics and the stratification of

15008,rapid sand filters rsf are an established and widely applied technology for groundwater treatment yet the underlying interwoven biological and physical chemical reactions controlling the sequential removal of iron ammonia and manganese remain poorly understood to resolve the contribution and interactions between the individual reactions we studied two full scale drinking water treatment plant configurations namely i one dual media anthracite and quartz sand filter and ii two single media quartz sand filters in series in situ and ex situ activity tests were combined with mineral coating characterization and metagenome guided metaproteomics along the depth of each filter both plants exhibited comparable performances and process compartmentalization with most of ammonium and manganese removal occurring only after complete iron depletion the homogeneity of the media coating and genome based microbial composition within each compartment highlighted the effect of backwashing namely the complete vertical mixing of the filter media in stark contrast to this homogeneity the removal of the contaminants was strongly stratified within each compartment and decreased along the filter height this apparent and longstanding conflict was resolved by quantifying the expressed proteome at different filter heights revealing a consistent stratification of proteins catalysing ammonia oxidation and protein based relative abundances of nitrifying genera up to 2 orders of magnitude difference between top and bottom samples this implies that microorganisms adapt their protein pool to the available nutrient load at a faster rate than the backwash mixing frequency ultimately these results show the unique and complementary potential of metaproteomics to understand metabolic adaptations and interactions in highly dynamic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater sand filter metaproteomics manganese ammonium iron

karapanagioti 2019 de vet 2011 rapid sand filters rsfs preceded by an aeration step are the most commonly applied technology for groundwater treatment the main groundwater contaminants soluble iron fe2 ammonium nh4 and manganese mn2 are sequentially removed in a combination of interdependent biological and physical chemical reactions bourgine et al 1994 while the latter have been the subject of decades of research our understanding of the microbiology involved in the removal of groundwater contaminants is still limited according to recent research fe2 is oxidized through a combination of chemical and biological processes van beek et al 2012 mn2 is mainly removed through chemical autocatalytic oxidation and to some extent biologically breda et al 2019 and nh4 removal is exclusively biological tekerlekopoulou et al 2013 however not only the impact of microbial activity on the removal processes and their stratification along the height of rsfs is largely unknown but also the individual physiologies of the involved microorganisms remain elusive gülay et al 2016 deepening our knowledge of the underlying microbiology is paramount to improve current rsf operation and to design and implement novel resource efficient systems the first characterization of nitrifying biomass stratification in rsfs dates back to the beginning of this century kihn et al 2000 in their pioneering work kihn and colleagues observed an uneven distribution of nitrifying activity along a full scale rsf using ex situ batch incubations subsequently molecular methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridization lydmark et al 2006 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing qin et al 2007 and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis w de vet et al 2009 have been used to investigate the diversity of nitrifying bacteria and to estimate the relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea furthermore quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr has been applied to determine the distribution of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in rsfs bai et al 2013 linking absolute microbial abundances to in situ ammonium removal capacity tatari et al 2016 2017 recently shotgun metagenomics has established itself as the predominant approach for the characterization of the composition and functional potential of complex microbiomes and led to remarkable discoveries in rsfs such as the complete oxidation of ammonia by a single organism comammox palomo et al 2016 pinto et al 2016 or the metabolic coupling between methane and ammonia oxidizing communities poghosyan et al 2020 on the contrary information about biological iron and manganese oxidation in rsfs is scarce primarily due to our limited understanding of the underlying metabolic pathways ilbert and bonnefoy 2013 romano et al 2017 in spite of this the presence and importance of iron and manganese oxidizing organisms in rsfs has repeatedly been shown by culture dependent burger et al 2008 nitzsche et al 2015 qin et al 2009 yang et al 2014 and culture independent studies bruins et al 2017 gülay et al 2018 marcus et al 2017 yang et al 2020 ex situ batch incubations breda et al 2019 and metagenomics hu et al 2020 palomo et al 2016 however mechanistic insights linking filter performance with actual microbial activities have not been established to date recent technical advancements made the characterization of the entire pool of proteins expressed in complex communities feasible van den bossche et al 2021 wilmes and bond 2004 proteins are the biological entities catalyzing metabolic reactions thus beyond genome based approaches their identification and quantification allow for the simultaneous resolution of the identity and actual metabolic function of core community members kleiner 2019 protein abundances also provide a more accurate estimation of the relative biomass contribution of different populations in a community kleikamp et al 2021 kleiner et al 2017 over the past decades metaproteomics has been successfully applied to characterize microbiomes from different environments including wastewater kleikamp et al 2022 and freshwater hanson and madsen 2015 ecosystems moreover differential protein expression has been used to characterize microbiomes physiological responses to rapid environmental changes chirania et al 2022 wilmes et al 2015 making metaproteomics particularly relevant to study dynamic environments such as rsf systems rsfs are regularly backwashed to remove particles that have been trapped during operation as a result biomass colonized filter media grains are displaced along the filter height and exposed to different substrate loads at every cycle ramsay et al 2021 consistently metagenome based studies commonly report even distributions of core taxa along filter heights bai et al 2013 tatari et al 2017 and conventional rsfs models consider them as homogeneous systems uhl and gimbel 2000 in contrast and irrespective of the backwash contaminant removal stratification along the filter is commonly reported gude et al 2016 tatari et al 2016 within this framework we hypothesize that genetically homogeneous rsfs microbial communities hold the ability to rapidly modify their pool of expressed proteins to metabolically respond to the environmental conditions encountered at a given filter height to this end we quantified the in situ removal of iron manganese and ammonium and resolved the taxonomy and function of the microbial communities along the filter height of two full scale rsf plants one dual media anthracite and sand single filter system and one comprising two single media sand filters in series 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection filter media and water samples were collected from two groundwater fed drinking water treatment plants dwtp operated by the company vitens the first one located in druten the netherlands was a single filter sf with a dual media bed of 0 6 m anthracite on top and 2 m of quartz sand at the bottom the second one located in hasselo the netherlands was a double filter df consisting of two single media 2 m high quartz sand filters df1 and df2 connected in series with an aeration step in between the filter media was sampled with a peat sampler at three different heights in each filter approximately every 0 5 m referred to as top t middle m and bottom b

corportaion massachusetts usa according to the manufacturer s protocol an aliquot corresponding to approximately 250 ng of protein digest was analyzed with a shotgun proteomics approach as described

peptide spectrum matches were filtered for 5 false discovery rate fdr and protein identifications with at least 2 unique peptides were considered as significant functional annotations ko identifiers

for diamond annotations the lineage of the lowest common ancestor was determined from the top 10 sequence alignments comparison of the relative abundance of proteins between samples was performed using relative spectral counts i e normalized spectral counts defined as spectral counts per protein divided by the molecular weight divided by the sum of spectral counts of all proteins of all samples since protein extraction was performed from filter media of equal mass 150 mg per sample the protein abundance of sample sf t was multiplied upfront by 0 76 to correct for the density difference between anthracite 1 3 g cm3 and quartz sand 1 7 g cm3 for sake of simplicity further corrections for differences in nutrient loads between systems resulting from different superficial velocities and filter volumes table 1 were omitted as they did not yield significantly different results to identify the functional guilds of interest all proteins were taxonomically classified using their best hit in the ncbi and kegg database and subsequently grouped at genus level and the resulting genera were manually classified based on their most probable energy source iron nitrogen or others based on the literature table s3 similarly the contribution of a specific protein was estimated by summing up the relative abundances of all proteins with the same annotation raw data is attached in table s5 3 results 3 1 in situ oxidation of fe2 nh4 mn2 display similar compartmentalization in both configurations the concentration profiles of ammonium iron and manganese along the studied treatment processes are shown in fig 2 a and 2b iron was completely removed 0 04 mg fe2 l in the top layer of the single filter system i e anthracite layer sf t and in the first filter of the double filter system df1 consistently manganese consumption only started after iron depletion in both systems namely in sf m and df2 t and was complete 0 002 mg mn2 l at the end of each treatment process in analogy most ammonium was removed after iron depletion with 30 removal in sf t and df1 the observed process compartmentalization was also reflected in each filter section in the total mass of iron and manganese oxides the end products of fe2 and mn2 oxidation van beek et al 2012 fig 2c d the coating in sf t and df1 mainly consisted of iron 118 8 mgfe gmedia while the coating in sf m sf b and df2 mainly consisted of manganese 33 6 mgmn gmedia in sf anthracite and quartz sand remained clearly separated after over one year of operation despite frequent backwashing cycles nevertheless trace amounts of anthracite particles were found in the lower filter sections and might explain the slightly higher iron coating content in sf m and sf b as compared to df2 fig 2c d overall concentration profiles and coating composition results revealed similar compartmentalization of removal processes in the two dwtps irrespective of dual media single filter or single media double filter configurations 3 2 ex situ nh4 and mn2 removal mechanisms and rates reflect in situ compartmentalization 3 2 1 manganese is chemically oxidized or adsorbed depending on filter media coating the manganese removal capacity of the filter media in the different sections was quantified in batch activity tests fig 3 a and 3c complete mn2 removal was observed with manganese coated media from the later sections of both treatments i e sf m sf b and df2 contrastingly it remained incomplete with iron coated media from the first treatment sections i e sf t and df1 to further characterize the removal mechanism desorption experiments were performed by submerging drained media in demineralized water eley and nicholson 1993 mn2 desorption was observed exclusively with iron rich media fig 3b and 3d suggesting that mn2 is adsorbed by iron oxides bibak 1994 while it is oxidized on manganese oxide coated particles first order oxidation rate constants were calculated for manganese oxidizing media fig 3e as manganese oxidation is known to occur mainly physicochemically and to linearly depend on mn2 concentration breda et al 2019 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 removal rate constants were similar in both systems 0 010 0 013 min 1 in sf m and sf b 0 014 0 016 min 1 in df2 consistent with the comparable total amounts of manganese oxide coating the catalyst of manganese oxidation breda et al 2019 moreover the rate constants were comparable in all sections devoid of iron oxides despite decreasing manganese concentrations along the filter height fig 2 likely this is the result of media mixing during frequent backwash events 3 2 2 ammonia oxidation is biological compartmentalized and stratified within each compartment the maximum volumetric ammonia oxidation rates along the filter heights were tested ex situ in batch experiments fig 4 a the biological nature of ammonia oxidation was validated with penicillin amended batch tests fig 4b consistent with the measured ammonium concentration profiles along the two treatments fig 2a and 2b the maximum ammonium removal rates were significantly lower in the sections where iron is present 4 5 4 7 g nh4 mmedia 3 h sf t df1 t and df1 m compared to the downstream sections where iron was depleted 15 62 g nh4 mmedia 3 h sf m sf b and throughout df2 moreover in contrast to the relatively uniform chemical manganese oxidation rate constants fig 3e the biological ammonium removal rates displayed a decreasing trend likely reflecting the decreasing substrate availability along the filter height fig 4a 3 3 taxonomic and functional analysis bridge plant operation with microbial physiology 3 3 1 metagenomic based microbial composition reflects process compartmentalization to resolve the phylum level taxonomic profile of the microbial community in the rapid sand filters we sequenced the metagenome of each section the metagenome was subsequently also used as a reference database for metaproteomics see next section the analysis yielded an average of 7 106 3 1 106 paired end reads per sample after quality filtering table s1 we used de novo assembly to process the trimmed reads resulting in 1 105 5 8 104 contigs 0 5 kb with an average n50 of 1118 215 bases notably samples from the lower sections of each filter sf m sf b and df2 b produced the shortest contigs with an average length of less than 1 kb we also predicted an average of 1 8 106 1 106 coding sequences per sample on the assembled contigs bacteria accounted for 91 2 1 9 of the total contigs in all samples while archaea accounted for 1 and the remainder remained unclassified 75 4 3 7 of the bacterial contigs were classified at phylum level fig 5 proteobacteria 45 7 12 1 and nitrospirae 18 8 10 8 dominated all sections followed by planctomycetes and acidobacteria that were present in all sections except for sf t verrucomicrobia and bacteroidetes were found in sf t and df1 and actinobacteria only in df1 importantly contigs associated with the nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae families fig s2 were more abundant in the upper parts of the filters where the actual removal of ammonium occurred in analogy contigs assigned to phyla or families known to contribute to iron oxidation were present in all compartments but were mainly present in the anthracite layer of sf where iron removal occurs overall the composition of the microbial communities reflected the observed activity compartmentalization figs 2 and 4 and this was especially evident in the dual filter system featuring a uniform community composition within each filter i e df1 and df2 despite the potential mixing effect of backwash an analogous compartmentalization was also observed between the anthracite sf t and sand layers sf m sf b in sf 3 3 2 differential protein abundance explains biological activity stratification the proteome of each section was quantified to estimate the relative contribution of known nitrogen and iron metabolizing guilds to the total biomass as well as the distribution of core nitrogen iron and manganese transforming enzymes per sample we obtained on average 176 79 individual protein groups that contained at least two unique peptides and false discover rate fdr 1 table s4 the guilds of interest were identified by taxonomically grouping all proteins at genus level and subsequently classifying the resulting genera based on their most probable energy source i e iron nitrogen or others fig 6 and table s3 based on the reported physiologies of the respective genus the relative contribution of individual proteins of interest was estimated by grouping all proteins with the same ko number and summing up all the corresponding relative abundances the protein based quantification of nitrogen metabolizing guilds revealed a clear increase in their relative abundance in the lower sections of sf and in df2 with a marked stratification in df2 fig 6 in analogy with the ex situ activities fig 4a the genes of core nitrogen metabolisms nitrification denitrification and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium dnra were present in all samples figure 7a table s2 and the abundance of the corresponding proteins was higher in the downstream sections of both systems specifically the key proteins for nitrification ammonia monooxygenase amoabc and nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab were present in all samples conversely hydroxylamine dehydrogenase hao was found at much lower abundances and only in some sections while its coding gene hao was ubiquitously present in terms of denitrification nitrite reductase nirk or nirs was the only detected protein even if most genes i e nitrate reductase narghi nitric oxide reductase norbc and nitrous oxide reductase nosz were found in the metagenome of all sections in analogy dnra genes were found in most metagenomes but none of the corresponding proteins were detected data not shown table s2 consistent with the iron concentration profiles and the coating composition along sf fig 2 putative iron oxidizers were most abundant in the first section of sf sf t fig 6 in turn surprisingly low abundance of iron oxidizers was found in df1 despite all iron being removed in this filter this observation coincides with low overall biomass abundances in df1 t and df1 m calculated as the sum of normalized spectral counts of each section divided by the sum of spectral counts of all samples combined as compared to the other filters fig s3 genes encoding for putative iron oxidizing proteins cyc2 cyc1 mtoabc based on fegenie garber et al 2020 were present in all sections yet the corresponding proteins were only found in sf and df2 fig 7 b other putative iron oxidizing genes i e foxabc foxeyz and pioabc garber et al 2020 were not detected in any sample lastly putative manganese oxidizing genes were spread across all samples with no evident correlation with filter operation but no expressed proteins were detected 4 discussion two full scale drinking water treatment plants were chosen to unravel the interaction between physicochemical and biological processes and their distribution along the height of rapid sand filters rsfs while treating groundwater with similar compositions the first plant employed a single filter with an anthracite layer on top of a quartz sand core and the second comprised a double filter configuration containing quartz sand only in situ and ex situ quantification of iron manganese and ammonium removals were combined with the characterization of the corresponding filter media coating genomic and proteomic profiling along the filter height was used to compare the metabolic potential i e genes encoding for certain proteins with the actual metabolism i e expressed proteins of the underlying microbial communities 4 1 backwash driven filter media mixing results in compartments with homogeneous coating and genetic fingerprints both sand filtration systems exhibited highly comparable operational performances and harboured microbial communities with surprisingly similar taxonomic and functional profiles iron was removed in the first sections being it the anthracite top layer in the single filter system or the first filter in the double filter configuration while ammonium and manganese removal occurred primarily in the downstream sections fig 2 spatial separation between iron and manganese removal has often been reported in rapid sand filters bourgine et al 1994 gouzinis et al 1998 and it is commonly attributed to the different ph oxidation reduction potentials required for their oxidation and precipitation pacini et al 2005 also the mineral coating composition is often used as a proxy to localize where removals occur during the lifespan of a filter gülay et al 2014 consistently we observed the process compartmentalization clearly reflected in the coating composition of the filter media of both studied systems iron and manganese oxides dominated the first and the downstream sections of each system respectively fig 2 with coating amounts comparable to other dwtps breda et al 2019 moreover both the manganese coating mass and the removal rate constants were rather constant in all sections devoid of iron fig 3 as the physicochemical oxidation of manganese is directly proportional to the available concentration of manganese breda et al 2019 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 manganese oxide coating was expected to decrease along the filter height in contrast we observed homogeneity of coating thickness within the manganese removing compartments of both filter systems which is likely the result of filter media mixing during backwash ramsay et al 2021 the observed compartmentalization of in situ removal rates and metal oxide coating types was also supported by the taxonomic classification of the shotgun metagenomics derived contigs fig 5 and by the distribution of genes encoding for proteins involved in the oxidation of iron ammonium and manganese fig 7 the relative abundance of families commonly associated to the oxidation of iron gallionellaceae gülay et al 2018 and nitrogen nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospiraceae fowler et al 2018b in rsfs were higher in the top and downstream sections of each dwtp respectively fig s1 moreover their distribution within each compartment was relatively homogeneous fig 5 suggesting that microbial growth on the available substrates in each section is slower compared to the frequency of backwash filter media mixing similar spatial separation between iron and ammonium removal bourgine et al 1994 w de vet et al 2009 sharma et al 2005 but low heterogeneity in genome based microbial community compositions have been observed along the height of different filters previously bai et al 2013 tatari et al 2017 w de vet et al 2009 ascribed this phenomenon to the accumulation of iron hydroxide flocks in the filter media and phosphate de vet et al 2012 or copper wagner et al 2016 limitation have also been shown to hinder nitrification in rsfs while the direct impact of iron oxides needs further investigation our work allows to rule out the impact of nutrient limitations in the investigated dwtps as full nitrification was not suppressed but simply spatially delayed taken together these results provide solid evidence that irrespective of treatment configuration being it a dual media single filter or single media double filter setup processes compartmentalize along filter heights the fact that anthracite and quartz sand remained clearly separated in the single filter after over one year of operation also proves the effectiveness of dual media filtration in spatially separating processes and its equivalence to two filters in series moreover the homogeneity of media coating and genome based microbial community composition within each compartment highlights the process wise relevance of backwashing filter media mixing 4 2 protein abundance profiles reflect biological activity stratification and substrate gradients in stark contrast to the clear intra compartment homogeneity in situ iron ammonium and manganese concentration profiles fig 2 and ex situ biological ammonium oxidation rates displayed a strongly stratified profile within the different filter compartments fig 4 to investigate the discrepancy between the stratified activities and the homogeneous metagenome based distribution of iron ammonia and manganese oxidizing genes fig 7 we employed shotgun metaproteomics to quantify the relative abundance of the encoded proteins along the filter heights as proxy for in situ biological activity stratification patterns in ex situ and in situ ammonia oxidation rates similar to the ones observed in sf and df have been reported in sand filters treating water with tatari et al 2013 2016 and without lee et al 2014 iron and have been attributed to the progressive decrease in ammonium concentration along the filter height w de vet rietveld et al 2009 we detected higher protein based relative abundances of putative nitrifying microorganisms in the downstream sections where most ammonia oxidation occurs and we even observed a clear stratification in df2 where all three investigated filter sections were devoid of iron fig 6 importantly the same decreasing trend could also be observed in the abundance of the core enzymes of nitrification i e ammonia monooxygenase amoabc nitrite oxidoreductase nxrab and nitrifier assigned nitrite reductase nirk used here as proxy for the actual nitrifying activity of the microbial community fig 7 in analogy the protein based relative abundance of putative iron oxidizing bacteria was the highest in the anthracite layer of sf fig 6 the only section where contigs of the gallionellaceae family the most common iron oxidizing bacteria de vet et al 2011 were found in terms of specific enzymes the only detected fe oxidizing protein with a proven function was the c type cytochrome cyc2 castelle et al 2008 a protein reported to be conserved in most neutrophilic iron oxidizers mcallister et al 2020 no other iron oxidizing protein was detected and likely due to the still limited biochemical characterization of this process only few of the known iron oxidizing genes reviewed by garber et al 2020 were found the surprisingly low relative abundance of proteins assigned to putative iron oxidizers in df1 fig 6 could in principle suggest a dominance of abiotic processes controlling iron oxidation in this filter however the overall protein recovery in df1 was significantly lower than in all other sections this could possibly be ascribed to iron oxides hindering protein extraction as seen by barco edwards 2014 yet this was not encountered in the iron removing sf t section thus the reason for the low protein yield in df1 as well as the extend of contribution of biological iron oxidation to overall iron removal deserve further investigation ultimately the absence of proteins involved in manganese oxidation despite the presence of the corresponding genes suggests an abiotic dominated process in strong agreement with the homogeneously distributed first order rate constants fig 3 in conclusion the quantification of expressed proteins allowed us to resolve the often reported dichotomy between on the one hand the intra compartment homogeneity of the mineral coating and genome based microbial community composition and on the other the marked stratification of the concentration profiles and biological activities we hypothesize that backwashing results in mixing and homogenization of the filter media and thereby exposes the attached microorganisms to a different substrate load in response microorganisms adjust their metabolic fluxes by adapting their protein pool at a faster rate than the mixing frequency conversely the actual microbial growth between mixing is minimal and does not result in detectable changes at the genome level beyond rapid sand filters these results prove the potential of metagenome guided metaproteomics as a powerful tool to understand metabolic interactions in highly dynamic ecosystems 5 conclusions in this work we compared two full scale drinking water treatment plants to resolve the interaction between the physicochemical and biological processes controlling ammonium iron and manganese removal the first plant employed a dual bed anthracite and quartz sand single filter the second two single bed quartz sand filters in series both plants treated groundwater with similar chemical composition the combination of biological activity measurements mineral coating characterization and multi omics profiling led to the following conclusions both systems exhibited comparable performances and clear process compartmentalization with iron being fully removed in the first sections and ammonium and manganese primarily in the downstream ones the mineral composition of the media coating reflected the compartmentalization of processes i e iron and manganese oxides dominated the first and downstream sections of each system respectively the homogeneity of media coating and genome based composition of the microbial communities within each compartment highlighted the process wise relevance of backwashing filter media mixing only protein abundance profiles reflected the intra compartment removal stratification strongly highlighting the potential of metaproteomic approaches for studying highly dynamic ecosystems dual media single filters and series of single media filters are equivalent from an operational and ecological perspective and anthracite and sand remain separated despite frequent backwashing ultimately the combination of in situ and ex situ physical chemical and biological

15009,clean soil is a potential capping material for controlling internal nutrient loading and helping the recovery of macrophytes in eutrophic lakes but the long term effects and underlying mechanisms of clean soil capping under in situ conditions remain poorly understood in this study a three year field capping enclosure experiment combining intact sediment core incubation in situ porewater sampling isotherm adsorption experiments and analysis of sediment nitrogen n and phosphorus p fractions was conducted to assess the long term performance of clean soil capping on internal loading in lake taihu our results indicate that clean soil has excellent p adsorption and retention capacity as an ecologically safe capping material and can effectively mitigate nh4 n and srp soluble reactive p fluxes at the sediment water interface swi and porewater srp concentration for one year after capping the mean nh4 n and srp fluxes of capping sediment were 34 86 mg m 2 h 1 and 1 58 mg m 2 h 1 compared 82 99 mg m 2 h 1 and 6 29 mg m 2 h 1 for control sediment clean soil controls internal nh4 n release through cation mainly al3 exchange mechanisms while for srp clean soil can not only react with srp due to its high al and fe content but also stimulate the migration of active ca2 to the capping layer thus precipitating as ca bound p ca p clean soil capping also contributed to the restoration of macrophytes during the growing season however the effect of controlling internal nutrient loading only lasted for one year under in situ conditions after which the sediment properties returned to pre capping conditions our results highlight that clean ca poor soil is a promising capping material and further research is needed to extend the longevity of this geoengineering technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication internal nutrient loading capping ca poor clean soil sediment water interface shallow lakes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication of lakes arising from excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p input leads to harmful algal blooms and retrogressive lake evolution bullerjahn et al 2016 the algae compete for light with submerged vegetation causing a shift from a macrophyte dominated lake to algae dominated this leads to degradation of the physical and chemical environment beyond the point where self recovery is possible with the lake becoming green turbid and foul smelling and potentially threatening drinking water sources guo 2007 scheffer and nes 2007 geo engineering solutions typically focus on controlling the input of external nutrients however even once these are reduced or stopped there can be persistent release of internal n and p loads that may continue to cause eutrophication for years or even decades spears et al 2014 watson et al 2016 research has shown that both n and p can be limiting nutrients and hence controlling both is the most effective way to limit eutrophication cotner 2017 paerl et al 2016 in situ capping of lake bed sediment is considered a cost effective technology for effectively isolating sediment nutrients and preventing or severely reducing their release gu et al 2017 lurling et al 2016 capping materials can include artificially chemically modified adsorbents such as lanthanum modified bentonite phoslock copetti et al 2016 iron modified zeolite zhan et al 2019 and hydrous aluminum oxide li et al 2017 however depending on the ph of the lake these can lead to undesired chemical releases including of toxic trivalent aluminum ions al3 at ph 6 or release of lanthanum peterson et al 1976 figueiredo et al 2022 capping materials that cause conditions to become more alkaline can lead to the conversion of nh4 n into nh3 which is toxic to biota balancing the available active ions in a chemically modified capping layer with the available nutrients that need locking up e g srp is difficult but important because excess capping material capacity will lead to potential toxicity from the al la and nh3 gibbs and hickey 2018 iron modified capping materials can be effective but they tend to form sediment fe p which is easily dissolved and released under seasonal hypoxia yang et al 2020 the use of natural clean soil as a capping material can avoid these potential toxic chemical side effects reducing both internal nutrient release and sediment resuspension with excellent ecological safety pan et al 2012a zhong et al 2022 evaluation of the efficiencies of capping materials for preventing nutrient release are generally conducted under laboratory conditions and or with short term small scale field trials both approaches are limited because natural lakes are subject to seasonal and episodic hydrodynamic and temperature fluctuations which in turn alter the sediment stability and lake biogeochemistry significantly longer term field testing is essential to thoroughly test the efficacy of capping approaches to control internal loading shallow lakes are characterized by frequent hydrodynamic disturbances that lead to resuspension and deposition of bed sediments and the deposition of nutrient rich suspended particular matter spm xu et al 2017 this presents a challenge for using capping layers to control internal release of nutrients because these caps themselves can be remobilized liu et al 2019 2016 re suspension events create fresh sediment water interfaces that can be highly reactive leading to a pulse of nutrients being released at the same time the material that is removed becomes spm mainly comprised of inorganic metal enriched particles and organic matter with large reactive surface area for binding any dissolved n and p these particles and any nutrients they have scavenged then settle out of the water column to be re deposited on top of the newly formed sediment water interface ultimately burying it again huser et al 2016 yu et al 2017 lakes that are subject to significant input of external spm will have the potential for this particulate material to remove nutrients from the water column into the bed sediment where they may later become released once buried and conditions change the long term effectiveness of sediment capping under in situ lake environments is poorly understood lin et al 2019 hence in this study a three year experimental monitoring approach was adopted with in situ control enclosures uncapped compared against enclosures where the sediment was capped with clean soil nutrient fluxes porewater nutrient profiles and nutrient fraction transformations were monitored to understand nutrient dynamics and the impact of capping the aim was to understand the impact of long term in situ capping with clean soil on nutrient release and hence to provide a reference point for this approach to the management of waterbody eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and material description the field enclosure experiment was conducted in shiba bay fig 1 in the northern part of lake taihu china lake taihu is situated on the yanqtze delta in a highly industrialized and economically developed area of eastern china the lake is relatively shallow 1 5 m impacted by the southeast monsoon and prone to annual cyanobacterial blooms severe algal deposition and water quality problems which have led to the severe accumulation of internal nutrient loading qin et al 2007 the clean soil material used for capping was collected on the shore of shiba bay at wuxi city air dried and passed through a 40 mesh 380 μm screen before being applied table 1 shows its detailed composition notably clean soil has a lower ca content than the native lake sediments 2 2 field enclosure experiment design and sampling fig 1 shows the location of the field enclosures and the sampling sites within the enclosures a 70 000 m2 treatment and a 50 000 m2 control enclosure were constructed with polyvinyl chloride pvc aiming to prevent material exchange with the external water body in the treatment enclosure several sub enclosures were established including clean sand ca poor soil chitosan modified soil capping etc for ca poor soil capping treatment pre processed clean soil for capping was sprayed into one enclosure water body and left to sink to the surface of the sediment producing a capping layer of 5 cm to 10 cm thickness fig s1 this capping layer depth was based on our previous experimental work to prevent resuspension pan et al 2012a 2019 which suggested a minimum of 1 cm and the aim to allow macrophyte growth which requires 5 10 cm for establishment and anchoring of roots the control enclosure without capping was located adjacent to the capping enclosure capping was undertaken in january 2010 in situ porewater samples were collected 450d 360d 150d and 90d prior to capping and both porewater samples and intact sediment cores were collected 60 d and 30 d pre capping as well as 30d 60d 90d 180d 270d 360d 480d 570d and 660d post capping the in situ porewater equilibration sampling devices peepers were placed through the swi by fixing to bamboo poles fig s1 and left to equilibrate for 15 d before being retrieved intact sediment cores were sampled using a gravity core sampler 90 mm diameter 60 cm length rigo co ltd japan all porewater samples and sediment cores were transported to the laboratory within 6 h for subsequent experiments incubation experiments on intact sediment cores were used to measure fluxes of nh4 n and srp at the swi under in situ temperature and do conditions details of the sediment core incubations and in situ peeper experiments are given in the supplementary material additionally triplicate sediment cores were also collected for the analysis of sediment oxygen demand sod using dissolved oxygen microprobe technology presens regensburg germany see our previous work for detailed methods zhong et al 2018 2 3 sediment sampling and analysis after the sediment incubation experiments the top 0 2 cm of the sediment cores were sliced for surface sediment properties analysis fresh sediment subsamples were used to analyze the total microbial activity of sediments according to the method described by schnürer and rosswall 1982 then three surface sediment samples were pooled and homogenized to obtain a representative sample for further analysis the fresh surface sediment was lyophilized under a vacuum and ground then passed through 0 150 mm sieves and stored at 4 c until subsequent analysis the total nitrogen tn content of surface sediment was analyzed by the alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation method chinese epa 2002 sediment dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including nh4 n no3 n and no2 n was extracted by 2 mol l kcl and analyzed by uv spectrophotometer shannon et al 2011 acid microwave digestion was used to determine al fe ca mn ni zn cu and cr by icp aes rukun 1999 sediment organic matter content was measured as loss of ignition loi and determined

al p organic p org p other inorganic p ca p and residual p res p sediment total p was calculated as the sum of above fractions further details of the extraction process are given in fig s2 in the supplementary materials 2 4 phosphate adsorption isotherm experiments phosphate adsorption isotherms were determined using the method and calculation procedures in pan et al 2002 2013 and yu et al 2017 briefly 0 5 g of the processed surface sediment was added to 40 ml of the solution and mixed in 50 ml polyethylene tube the p concentration gradient of the solutions was set to 0 0 05 0 2 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 mg l the mixture was incubated for 48 h in a constant temperature shaker at 180 rpm and 25 c after the incubation the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and filtered through a gf c membrane for analysis finally the maximal adsorption capacity qmax mg g and zero equilibrium p concentration epc0 mg l were calculated by the non linear form of the langmuir equation to characterize the p adsorption capacity of surface sediments 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s post hoc test was used to identify the significant differences in nutrient fluxes porewater nutrient concentrations and sediment properties between control and capping treatment pearson s correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between nutrient fluxes and environmental variables significant difference was set at the p 0 05 level statistical analysis was performed using spss 25 0 ibm new york usa 3 results 3 1 characteristics of clean soil and surface sediment the physicochemical characteristics of the clean soil and surface sediment are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the results show that the clean soil is characterized by lower organic matter loi tp and tn and ca content with slightly higher al and fe content than the surface sediment table 1 fig 2 this plays a role in systematic differences measured between the capping sediment and uncapped control sediment 30 days post capping where the average values of the former are 95 loi 46 tp 52 tn 31 ca 110 al and 130 fe of those of the latter furthermore lower mn ni zn cu and zr contents were measured in the clean soil indicating its suitability as an ecologically safe capping material when the ca poor soil was introduced into the waterbody the contents of tp and ca in the capping sediment increased rapidly within 60d after capping from 344 mg kg 1and 2 02 mg g 1 to 644 mg kg 1 and 5 13 mg g 1 respectively table 1 the sediment oxygen demand sod of both capping and control treatment showed significant seasonal variability within one year of capping fig s3 the highest sod rates appeared in summer 180d and capping and control treatment only showed significant differences in summer the total microbial activity of the control sediment showed significant seasonal variation fig s4 and was highest in summer 180d while the capping sediments did not show significant seasonal variation consequently a significant difference between microbial activity in the capping and control treatments was only found in summer 3 2 fraction of n and p in capping and control sediments the variation of din of the surface sediment in control and capping sediments is shown in fig 2 sediment nh4 n content decreased significantly after capping reaching 57 of control sediment values 30d post capping and then increased before further fluctuation sediment tn also decreased post capping but then increased to levels similar to the control no significant difference was observed in no3 n and no2 n between control and capping sediment the variation of different p fractions in control and capping sediments were displayed in figs 3 and s5 the dominant surface sediment p fractions were fe p al p and ca p prior to capping averaging 27 20 24 55 and 22 49 respectively the capped sediments then evolved such that al p fe p and res p became the dominant fractions averaging 31 44 21 79 and 15 70 respectively furthermore beyond 30d after capping the inert p the sum of al p ca p and res p in the capping sediment increased significantly compared with the control sediment averaging 62 60 of tp fig s5 sediment ca p content increased from 2 00 mg kg at 30d post capping to 104 29 mg kg at 660d post capping a 50 fold increase respectively fig 3 positive correlations p 0 05 were found between sediment ca p tp and ca content between fe al and res p and also between al p and nh4 n and nh4 n and tn fig s6 significant negative correlations p 0 05 were found between res p fe and ca p content and between fe al and no3 n content except for between res p and fe and fe and al content in the sediment 3 3 phosphate adsorption capacity of capping and control sediments a langmuir model was used to fit the equilibrium adsorption data of srp on the surface sediment and clean capping soil pan et al 2002 results are shown in fig 4 and detailed parameters are listed in table s1 epc0 of the capping sediments was significantly lower than that of the control sediment furthermore the qmax values for the control and capping sediment were 0 2 mg g to 0 31 mg g and 0 24 mg g to 0 35 mg g respectively and the clean soil was 0 36 mg g kp values for retention capacity of solid phase for srp were 0 03 l g to 0 54 l g and 0 43 l g to 4 27 l g for the control and capping sediment respectively and the clean soil was 6 75 l g all the above parameters show that the capping sediment was characterized by greater p adsorption and retention capacity than the control sediment except at the end of the 660 day experiment 3 4 nutrients porewater concentrations and fluxes across the swi the temporal variation of control and capping sediment porewater nutrient concentrations with sediment depth are shown in figs 5 and 6 for nh4 n the pre capping sediments show a good degree of homogeneity with similar profiles of low overlying water concentrations and then increasing concentrations with depth below the swi reaching a stable value at about 10 cm with steeper gradients during the warmer sampling periods post capping nh4 n profiles remain largely unchanged in both control and capped systems which show no significant differences for srp the pre capping profiles show similar sharp increases in concentration immediately below the swi and generally peaked at about 2 cm to 5 cm with variations reflecting temperatures of sampling periods post capping profiles show clear differences between the control sites and the capped sites capping caused burial of previous srp peaks and then a homogenization of profiles at lower levels of srp which took a long period 1 year to re establish diffusive gradients fig 7 shows nh4 n fluxes across the swi in the control sediment varied from 3 08 1 03 mg m 2 h 1 to 300 68 53 95 mg m 2 h 1 peaking at 180d post capping in summer capped sediments exhibited similar temporal patterns varying from 4 16 1 31 mg m 2 h 1 to 107 57 40 mg m 2 h 1 with a peak at 180d and second smaller peak 23 82 12 11 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d in summer all measurements showed nh4 n efflux from the sediment to the overlying water capping significantly p 0 05 reduced nh4 n efflux for one year compared to control sediments but this effect disappeared thereafter srp fluxes of control sediment fig 7 show similar temporal trends to nh4 n fluxes varying from 0 24 0 04 mg m 2 h 1 to 26 97 1 91 mg m 2 h 1 with a first peak at 180d post capping and second smaller peak 9 93 4 10 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d post capping in summer srp fluxes in the capped sediment switched from effluxes to influxes from 90d reaching a maximum influx of 4 94 2 17 mg m 2 h 1 at 180d post capping before then switching back to effluxes with a peak of 9 05 2 94 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d fluxes were therefore significantly p 0 05 different to controls for the first year but this difference disappeared during the second year notably a significant p 0 05 positive correlation was obtained between srp flux and sediment fe p content fig s6 4 discussion 4 1 clean soil capping controls nh4 n and srp fluxes at the swi in this study fig 7 shows that clean soil capping produces an average of 31 reduction of internal nh4 n fluxes from the sediment for one year simultaneously capping caused srp fluxes to switch from efflux to influx for one year after capping with the source sink transition between overlying water and sediment overall clean soil capping effectively controlled internal nh4 n and srp release for up to one year but not thereafter the diffusion of n and p from sediment to overlying water mainly depends on the concentration gradient at the swi higher nh4 n fluxes across the swi consistent with higher porewater nh4 n concentrations were measured in warm seasons fig 7 where the elevated temperature enhanced rates of microbial activity fig s4 increasing the mineralization of organic matter depleting dissolved oxygen and enhancing anaerobic conditions with sediment depth fig s3 ding et al 2018 a combination of enhanced degradation of organic matter and reduced nitrification caused increased accumulation of nh4 n leading to steeper pore water gradients and enhanced efflux beutel 2006 zhong et al 2021 reduced nh4 n effluxes in the capping sediment compared to the control were likely due to the clean soil providing additional cation exchange capacity that led to sorption of nh4 n when diffusing across the capping layer this ultimately reduced the nh4 n concentration of the overlying water leyva ramos et al 2008 pan et al 2012b zhan et al 2019 in parallel clean soil capping resulted in a reduction in porewater srp concentration and a switch from srp effluxes to influxes this result is attributed to the immobilization of srp by the clean soil prior to capping srp was being liberated at depth due to anaerobic conditions most likely through a combination of release from degrading organic matter and release from iron oxyhydroxides during microbial iron reduction tammeorg et al 2020 addition of clean soil caused a reduction in srp generation at depth and led to the sediment becoming a sink for p thus the srp concentration of the overlying water was effectively reduced pan et al 2012b pan et al 2019 this is most likely due to oxygenated soil containing abundant iron oxides and other reactive surface sites causing simultaneous retardation of anerobic microbial activity and sorption of srp hinsinger 2001 moore et al 1994 the increased srp influx during warmer sampling periods is likely due to enhanced microbial degradation during those periods producing more srp available to be locked up by the sediment iron oxides fig 7 s3 and the lack of accumulation of srp in the pore water suggests there are sufficient iron oxides in the sediment to immediately adsorb any srp produced this is further supported by the good srp sorption and retention capacity of the clean soil fig 4 table s1 the above processes explain why srp fluxes were significantly positively correlated with sediment fe p content with smaller srp influx at higher fe p content moreover porewater srp concentrations of capping sediment within 10 cm reduced to range from 0 0005 mg l 1 to 0 40 mg l 1 compared to 0 04 mg l 1 to 1 84 mg l 1 in control sediment indicating the presence of a static layer directly below the swi after the clean soil capping which has been confirmed to play a key role in controlling internal p desorption and mobilization from the sediment to overlying water across the swi wang et al 2017 temporally the internal nh4 n and srp fluxes recovered after one year of capping our results suggest a continuous process of transformation from clean soil to native sediment leading to the return of physicochemical properties towards those of the initial sediment table 1 recovered nh4 n fluxes may attributed to nh4 n being able to transfer across the capping layer unhindered as any cation capacity to absorb it was used up meanwhile a switch of srp influxes to effluxes was detected corresponding with steeper srp concentration gradient at the swi fig 6 which supported the internal srp release wen et al 2020 this was further supported by a weakening of the srp sorption and retention capacity effect of the clean soil fig 4 4 2 underlying mechanisms of clean soil capping to control porewater nh4 n and srp concentrations our results show that clean soil can effectively control porewater srp concentration but not nh4 n concentrations figs 5 and 6 porewater nh4 n concentration is significantly negatively correlated with the sediment al ion content fig s6 thus we deduced that cation exchange between the exchangeable cations in the clean soil al ion and nh4 n in porewater is an important mechanism for the adsorptive removal of nh4 n from the porewater and controls its released from the clean soil sediment caps alshameri et al 2014 lin et al 2013 2014 this is supported by the fact that the clean soil has a higher al and fe content than the sediment and that this reduces with time table 1 finally sediment nh4 n shares the same temporal variation with sediment tn and is also positively correlated with sediment al p content fig s6 this supports the hypothesis that nh4 n is adsorbed by the clean soil this process could release al3 then promoting the reaction of al3 and srp in porewater to form al p fig 8 moreover the aerobic environment caused by clean soil capping could promote sediment microbial activity particularly nitrifying bacteria thus nh4 n is decreased in short term pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however the presence of a large amount of organic n in the sediment fig 2 can quickly replenish the porewater nh4 n concentration which explains why the clean soil capping has limited impact on porewater nh4 n concentrations but can significantly reduce the nh4 n fluxes at the swi vertically the nh4 n concentration in porewater increased with depth in the sediment and reached a maximum stable value at 10 cm which is consistent with our previous study zhong et al 2018 the highly anaerobic conditions at depth are conducive to the accumulation of nh4 n roberts et al 2012 while nitrification is inhibited and denitrification was promoted thus promoting the desorption of no2 n an intermediate product of denitrification from the sediment explaining the negative correlation of sediment no2 n and porewater nh4 n zhong et al 2010a 2010b the possible explanation for the negative correlation with sediment res p content was that capping leads to an increase in ph which promotes the desorption and release of res p zhou et al 2019 fig 6 shows that clean soil capping is effective at controlling porewater srp this can be attributed to the higher fe content of the clean soil table 1 previous studies have confirmed that the ligand exchange of fe oxide hydroxide with srp to form an inner sphere p o fe link plays an important role in srp uptake ajmal et al 2018 cao et al 2016 furthermore since srp and nh4 n coexist in the porewater it is possible that the al3 can be desorbed from the clean soil via cation exchange between al3 on the clean soil and porewater nh4 n allowing it to then react with srp to form al p fig 8 therefore clean soil capping has a better srp adsorption capacity to control internal p release due in part to a combination of the high fe and al present this can be further supported by the significant positive correlation between the sediment fe and al content and sediment res p fig s6 indicating that the presence of fe and al can promote the formation of inert p which is consistent with the result that lower srp concentration was observed in the porewater zhan et al 2019 notably sediment ca content increased from 1 99 mg g to 5 32 mg g over the whole experiment table 1 and the migration of ca could accelerate the chemical precipitation of porewater srp with ca2 to form ca p thereby transforming the porewater srp to sediment inert p lin et al 2011 therefore we conclude that the control mechanism of porewater srp by clean soil capping was likely a combination of srp adsorption due to the higher fe and al content and the co precipitation of ca2 with porewater srp fig 8 clean soil capping can effectively reduce srp concentrations in porewater within one year which was also confirmed by our previous short term work pan et al 2019 however the porewater srp concentrations recovered gradually after one year post capping due to a combination of increased sediment p loading and the weakened p adsorption and retention capacity fig 4 wen et al 2020 4 3 variation of p fractions in surface sediments after capping sediment p release potential is determined by various p fractions in sediment and their relative abundance liu et al 2022 rydin 2000 the upper 2 cm of the control and capping sediment contained different p fractions fig 3 sediment total p tp is the sum of different p fractions fig 3 shows that the tp of capping sediment increased significantly and approached that in the control sediment within the first year after capping while the tp content of control sediment maintained high values throughout this is associated with the isotherm parameters determined by the langmuir equation the qmax and kp decrease from 0 36 mg g 1 to 0 32 mg g 1 and 6 75 l g 1 to 0 43 l g 1 within one year table s1 suggesting the reduced p adsorption and retention capacity of capping sediment mainly due to the reducing difference in the tp content compared to the control sediment lai and lam 2009 wen et al 2020 the variations of different p fractions in the capping sediment were significant previous studies have confirmed that mobile p the sum of nh4cl p fe p and org p is considered algal available and hence a potential internal p loading while inert p the sum of al p ca p and res p is considered a pool of permanent burial p which is hard to release rydin 2000 our results showed that clean soil capping can significantly reduce the mobile p content in the surface sediments figs 3 and s5 nh4cl p corresponds to immediately algal available p which is adsorbed to the surface of sediment particles sun et al 2009 an apparent reduction of nh4cl p in capping sediment was observed reducing from 3 97 mg kg 1 to 1 43 mg kg 1 compared to the control fig 3 suggesting that clean soil capping can effectively control labile p this apparent decrease is attributed to the introduction of clean soil characterized by excellent p adsorption capacity that removes labile p by physical adsorption to soil particulates zhou et al 2019 this phenomenon is further supported by reduced porewater srp concentration within the clean soil capping layer fe p is redox sensitive p which easily released under anaerobic conditions and transformed to potential algal available p chen et al 2015 figs 3 and s5 show a decrease of mobile p in the capping sediment mainly originated from fe p accounting for 128 7 of decreased mobile p and 92 of tp the clean soil characterized by a high fe that promotes the reaction of fe3 with srp to form fe p under aerobic conditions during the cold season and the lack of ca p together then results in the increased ratio of mobile p to tp in the early period after capping microbial activity and sod were promoted by increased temperatures figs s3 s4 leading to anaerobic conditions within the sediment during warm seasons with fe p readily released due to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 wang et al 2016 org p increased slightly early in the experiment but decreased during the warm season accompanied by dissolution of fe p in the uncapped sediment however the opposite variation was observed in capping sediment this indicates different p release mechanisms between control and capping sediment the control sediment being mainly controlled by coupled release of fe p and org p while the capping sediment is dominated by the traditional fe p release process demonstrating the shift of internal p release processes after capping liu et al 2022 sun et al 2022 notably there is a negative correlation between sediment fe and ca p content which gives the likely explanation of competitive adsorption on p by stronger reactive ca2 and fe3 promoting the shift of fe p to ca p a similar phenomenon to that reported by zhou et al 2019 our results show that inert p increased sharply within one year of capping fig 3 which is mainly attributed to the increase of ca p and al p this result indicated that capping is beneficial for the formation of inert p fractions in the sediment li et al 2019 yin et al 2021 which is further supported by the lower porewater srp concentration observed in the capping sediment fig 6 al p is often analyzed together with fe p and while al p is actually more difficult to re release than fe p our result found that sediment al p was positively correlated with sediment nh4 n implying that the released al3 is from cation exchange between sediment al3 and nh4 n in porewater thus promoting the formation of al p rönicke et al 2021 rydin 2000 furthermore the al p content reduced while the ca p content increased after 60d post capping which may be attributed to the actively competitive adsorption of p by ca2 over al3 yin et al 2021 ca p is regarded as permanently buried p and a significant positive correlation was found between sediment ca p and ca content consistent with our result that ca p accounts for 64 07 of the increased tp during the experiment in this study ca poor soil exhibited a similar excellent internal p control ability to ca modified material zhou et al 2019 the underlying mechanism is likely the formation of a ca2 concentration gradient between the ca poor capping layer and native surface sediment which promotes the migration of active ca2 to the capping layer and thus reacts with srp to form a precipitate of ca p compounds fig 8 the above mentioned shift in the release mechanism of coupled fe p and org p to fe p suggests the transformation of algae dominated status to macrophyte dominated status liu et al 2022 thus the precipitation of ca and srp by calcite crusts on the surface of submerged macrophytes might play an important role in increased sediment ca p blindow 1992 sand jensen et al 2021 furthermore the reduced sediment res p suggests the enhanced alkaline environment which would allow ca2 to become the primary srp binding reactant over fe and al and also explains the negative correlation of sediment ca p and res p content wu et al 2022 4 4 implication for the development of ca poor capping material and practical capping geoengineering in this study the large scale field experiment is close to a practical geoengineering project and hence understanding the long term performance is important for decision making in eutrophication management the experimental results indicate that clean soil capping could effectively mitigate internal n and p release from sediment simultaneously for one year fig 7 furthermore clean soil is a natural ecologically safe material that helps to change the algae dominated status of a lake to macrophyte dominated status pan et al 2012a in this study the recovery of submerged macrophytes was observed during the growing season our results indicate that ca poor soil can be used in geoengineering to control internal nutrient loading and provide a better habitat for macrophytes the dominant macrophytes observed were naturally occurring p malaianus and p crispus and their recovery was accompanied by reduced chl α concentrations fig s7 pan et al 2012b previous studies on capping materials have focused on calcium rich material such as heat modified ca rich attapulgite gan et al 2009 natural modified zeolite zhan et al 2019 illite gu et al 2019 and confirmed these have better capacity to control sediment internal p loading and promote the transformation of mobile p to inert p hinsinger 2001 therefore use of clean soil characterized by lower ca content was contrary to the widely accepted view interestingly we found that when ca poor soil is introduced into the water body the ca rich water body will automatically supplement the ca content to the capping layer thus achieving a similar effect to that of ca rich materials this finding leads us to consider the development of ca poor and environment friendly materials for geoengineering the time limited effectiveness of geoengineering in controlling internal nutrient loading continues to plague the successful application of projects we found that n and p fluxes accompanied with surface sediment physicochemical properties recovered one year post capping fig 7 table 1 when the clean soil was introduced into the water body the clean soil gradually transformed to native sediment under the in situ lake conditions for example the ca rich water body will continually supply ca to the ca poor soil thus causing changes in the p forms and ca p shifting process fig 3 in addition considering the background of persistent external inputs the external input spm has high nutrient and organic matter content could continuously deposit upon the capping layer promoting the return of the physicochemical properties of new born swi to the pre capping status wen et al 2020 furthermore surface sediment is prone to resuspension under hydrodynamic disturbance which promotes the potential for deposition of contaminated sediment from uncapped areas to those with capping moreover bioturbation will not only reorganize the sediment vertically to allow the capping material to react with deep sediment xu et al 2017 yin et al 2021 but also can accelerate the mixing of the deposited spm and capping material promoting the sedimentation process of the capping material overall we found that the change in the color of surface sediment clean soil was slow as it transformed from ca poor soil to native sediment after capping fig s8 however the change in the contents of ca and ca p in the surface sediments clean soil was rapid table 1 fig 3 this result suggested that the active migration of substances such as ca and p in the water body rather than sediment disturbance processes and external spm input dominated the recovery of sediment properties and internal loading clean soil as a natural material can effectively control internal loading of nutrients for only one year and promote macrophyte restoration for a longer period the results of our long term enclosure experiment cause us to worry about the long term effects of other functional geoengineering materials future research should focus on the long term effects of functional materials under field condition and how to use management measures to extend the long term effects of geoengineering technology 5 conclusion a three year field enclosure experiment was carried out to investigate the long term performance and underlying mechanism of clean soil capping on internal nutrient loading mitigation clean soil capping can not only reduce internal n and p fluxes and porewater srp concentration for one year but also promote the restoration of macrophytes in a eutrophic lake clean soil characterized with high al and fe content can prevent internal nh4 n release through cation exchange and also has excellent p adsorption and retention capacity furthermore ca poor clean soil has performed better in the control of internal p release via not only high cation capacity to react with srp in the short term but also via stimulating the migration of active ca2 to precipitate with srp thus promoting the burial of internal p in long term however under the in situ conditions of lake taihu the properties of capping sediment will gradually recover to the state of the native sediment ultimately resulting in weakened effectiveness after one year post capping our field enclosure experiment demonstrated that the clean ca poor soil is a promising capping material to control the internal nutrient loading and help the recovery of macrophytes and future research efforts should be exerted to extend the longevity of this

15009,clean soil is a potential capping material for controlling internal nutrient loading and helping the recovery of macrophytes in eutrophic lakes but the long term effects and underlying mechanisms of clean soil capping under in situ conditions remain poorly understood in this study a three year field capping enclosure experiment combining intact sediment core incubation in situ porewater sampling isotherm adsorption experiments and analysis of sediment nitrogen n and phosphorus p fractions was conducted to assess the long term performance of clean soil capping on internal loading in lake taihu our results indicate that clean soil has excellent p adsorption and retention capacity as an ecologically safe capping material and can effectively mitigate nh4 n and srp soluble reactive p fluxes at the sediment water interface swi and porewater srp concentration for one year after capping the mean nh4 n and srp fluxes of capping sediment were 34 86 mg m 2 h 1 and 1 58 mg m 2 h 1 compared 82 99 mg m 2 h 1 and 6 29 mg m 2 h 1 for control sediment clean soil controls internal nh4 n release through cation mainly al3 exchange mechanisms while for srp clean soil can not only react with srp due to its high al and fe content but also stimulate the migration of active ca2 to the capping layer thus precipitating as ca bound p ca p clean soil capping also contributed to the restoration of macrophytes during the growing season however the effect of controlling internal nutrient loading only lasted for one year under in situ conditions after which the sediment properties returned to pre capping conditions our results highlight that clean ca poor soil is a promising capping material and further research is needed to extend the longevity of this geoengineering technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication internal nutrient loading capping ca poor clean soil sediment water interface shallow lakes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction eutrophication of lakes arising from excessive nitrogen n and phosphorus p input leads to harmful algal blooms and retrogressive lake evolution bullerjahn et al 2016 the algae compete for light with submerged vegetation causing a shift from a macrophyte dominated lake to algae dominated this leads to degradation of the physical and chemical environment beyond the point where self recovery is possible with the lake becoming green turbid and foul smelling and potentially threatening drinking water sources guo 2007 scheffer and nes 2007 geo engineering solutions typically focus on controlling the input of external nutrients however even once these are reduced or stopped there can be persistent release of internal n and p loads that may continue to cause eutrophication for years or even decades spears et al 2014 watson et al 2016 research has shown that both n and p can be limiting nutrients and hence controlling both is the most effective way to limit eutrophication cotner 2017 paerl et al 2016 in situ capping of lake bed sediment is considered a cost effective technology for effectively isolating sediment nutrients and preventing or severely reducing their release gu et al 2017 lurling et al 2016 capping materials can include artificially chemically modified adsorbents such as lanthanum modified bentonite phoslock copetti et al 2016 iron modified zeolite zhan et al 2019 and hydrous aluminum oxide li et al 2017 however depending on the ph of the lake these can lead to undesired chemical releases including of toxic trivalent aluminum ions al3 at ph 6 or release of lanthanum peterson et al 1976 figueiredo et al 2022 capping materials that cause conditions to become more alkaline can lead to the conversion of nh4 n into nh3 which is toxic to biota balancing the available active ions in a chemically modified capping layer with the available nutrients that need locking up e g srp is difficult but important because excess capping material capacity will lead to potential toxicity from the al la and nh3 gibbs and hickey 2018 iron modified capping materials can be effective but they tend to form sediment fe p which is easily dissolved and released under seasonal hypoxia yang et al 2020 the use of natural clean soil as a capping material can avoid these potential toxic chemical side effects reducing both internal nutrient release and sediment resuspension with excellent ecological safety pan et al 2012a zhong et al 2022 evaluation of the efficiencies of capping materials for preventing nutrient release are generally conducted under laboratory conditions and or with short term small scale field trials both approaches are limited because natural lakes are subject to seasonal and episodic hydrodynamic and temperature fluctuations which in turn alter the sediment stability and lake biogeochemistry significantly longer term field testing is essential to thoroughly test the efficacy of capping approaches to control internal loading shallow lakes are characterized by frequent hydrodynamic disturbances that lead to resuspension and deposition of bed sediments and the deposition of nutrient rich suspended particular matter spm xu et al 2017 this presents a challenge for using capping layers to control internal release of nutrients because these caps themselves can be remobilized liu et al 2019 2016 re suspension events create fresh sediment water interfaces that can be highly reactive leading to a pulse of nutrients being released at the same time the material that is removed becomes spm mainly comprised of inorganic metal enriched particles and organic matter with large reactive surface area for binding any dissolved n and p these particles and any nutrients they have scavenged then settle out of the water column to be re deposited on top of the newly formed sediment water interface ultimately burying it again huser et al 2016 yu et al 2017 lakes that are subject to significant input of external spm will have the potential for this particulate material to remove nutrients from the water column into the bed sediment where they may later become released once buried and conditions change the long term effectiveness of sediment capping under in situ lake environments is poorly understood lin et al 2019 hence in this study a three year experimental monitoring approach was adopted with in situ control enclosures uncapped compared against enclosures where the sediment was capped with clean soil nutrient fluxes porewater nutrient profiles and nutrient fraction transformations were monitored to understand nutrient dynamics and the impact of capping the aim was to understand the impact of long term in situ capping with clean soil on nutrient release and hence to provide a reference point for this approach to the management of waterbody eutrophication 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and material description the field enclosure experiment was conducted in shiba bay fig 1 in the northern part of lake taihu china lake taihu is situated on the yanqtze delta in a highly industrialized and economically developed area of eastern china the lake is relatively shallow 1 5 m impacted by the southeast monsoon and prone to annual cyanobacterial blooms severe algal deposition and water quality problems which have led to the severe accumulation of internal nutrient loading qin et al 2007 the clean soil material used for capping was collected on the shore of shiba bay at wuxi city air dried and passed through a 40 mesh 380 μm screen before being applied table 1 shows its detailed composition notably clean soil has a lower ca content than the native lake sediments 2 2 field enclosure experiment design and sampling fig 1 shows the location of the field enclosures and the sampling sites within the enclosures a 70 000 m2 treatment and a 50 000 m2 control enclosure were constructed with polyvinyl chloride pvc aiming to prevent material exchange with the external water body in the treatment enclosure several sub enclosures were established including clean sand ca poor soil chitosan modified soil capping etc for ca poor soil capping treatment pre processed clean soil for capping was sprayed into one enclosure water body and left to sink to the surface of the sediment producing a capping layer of 5 cm to 10 cm thickness fig s1 this capping layer depth was based on our previous experimental work to prevent resuspension pan et al 2012a 2019 which suggested a minimum of 1 cm and the aim to allow macrophyte growth which requires 5 10 cm for establishment and anchoring of roots the control enclosure without capping was located adjacent to the capping enclosure capping was undertaken in january 2010 in situ porewater samples were collected 450d 360d 150d and 90d prior to capping and both porewater samples and intact sediment cores were collected 60 d and 30 d pre capping as well as 30d 60d 90d 180d 270d 360d 480d 570d and 660d post capping the in situ porewater equilibration sampling devices peepers were placed through the swi by fixing to bamboo poles fig s1 and left to equilibrate for 15 d before being retrieved intact sediment cores were sampled using a gravity core sampler 90 mm diameter 60 cm length rigo co ltd japan all porewater samples and sediment cores were transported to the laboratory within 6 h for subsequent experiments incubation experiments on intact sediment cores were used to measure fluxes of nh4 n and srp at the swi under in situ temperature and do conditions details of the sediment core incubations and in situ peeper experiments are given in the supplementary material additionally triplicate sediment cores were also collected for the analysis of sediment oxygen demand

experiments the top 0 2 cm of the sediment cores were sliced for surface sediment properties analysis fresh sediment subsamples were used to analyze the total microbial activity of sediments according to the method described by schnürer and rosswall 1982 then three surface sediment samples were pooled and homogenized to obtain a representative sample for further analysis the fresh surface sediment was lyophilized under a vacuum and ground then passed through 0 150 mm sieves and stored at 4 c until subsequent analysis the total nitrogen tn content of surface sediment was analyzed by the alkaline potassium persulfate oxidation method chinese epa 2002 sediment dissolved inorganic nitrogen din including nh4 n no3 n and no2 n was extracted by 2 mol l kcl and analyzed by uv spectrophotometer

supplementary materials 2 4 phosphate adsorption isotherm experiments phosphate adsorption isotherms were determined using the method and calculation procedures in pan et al 2002 2013 and yu et al 2017 briefly 0 5 g of the processed surface sediment was added to 40 ml of the solution and mixed in 50 ml polyethylene tube the p concentration gradient of the solutions was set to 0 0 05 0 2 0 5 1 2 5 and 10 mg l the mixture was incubated for 48 h in a constant temperature shaker at 180 rpm and 25 c after the incubation the supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and filtered through a gf c membrane for analysis finally the maximal adsorption capacity qmax mg g and zero equilibrium p concentration epc0 mg l were calculated by the non linear form of the langmuir equation to characterize the p adsorption capacity of surface sediments 2 5 statistical analysis one way analysis of variance anova with tukey s post hoc test was used to identify the significant differences in nutrient fluxes porewater nutrient concentrations and sediment properties between control and capping treatment pearson s correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between nutrient fluxes and environmental variables significant difference was set at the p 0 05 level statistical analysis was performed using spss 25 0 ibm new york usa 3 results 3 1 characteristics of clean soil and surface sediment the physicochemical characteristics of the clean soil and surface sediment are shown in table 1 and fig 2 the results show that the clean soil is characterized by lower organic matter loi tp and tn and ca content with slightly higher al and fe content than the surface sediment table 1 fig 2 this plays a role in systematic differences measured between the capping sediment and uncapped control sediment 30 days post capping where the average values of the former are 95 loi 46 tp 52 tn 31 ca 110 al and 130 fe of those of the latter furthermore lower mn ni zn cu and zr contents were measured in the clean soil indicating its suitability as an ecologically safe capping material when the ca poor soil was introduced into the waterbody the contents of tp and ca in the capping sediment increased rapidly within 60d after capping from 344 mg kg 1and 2 02 mg g 1 to 644 mg kg 1 and 5 13 mg g 1 respectively table 1 the sediment oxygen demand sod of both capping and control treatment showed significant seasonal variability within one year of capping fig s3 the highest sod rates appeared in summer 180d and capping and control treatment only showed significant differences in summer the total microbial activity of the control sediment showed significant seasonal variation fig s4 and was highest in summer 180d while the capping sediments did not show significant seasonal variation consequently a significant difference between microbial activity in the capping and control treatments was only found in summer 3 2 fraction of n and p in capping and control sediments the variation of din of the surface sediment in control and capping sediments is shown in fig 2 sediment nh4 n content decreased significantly after capping reaching 57 of control sediment values 30d post capping and then increased before further fluctuation sediment tn also decreased post capping but then increased to levels similar to the control no significant difference was observed in no3 n and no2 n between control and capping sediment the variation of different p fractions in control and capping sediments were displayed in figs 3 and s5 the dominant surface sediment p fractions were fe p al p and ca p prior to capping averaging 27 20 24 55 and 22 49 respectively the capped sediments then evolved such that al p fe p and res p became the dominant fractions averaging 31 44 21 79 and 15 70 respectively furthermore beyond 30d after capping the inert p the sum of al p ca p and res p in the capping sediment increased significantly compared with the control sediment averaging 62 60 of tp fig s5 sediment ca p content increased from 2 00 mg kg at 30d post capping to 104 29 mg kg at 660d post capping a 50 fold increase respectively fig 3 positive correlations p 0 05 were found between sediment ca p tp and ca content between fe al and res p and also between al p and nh4 n and nh4 n and tn fig s6 significant negative correlations p 0 05 were found between res p fe and ca p content and between fe al and no3 n content except for between res p and fe and fe and al content in the sediment 3 3 phosphate adsorption capacity of capping and control sediments a langmuir model was used to fit the equilibrium adsorption data of srp on the surface sediment and clean capping soil pan et al 2002 results are shown in fig 4 and detailed parameters are listed in table s1 epc0 of the capping sediments was significantly lower than that of the control sediment furthermore the qmax values for the control and capping sediment were 0 2 mg g to 0 31 mg g and 0 24 mg g to 0 35 mg g respectively and the clean soil was 0 36 mg g kp values for retention capacity of solid phase for srp were 0 03 l g to 0 54 l g and 0 43 l g to 4 27 l g for the control and capping sediment respectively and the clean soil was 6 75 l g all the above parameters show that the capping sediment was characterized by greater p adsorption and retention capacity than the control sediment except at the end of the 660 day experiment 3 4 nutrients porewater concentrations and fluxes across the swi the temporal variation of control and capping sediment porewater nutrient concentrations with sediment depth are shown in figs 5 and 6 for nh4 n the pre capping sediments show a good degree of homogeneity with similar profiles of low overlying water concentrations and then increasing concentrations with depth below the swi reaching a stable value at about 10 cm with steeper gradients during the warmer sampling periods post capping nh4 n profiles remain largely unchanged in both control and capped systems which show no significant differences for srp the pre capping profiles show similar sharp increases in concentration immediately below the swi and generally peaked at about 2 cm to 5 cm with variations reflecting temperatures of sampling periods post capping profiles show clear differences between the control sites and the capped sites capping caused burial of previous srp peaks and then a homogenization of profiles at lower levels of srp which took a long period 1 year to re establish diffusive gradients fig 7 shows nh4 n fluxes across the swi in the control sediment varied from 3 08 1 03 mg m 2 h 1 to 300 68 53 95 mg m 2 h 1 peaking at 180d post capping in summer capped sediments exhibited similar temporal patterns varying from 4 16 1 31 mg m 2 h 1 to 107 57 40 mg m 2 h 1 with a peak at 180d and second smaller peak 23 82 12 11 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d in summer all measurements showed nh4 n efflux from the sediment to the overlying water capping significantly p 0 05 reduced nh4 n efflux for one year compared to control sediments but this effect disappeared thereafter srp fluxes of control sediment fig 7 show similar temporal trends to nh4 n fluxes varying from 0 24 0 04 mg m 2 h 1 to 26 97 1 91 mg m 2 h 1 with a first peak at 180d post capping and second smaller peak 9 93 4 10 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d post capping in summer srp fluxes in the capped sediment switched from effluxes to influxes from 90d reaching a maximum influx of 4 94 2 17 mg m 2 h 1 at 180d post capping before then switching back to effluxes with a peak of 9 05 2 94 mg m 2 h 1 at 570d fluxes were therefore significantly p 0 05 different to controls for the first year but this difference disappeared during the second year notably a significant p 0 05 positive correlation was obtained between srp flux and sediment fe p content fig s6 4 discussion 4 1 clean soil capping controls nh4 n and srp fluxes at the swi in this study fig 7 shows that clean soil capping produces an average of 31 reduction of internal nh4 n fluxes from the sediment for one year simultaneously capping caused srp fluxes to switch from efflux to influx for one year after capping with the source sink transition between overlying water and sediment overall clean soil capping effectively controlled internal nh4 n and srp release for up to one year but not thereafter the diffusion of n and p from sediment to overlying water mainly depends on the concentration gradient at the swi higher nh4 n fluxes across the swi consistent with higher porewater nh4 n concentrations were measured in warm seasons fig 7 where the elevated temperature enhanced rates of microbial activity fig s4 increasing the mineralization of organic matter depleting dissolved oxygen and enhancing anaerobic conditions with sediment depth fig s3 ding et al 2018 a combination of enhanced degradation of organic matter and reduced nitrification caused increased accumulation of nh4 n leading to steeper pore water gradients and enhanced efflux beutel 2006 zhong et al 2021 reduced nh4 n effluxes in the capping sediment compared to the control were likely due to the clean soil providing additional cation exchange capacity that led to sorption of nh4 n when diffusing across the capping layer this ultimately reduced the nh4 n concentration of the overlying water leyva ramos et al 2008 pan et al 2012b zhan et al 2019 in parallel clean soil capping resulted in a reduction in porewater srp concentration and a switch from srp effluxes to influxes this result is attributed to the immobilization of srp by the clean soil prior to capping srp was being liberated at depth due to anaerobic conditions most likely through a combination of release from degrading organic matter and release from iron oxyhydroxides during microbial iron reduction tammeorg et al 2020 addition of clean soil caused a reduction in srp generation at depth and led to the sediment becoming a sink for p thus the srp concentration of the overlying water was effectively reduced pan et al 2012b pan et al 2019 this is most likely due to oxygenated soil containing abundant iron oxides and other reactive surface sites causing simultaneous retardation of anerobic microbial activity and sorption of srp hinsinger 2001 moore et al 1994 the increased srp influx during warmer sampling periods is likely due to enhanced microbial degradation during those periods producing more srp available to be locked up by the sediment iron oxides fig 7 s3 and the lack of accumulation of srp in the pore water suggests there are sufficient iron oxides in the sediment to immediately adsorb any srp produced this is further supported by the good srp sorption and retention capacity of the clean soil fig 4 table s1 the above processes explain why srp fluxes were significantly positively correlated with sediment fe p content with smaller srp influx at higher fe p content moreover porewater srp concentrations of capping sediment within 10 cm reduced to range from 0 0005 mg l 1 to 0 40 mg l 1 compared to 0 04 mg l 1 to 1 84 mg l 1 in control sediment indicating the presence of a static layer directly below the swi after the clean soil capping which has been confirmed to play a key role in controlling internal p desorption and mobilization from the sediment to overlying water across the swi wang et al 2017 temporally the internal nh4 n and srp fluxes recovered after one year of capping our results suggest a continuous process of transformation from clean soil to native sediment leading to the return of physicochemical properties towards those of the initial sediment table 1 recovered nh4 n fluxes may attributed to nh4 n being able to transfer across the capping layer unhindered as any cation capacity to absorb it was used up meanwhile a switch of srp influxes to effluxes was detected corresponding with steeper srp concentration gradient at the swi fig 6 which supported the internal srp release wen et al 2020 this was further supported by a weakening of the srp sorption and retention capacity effect of the clean soil fig 4 4 2 underlying mechanisms of clean soil capping to control porewater nh4 n and srp concentrations our results show that clean soil can effectively control porewater srp concentration but not nh4 n concentrations figs 5 and 6 porewater nh4 n concentration is significantly negatively correlated with the sediment al ion content fig s6 thus we deduced that cation exchange between the exchangeable cations in the clean soil al ion and nh4 n in porewater is an important mechanism for the adsorptive removal of nh4 n from the porewater and controls its released from the clean soil sediment caps alshameri et al 2014 lin et al 2013 2014 this is supported by the fact that the clean soil has a higher al and fe content than the sediment and that this reduces with time table 1 finally sediment nh4 n shares the same temporal variation with sediment tn and is also positively correlated with sediment al p content fig s6 this supports the hypothesis that nh4 n is adsorbed by the clean soil this process could release al3 then promoting the reaction of al3 and srp in porewater to form al p fig 8 moreover the aerobic environment caused by clean soil capping could promote sediment microbial activity particularly nitrifying bacteria thus nh4 n is decreased in short term pan et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 however the presence of a large amount of organic n in the sediment fig 2 can quickly replenish the porewater nh4 n concentration which explains why the clean soil capping has limited impact on porewater nh4 n concentrations but can significantly reduce the nh4 n fluxes at the swi vertically the nh4 n concentration in porewater increased with depth in the sediment and reached a maximum stable value at 10 cm which is consistent with our previous study zhong et al 2018 the highly anaerobic conditions at depth are conducive to the accumulation of nh4 n roberts et al 2012 while nitrification is inhibited and denitrification was promoted thus promoting the desorption of no2 n an intermediate product of denitrification from the sediment explaining the negative correlation of sediment no2 n and porewater nh4 n zhong et al 2010a 2010b the possible explanation for the negative correlation with sediment res p content was that capping leads to an increase in ph which promotes the desorption and release of res p zhou et al 2019 fig 6 shows that clean soil capping is effective at controlling porewater srp this can be attributed to the higher fe content of the clean soil table 1 previous studies have confirmed that the ligand exchange of fe oxide hydroxide with srp to form an inner sphere p o fe link plays an important role in srp uptake ajmal et al 2018 cao et al 2016 furthermore since srp and nh4 n coexist in the porewater it is possible that the al3 can be desorbed from the clean soil via cation exchange between al3 on the clean soil and porewater nh4 n allowing it to then react with srp to form al p fig 8 therefore clean soil capping has a better srp adsorption capacity to control internal p release due in part to a combination of the high fe and al present this can be further supported by the significant positive correlation between the sediment fe and al content and sediment res p fig s6 indicating that the presence of fe and al can promote the formation of inert p which is consistent with the result that lower srp concentration was observed in the porewater zhan et al 2019 notably sediment ca content increased from 1 99 mg g to 5 32 mg g over the whole experiment table 1 and the migration of ca could accelerate the chemical precipitation of porewater srp with ca2 to form ca p thereby transforming the porewater srp to sediment inert p lin et al 2011 therefore we conclude that the control mechanism of porewater srp by clean soil capping was likely a combination of srp adsorption due to the higher fe and al content and the co precipitation of ca2 with porewater srp fig 8 clean soil capping can effectively reduce srp concentrations in porewater within one year which was also confirmed by our previous short term work pan et al 2019 however the porewater srp concentrations recovered gradually after one year post capping due to a combination of increased sediment p loading and the weakened p adsorption and retention capacity fig 4 wen et al 2020 4 3 variation of p fractions in surface sediments after capping sediment p release potential is determined by various p fractions in sediment and their relative abundance liu et al 2022 rydin 2000 the upper 2 cm of the control and capping sediment contained different p fractions fig 3 sediment total p tp is the sum of different p fractions fig 3 shows that the tp of capping sediment increased significantly and approached that in the control sediment within the first year after capping while the tp content of control sediment maintained high values throughout this is associated with the isotherm parameters determined by the langmuir equation the qmax and kp decrease from 0 36 mg g 1 to 0 32 mg g 1 and 6 75 l g 1 to 0 43 l g 1 within one year table s1 suggesting the reduced p adsorption and retention capacity of capping sediment mainly due to the reducing difference in the tp content compared to the control sediment lai and lam 2009 wen et al 2020 the variations of different p fractions in the capping sediment were significant previous studies have confirmed that mobile p the sum of nh4cl p fe p and org p is considered algal available and hence a potential internal p loading while inert p the sum of al p ca p and res p is considered a pool of permanent burial p which is hard to release rydin 2000 our results showed that clean soil capping can significantly reduce the mobile p content in the surface sediments figs 3 and s5 nh4cl p corresponds to immediately algal available p which is adsorbed to the surface of sediment particles sun et al 2009 an apparent reduction of nh4cl p in capping sediment was observed reducing from 3 97 mg kg 1 to 1 43 mg kg 1 compared to the control fig 3 suggesting that clean soil capping can effectively control labile p this apparent decrease is attributed to the introduction of clean soil characterized by excellent p adsorption capacity that removes labile p by physical adsorption to soil particulates zhou et al 2019 this phenomenon is further supported by reduced porewater srp concentration within the clean soil capping layer fe p is redox sensitive p which easily released under anaerobic conditions and transformed to potential algal available p chen et al 2015 figs 3 and s5 show a decrease of mobile p in the capping sediment mainly originated from fe p accounting for 128 7 of decreased mobile p and 92 of tp the clean soil characterized by a high fe that promotes the reaction of fe3 with srp to form fe p under aerobic conditions during the cold season and the lack of ca p together then results in the increased ratio of mobile p to tp in the early period after capping microbial activity and sod were promoted by increased temperatures figs s3 s4 leading to anaerobic conditions within the sediment during warm seasons with fe p readily released due to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 wang et al 2016 org p increased slightly early in the experiment but decreased during the warm season accompanied by dissolution of fe p in the uncapped sediment however the opposite variation was observed in capping sediment this indicates different p release mechanisms between control and capping sediment the control sediment being mainly controlled by coupled release of fe p and org p while the capping sediment is dominated by the traditional fe p release process demonstrating the shift of internal p release processes after capping liu et al 2022 sun et al 2022 notably there is a negative correlation between sediment fe and ca p content which gives the likely explanation of competitive adsorption on p by stronger reactive ca2 and fe3 promoting the shift of fe p to ca p a similar phenomenon to that reported by zhou et al 2019 our results show that inert p increased sharply within one year of capping fig 3 which is mainly attributed to the increase of ca p and al p this result indicated that capping is beneficial for the formation of inert p fractions in the sediment li et al 2019 yin et al 2021 which is further supported by the lower porewater srp concentration observed in the capping sediment fig 6 al p is often analyzed together with fe p and while al p is actually more difficult to re release than fe p our result found that sediment al p was positively correlated with sediment nh4 n implying that the released al3 is from cation exchange between sediment al3 and nh4 n in porewater thus promoting the formation of al p rönicke et al 2021 rydin 2000 furthermore the al p content reduced while the ca p content increased after 60d post capping which may be attributed to the actively competitive adsorption of p by ca2 over al3 yin et al 2021 ca p is regarded as permanently buried p and a significant positive correlation was found between sediment ca p and ca content consistent with our result that ca p accounts for 64 07 of the increased tp during the experiment in this study ca poor soil exhibited a similar excellent internal p control ability to ca modified material zhou et al 2019 the underlying mechanism is likely the formation of a ca2 concentration gradient between the ca poor capping layer and native surface sediment which promotes the migration of active ca2 to the capping layer and thus reacts with srp to form a precipitate of ca p compounds fig 8 the above mentioned shift in the release mechanism of coupled fe p and org p to fe p suggests the transformation of algae dominated status to macrophyte dominated status liu et al 2022 thus the precipitation of ca and srp by calcite crusts on the surface of submerged macrophytes might play an important role in increased sediment ca p blindow 1992 sand jensen et al 2021 furthermore the reduced sediment res p suggests the enhanced alkaline environment which would allow ca2 to become the primary srp binding reactant over fe and al and also explains the negative correlation of sediment ca p and res p content wu et al 2022 4 4 implication for the development of ca poor capping material and practical capping geoengineering in this study the large scale field experiment is close to a practical geoengineering project and hence understanding the long term performance is important for decision making in eutrophication management the experimental results indicate that clean soil capping could effectively mitigate internal n and p release from sediment simultaneously for one year fig 7 furthermore clean soil is a natural ecologically safe material that helps to change the algae dominated status of a lake to macrophyte dominated status pan et al 2012a in this study the recovery of submerged macrophytes was observed during the growing season our results indicate that ca poor soil can be used in geoengineering to control internal nutrient loading and provide a better habitat for macrophytes the dominant macrophytes observed were naturally occurring p malaianus and p crispus and their recovery was accompanied by reduced chl α concentrations fig s7 pan et al 2012b previous studies on capping materials have focused on calcium rich material such as heat modified ca rich attapulgite gan et al 2009 natural modified zeolite zhan et al 2019 illite gu et al 2019 and confirmed these have better capacity to control sediment internal p loading and promote the transformation of mobile p to inert p hinsinger 2001 therefore use of clean soil characterized by lower ca content was contrary to the widely accepted view interestingly we found that when ca poor soil is introduced into the water body the ca rich water body will automatically supplement the ca content to the capping layer thus achieving a similar effect to that of ca rich materials this finding leads us to consider the development of ca poor and environment friendly materials for geoengineering the time limited effectiveness of geoengineering in controlling internal nutrient loading continues to plague the successful application of projects we found that n and p fluxes accompanied with surface sediment physicochemical properties recovered one year post capping fig 7 table 1 when the clean soil was introduced into the water body the clean soil gradually transformed to native sediment under the in situ lake conditions for example the ca rich water body will continually supply ca to the ca poor soil thus causing changes in the p forms and ca p shifting process fig 3 in addition considering the background of persistent external inputs the external input spm has high nutrient and organic matter content could continuously deposit upon the capping layer promoting the return of the physicochemical properties of new born swi to the pre capping status wen et al 2020 furthermore surface sediment is prone to resuspension under hydrodynamic disturbance which promotes the potential for deposition of contaminated sediment from uncapped areas to those with capping moreover bioturbation will not only reorganize the sediment vertically to allow the capping material to react with deep sediment xu et al 2017 yin et al 2021 but also can accelerate the mixing of the deposited spm and capping material promoting the sedimentation process of the capping material overall we found that the change in the color of surface sediment clean soil was slow as it transformed from ca poor soil to native sediment after capping fig s8 however the change in the contents of ca and ca p in the surface sediments clean soil was rapid table 1 fig 3 this result suggested that the active migration of substances such as ca and p in the water body rather than sediment disturbance processes and external spm input dominated the recovery of sediment properties and internal loading clean soil as a natural material can effectively control internal loading of nutrients for only one year and promote macrophyte restoration for a longer period the results of our long term enclosure experiment cause us to worry about the long term effects of other functional geoengineering materials future research should focus on the long term effects of functional materials under field condition and how to use management measures to extend the long term effects of geoengineering technology 5 conclusion a three year field enclosure experiment was carried out to investigate the long term performance and underlying mechanism of clean soil capping on internal nutrient loading mitigation clean soil capping can not only reduce internal n and p fluxes and porewater srp concentration for one year but also promote the restoration of macrophytes in a eutrophic lake clean soil characterized with high al and fe content can prevent internal nh4 n release through cation exchange and also has excellent p adsorption and retention capacity furthermore ca poor clean soil has performed better in the control of internal p release via not only high cation capacity to react with srp in the short term but also via stimulating the migration of active ca2 to precipitate with srp thus promoting the burial of internal p in long term however under the in situ conditions of lake taihu the properties of capping sediment will gradually recover to the state of the native sediment ultimately resulting in weakened effectiveness after one year post capping our field enclosure experiment demonstrated that the clean ca poor soil is a promising capping material to control the internal nutrient loading and help the recovery of macrophytes and future research efforts should be exerted to extend the longevity of this
