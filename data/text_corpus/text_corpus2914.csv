fuel cells mfcs a hybrid biochemical device have been tested as a promising technique for wastewater treatment with energy recovery by many researchers 6 8 microorganisms are the mediator to convert a large variety of biodegradable organic compounds into co2 water and energy 5 9 this facilitates microbial interaction to convert chemical energy to electrical energy and production of value added products through the metabolic activity of microorganisms 2 10 12 a general design of a two chambered mfc consists of anodic compartment where microorganisms help in oxidative conversion of the substrate simultaneous chemical reductive conversion takes place in cathodic compartment the electrons produced in anodic chamber pass through the external circuit and at the same time protons passing through a proton exchange membrane pem react with an oxidizing agent such as oxygen at the cathode surface which leads to close the circuit 13 16 37 with integration of multiple process elements and experimental conditions the setup may also have positive influence on the overall wastewater treatment efficiency the conversion efficiency of organic wastes to bio energy and economic viability depend on the sources of waste its chemical composition characteristics and concentration of the components that can be converted into bio energy 17 distillery spent wash has become a major source of environmental pollution due to the presence of high organic load dark brown color and unpleasant odor in it it also contains considerable nutrients in terms of potassium sulphur nitrogen and phosphorus as well as large amount of micronutrients like ca cu mn and zn 18 among all the conventional treatment processes anaerobic treatment is widely accepted practice and also it has been tried at pilot and full scale operations 19 prior research has been carried out on the treatment of distillery spent wash in microbial fuel cells mfcs to utilize the high organic matters as an oxidizing

an external resistance of 120 ω 21 traditional aerobic or anaerobic wastewater treatment technologies are energy consuming with emission of large amount of carbon dioxide co2 as the major gaseous end product when either glucose or acetate was used as substrate 22 as algae are recognized as excellent co2 sinkers and oxygen is generated simultaneously in their metabolic activities several

instruments samples were prepared by mixing distillery spent wash and sewage wastewater in the ratios of 100 0 75 25 50 50 and 25 75 by v v and were denoted as dsw100 sww0 dsw75 sww25 dsw50 sww50 dsw25 sww75 respectively 2 3 experimental setup an h type dual chambered microbial fuel cell fig 1 was designed and fabricated fig 2 using transparent plexiglas material of thickness 0 5 cm which consists two equal volume cylindrical chambers each with working volume of 900 ml separated by proton exchange membrane pem the height and diameter of each chamber were 15 cm and 10 cm respectively graphite rod with 17 cm length and 1 2 cm diameter were used as electrodes in both the chambers the electrodes were connected to an external resistor of 100 ω in a loop configuration and the voltage generated was monitored by multi meter mashtech india pvt ltd in this experiment pretreated nafion 117 from dupont was used as proton exchange membrane pretreatment of nafion 117 membrane was done by dipping the membrane first in a solution of h2o2 3 v v for 1 h at 80 c and then in h2so4 0 5 m for 1 h at 80 c the membrane was washed with boiling water after each solution treatment 25 pretreated autoclaved wastewater sample was fed in batch mode for 21 days in the mfc at 25 1 c anaerobic condition was maintained in anodic chamber by purging nitrogen gas was for around 15 mins the gasses produced in anodic chamber including co2 were transferred to cathodic chamber through an outlet duct the gas was utilized by microalgae in cathodic chamber bbm medium was used in the cathodic chamber for the growth of scenedesmus abundans cathodic chamber was kept under temperature controlled environment and illumination using 4 led strips with light intensity of 94 6 μmol m 2 s 1 the light and dark cycle maintained was 16 h 8 h a sample of 2 ml of sample was collected every day for test of different parameter test 2 4 electrochemical and chemical analysis open circuit voltage was monitored and recorded at regular interval of 1hr for 21 days by digital multi meter connected to 100 ω external resistances r in series power was calculated by using ohm s formula p v2 r where v and r are the voltage and resistance respectively the power was normalized to the anode surface in order to calculate power density mw a2 power density was calculated based on the electrode surface area as pd p a where a is the total surface area of the electrode in m2 the cod removal efficiency was calculated using the following equation 1 c o d r e m o v a l c i c f c i 100 where ci cf are the initial and final cod respectively 2 5 algal growth the concentration of algal biomass was collected in every day basis and was measured by uv spectrophotometer shimadzu corp japan at 680 nm for estimation of dry

biomass concentrations at t1 and t0 days respectively 4 doubling time ln 2 μ 3 result and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment 3 1 1 cod removal efficiency the cod concentration in wastewater is an important factor which limits the power generation tendency the dual chambered h type mfc was operated for 21 days in batch mode using four different dilutions of wastewater the correlation between power density calculated from voltage outputs and cod concentration over the entire incubation period was recorded as shown in fig 4 the dilution of distillery effluent with sewage wastewater 50 50 v v showed highest electricity generation than the other diluted distillery sample cod removal efficiency of four different samples varied in between 66 to 78 66 the steady incline in cod reduction percentage with increase in cell voltage over time indicates the capability of the inoculated consortia of culture to remove cod of the distillery spent wash and generate electricity the value of the voltage generated was decreased after a steady removal efficiency of cod was attained due to unavailability of organic nutrient after 17 days in case of 100 0 v v sample lowest removal efficiency of cod 66 was observed due to the presence of high organic load in the distillery wastewater as it was very difficult to sustain microbes in high cod environment however a longer lag phase of more than 10 days was observed for higher dilution of dsw was observed the efficiency of cod removal is increased 78 6 at 50 50 v v due to less complexity of organic nutrient however a little decreased of organic removed efficiency 66 was noticed in case of 25 75 v v due to non availability of nutrients mixed culture as used in the present study showed better cod removal efficiency of 78 6 as compared to single strain treatment 72 84 dairy wastewater as reported by venkata mohan 26 cod values are considered as an index for survival of living organism in wastewater 27 lesser activity of electrogenic consortia and decrease in mobility of charge transfer due to ohmic resistance under such higher concentration of feed might be the reason of reduced current generation the gradual decrease in efficiency of the mfc might have happened due to overloading of the substrate 3 1 2 pollutant removal efficiency the consumption of macronutrients and micronutrients by the microorganism to enhance its growth and hence reduction of the nutrient concentration in the wastewater supports the purpose of the advanced wastewater treatment the various physicochemical parameters as well as macro and micro nutrients were analyzed before treatment of different samples as recorded in table 1 in this study the maximum reduction percentage of tds and tss of the four samples dsw100 sww0 dsw75 sww25 dsw50 sww50 dsw25 sww75 were found 27 32 39 66 32 66 and 64 66 88 97 94 respectively as shown in fig 7 the tds and tss levels directly related to the various parameters such as ec hrt etc in the present study the maximum reductions of heavy metals like mg p cd ca cu mn pb in different sample were 60 68 58 12 77 45 62 78 95 63 and 96 29 respectively as shown in fig 9 trace metals like k na mg2 mn2 cu2 and ca2 respectively play a crucial role in bacterial growth because of their major participation in the activation of various metabolic pathways like energy consumption and storage these mechanisms of removal of heavy metals include the efflux of metal ions outside the cell accumulation and forms complex of the metal ions inside the cell and later reduce the toxic metal ions to a non toxic state among the bacterial community many research showed that bacillus genus has maximum biosorbents capacity of inorganic pollutant 3 2 production of electricity four mfcs were used in this current study were fed with distillery effluent and sewage wastewater under different concentration all the mfcs were operated with proper anaerobic condition maintained in the anodic chamber for 21 days the output data of voltage was monitored with multi meter and illustrated in fig 5 stable voltage growth was seen after 12 14 days of incubation periods which indicates the highest degradation of organic substances after this period increasing the wastewater cod concentration increased the conductivity of the solutions which might help to improve the performance of mfc 38 but extended start up period of 8 9 days might be due to the availability of higher concentration of organic matter for metabolic reaction in distillery effluent and inappropriate growth environment for biocatalyst 28 the output of 100 dsw also showed higher power density from than other previous studies the peak power density and cod removal efficiency was observed as 836 81 mw m2 and 78 66 respectively for sample dsw50 sw50 at optimum environment as shown in fig 3 the maximum voltage generation of different dilution of dsw100 sww0 dsw75 sw25 dsw50 sw50 and dsw25 sww75 were 346 2 mv 414 6 mv 745 13 mv 615 1 mv and respectively the mixture of dsw and sww were utilized as an organic substrate for bacterial biocatalyst and produces electrons e and protons h through redox reaction which facilitating power generation venkata mohan et al 26 after 10 days of incubation period the mfc yielded a relatively stable operating potential of 193 33 mv in 100 distillery effluent the generation of maximum voltage and power density of 346 2 mv and 180 42 mw m2 respectively noticed on 17th day and the output was higher than previous studies from figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that for 50 diluted distillery effluent the voltage generation and power density were increased up to 745 13 mv and 836 81 mw m2 respectively on 16th day in 25 distillery and 75 sewage treated wastewater the maximum voltage of 615 1 mv and power density of 570 23 mw m2 on 17th day were registered for distillery effluent diluted with sww the output was found higher as compared to the previous studies with distillery effluents using mfcs table 2 this decrease of power generation is due to the lower concentration of organic substances which leads the effective electron e discharge 3 3 biomass production in general growth of the microalgae depends upon the cultivation media culture condition and optimized environment in this study the culture conditions are same but in the mfcs co2 for algae growth was supplied from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber in which algae was cultured it is shown in principle that gaseous co2 generated from substrate degradation in anode chamber can be completely removed and converted into algal biomass in the cathode chamber furthermore ch4 was reported not to be the main gaseous product in mfcs scenedesmus abundans showed the maximum biomass yield of 0 74 g l and biomass productivity 0 038 g ld 1 in 50 dilution of distillery spent wash over 21 days of cultivation period as shown in fig 8 which indicates the maximum anaerobic digestion in anodic chamber with supply of co2 to cathodic chamber from fig 8 the almost same growth pattern was found in all the different concentrations of wastewater scenedesmus abundans has a lag phase of 5 days before going to the exponential phase it attained the stationary phase between 16 and 21 days of cultivation period previous studies 35 showed a promising biomass production by scenedesmus abundans 3 3 1 specific growth rate and doubling time specific growth rate and doubling time are the major parameters of algal proliferation which indicate the relationship between the adaptation and growth in a particular condition table 3 indicates that the specific growth rate 0 20 d 1 and doubling time 3 38 of algae scenedesmus abundans with the combination of sample dsw50 sww50 is consistently higher than all the other three samples with short of doubling time al shatri et al 36 reported specific growth rate of 0 104 d 1at 25 c for growth of scenedesmus dimorph on in bbm medium under constant photon flux density in the present study all the four experiments showed higher specific growth rate in comparison to the data reported by ali hussain for scenedesmus abundans thus the combination of anaerobic treated dsw50 sww50 sample as carbon dioxide source with bbm medium is the most suitable for scenedesmus abundans as used in the present work 4 conclusions in this study the efficiency of h type two chamber mfc using mixture of distillery wastewater and sewage wastewater as a substrate was systematically observed the feasibility of power generation using microalgae scenedesmus abundans was demonstrated the maximum power density of 836 mw m2 and maximum ocv of 745 13 mv in this study were found relatively higher as compared to other reports the production of co2 by the degradation of organic and inorganic compounds could be used by microalgae to promote their growth as well as oxygen generation at cathode the maximum growth of biomass 0 74 g ld 1 was noticed due to dilution of highly organic distillery wastewater with sewage wastewater and effective adaptation of both bacteria and algae in both chambers separately might be the reason of higher efficiency of mfc this study suggests that proper dilution of distillery wastewater and optimized condition for microalgae growth can be a promising way for higher power generation in mfc operation acknowledgement the first author would like to thank the ministry of human resources and development mhrd government of india for providing financial support to successfully carry out this research work

generation venkata mohan et al 26 after 10 days of incubation period the mfc yielded a relatively stable operating potential of 193 33 mv in 100 distillery effluent the generation of maximum voltage and power density of 346 2 mv and 180 42 mw m2 respectively noticed on 17th day and the output was higher than previous studies from figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that for 50 diluted distillery effluent the voltage generation and power density were increased up to 745 13 mv and 836 81 mw m2 respectively on 16th day in 25 distillery and 75 sewage treated wastewater the maximum voltage of 615 1 mv and power density of 570 23 mw m2 on 17th day were registered for distillery effluent diluted with sww the output was found higher as compared to the previous studies with distillery effluents using mfcs table 2 this decrease of power generation is due to the lower concentration of organic substances which leads the effective electron e discharge 3 3 biomass production in general growth of the microalgae depends upon the cultivation media culture condition and optimized environment in this study the culture conditions are same but in the mfcs co2 for algae growth was supplied from the anode chamber to the cathode chamber in which algae was cultured it is shown in principle that gaseous co2 generated from substrate degradation in anode chamber can be completely removed and converted into algal biomass in the cathode chamber furthermore ch4 was reported not to be the main gaseous product in mfcs scenedesmus abundans showed the maximum biomass yield of 0 74 g l and biomass productivity 0 038 g ld 1 in 50 dilution of distillery spent wash over 21 days of cultivation period as shown in fig 8 which indicates the maximum anaerobic digestion in anodic chamber with supply of co2 to cathodic chamber from fig 8 the almost same growth pattern was found in all the different concentrations of wastewater scenedesmus abundans has a lag phase of 5 days before going to the exponential phase it attained the stationary phase between 16 and 21 days of cultivation period previous studies 35 showed a promising biomass production by scenedesmus abundans 3 3 1 specific growth rate and doubling time specific growth rate and doubling time are the major parameters of algal proliferation which indicate the relationship between the adaptation and growth in a particular condition table 3 indicates that the specific growth rate 0 20 d 1 and doubling time 3 38 of algae scenedesmus abundans with the combination of sample dsw50 sww50 is consistently higher than all the other three samples with short of doubling time al shatri et al 36 reported specific growth rate of 0 104 d 1at 25 c for growth of scenedesmus dimorph on in bbm medium under constant photon flux density in the present study all the four experiments showed higher specific growth rate in comparison to the data reported by ali hussain for scenedesmus abundans thus the combination of anaerobic treated dsw50 sww50 sample as carbon dioxide source with bbm medium is the most suitable for scenedesmus abundans as used in the present work 4 conclusions in this study the efficiency of h type two chamber mfc using mixture of distillery wastewater and sewage wastewater as a substrate was systematically observed the feasibility of power generation using microalgae scenedesmus abundans was demonstrated the maximum power density of 836 mw m2 and maximum ocv of 745 13 mv in this study were found relatively higher as compared to other reports the production of co2 by the degradation of organic and inorganic compounds could be used by microalgae to promote their growth as well as oxygen generation at cathode the maximum growth of biomass 0 74 g ld 1 was noticed due to dilution of highly organic distillery wastewater with sewage wastewater and effective adaptation of both bacteria and algae in both chambers separately might be the reason of higher efficiency of mfc this study suggests that proper dilution of distillery wastewater and optimized condition for microalgae growth can be a promising way for higher power generation in mfc operation acknowledgement the first author would like to thank

14571,the paper describes the use of advanced reduction processes arps with dithionite uv to remove arsenic from water wastewater the highly reducing radicals generated by the arp react with arsenite and arsenate to produce solid phases such as elemental arsenic or arsenic sulfides that can be readily removed this study evaluated the effectiveness in removing arsenic at 5 different ph values 5 6 7 8 and 9 as well as the mechanism of resolubilization for solids moderate ph values of 6 7 and 8 were found to be the most effective for arsenic removal resolubilization occurred at all ph values because dithionite was consumed under uv irradiation a simple kinetic model was applied to describe the changes in concentrations of arsenic and dithionite with time arsenic removal kinetics was fast at the first 10 20 min for all ph values the highest rate constant was observed at ph 6 for arsenate removal 616 l mol min and at ph 7 for arsenite removal 534 l mol min keywords arsenic removal advanced reduction processes wastewater treatment uv irradiation reducing radicals 1 introduction arsenic is chosen as the target contaminant of this study because it becomes life threatening in living beings towards the end of the twentieth century scientists detected widespread poisoning in bangladesh india west bengal parts of argentina cambodia chile mainland china mexico nepal pakistan taiwan vietnam and the united states 1 3 although the median level of arsenic in us drinking water are well within the who drinking water limits 10 μg l 2 4 arsenic levels of 1000 μg l have been detected in natural waters in the united states 5 arsenic bearing waters are not only caused by industrial spills improper disposal of wastes leading to its leaching in groundwater but also from natural activities of the geothermal waters leading to its mobilization from rocks effectiveness of treatment methods in removing arsenic depends on many factors associated with the treatment process and the water being treated the most important physical and chemical characteristics of the water that determine the optimal treatment process are ph acidic waters are easier to treat concentration of arsenic present the concentration required to be achieved by treatment flow of water to be treated and presence of interfering co ions commonly used technologies for the removal of arsenate include sorption co precipitation with iron oxides and iron hydroxides ion exchange and filtration however co precipitation generates sludge that is difficult to dewater 6 limitations of present arsenic removal methods are summarized in table 1 and call for development of new treatment methods apart from these conventional ways of treating arsenic in wastewater many novel ways of treating arsenic are being investigated this paper focuses on advanced reduction processes arps as a new method for removing arsenic from wastewater arps are a group of recently explored treatment processes for oxidized contaminants in wastewater the basic principal of these processes is to produce highly reactive reducing radicals in situ which react with the target compound to make stable products the reducing free radicals are produced by providing the necessary activation energy to solutions of appropriate reagents research studies have shown arps to be capable of removing both organics such as 1 2 dichloroethane and vinyl chloride 13 16 and inorganics such as bromate nitrate perchlorate arsenic and selenium 17 21 the most commonly used reagents to produce the reducing radicals are sulfite sulfide dithionite and ferrous iron 13 21 our previous screening experiments studied arsenic removal by several different arps including sulfite uv ferrous iron uv and dithionite uv dithionite was identified as the most effective reagent for removal of arsenic based on faster kinetics and higher arsenic removal 21 therefore this study we further evaluated the kinetics of arsenic removal with dithionite uv arp and mechanism of arsenic resolubilization dithionite is a reducing reagent that has been used in arps it has a long and hence a weak ss bond that breaks to form two sulfur dioxide radical anions so2 as shown in eq 1 22 1 s2o4 2 2 so2 since this reaction has a low equilibrium constant of 1 4 10 9 m the sulfur dioxide radical exists at very low concentrations in aqueous dithionite solutions the absorption peak of dithionite is at 315 nm 23 so irradiating the dithionite solution near this wavelength would be expected to produce the sulfur dioxide radical anions by breaking the weak ss bond however the rate constant reported for the non photolytic reaction that produces the radicals was estimated to be more than 50 times higher than the first order rate constant for the photolytic reaction in this study this calculation used rate constant of 2 5 s 1 for the non photolytic reaction 24 and the conditions used in the experiments reported in this study dithionite concentration 2e 4 mol l molar absorptivity base e 8760 l mol cm irradiance 1 mw cm2 previous studies have reported existence of the dithionite radical anion s2o4 in non aqueous solvents 25 27 therefore an alternative hypothesis for dithionite photolysis is that it generates s2o4 and aqueous electron eaq eq 2 aqueous electron is a reducing species that may be effective in reducing arsenic 2 s2o4 2 hυ s2o4 eaq the objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of ph on the kinetics and to discuss possible reaction mechanisms a kinetic model is derived to aid investigation of the effect of ph on the rate of arsenic removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all reagents were used as received arsenic iii standard solution 1000 mg l 2 mg l arsenic trioxide in 2 w w hno3 arsenic v

experimental procedure all experiments were conducted in an anaerobic chamber coy laboratory products inc grass lake mi usa where oxygen would not interfere with the reduction process the chamber was filled with a gas mixture of 95 nitrogen and 5 hydrogen praxair distribution inc byran tx usa and regularly refilled it was equipped with an analyzer for oxygen and hydrogen fan box and a palladium catalyst stak pak coy laboratory products inc grass lake mi usa that scavenges oxygen the deionized water milli q millipore used in all experiment was deoxygenated by sparging with ultra high purity nitrogen for 2 h outside the chamber and then for 24 h inside the chamber uv light was provided by phillips model tuv pl l36w 4p low pressure mercury bulb uv l which emitted short wave uv radiation with a peak at 253 7 nm all uv irradiation experiments were carried out in 17 ml cylindrical uv transparent quartz reactors starna cells inc atascadero ca usa to study the kinetics of the reaction it is important to reduce the rate of the reaction compared to that observed in preliminary experiments so that sampling times could be set at reasonable intervals this was accomplished by using lower initial concentrations of the reagent and lower incident uv irradiance relative to values used in screening experiments 21 experiments were performed at ph 5 6 7 8 and 9 using a 10 mm phosphate buffer with initial concentrations of dithionite and arsenic of 0 2 mm and 5 μm respectively the intensity of uv light was 1 mw cm2 for all kinetic experiments sampling times were increased with samples from multiple reactors being taken at 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 20 25 30 40 60 90 and 120 min a separate reactor was sacrificed to provide a sample at each sampling time time zero corresponds to when all reactors were first exposed to uv in the presence of dithionite the resolubilization experiments used 5 μm as v 0 5 mm dithionite 5 mm sulfite and a 10 mm phosphate buffer 9 5 mm kh2po4 and 90 5 mm k2hpo4 diluted 1 10 at ph 8 the intensity of uv light was 6 mw cm2 for all resolubilization experiments an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms was used for analysis of total soluble arsenic nexion 300d perkinelmer waltham ma usa before analysis the samples were passed through a 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filter 25 mm diameter whatman piscataway nj usa and then were diluted in 1 v v hno3 analysis of dithionite in the filtered sample was conducted using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer as rapidly as possible after sampling using precautions to avoid contact with air a part of the final filtered sample was immediately transferred to airtight quartz cuvettes within the anaerobic chamber and its absorbance measured at 316 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa 2 3 kinetic model a kinetic model for the reactor system was developed with the assumptions that 1 only dithionite absorbs light and so it is the only compound being photolyzed 2 the reactor is completely mixed 3 photolysis is the only reaction in the system involving dithionite 4 light flows in only one direction 5 the reactor has a constant depth 6 the rate of removal of arsenic from solution is proportional to the product of the concentrations of arsenic and dithionite the real reaction scheme for removal of soluble arsenic is much more complex than indicated by a simple second order kinetic model and the proposed model is not intended to be mechanistic 2 3 1 modelling dithionite concentration a model for the concentration of dithionite was developed as a function of time in a batch completely mixed reactor the model assumes that the rate of loss of dithionite at any point in the reactor is proportional to the product of a quantum yield φ mol einstein the molar extinction coefficient at wavelength λ ε base e l mol cm the molar concentration of dithionite c mol l at specified time t sec and the photon flux at wavelength λ i einstein m2 s as shown in eq 3 3 r l o s s φ ε i c the reactor was assumed to be well mixed so the concentration of dithionite is the same throughout the reactor however the photon flux decreases through the reactor as it is absorbed by dithionite therefore an average rate for the reactor rloss mol l sec eq 5 is calculated using eq 4 that contains an average photon flux at wavelength λ iavg einstein m2 sec the average photon flux is calculated by integrating the photon flux across the reactor the reactor depth l cm is the path length that light travels through the reactor 4 i a v g i 0 ε c l 1 e x p ε c l 5 r l o s s φ i 0 l 1 e x p ε c l where i0 is the photon flux at wavelength λ entering the solution this average rate of dithionite loss is applied in a material balance equation for a batch system with the assumption that photolysis was the only reaction that would affect dithionite as shown in eq 6 6 d c d t φ i 0 l 1 e x p ε c l the material balance can be solved by integration to obtain a relationship for the concentration of dithionite as a function of irradiation time as shown in eq 7 7 c l n e x p φ i 0 ε t e x p ε c 0 l 1 e x p φ i 0 ε t ε l where c0 mol l is the initial concentration of dithionite and other variables as described above this model was used in a non linear regression on measured concentrations of dithionite during photolysis to obtain values of the quantum yield it can also be used with those values of quantum yield to predict dithionite concentrations as a function of time and these concentrations are used in the second order kinetic model to describe how soluble arsenic concentrations change with time 2 3 2 modeling arsenic concentration a second order rate equation eq 8 was used to describe the effects of the concentration of dithionite c mol l and arsenic a mole l on the rate of loss of arsenic from solution by the dithionite uv l arp this simple is intended as an aid in quantifying removal kinetics and is not intended to be mechanistic in fact we hypothesize that dithionite does not directly react with arsenic but rather photolyzes under uv light to form products that are responsible for arsenic reduction and removal from solution 8 r l o s s k c a in the above equation k is the second order rate constant l mol min the relationship for the concentration of dithionite as a function of time eq 7 can be substituted into this rate equation and combined with a material balance equation to obtain eq 9 9 d a d t k l n e x p φ i 0 ε t e x p ε c 0 l 1 e x p φ i 0 ε t ε l a this differential equation can be solved numerically to calculate concentrations of soluble arsenic as a function of time during treatment by the dithionite uv l arp and this was done with the matlab function ode45 this solution technique was used by the matlab function nlinfit to conduct non linear regressions with measured data for soluble arsenic to obtain second order rate constants and initial concentrations of arsenic the regression used only those arsenic concentrations that occurred when dithionite was still present in the system 25 min so that eq 9 would be valid 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of kinetics 3 1 1 arsenate as v experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of ph on the kinetics of as v precipitation in solutions of dithionite irradiated with uv l and the results are shown in fig 1 fast kinetics for arsenate removal was observed during the first 20 min for all ph values as shown in fig 1a the mechanism for this removal is hypothesized to be formation of solids by the reaction of arsenate with aqueous electrons that are produced by dithionite photolysis eq 2 however resolubilization occurred around 20 30 min this behavior is supposed to due to oxidation of solid arsenic species by formation of secondary oxidizing radicals fig 1b shows a steady decrease of dithionite at about the same rate for all ph there appears to be some effect of ph on the initial concentration of dithionite the same amount of dithionite should have been added in each experiment but more dithionite could have been degraded initially in solutions with lower ph low ph is known to promote anaerobic dithionite degradation 28 however dithionite was completely consumed within 20 min regardless of the ph depletion of dithionite is the reason that arsenic removal was interrupted which led to resolubilization 3 1 2 arsenite as iii results of experiments to characterize the effect of ph on kinetics of as iii precipitation are shown in fig 2 similarly the concentration of soluble arsenic decreased with time within the first 10 20 min before dithionite depletion as shown in fig 2a again there was evidence of arsenic resolubilization and it was more pronounced than in arsenate experiments fig 2b shows a steady decrease of dithionite at about the same rate for all ph there appears to be some effect of ph on the initial concentrations of dithionite that could be caused by dithionite decomposition being favored at low ph fig 2 does not show complete arsenic removal because experimental conditions were chosen to facilitate collection of kinetic data not to demonstrate overall removal in particular the concentration of the reagent dithionite was kept low enough so that light would penetrate the reactor and support formation of reactive species and reaction with arsenic at all points adjusting reagent addition would support complete arsenic removal and optimization of that will be the focus of later application of the kinetic model that will be developed with this data 3 2 resolubilization of arsenic experiments were conducted to evaluate factors affecting the precipitation resolubilization of arsenic in the presence of dithionite under uv irradiation fig 3 shows resolubilization of as v after 5 min of uv irradiation the expected mechanism for precipitation of as v is that it reacts with aqueous electron a product of dithionite photolysis and is reduced to solid elemental arsenic or arsenic sulfides resolubilization could occur by further reduction to arsine or by oxidation of solid phase arsenic with secondary oxidizing radicals to form soluble arsenic species a set of experiments was carried out with dithionite to determine if any volatile arsenic species such as arsine were being produced samples from the arp experiments were purged with a gas mix of 95 nitrogen and 5 hydrogen inside the anaerobic chamber for about 30 min before analysis with icp ms since arsine is a dissolved gas this step should have removed it from the sample results for purged samples were compared with samples that were not purged and it was concluded that there were no volatile arsenic species present other experiments were performed to evaluate the mechanism of resolubilization by evaluating the effect of adding dithionite sulfite or thiosulfate before initiation of resolubilization fig 4 shows the results of an experiment in which dithionite was injected at 5 min as v was precipitated during the first 5 min of uv l irradiation and resolubilization occurred between 5 min and 10 min when supplemental dithionite was not added a uv scan of the 5 min sample indicated that no dithionite was present however addition of more dithionite after 5 min of irradiation resulted in further precipitation therefore resolubilization is not observed as long as dithionite is present the results also show that uv irradiation is required for resolubilization a potential mechanism for resolubilization during uv l irradiation is that a product of dithionite photolysis is photolyzed and its photolysis products react with solid phase arsenic to solubilize it although resolubilization is not observed in the presence of dithionite the resolubilization reaction may be occurring but at a rate lower than the rate of precipitation this would result in net removal of soluble arsenic when dithionite is present and a net gain in soluble arsenic when it is absent to evaluate the hypothesis that a dithionite photolysis product is responsible for resolubilization experiments were performed by introducing 5 mm of sulfite at different irradiation times and measuring the effect on arsenic precipitation resolubilization sulfite is a major product of dithionite photolysis because it is the product formed with sulfur dioxide radicals act as reductants the results are shown in fig 5 addition of sulfite not only failed to increase resolubilization of arsenic it inhibited it a uv scan showed that dithionite was depleted after 5 min another product of dithionite decomposition that could be responsible for resolubilization is thiosulfate an experiment was conducted to evaluate whether thiosulfate 1 m could dissolve elemental arsenic 10 mm during irradiation 6 mw cm2 however the results did not show an increase in soluble arsenic so thiosulfate is not responsible for the resolubilization of arsenic observed in previous experiments refer to supporting information s1 3 3 kinetic modeling the results of quantum yields and second order rate constants are shown in table 2 ph affects arsenic removal kinetics with higher rate constants observed at near neutral ph ph 6 7 and 8 arsenate removal was fastest at ph 6 for arsenite removal the removal rate increased as ph increased from 5 to 7 and decreased as ph increased to 9 however factors like resolubilization and the dominant arsenic species as iii or as v will ultimately determine the most effective ph for removal of arsenic from a waste water fig 6 shows a typical fit of model predictions line and experimental values of soluble as v concentration symbols at ph 6 as v was removed until about 30 min which is the time when dithionite concentration approached zero fig 2 the coefficient of variation for the model fit at ph 6 0 054 shows that the model adequately fits the experimental data obtained before the initiation of resolubilization at the end of the experiment at ph 9 significant resolubilization was observed for as iii and as v which cannot be explained using the current kinetic model 4 conclusion arp technology looks promising for application to arsenic bearing wastewaters because it is able to convert soluble arsenic into solid phases that can be readily removed use of arp in arsenic bearing waters will not only remove this poisonous contaminant from waters but it has the potential to convert it into solid forms that are less harmful experiments conducted by our research group have shown arsenic removal as high as 80 with uv dithionite arp and higher removals could be obtained by maintaining the concentration of dithionite the data showed that ph impacts the extent and kinetics of arsenic removal as well as the behavior of dithionite arsenic removal was most effective and maximum at the moderate ph of 6 7 and 8 while it was minimum at ph 5 and 9 the presence of dithionite is needed for precipitation of as v and its absence results in resolubilization if uv irradiation continues the absence of uv irradiation would not lead to resolubilization a potential mechanism for resolubilization during uv l irradiation is that a product of dithionite photolysis is photolyzed and its photolysis products react with solid phase arsenic to solubilize it a hypothesis for arsenic removal and resolubilization using arp is that soluble arsenic is converted to a solid form elemental or arsenic sulfide rapidly by reaction with aqueous electrons that are produced by dithionite photolysis the solid can react with secondary radicals possibly produced by photolysis of compounds formed by degradation of dithionite to form soluble arsenic species additional research is needed to identify the compounds that are responsible for resolublization of arsenic acknowledgements this work was supported by the qatar national research fund under its national priorities research program

dithionite solutions the absorption peak of dithionite is at 315 nm 23 so irradiating the dithionite solution near this wavelength would be expected to produce the sulfur dioxide radical anions by breaking the weak ss bond however the rate constant reported for the non photolytic reaction that produces the radicals was estimated to be more than 50 times higher than the first order rate constant

of dithionite was developed as a function of time in a batch completely mixed reactor the model assumes that the rate of loss of dithionite at any point in the reactor is proportional to the product of a quantum yield φ mol einstein the molar extinction coefficient at wavelength λ ε base e l mol cm the molar concentration of dithionite c mol l at specified time t sec and the photon flux at wavelength λ i einstein m2 s as shown in eq 3 3 r l o s s φ ε i c the reactor was assumed to be well mixed so the concentration of dithionite is the same throughout the reactor however the photon flux decreases through the reactor as it is absorbed by dithionite therefore an average rate for the reactor rloss mol l sec eq 5 is calculated using eq 4 that contains an average photon flux at wavelength λ iavg einstein m2 sec the average photon flux is calculated by integrating the photon flux across the reactor the reactor depth l cm is the path length that light travels through the reactor 4 i a v g i 0 ε c l 1 e x p ε c l 5 r l o s s φ i 0 l 1 e x p ε c l where i0 is the photon flux at wavelength λ entering the solution this average rate of dithionite loss is applied in a material balance equation for a batch system with the assumption that photolysis was the only reaction that would affect dithionite as shown in eq 6 6 d c d t φ i 0 l 1 e x p ε c l the material balance can be solved by integration to obtain a relationship for the concentration of dithionite as a function of irradiation time as shown in eq 7 7 c l n e x p φ i 0 ε t e x p ε c 0 l 1 e x p φ i 0 ε t ε l where c0 mol l is the initial concentration of dithionite and other variables as described above this model was used in a non linear regression on measured concentrations of dithionite during photolysis to obtain values of the quantum yield it can also be used with those values of quantum yield to predict dithionite concentrations as a function of time and these concentrations are used in the second order kinetic model to describe how soluble arsenic concentrations change with time 2 3 2 modeling arsenic concentration a second order rate equation eq 8 was used to describe the effects of the concentration of dithionite c mol l and arsenic a mole l on the rate of loss of arsenic from solution by the dithionite uv l arp this simple is intended as an aid in quantifying removal kinetics and is not intended to be mechanistic in fact we hypothesize that dithionite does not directly react with arsenic but rather photolyzes under uv light to form products that are responsible for arsenic reduction and removal from solution 8 r l o s s k c a in the above equation k is the second order rate constant l mol min the relationship for the concentration of dithionite as a function of time eq 7 can be substituted into this rate equation and combined with a material balance equation to obtain eq 9 9 d a d t k l n e x p φ i 0 ε t e x p ε c 0 l 1 e x p φ i 0 ε t ε l a this differential equation can be solved numerically to calculate concentrations of soluble arsenic as a function of time during treatment by the dithionite uv l arp and this was done with the matlab function ode45 this solution technique was used by the matlab function nlinfit to conduct non linear regressions with measured data for soluble arsenic to obtain second order rate constants and initial concentrations of arsenic the regression used only those arsenic concentrations that occurred when dithionite was still present in the system 25 min so that eq 9 would be valid 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of kinetics 3 1 1 arsenate as v experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of ph on the kinetics of as v precipitation in solutions of dithionite irradiated with uv l and the results are shown in fig 1 fast kinetics for arsenate removal was observed during the first 20 min for all ph values as shown in fig 1a the mechanism for this removal is hypothesized to be formation of solids by the reaction of arsenate with aqueous electrons that are produced by dithionite photolysis eq 2 however resolubilization occurred around 20 30 min this behavior is supposed to due to oxidation of solid arsenic species by formation of secondary oxidizing radicals fig 1b shows a steady decrease of dithionite at about the same rate for all ph there appears to be some effect of ph on the initial concentration of dithionite the same amount of dithionite should have been added in each experiment but more dithionite could have been degraded initially in solutions with lower ph low ph is known to promote anaerobic dithionite degradation 28 however dithionite was completely consumed within 20 min regardless of the ph depletion of dithionite is the reason that arsenic removal was interrupted which led to resolubilization 3 1 2 arsenite as iii results of experiments to characterize the effect of ph on kinetics of as iii precipitation are shown in fig 2 similarly the concentration of soluble arsenic decreased with time within the first 10 20 min before dithionite depletion as shown in fig 2a again there was evidence of arsenic resolubilization and it was more pronounced than in arsenate experiments fig 2b shows a steady decrease of dithionite at about the same rate for all ph there appears to be some effect of ph on the initial concentrations of dithionite that could be caused by dithionite decomposition being favored at low ph fig 2 does not show complete arsenic removal because experimental conditions were chosen to facilitate collection of kinetic data not to demonstrate overall removal in particular the concentration of the reagent dithionite was kept low enough so that light would penetrate the reactor and support formation of reactive species and reaction with arsenic at all points adjusting reagent addition would support complete arsenic removal and optimization of that will be the focus of later application of the kinetic model that will be developed with this data 3 2 resolubilization of arsenic experiments were conducted to evaluate factors affecting the precipitation resolubilization of arsenic in the presence of dithionite under uv irradiation fig 3 shows resolubilization of as v after 5 min of uv irradiation the expected mechanism for precipitation of as v is that it reacts with aqueous electron a product of dithionite photolysis and is reduced to solid elemental arsenic or arsenic sulfides resolubilization could occur by further reduction to arsine or by oxidation of solid phase arsenic with secondary oxidizing radicals to form soluble arsenic species a set of experiments was carried out with dithionite to determine if any volatile arsenic species such as arsine were being produced samples from the arp experiments were purged with a gas mix of 95 nitrogen and 5 hydrogen inside the anaerobic chamber for about 30 min before analysis with icp ms since arsine is a dissolved gas this step should have removed it from the sample results for purged samples were compared with samples that were not purged and it was concluded that there were no volatile arsenic species present other experiments were performed to evaluate the mechanism of resolubilization by evaluating the effect of adding dithionite sulfite or thiosulfate before initiation of resolubilization fig 4 shows the results of an experiment in which dithionite was injected at 5 min as v was precipitated during the first 5 min of uv l irradiation and resolubilization occurred between 5 min and 10 min when supplemental dithionite was not added a uv scan of the 5 min sample indicated that no dithionite was present however addition of more dithionite after 5 min of irradiation resulted in further precipitation therefore resolubilization is not observed as long as dithionite is present the results also show that uv irradiation is required for resolubilization a potential mechanism for resolubilization during uv l irradiation is that a product of dithionite photolysis is photolyzed and its photolysis products react with solid phase arsenic to solubilize it although resolubilization is not observed in the presence of dithionite the resolubilization reaction may be occurring but at a rate lower than the rate of precipitation this would result in net removal of soluble arsenic when dithionite is present and a net gain in soluble arsenic when it is absent to evaluate the hypothesis that a dithionite photolysis product is responsible for resolubilization experiments were performed by introducing 5 mm of sulfite at different irradiation times and measuring the effect on arsenic precipitation resolubilization sulfite is a major product of dithionite photolysis because it is the product formed with sulfur dioxide radicals act as reductants the results are shown in fig 5 addition of sulfite not only failed to increase resolubilization of arsenic it inhibited it a uv scan showed that dithionite was depleted after 5 min another product of dithionite decomposition that could be responsible for resolubilization is thiosulfate an experiment was conducted to evaluate whether thiosulfate 1 m could dissolve elemental arsenic 10 mm during irradiation 6 mw cm2 however the results did not show an increase in soluble arsenic so thiosulfate is not responsible for the resolubilization of arsenic observed in previous experiments refer to supporting information s1 3 3 kinetic modeling the results of quantum yields and second order rate constants are shown in table 2 ph affects arsenic removal kinetics with higher rate constants observed at near neutral ph ph 6 7 and 8 arsenate removal was fastest at ph 6 for arsenite removal the removal rate increased as ph increased from 5 to 7 and decreased as ph increased to 9 however factors like resolubilization and the dominant arsenic species as iii or as v will ultimately determine the most effective ph for removal of arsenic from a waste water fig 6 shows a typical fit of model predictions line and experimental values of soluble as v concentration symbols at ph 6 as v was removed until about 30 min which is the time when dithionite concentration approached zero fig 2 the coefficient of variation for the model fit at ph 6 0 054 shows that the model adequately fits the experimental data obtained before the initiation of resolubilization at the end of the experiment at ph 9 significant resolubilization was observed for as iii and as v which cannot be explained using the current kinetic model 4 conclusion arp technology looks promising for application to arsenic bearing wastewaters because it is able to convert soluble arsenic into solid phases that can be readily removed use of arp in arsenic bearing waters will not only remove this poisonous contaminant from waters but it has the potential to convert it into solid forms that are less harmful experiments conducted by our research group have shown arsenic removal as high as 80 with uv dithionite arp and higher removals could be obtained by maintaining the concentration of dithionite the data showed that ph impacts the extent and kinetics of arsenic removal as well as the behavior of dithionite arsenic removal was most effective and maximum at the moderate ph of 6 7 and 8 while it was minimum at ph 5 and 9 the presence of dithionite is needed for precipitation of as v and its absence results in resolubilization if uv irradiation continues the absence of uv irradiation would not lead to resolubilization a potential mechanism for resolubilization during uv l irradiation is that a product of dithionite photolysis is photolyzed and its photolysis products react with solid phase arsenic to solubilize it a hypothesis for arsenic removal and resolubilization using arp is that soluble arsenic is converted to a solid form elemental or arsenic sulfide rapidly by reaction with aqueous electrons that are produced by dithionite photolysis the solid can react with secondary radicals possibly produced by photolysis of compounds formed by degradation of dithionite to form soluble arsenic species additional research is needed to identify the compounds that are responsible for resolublization of arsenic acknowledgements this work was supported by the qatar national research fund under its national priorities research program

14572,many parts of the world have excess fluoride in drinking water at some locations nitrate is also in excess hence reverse osmosis ro units have been installed at several villages in india reverse osmosis is a good technique but it has the disadvantage of discarding a considerable amount of the inlet water as a reject stream this is an unsustainable way of using water two adsorbents namely a hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr and activated alumina aa were used in column experiments for water containing only f haix zr had a better capacity than aa the same trend was observed with synthetic water samples containing other ions in addition to f however for ro reject the converse was true and the capacities of aa and haix zr decreased significantly for aa the presence of a small concentration of hco 3 increased the uptake of f by 100 compared to water containing only f for haix zr the adsorption capacity decreased as the concentration of co ions increased the cost of treated water varied from 0 1 1 5 l us 0 002 0 03 l for aa and 0 2 11 5 l us 0 004 0 23 l for haix zr keywords activated alumina bicarbonate defluoridation hydrated zirconium oxide reject water reverse osmosis 1 introduction prolonged exposure to water containing fluoride f and food and air containing fluorine compounds causes a disease called fluorosis in people and animals since the first case of dental fluorosis was reported over a century ago 16 fluorosis has spread its tentacles across parts of many countries such as argentina china india mexico and tanzania approximately 220 million people are at risk of drinking water containing excess fluoride 1 water is one of the main sources for the ingestion of fluoride by people hence numerous papers have been published on defluoridation or the removal of excess f from drinking water 3 7 8 9 18 24 31 33 34 37 40 45 49 59 in this context the indian standards prescribe acceptable and permissible limits of 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively for the concentration c f of f in drinking water 10 the world health organization prescribes a limit of 1 5 mg l 58 many methods such as coagulation precipitation adsorption ion exchange nanofiltration reverse osmosis ro and solar distillation have been used for defluoridation each method has its share of problems and must be adapted to local needs pressure driven membrane processes like ro and nanofiltration have good f removal efficiencies in the presence of many other ions this has driven the installation of many ro units by state governments and ngo s in india the main drawback of the ro units is that they discard huge amounts of water as a waste or reject stream the latter contains high concentrations of f disposing the reject directly into the surface water aggravates the problem of fluoride contamination a process that can overcome this drawback is adsorption adsorption is one of the commonly used methods for selective removal of components from a mixture 42 in the context of water contaminated with fluoride this is one of the efficient processes and many kinds of adsorbents have been used adsorbents having al mg ca and zr have a good affinity for f but they lose their affinity in the presence of other ions such as phosphate sulphate bicarbonate and nitrate 32 35 54 therefore there is a need to understand the effect of the variables involved in the adsorption process this can help to a great extent in the treatment of ro reject water treatment of reject water is a challenging problem and varies based on the characteristics of the reject hence different post treatment methods have been investigated 15 25 53 39 51 19 but with respect to defluoridation of reject water there are very few articles babu et al 4 studied the defluoridation of ro reject using calcium carbonate as the adsorbent a capacity of 0 03 mg of f g of adsorbent was obtained for a residence time of 46 h and a flow rate of 20 ml min the concentration of f in the reject stream was 13 8 mg l and the concentrations of other ions were not reported the reason for the low uptake capacity of caco 3 was not examined a reverse osmosis plant has been installed at yellampalli village in bagepalli taluk in the state of karnataka india the reject which constitutes about 50 70 of the feed is sent to a pond which aggravates the problem of groundwater contamination also during the periods of drought the cattle are allowed to drink the reject water the ro reject water has concentrations of f and no 3 that are well above the permissible limits specified by the indian standards table 1 the concentration of ca 2 is also high but this is a less toxic ion indeed the world health organization does not prescribe a health based guideline value for ca 2 however the hardness due to ca 2 and mg 2 is equivalent to 1000 1300 mg l as caco 3 which would be classified as a very hard water 46 in drought prone areas water is precious and should not be wasted further the contamination of small inland water bodies by the reject water must be avoided treatment of the reject water to make it potable is a formidable problem that involves reduction of the concentrations of i f ii no 3 iii ca 2 and mg 2 and iv the anti scaling agents added to the feed water a comprehensive solution does not appear to be available in the literature and the present work represents only a partial attempt namely defluoridation as the ro permeate contains very low concentrations of most of the ions supplementary table s1 blending of the treated reject with the permeate may also be helpful as noted by one of the referees electrocoagulation can remove both f and no 3 21 22 26 41 however there will be considerable formation of sludge which has to be disposed properly in order to efficiently use the ro reject we present some details about the performance of two adsorbents namely a hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr and activated alumina aa as the composition of the field reject water changes with time it was decided to also use synthetic samples which mimic the field water the adsorbents were treated with water containing many ions rather than a single ion the latter being the usual method for determining the removal efficiency 11 36 52 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents and types of water commercially available granular activated alumina aa from oxide india catalysts pvt ltd durgapur india of oas 37 grade was used the composition and the physical properties of the aa pellets as stated by the manufacturer are given in supplementary table s2 hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr was prepared by precipitating nanoparticles inside an anionic polymer matrix made of macroporous polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene and having quaternary ammonium functional groups 37 38 the resin beads were characterized using a hitachi 4300se n scanning electron microscope the images of a sliced bead taken before and after the zirconia nanoparticles were embedded in the resin show that there was no change in the pore structure of the resin fig 1 the loading of zr in the resin was obtained by subjecting a sliced resin bead to energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and was about 110 130 mg g of the adsorbent 37 the diameters of the particles used were in the range 0 4 0 8 mm and 0 3 1 2 mm for aa and haix zr respectively the adsorbents were soaked in deionised water for 24 h before the experiments in order to remove any unwanted contaminants activated alumina was observed to change from boehmite alooh to gibbsite γ al oh 3 when it was subjected to hydration 13 it was shown that soaking aa for 24 h changed the surface morphology and this helped in a better uptake of f 47 the change in the surface morphology was distinctly observed using sem fig 2 the change in the phases was observed using x ray diffraction which is presented in the results section the xrd analysis was performed using a bruker d8 advance instrument the angular range 2θ was varied from 10 to 70 at a scan rate of 1 min 1 field and synthetic water samples were used in the experiments the field water termed as ro reject ror was collected from the drain of the ro unit in yellampalli village typical concentrations of ions in the reject water are shown in table 1 synthetic water having three different concentrations of various ions was prepared table 1 the synthetic reject water srw was chosen to mimic the field reject water for obtaining the srw naf k2so4 cacl2 mgso4 7h2o mgcl2 mg no3 2 and nahco3 were added to deionised water and stirred till all the salts dissolved as the effect of the concentrations of various ions was to be checked synthetic water mimicking drinking water but with high concentrations of fluoride and nitrate was prepared and denoted as synthetic normal water snw snw was prepared by adding naf cacl2 na2so4 mg no3 2 and nahco3 to deionised water such that the concentrations of most of the ions were below the permissible limits as specified by the indian standard 10 synthetic f water sfw was prepared by adding naf to deionised water the ph of snw and srw was adjusted to 5 5 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh therefore the concentrations of cl and na differ from the values listed in table 1 also for the synthetic samples the concentrations shown are nominal values calculated by assuming complete dissociation of the salts the measured concentrations of the relevant cations and anions are shown in the figure captions they differ slightly from the nominal values listed in table 1 all the chemicals used in the preparation of the solutions were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification deionised water having a conductivity of 0 05 μ s cm was obtained from a millipore unit 2 2 chemical analysis analysis of the samples was done using an ion chromatograph metrohm 883 basic ic plus for anions and cations the 95 confidence limits were calculated using the data for the standards and the t distribution 48 appendix a the error bars shown in the figures correspond to these limits in order to operate the chromatographic column below the maximum number of exchange sites available it was recommended to dilute the samples during the analysis the samples of ror srw and snw were diluted 5 or 10 times and samples of sfw were used without dilution as the bicarbonate concentration cannot be measured using this method it was calculated using titration 14 the concentration of total carbonate comprising co 3 2 hco 3 and co 2 aq was calculated from the ph of solution the pk values of carbonic acid and the bicarbonate concentration obtained by titration the quality of the analysis was checked using international standards like ion 915 ion 96 4 and missippi 03 the concentrations of all the ions quantified were within 5 of the certified values of these standards 2 3 column experiments column experiments were conducted using a glass column of inner diameter 18 mm the flow was controlled using a peristaltic pump raven scientific rh p120vs fig 3 the height of the adsorbent bed was 10 cm and it was sandwiched between beds of glass beads of height 5 cm each to ensure a proper distribution of the water these two beds were further placed between a pair of cotton plugs the plug at the bottom was used to support the bed and the one at the top was used as a filter to remove any dirt or precipitates entering the column these items were placed in the column after filling it with deionised water thereby ensuring a random packing of the adsorbent if water was poured into the column after filling the adsorbent it resulted in the formation of air gaps which may cause channelling and reduce the efficiency of the adsorbent the ratio of the diameter of the column to that of the particle d dp was chosen to be greater than 20 in order to reduce the chances of channelling 29 60 for all the experiments an empty bed contact time ebct v b q of 5 minutes was maintained and the temperature was the room temperature 26 30 c here v b and q are the volume of the bed and the volumetric flowrate respectively as the experiments were done to simulate the actual conditions at the field level they were stopped daily after operating for about 10 12 h and were continued the next day during the resting period the column was left filled with the working solution in these experiments the breakthrough time was assumed to be the time at which the exit concentration of f c e f exceeded 1 0 mg l which corresponds to the acceptable limit of f in drinking water when the c e f exceed this value the adsorbent was deemed to be exhausted the number of bed volumes of water treated when c f crossed 1 0 mg l was calculated by interpolation of the data bracketing 1 0 mg l the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was calculated as described in appendix b 3 results and discussion the following symbols will be used in this section c 0 f and c e f denote the inlet and exit concentrations of f respectively m is the mass of adsorbent v is the volume of water treated till breakthrough occurs and v b π d 2 4 h is the bed volume where d is the inner diameter of the column and h is the height of the bed of adsorbent the abbreviations ror sfw snw and srw will be used to denote ro reject synthetic fluoride water synthetic normal water and synthetic reject water respectively 3 1 decreased efficiency of adsorbents with ro reject water from the field samples of ro reject ror were tested for defluoridation using haix zr and aa without adjusting the ph the samples were collected at different times of the year for one sample breakthrough with respect to f was achieved after about 190 bed volumes bv when aa was used fig 4 a the adsorption capacity q f calculated using b 11 see appendix b was 0 6 0 2 mg of f g of adsorbent the uncertainty in the capacity is calculated as follows when allowance is made for the confidence limits see appendix a the breakthrough curve consists of a set of three curves one representing the mean values of c e f c 0 f and the other two the upper and lower confidence limits hence three values are obtained for the area a c under the curve of c e f c 0 f vs v v b leading via b 11 to three values of the capacity q f corresponding to breakthrough these values are used to calculate the mean q f and the standard deviation σ f the capacity is reported as q f σ f the data correspond to one experiment with a particular concentration of ions in ror but a series of experiments were conducted with ror all the breakthrough volumes and adsorption capacities were similar fig 5 the slight variations in the capacities can be attributed to the change in the inlet concentration of f c 0 f with time 1 during an experiment there were regular drops in the value of c e f fig 4a this was due to the pause in the experiment after running it for about 10 12 h and resuming it the next day as mentioned earlier a similar behaviour was observed by li and sengupta 30 for the adsorption of pentachlorophenol on a macroporous exchanger they attributed it to the diffusion of the adsorbate into the interior of the pellet during the resting period thus fresh sites would be available for adsorption when the experiment was resumed the breakthrough volume obtained with the ror was about 6 times less than that obtained with using synthetic water containing only f sfw for aa fig 4a and about 133 times less for haix zr fig 4b the drastic decrease in the adsorption of f may be mainly attributed to the presence of many ions along with f in the feed 12 and also the higher ph of the ror table 1 there was about 15 0 3 0 mg of so 4 2 g of adsorbent adsorbed onto aa along with f and there was almost no adsorption of cl and no 3 supplementary fig s1 for some values of v v b the dimensionless concentrations of no 3 and cl were 1 the reason for this behavior is not known using synthetic fluoride water sfw the adsorption capacity for aa was found to be 3 3 0 1 mg of f g until the exit concentration reached 1 0 mg l this value is about 7 times higher than the values reported by ghorai and pant 18 0 5 mg of f g the aa used in both cases was procured from the same vendor and both batches had almost the same physical and chemical properties as per the specifications given by the vendor the difference in the performance of aa may result from soaking it in deionized water which changes the surface morphology 13 47 the adsorption of f is also observed to change the surface as confirmed using sem fig 2 and fig 6 xrd analysis shows that the fresh and soaked alumina had more of hexagonal and cubic phase alumina this was confirmed by using jcpds data files 002 0921 and 002 1420 respectively when there was adsorption of f along with hexagonal and cubic phases there was an orthorhombic phase of alumina also there was a slight shift in the peaks corresponding to the orthorhombic phase compared to the peaks reported in jcpds data files 016 0435 and 046 1215 probably due to the adsorption of f fig 7 in contrast to the behaviour observed with sfw when ro reject was treated using aa with and without soaking in deionised water the adsorption capacities were similar i e 0 6 0 1 mg of f g the adsorption of so 4 2 was the same for both modes of soaking when ror was used as feed as the concentration of no 3 in the feed and the treated water is well above the desirable limit of 45 mg l supplementary fig s1 additional treatment is required before the water can be used for drinking considering ror even though the observed uptake capacity of aa for f was less than that for sfw it was about 20 times larger than the capacity obtained by babu et al 4 who used caco 3 0 03 mg f g the capacity of haix zr was also about 4 times larger than that of caco 3 3 2 performance comparison of aa and haix zr activated alumina is an economical and readily available adsorbent but it has less adsorption capacity compared to many other adsorbents also the mechanical strength of the aa pellets is so low that they tend to crumble even with a small exertion of pressure in contrast haix zr is more robust and may have a better adsorption capacity than aa 37 to test this conjecture ror was treated with haix zr and aa owing to some operational problems the same feed could not be used for both the adsorbents even though the concentration of f in the feed was lower for haix zr the adsorption capacity was 0 14 0 06 mg f g which is about 4 times lower than the capacity obtained with aa correspondingly breakthrough occurs earlier for haix zr than for aa fig 4 however the masses of the adsorbents differ in the two cases and the bed volumes of water treated per unit mass of adsorbent are 3 3 g 1 for haix zr and 7 8 g 1 for aa as the composition of ror changes with the date of sampling it was decided to use srw adjusted to ph 5 5 table 1 for the present purpose with haix zr there was removal of both f and no 3 fig 8 and supplementary fig s2 but in the case of aa there was removal of f and so 4 2 fig 8 and supplementary fig s3 a detailed discussion about the effect of different co ions is given in next section activated alumina was able to treat about 440 bed volumes bv of water compared to 370 bv with haix zr fig 8 as the bulk densities of aa and haix zr differ the adsorption capacities were 2 1 0 5 mg f g 0 11 0 03 mmol g for aa and 2 9 0 6 mg f g 0 15 0 03 mmol g for haix zr a three fold increase in the capacity was observed for both the adsorbents with a change in the feed from srw to snw the capacities for aa and haix zr were 6 2 0 1 and 8 4 0 2 mg f g 0 33 0 01 and 0 44 0 01 mmol g respectively there was also a huge increase in the number of bed volumes of water treated from 440 to 1280 and 370 to 920 bv for aa and haix zr respectively fig 8b the error bars in fig 8a are larger than those in fig 8b because the samples were diluted by a factor of 10 in the former case and a factor of 5 in the latter case for srw and snw the better uptake of f by haix zr compared to aa can be attributed to the availability of abundant positively charged surfaces of the embedded zirconia nanoparticles compared to the aa surface the speciation reactions for zirconia in haix zr 37 and aluminol groups on aa 43 are given by 1 2 and 3 4 respectively 1 z r o o h 2 h z r o o h p k 1 6 5 2 z r o o h h z r o o p k 2 7 8 3 a l o h 2 h a l o h p k 1 4 5 4 a l o h h a l o p k 2 10 4 here the symbol represents a species located on the surface of the adsorbent and k 1 k 2 k 1 and k 2 are the apparent equilibrium constants 6 for the reactions 1 2 3 and 4 respectively true equilibrium constants involve additional factors that depend on the electric potential ϕ to simplify the analysis the effect of ϕ is neglected let zrooh denote the mole fraction of zrooh using the values of the apparent equilibrium constants and assuming that the activity coefficients are unity it is found that zrooh 2 0 909 and aloh 0 91 at a ph 5 5 hence at the working ph of 5 5 the dominant species on the surface of the adsorbent are zrooh 2 for haix zr and aloh for aa thus haix zr may be expected to have a higher capacity for f than aa this conjecture is confirmed by the experiments with synthetic feed water even though aloh 2 0 091 we shall see later that most of the f is adsorbed by exchange with the aloh 2 groups the change in the uptake of f as the inlet solution was changed from sfw to snw and srw can be attributed to the presence of other ions which compete with f for the exchange sites on the surface of the adsorbent a decrease in ph can increase the positive surface sites but it also increases dissolution of alumina 17 and zirconia 37 therefore a ph of 5 5 was used haix zr has an added advantage of using nanoparticles thereby increasing the number of surface sites encapsulation of these nanoparticles inside the anion exchange resin helps in selective movement of anions to the surface sites and exclusion of cations by the donnan membrane principle 44 based on above explanation and from 2 it follows that zroo sites do not react with any cations except h whereas many of the zrooh 2 sites can react with anions thereby further consuming zrooh hence zrooh 2 is produced by the backward reactions of 1 and 2 for alo or zroo outside the resin there are other cations in addition to h hence they will not be as effective as the sites present inside the resin thus this adsorbent can be used over a range of ph values but the amount of species which can adsorb depends on the ph an optimum ph of 5 5 has been found to increase the adsorption capacity 37 3 3 effect of competing ions on the adsorption capacity of aa for srw snw and sfw the bed volumes of water treated by aa were 440 1280 and 665 respectively fig 4figs 4a and fig 88 the corresponding adsorption capacities were 0 11 0 03 0 33 0 01 and 0 17 0 01 mmol f g compared to sfw there was a 35 decrease for srw and a 100 increase for snw the reasons for the increase with snw will be discussed later in the literature adsorption of oh is reported to interfere with the adsorption of f uptake of oh should cause the ph of the exit solution to decrease whereas it increased to 6 0 8 0 for sfw fig 9 an initial decrease in the ph of the treated water may be due to the desorption of no 3 which alters the charge balance and is compensated by h production from h 2 o nitrate was released because of the use of nitric acid as a binding agent during the manufacture of aa private communication oxide india when 1 g of fresh aa was soaked in 10 ml of deionized water for 24 h the concentration of no 3 in water was 250 mg l in the exit solution the degree of change of ph was lower when the inlet concentrations of the ions were increased this is because of the ability of the ions to contribute to the overall charge balance along with h whereas for sfw h is the sole contributor the amount of oh released per unit mass of the adsorbent is given by 5 a h v b v 10 ph e a 14 10 ph i a 14 m here v v v b is the dimensionless volume of water treated v q t is the total volume of water treated q is the volumetric flow rate of water t is the time for which water is passed through the column v b is the volume of the adsorbent bed ph e a and ph i a are the average exit and inlet ph of the solution respectively and m is the mass of the adsorbent the amount of oh released was 5 56 10 4 mmol g 1 61 10 4 mmol g and 7 78 10 6 mmol g for sfw snw and srw respectively these values are 2 4 orders of magnitude less than the number of moles of f adsorbed 0 11 0 33 and 0 17 mmol g thus among the two reactions 6 and 7 the former is expected to be predominant 55 6 a l o h 2 f a l f h 2 o 7 a l o h f a l f o h the decrease in the uptake of f for srw fig 8a even with the availability of surface sites may be due to the competition of other ions for the same sites as their concentrations were increased as discussed later a contrasting increase in uptake for snw is because of the presence of hco 3 which aids in the formation of aloh 2 several studies on alumina report that ions such as cl so 4 2 and no 3 either have no effect on the uptake of f 2 5 27 31 or only a slight effect 23 28 it has been reported that phosphate and bicarbonate affect the adsorption of f 20 56 the decrease with respect to bicarbonate was attributed to the change in the ph of the solution 20 which changes the surface charge of aa also all the experiments were done in a batch mode with f and one other ion in the feed the presence of po 4 3 and related species and sio 2 3 were stated to be the biggest contributors to the decrease in the adsorption of f 2 28 however from fig 4 and fig 8 the adsorption of f decreased by about 35 when the feed was changed from sfw to srw even though po 4 3 and sio 2 were absent the variation of the hco 3 concentration with v v b was complex for snw the exit concentration fluctuated about the inlet concentration with a few data points where the concentration was much higher than the inlet concentration for srw adsorption occurred from the beginning of the experiment with a gradual change in the exit concentration reasons for the contrasting behaviour observed with snw and srw are not known during the resting period there was a similar decrease in the concentration as was observed for so 4 2 and f the overall amount of carbonate species adsorbed was 0 52 and 6 41 mmol g for snw and srw respectively there was about 70 decrease in the adsorption of f about 60 increase in the adsorption of so 4 2 and about 12 times increase in the uptake of hco 3 as the feed was changed from snw to srw the increase in the uptake of so 4 2 and hco 3 may be attributed to the higher concentrations of these ions in srw compared to snw this confirms the effect of co ions on adsorption the breakthrough curve for hco 3 was stopped when f crossed its breakthrough point in the ph range 5 2 7 2 wijnja and schulthess 57 proposed reactions 8 10 for the formation of a aloco 2 complex and a new aloh 2 site 8 a l o h c o 3 2 a l o c o 2 o h 9 a l o h h c o 3 a l o c o 2 o h h 10

complexation of all the carbonate species with the alumina surface the release of h is evident from the lower degree of change in the ph of the effluent as the concentration of hco 3 is increased fig 9 a very high uptake of total carbonate 6 41 mmol g by aa conforms to the reactions 8 11 and the use of aloh as it is the predominant surface group of al at a ph of 5 5 su and suarez 50 reported a similar 10 fold increase in the uptake of hco 3 by aa with a change in the concentration of hco 3 from 0 002 m to 0 02 m for aa at a ph of 5 5 there were comparatively less aloh 2 sites but a 100 increase in f adsorption was achieved by snw relative to sfw probably because of the formation of positive sites by the reactions 9 and 10 therefore a minimum concentration of hco 3 is required to increase the adsorption of f at high concentrations of hco 3 as in srw the hco 3 ions compete for the adsorption sites with f and reduce the uptake of f for the adsorption of f using haix zr the adsorption capacities were 0 98 0 01 0 46 0 01 and 0 15 0 03 mmol g for sfw snw and srw respectively fig 4figs 4b and fig 88 the error bars are larger for srw because of a higher dilution of the samples and a less linear calibration curve the performance of haix zr decreased in the presence of co ions except for so 4 2 and cl even after these ions attained a constant concentration adsorption of f continued fig 8 sulphate was released into the solution for 100 200 bed volumes similar to the trend observed with respect to aa where no 3 was released with respect to cl the exit concentration was constant and equal to the inlet concentration at some points c e c c 0 c w a s 1 probably because of the use of hcl for adjusting the ph of the solution in the reservoir to 5 5 the lack of adsorption of cl was also observed in the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of a sliced particle subjected to the adsorption process the eds for zr and f showed an inner dark patch which corresponds to the presence of hydrated zirconia nanoparticles and f ions at the center of the particle the absence of dark patches at the centre for cl and s confirms the observed lack of adsorption of cl and so 4 2 onto haix zr fig 10 nitrate adsorption was observed till 170 and 130 bv for snw and srw respectively supplementary fig s2 the corresponding adsorption capacity was 0 14 mmol g for both the solutions even with a change in the concentration of the ions there was a constant adsorption capacity for no 3 3 4 regeneration of the adsorbent used for treating srw and snw regeneration of the used spent adsorbent is an important aspect of adsorption as it decreases the cost of treated water and also prevents the wastage of the adsorbent it was shown by many authors that the adsorbents could be regenerated when water with only f was used 7 9 however when adsorption was performed with snw and srw which contains many ions very little f could be desorbed from the adsorbent the regeneration was performed in batch and column modes for adsorbents treated with snw and srw respectively about 0 2 and 0 5 mg of f g of adsorbent desorbed from aa and haix zr respectively when f was adsorbed from snw the release of f was faster from haix zr than from aa upon use of the regenerated adsorbent for further f uptake there was a constant uptake but the concentration of the exit stream was above the acceptable limit of 1 0 mg l with both the adsorbents this inefficiency is caused by the incomplete desorption of the adsorbed f in the first cycle when regeneration was performed in the column mode about 0 2 and 0 3 mg of f g were desorbed from aa and haix zr respectively the effluent from the column with haix zr attained a zero concentration of f in about 8 bed volumes for aa the concentration decreased very slowly after 8 bed volumes even though there was no release of f for haix zr based on the amount of f adsorbed before regeneration there was about 2 6 mg g of f still remaining on the adsorbent thus the adsorption of other ions along with f decreases the ability of the adsorbent to desorb f a more detailed analysis is required to explain the incomplete desorption 3 5 cost of the treated water till now the performance of the adsorbents was assessed based on the adsorption capacity when the cost of the adsorbent is considered it gives an idea about the feasibility of the adsorbent for public use the cost of the activated alumina adsorbent is about 200 kg us 3 0 kg which includes the shipping and manufacturing cost and that of haix zr is 600 l of the adsorbent us 9 0 l because of the high cost of haix zr even with a higher capacity for sfw the cost was 0 2 l us 0 004 l table 2 the calculations are based on the total amount of water treated with an exit concentration 1 0 mg l and do not include the operating and capital costs the cost increased drastically as the concentration of different ions increased for aa the cost of the treated water is 1 5 l us 0 03 l with any sample of water table 2 shreyas et al 47 had shown that the cost of the treated water decreases with the number of regeneration cycles up to four cycles however they used only synthetic water samples containing only f and not reject water in the present work as the regeneration was not effective this factor was not included in calculating the cost of treated water 4 conclusions reject water from a reverse osmosis unit and synthetic water samples of various compositions were treated using activated alumina and a hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with hydrated zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr the performance of haix zr was superior to aa for synthetic reject synthetic normal and synthetic fluoride water but the converse was true for ro reject with aa there was negligible adsorption of cl and no 3 but so 4 2 and hco 3 were adsorbed a moderate amount of hco 3 increased the uptake of f by aa with haix zr there was negligible adsorption of cl and so 4 2 but no 3 and hco 3 were adsorbed the presence of many co ions at high concentrations caused a drastic decrease in the adsorption capacity of f for both the adsorbents in case of haix zr the donnan membrane effect helps in better selectivity of ions by preventing the entry of cations into the resin beads with the use of a better adsorbent like haix zr the ro reject can be subjected to a slight pre treatment i e passing it through a weak acid anion exchange resin to remove the excess hco 3 instead of the reject being wasted in the present ro reject the water has high concentrations of fluoride and nitrate aa was able to remove f but not no 3 therefore additional treatment would be required before the water can be used for drinking in contrast haix zr was able to remove both f and no 3 but no 3 was removed to a lesser extent for caco 3 babu et al 4 state that the adsorption capacity was 0 03 mg f g when the inlet f concentration was 13 8 mg l in the present work the adsorption capacity of aa was 0 57 mg f g when the inlet f concentration was 5 0 mg l and the concentration of the co anions was 31 8 mm thus aa is a better adsorbent than caco 3 for treating reject water the adsorption of f increased with a hco 3 concentration of 100 mg l and decreased as the concentration increased to 1050 mg l the competitive adsorption of hco 3 on aa causes a dual effect on the adsorption of f the present experiments on the effect of multiple co anions can explain the cause for the decreased efficiency for the adsorption of f the cost of the treatment for different water samples varied from 0 1 1 5 l us 0 002 0 03 l for aa and 0 2 11 5 l us 0 004 0 23 l for haix zr acknowledgements we thank the department of science and technology for financial support mr m k ashwin

calibration curve and confidence limits the quantitative analysis of the ions in the solution was mostly done using ion chromatography in a typical chromatogram the area under the peak corresponding

calibration curve is constructed as follows considering samples having known concentrations of the ions let c i denote the concentration of f in a sample i a i the area under the chromatogram and n

sample in a 3 the term after the sign gives the confidence limits for a set of known concentrations an example of a calibration curve is shown in fig 11 a similar procedure is used for the other ions

the quantity n i n i 0 is the amount of i that accumulates in the liquid outside the pellets the void volume with a particular adsorbent was obtained by measuring the change in the volume of water when adsorbent particles were added to it in the present case the void volume of a 10 cm bed of diameter d 18 mm with aa particles corresponds to 12 5 ml similarly as the adsorbent is porous it can retain some amount of solute the void volume of the fresh pellets was measured and found to be about 3 2 ml for a mass of 25 g for an inlet concentration of f c 0 f 5 mg l the maximum amount of solute that can accumulate in the void volume within and outside the pellets is 0 078 mg the present experiments show that the lowest adsorption capacity obtained is 0 49 mg f g which is equivalent to 14 25

14572,many parts of the world have excess fluoride in drinking water at some locations nitrate is also in excess hence reverse osmosis ro units have been installed at several villages in india reverse osmosis is a good technique but it has the disadvantage of discarding a considerable amount of the inlet water as a reject stream this is an unsustainable way of using water two adsorbents namely a hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr and activated alumina aa were used in column experiments for water containing only f haix zr had a better capacity than aa the same trend was observed with synthetic water samples containing other ions in addition to f however for ro reject the converse was true and the capacities of aa and haix zr decreased significantly for aa the presence of a small concentration of hco 3 increased the uptake of f by 100 compared to water containing only f for haix zr the adsorption capacity decreased as the concentration of co ions increased the cost of treated water varied from 0 1 1 5 l us 0 002 0 03 l for aa and 0 2 11 5 l us 0 004 0 23 l for haix zr keywords activated alumina bicarbonate defluoridation hydrated zirconium oxide reject water reverse osmosis 1 introduction prolonged exposure to water containing fluoride f and food and air containing fluorine compounds causes a disease called fluorosis in people and animals since the first case of dental fluorosis was reported over a century ago 16 fluorosis has spread its tentacles across parts of many countries such as argentina china india mexico and tanzania approximately 220 million people are at risk of drinking water containing excess fluoride 1 water is one of the main sources for the ingestion of fluoride by people hence numerous papers have been published on defluoridation or the removal of excess f from drinking water 3 7 8 9 18 24 31 33 34 37 40 45 49 59 in this context the indian standards prescribe acceptable and permissible limits of 1 0 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively for the concentration c f of f in drinking water 10 the world health organization prescribes a limit of 1 5 mg l 58 many methods such as coagulation precipitation adsorption ion exchange nanofiltration reverse osmosis ro and solar distillation have been used for defluoridation each method has its share of problems and must be adapted to local needs pressure driven membrane processes like ro and nanofiltration have good f removal efficiencies in the presence of many other ions this has driven the installation of many ro units by state governments and ngo s in india the main drawback of the ro units is that they discard huge amounts of water as a waste or reject stream the latter contains high concentrations of f disposing the reject directly into the surface water aggravates the problem of fluoride contamination a process that can overcome this drawback is adsorption adsorption is one of the commonly used methods for selective removal of components from a mixture 42 in the context of water contaminated with fluoride this is one of the efficient processes and many kinds of adsorbents have been used adsorbents having al mg ca and zr have a good affinity for f but they lose their affinity in the presence of other ions such as phosphate sulphate bicarbonate and nitrate 32 35 54 therefore there is a need to understand the effect of the variables involved in the adsorption process this can help to a great extent in the treatment of ro reject water treatment of reject water is a challenging problem and varies based on the characteristics of the reject hence different post treatment methods have been investigated 15 25 53 39 51 19 but with respect to defluoridation of reject water there are very few articles babu et al 4 studied the defluoridation of ro reject using calcium carbonate as the adsorbent a capacity of 0 03 mg of f g of adsorbent was obtained for a residence time of 46 h and a flow rate of 20 ml min the concentration of f in the reject stream was 13 8 mg l and the concentrations of other ions were not reported the reason for the low uptake capacity of caco 3 was not examined a reverse osmosis plant has been installed at yellampalli village in bagepalli taluk in the state of karnataka india the reject which constitutes about 50 70 of the feed is sent to a pond which aggravates the problem of groundwater contamination also during the periods of drought the cattle are allowed to drink the reject water the ro reject water has concentrations of f and no 3 that are well above the permissible limits specified by the indian standards table 1 the concentration of ca 2 is also high but this is a less toxic ion indeed the world health organization does not prescribe a health based guideline value for ca 2 however the hardness due to ca 2 and mg 2 is equivalent to 1000 1300 mg l as caco 3 which would be classified as a very hard water 46 in drought prone areas water is precious and should not be wasted further the contamination of small inland water bodies by the reject water must be avoided treatment of the reject water to make it potable is a formidable problem that involves reduction of the concentrations of i f ii no 3 iii ca 2 and mg 2 and iv the anti scaling agents added to the feed water a comprehensive solution does not appear to be available in the literature and the present work represents only a partial attempt namely defluoridation as the ro permeate contains very low concentrations of most of the ions supplementary table s1 blending of the treated reject with the permeate may also be helpful as noted by one of the referees electrocoagulation can remove both f and no 3 21 22 26 41 however there will be considerable formation of sludge which has to be disposed properly in order to efficiently use the ro reject we present some details about the performance of two adsorbents namely a hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr and activated alumina aa as the composition of the field reject water changes with time it was decided to also use synthetic samples which mimic the field water the adsorbents were treated with water containing many ions rather than a single ion the latter being the usual method for determining the removal efficiency 11 36 52 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents and types of water commercially available granular activated alumina aa from oxide india catalysts pvt ltd durgapur india of oas 37 grade was used the composition and the physical properties of the aa pellets as stated by the manufacturer are given in supplementary table s2 hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr was prepared by precipitating nanoparticles inside an anionic polymer matrix made of macroporous polystyrene crosslinked with divinylbenzene and having quaternary ammonium functional groups 37 38 the resin beads were characterized using a hitachi 4300se n scanning electron microscope the images of a sliced bead taken before and after the zirconia nanoparticles were embedded in the resin show that there was no change in the pore structure of the resin fig 1 the loading of zr in the resin was obtained by subjecting a sliced resin bead to energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and was about 110 130 mg g of the adsorbent 37 the diameters of the particles used were in the range 0 4 0 8 mm and 0 3 1 2 mm for aa and haix zr respectively the adsorbents were soaked in deionised water for 24 h before the experiments in order to remove any unwanted contaminants activated alumina was observed to change from boehmite alooh to gibbsite γ al oh 3 when it was subjected to hydration 13 it was shown that soaking aa for 24 h changed the surface morphology and this helped in a better uptake of f 47 the change in the surface morphology was distinctly observed using sem fig 2 the change in the phases was observed using x ray diffraction which is presented in the results section the xrd analysis was performed using a bruker d8 advance instrument the angular range 2θ was varied from 10 to 70 at a scan rate of 1 min 1 field and synthetic water samples were used in the experiments the field water termed as ro reject ror was collected from the drain of the ro unit in yellampalli village typical concentrations of ions in the reject water are shown in table 1 synthetic water having three different concentrations of various ions was prepared table 1 the synthetic reject water srw was chosen to mimic the field reject water for obtaining the srw naf k2so4 cacl2 mgso4 7h2o mgcl2 mg no3 2 and nahco3 were added to deionised water and stirred till all the salts dissolved as the effect of the concentrations of various ions was to be checked synthetic water mimicking drinking water but with high concentrations of fluoride and nitrate was prepared and denoted as synthetic normal water snw snw was prepared by adding naf cacl2 na2so4 mg no3 2 and nahco3 to deionised water such that the concentrations of most of the ions were below the permissible limits as specified by the indian standard 10 synthetic f water sfw was prepared by adding naf to deionised water the ph of snw and srw was adjusted to 5 5 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh therefore the concentrations of cl and na differ from the values listed in table 1 also for the synthetic samples the concentrations shown are nominal values calculated by assuming complete dissociation of the salts the measured concentrations of the relevant cations and anions are shown in the figure captions they differ slightly from the nominal values listed in table 1 all the chemicals used in the preparation of the solutions were of analytical grade and were used without any further purification deionised water having a conductivity of 0 05 μ s cm was obtained from a millipore unit 2 2 chemical analysis analysis of the samples was done using an ion chromatograph metrohm 883 basic ic plus for anions and cations the 95 confidence limits were calculated using the data for the standards and the t distribution 48 appendix a the error bars shown in the figures correspond to these limits in order to operate the chromatographic column below the maximum number of exchange sites available it was recommended to dilute the samples during the analysis the samples of ror srw and snw were diluted 5 or 10 times and samples of sfw were used without dilution as the bicarbonate concentration cannot be measured using this method it was calculated using titration 14 the concentration of total carbonate comprising co 3 2 hco 3 and co 2 aq was calculated from the ph of solution the pk values of carbonic acid and the bicarbonate concentration obtained by titration the quality of the analysis was checked using international standards like ion 915 ion 96 4 and missippi 03 the concentrations of all the ions quantified were within 5 of the certified values of these standards 2 3 column experiments column experiments were conducted using a glass column of inner diameter 18 mm the flow was controlled using a peristaltic pump raven scientific rh p120vs fig 3 the height of the adsorbent bed was 10 cm and it was sandwiched between beds of glass beads of height 5 cm each to ensure a proper distribution of the water these two beds were further placed between a pair of cotton plugs the plug at the bottom was used to support the bed and the one at the top was used as a filter to remove any dirt or precipitates entering the column these items were placed in the column after filling it with deionised water thereby ensuring a random packing of the adsorbent if water was poured into the column after filling the adsorbent it resulted in the formation of air gaps which may cause channelling and reduce the efficiency of the adsorbent the ratio of the diameter of the column to that of the particle d dp was chosen to be greater than 20 in order to reduce the chances of channelling 29 60 for all the experiments an empty bed contact time ebct v b q of 5 minutes was maintained and the temperature was the room temperature 26 30 c here v b and q are the volume of the bed and the volumetric flowrate respectively as the experiments were done to simulate the actual conditions at the field level they were stopped daily after operating for about 10 12 h and were continued the next day during the resting period the column was left filled with the working solution in these experiments the breakthrough time was assumed to be the time at which the exit concentration of f c e f exceeded 1 0 mg l which corresponds to the acceptable limit of f in drinking water when the c e f exceed this value the adsorbent was deemed to be exhausted the number of bed volumes of water treated when c f crossed 1 0 mg l was calculated by interpolation of the data bracketing 1 0 mg l the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was calculated as described in appendix b 3 results and discussion the following symbols will be used in this section c 0 f and c e f denote the inlet and exit concentrations of f respectively m is the mass of adsorbent v is the volume of water treated till breakthrough occurs and v b π d 2 4 h is the bed volume where d is the inner diameter of the column and h is the height of the bed of adsorbent the abbreviations ror sfw snw and srw will be used to denote ro reject synthetic fluoride water synthetic normal water and synthetic reject water respectively 3 1 decreased efficiency of adsorbents with ro reject water from the field samples of ro reject ror were tested for defluoridation using haix zr and aa without adjusting the ph the samples were collected at different times of the year for one sample breakthrough with respect to f was achieved after about 190 bed volumes bv when aa was used fig 4 a the adsorption capacity q f calculated using b 11 see appendix b was 0 6 0 2 mg of f g of adsorbent the uncertainty in the capacity is calculated as follows when allowance is made for the confidence limits see appendix a the breakthrough curve consists of a set of three curves one representing the mean values of c e f c 0 f and the other two the upper and lower confidence limits hence three values are obtained for the area a c under the curve of c e f c 0 f vs v v b leading via b 11 to three values of the capacity q f corresponding to breakthrough these values are used to calculate the mean q f and the standard deviation σ f the capacity is reported as q f σ f the data correspond to one experiment with a particular concentration of ions in ror but a series of experiments were conducted with ror all the breakthrough volumes and adsorption capacities were similar fig 5 the slight variations in the capacities can be attributed to the change in the inlet concentration of f c 0 f with time 1 during an experiment there were regular drops in the value of c e f fig 4a this was due to the pause in the experiment after running it for about 10 12 h and resuming it the next day as mentioned earlier a similar behaviour was observed by li and sengupta 30 for the adsorption of pentachlorophenol on a macroporous exchanger they attributed it to the diffusion of the adsorbate into the interior of the pellet during the resting period thus fresh sites would be available for adsorption when the experiment was resumed the breakthrough volume obtained with the ror was about 6 times less than that obtained with using synthetic water containing only f sfw for aa fig 4a and about 133 times less for haix zr fig 4b the drastic decrease in the adsorption of f may be mainly attributed to the presence of many ions along with f in the feed 12 and also the higher ph of the ror table 1 there was about 15 0 3 0 mg of so 4 2 g of adsorbent adsorbed onto aa along with f and there was almost no adsorption of cl and no 3 supplementary fig s1 for some values of v v b the dimensionless concentrations of no 3 and cl were 1 the reason for this behavior is not known using synthetic fluoride water sfw the adsorption capacity for aa was found to be 3 3 0 1 mg of f g until the exit concentration reached 1 0 mg l this value is about 7 times higher than the values reported by ghorai and pant 18 0 5 mg of f g the aa used in both cases was procured from the same vendor and both batches had almost the same physical and chemical properties as per the specifications given by the vendor the difference in the performance of aa may result from soaking it in deionized water which changes the surface morphology 13 47 the adsorption of f is also observed to change the surface as confirmed using sem fig 2 and fig 6 xrd analysis shows that the fresh and soaked alumina had more of hexagonal and cubic phase alumina this was confirmed by using jcpds data files 002 0921 and 002 1420 respectively when there was adsorption of f along with hexagonal and cubic phases there was an orthorhombic phase of alumina also there was a slight shift in the peaks corresponding to the orthorhombic phase compared to the peaks reported in jcpds data files 016 0435 and 046 1215 probably due to the adsorption of f fig 7 in contrast to the behaviour observed with sfw when ro reject was treated using aa with and without soaking in deionised water the adsorption capacities were similar i e 0 6 0 1 mg of f g the adsorption of so 4 2 was the same for both modes of soaking when ror was used as feed as the concentration of no 3 in the feed and the treated water is well above the desirable limit of 45 mg l supplementary fig s1 additional treatment is required before the water can be used for drinking considering ror even though the observed uptake capacity of aa for f was less than that for sfw it was about 20 times larger than the capacity obtained by babu et al 4 who used caco 3 0 03 mg f g the capacity of haix zr was also about 4 times larger than that of caco 3 3 2 performance comparison of aa and haix zr activated alumina is an economical and readily available adsorbent but it has less adsorption capacity compared to many other adsorbents also the mechanical strength of the aa pellets is so low that they tend to crumble even with a small exertion of pressure in contrast haix zr is more robust and may have a better adsorption capacity than aa 37 to test this conjecture ror was treated with haix zr and aa owing to some operational problems the same feed could not be used for both the adsorbents even though the concentration of f in the feed was lower for haix zr the adsorption capacity was 0 14 0 06 mg f g which is about 4 times lower than the capacity obtained with aa correspondingly breakthrough occurs earlier for haix zr than for aa fig 4 however the masses of the adsorbents differ in the two cases and the bed volumes of water treated per unit mass of adsorbent are 3 3 g 1 for haix zr and 7 8 g 1 for aa as the composition of ror changes with the date of sampling it was decided to use srw adjusted to ph 5 5 table 1 for the present purpose with haix zr there was removal of both f and no 3 fig 8 and supplementary fig s2 but in the case of aa there was removal of f and so 4 2 fig 8 and supplementary fig s3 a detailed discussion about the effect of different co ions is given in next section activated alumina was able to treat about 440 bed volumes bv of water compared to 370 bv with haix zr fig 8 as the bulk densities of aa and haix zr differ the adsorption capacities were 2 1 0 5 mg f g 0 11 0 03 mmol g for aa and 2 9 0 6 mg f g 0 15 0 03 mmol g for haix zr a three fold increase in the capacity was observed for both the adsorbents with a change in the feed from srw to snw the capacities for aa and haix zr were 6 2 0 1 and 8 4 0 2 mg f g 0 33 0 01 and 0 44 0 01 mmol g respectively there was also a huge increase in the number of bed volumes of water treated from 440 to 1280 and 370 to 920 bv for aa and haix zr respectively fig 8b the error bars in fig 8a are larger than those in fig 8b because the samples were diluted by a factor of 10 in the former case and a factor of 5 in the latter case for srw and snw the better uptake of f by haix zr compared to aa can be attributed to the availability of abundant positively charged surfaces of the embedded zirconia nanoparticles compared to the aa surface the speciation reactions for zirconia in haix zr 37 and aluminol groups on aa 43 are given by 1 2 and 3 4 respectively 1 z r o o h 2 h z r o

and k 2 are the apparent equilibrium constants 6 for the reactions 1 2 3 and 4 respectively true equilibrium constants involve additional factors that depend on the electric potential ϕ to simplify the analysis the effect of ϕ is neglected let zrooh denote the mole fraction of zrooh using the values of the apparent equilibrium constants and assuming that the activity coefficients are unity it is found that zrooh 2 0 909 and aloh 0 91 at a ph 5 5 hence at the working ph of 5 5 the dominant species on the surface of the adsorbent are zrooh 2 for haix zr and aloh for aa thus haix zr may be expected to have a higher capacity for f than aa this conjecture is confirmed by the experiments with synthetic feed water even though aloh 2 0 091 we shall see later that most of the f is adsorbed by exchange with the aloh 2 groups the change in the uptake of f as the inlet solution was changed from sfw to snw and srw can be attributed to the presence of other ions which compete with f for the exchange sites on the surface of the adsorbent a decrease in ph can increase the positive surface sites but it also increases dissolution of alumina 17 and zirconia 37 therefore a ph of 5 5 was used haix zr has an added advantage of using nanoparticles thereby increasing the number of surface sites encapsulation of these nanoparticles inside the anion exchange resin helps in selective movement of anions to the surface sites and exclusion of cations by the donnan membrane principle 44 based on above explanation and from 2 it follows that zroo sites do not react with any cations except h whereas many of the zrooh 2 sites can react with anions thereby further consuming zrooh hence zrooh 2 is produced by the backward reactions of 1 and 2 for alo or zroo outside the resin there are other cations in addition to h hence they will not be as effective as the sites present inside the resin thus this adsorbent can be used over a range of ph values but the amount of species which can adsorb depends on the ph an optimum ph of 5 5 has been found to increase the adsorption capacity 37 3 3 effect of competing ions on the adsorption capacity of aa for srw snw and sfw the bed volumes of water treated by aa were 440 1280 and 665 respectively fig 4figs 4a and fig 88 the corresponding adsorption capacities were 0 11 0 03 0 33 0 01 and 0 17 0 01 mmol f g compared to sfw there was a 35 decrease for srw and a 100 increase for snw the reasons for the increase with snw will be discussed later in the literature adsorption of oh is reported to interfere with the adsorption of f uptake of oh should cause the ph of the exit solution to decrease whereas it increased to 6 0 8 0 for sfw fig 9 an initial decrease in the ph of the treated water may be due to the desorption of no 3 which alters the charge balance and is compensated by h production from h 2 o nitrate was released because of the use of nitric acid as a binding agent during the manufacture of aa private communication oxide india when 1 g of fresh aa was soaked in 10 ml of deionized water for 24 h the concentration of no 3 in water was 250 mg l in the exit solution the degree of change of ph was lower when the inlet concentrations of the ions were increased this is because of the ability of the ions to contribute to the overall charge balance along with h whereas for sfw h is the sole contributor the amount of oh released per unit mass of the adsorbent is given by 5 a h v b v 10 ph e a 14 10 ph i a 14 m here v v v b is the dimensionless volume of water treated v q t is the total volume of water treated q is the volumetric flow rate of water t is the time for which water is passed through the column v b is the volume of the adsorbent bed ph e a and ph i a are the average exit and inlet ph of the solution respectively and m is the mass of the adsorbent the amount of oh released was 5 56 10 4 mmol g 1 61 10 4 mmol g and 7 78 10 6 mmol g for sfw snw and srw respectively these values are 2 4 orders of magnitude less than the number of moles of f adsorbed 0 11 0 33 and 0 17 mmol g thus among the two reactions 6 and 7 the former is expected to be predominant 55 6 a l o h 2 f a l f h 2 o 7 a l o h f a l f o h the decrease in the uptake of f for srw fig 8a even with the availability of surface sites may be due to the competition of other ions for the same sites as their concentrations were increased as discussed later a contrasting increase in uptake for snw is because of the presence of hco 3 which aids in the formation of aloh 2 several studies on alumina report that ions such as cl so 4 2 and no 3 either have no effect on the uptake of f 2 5 27 31 or only a slight effect 23 28 it has been reported that phosphate and bicarbonate affect the adsorption of f 20 56 the decrease with respect to bicarbonate was attributed to the change in the ph of the solution 20 which changes the surface charge of aa also all the experiments were done in a batch mode with f and one other ion in the feed the presence of po 4 3 and related species and sio 2 3 were stated to be the biggest contributors to the decrease in the adsorption of f 2 28 however from fig 4 and fig 8 the adsorption of f decreased by about 35 when the feed was changed from sfw to srw even though po 4 3 and sio 2 were absent the variation of the hco 3 concentration with v v b was complex for snw the exit concentration fluctuated about the inlet concentration with a few data points where the concentration was much higher than the inlet concentration for srw adsorption occurred from the beginning of the experiment with a gradual change in the exit concentration reasons for the contrasting behaviour observed with snw and srw are not known during the resting period there was a similar decrease in the concentration as was observed for so 4 2 and f the overall amount of carbonate species adsorbed was 0 52 and 6 41 mmol g for snw and srw respectively there was about 70 decrease in the adsorption of f about 60 increase in the adsorption of so 4 2 and about 12 times increase in the uptake of hco 3 as the feed was changed from snw to srw the increase in the uptake of so 4 2 and hco 3 may be attributed to the higher concentrations of these ions in srw compared to snw this confirms the effect of co ions on adsorption the breakthrough curve for hco 3 was stopped when f crossed its breakthrough point in the ph range 5 2 7 2 wijnja and schulthess 57 proposed reactions 8 10 for the formation of a aloco 2 complex and a new aloh 2 site 8 a l o h c o 3 2 a l o c o 2 o h 9 a l o h h c o 3 a l o c o 2 o h h 10

complexation of all the carbonate species with the alumina surface the release of h is evident from the lower degree of change in the ph of the effluent as the concentration of hco 3 is increased fig 9 a very high uptake of total carbonate 6 41 mmol g by aa conforms to the reactions 8 11 and the use of aloh as it is the predominant surface group of al at a ph of 5 5 su and suarez 50 reported a similar 10 fold increase in the uptake of hco 3 by aa with a change in the concentration of hco 3 from 0 002 m to 0 02 m for aa at a ph of 5 5 there were comparatively less aloh 2 sites but a 100 increase in f adsorption was achieved by snw relative to sfw probably because of the formation of positive sites by the reactions 9 and 10 therefore a minimum concentration of hco 3 is required to increase the adsorption of f at high concentrations of hco 3 as in srw the hco 3 ions compete for the adsorption sites with f and reduce the uptake of f for the adsorption of f using haix zr the adsorption capacities were 0 98 0 01 0 46 0 01 and 0 15 0 03 mmol g for sfw snw and srw respectively fig 4figs 4b and fig 88 the error bars are larger for srw because of a higher dilution of the samples and a less linear calibration curve the performance of haix zr decreased in the presence of co ions except for so 4 2 and cl even after these ions attained a constant concentration adsorption of f continued fig 8 sulphate was released into the solution for 100 200 bed volumes similar to the trend observed with respect to aa where no 3 was released with respect to cl the exit concentration was constant and equal to the inlet concentration at some points c e c c 0 c w a s 1 probably because of the use of hcl for adjusting the ph of the solution in the reservoir to 5 5 the lack of adsorption of cl was also observed in the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds of a sliced particle subjected to the adsorption process the eds for zr and f showed an inner dark patch which corresponds to the presence of hydrated zirconia nanoparticles and f ions at the center of the particle the absence of dark patches at the centre for cl and s confirms the observed lack of adsorption of cl and so 4 2 onto haix zr fig 10 nitrate adsorption was observed till 170 and 130 bv for snw and srw respectively supplementary fig s2 the corresponding adsorption capacity was 0 14 mmol g for both the solutions even with a change in the concentration of the ions there was a constant adsorption capacity for no 3 3 4 regeneration of the adsorbent used for treating srw and snw regeneration of the used spent adsorbent is an important aspect of adsorption as it decreases the cost of treated water and also prevents the wastage of the adsorbent it was shown by many authors that the adsorbents could be regenerated when water with only f was used 7 9 however when adsorption was performed with snw and srw which contains many ions very little f could be desorbed from the adsorbent the regeneration was performed in batch and column modes for adsorbents treated with snw and srw respectively about 0 2 and 0 5 mg of f g of adsorbent desorbed from aa and haix zr respectively when f was adsorbed from snw the release of f was faster from haix zr than from aa upon use of the regenerated adsorbent for further f uptake there was a constant uptake but the concentration of the exit stream was above the acceptable limit of 1 0 mg l with both the adsorbents this inefficiency is caused by the incomplete desorption of the adsorbed f in the first cycle when regeneration was performed in the column mode about 0 2 and 0 3 mg of f g were desorbed from aa and haix zr respectively the effluent from the column with haix zr attained a zero concentration of f in about 8 bed volumes for aa the concentration decreased very slowly after 8 bed volumes even though there was no release of f for haix zr based on the amount of f adsorbed before regeneration there was about 2 6 mg g of f still remaining on the adsorbent thus the adsorption of other ions along with f decreases the ability of the adsorbent to desorb f a more detailed analysis is required to explain the incomplete desorption 3 5 cost of the treated water till now the performance of the adsorbents was assessed based on the adsorption capacity when the cost of the adsorbent is considered it gives an idea about the feasibility of the adsorbent for public use the cost of the activated alumina adsorbent is about 200 kg us 3 0 kg which includes the shipping and manufacturing cost and that of haix zr is 600 l of the adsorbent us 9 0 l because of the high cost of haix zr even with a higher capacity for sfw the cost was 0 2 l us 0 004 l table 2 the calculations are based on the total amount of water treated with an exit concentration 1 0 mg l and do not include the operating and capital costs the cost increased drastically as the concentration of different ions increased for aa the cost of the treated water is 1 5 l us 0 03 l with any sample of water table 2 shreyas et al 47 had shown that the cost of the treated water decreases with the number of regeneration cycles up to four cycles however they used only synthetic water samples containing only f and not reject water in the present work as the regeneration was not effective this factor was not included in calculating the cost of treated water 4 conclusions reject water from a reverse osmosis unit and synthetic water samples of various compositions were treated using activated alumina and a hybrid anion exchange resin embedded with hydrated zirconium oxide nanoparticles haix zr the performance of haix zr was superior to aa for synthetic reject synthetic normal and synthetic fluoride water but the converse was true for ro reject with aa there was negligible adsorption of cl and no 3 but so 4 2 and hco 3 were adsorbed a moderate amount of hco 3 increased the uptake of f by aa with haix zr there was negligible adsorption of cl and so 4 2 but no 3 and hco 3 were adsorbed the presence of many co ions at high concentrations caused a drastic decrease in the adsorption capacity of f for both the adsorbents in case of haix zr the donnan membrane effect helps in better selectivity of ions by preventing the entry of cations into the resin beads with the use of a better adsorbent like haix zr the ro reject can be subjected to a slight pre treatment i e passing it through a weak acid anion exchange resin to remove the excess hco 3 instead of the reject being wasted in the present ro reject the water has high concentrations of fluoride and nitrate aa was able to remove f but not no 3 therefore additional treatment would be required before the water can be used for drinking in contrast haix zr was able to remove both f and no 3 but no 3 was removed to a lesser extent for caco 3 babu et al 4 state that the adsorption capacity was 0 03 mg f g when the inlet f concentration was 13 8 mg l in the present work the adsorption capacity of aa was 0 57 mg f g when the inlet f concentration was 5 0 mg l and the concentration of the co anions was 31 8 mm thus aa is a better adsorbent than caco 3 for treating reject water the adsorption of f increased with a hco 3 concentration of 100 mg l and decreased as the concentration increased to 1050 mg l the competitive adsorption of hco 3 on aa causes a dual effect on the adsorption of f the present experiments on the effect of multiple co anions can explain the cause for the decreased efficiency for the adsorption of f the cost of the treatment for different water samples varied from 0 1 1 5 l us 0 002 0 03 l for aa and 0 2 11 5 l us 0 004 0 23 l for haix zr acknowledgements we thank the department of science and technology for financial support mr m k ashwin

calibration curve and confidence limits the quantitative analysis of the ions in the solution was mostly done using ion chromatography in a typical chromatogram the area under the peak corresponding

calibration curve is constructed as follows considering samples having known concentrations of the ions let c i denote the concentration of f in a sample i a i the area under the chromatogram and n

sample in a 3 the term after the sign gives the confidence limits for a set of known concentrations an example of a calibration curve is shown in fig 11 a similar procedure is used for the other ions

the quantity n i n i 0 is the amount of i that accumulates in the liquid outside the pellets the void volume with a particular adsorbent was obtained by measuring the change in the volume of water when adsorbent particles were added to it in the present case the void volume of a 10 cm bed of diameter d 18 mm with aa particles corresponds to 12 5 ml similarly as the adsorbent is porous it can retain some amount of solute the void volume of the fresh pellets was measured and found to be about 3 2 ml for a mass of 25 g for an inlet concentration of f c 0 f 5 mg l the maximum amount of solute that can accumulate in the void volume within and outside the pellets is 0 078 mg the present experiments show that the lowest adsorption capacity obtained is 0 49 mg f g which is equivalent to 14 25

14573,industrial wastewater containing effluents from 190 factories located at an industrial park in toluca state mexico was subjected to galvanic gt galvanic fenton gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments to remove organic matter the galvanic system uses iron copper electrodes to produce fe2 in situ for the gf system hydrogen peroxide was applied to produce hydroxyl radicals the gf system does not require energy unlike the analogous electro fenton system and in fact it is possible to generate an electric current 220 mv from the chemical reactions a synergistic effect was observed with gf treatment at ph 2 8 and a h2o2 fe2 ratio of 19 1 i e 7840 mg h2o2 l and 408 mg fe2 l leading to high removal percentages for color 76 soluble chemical oxygen demand 71 and total organic carbon 79 while degradations of 43 and 48 were achieved for biochemical oxygen demand and nitrates respectively fluorescence and ir spectroscopy analyses of raw and treated wastewater samples were performed with the aim of establishing the anthropic origin of the dissolved organic matter fluorescence spectroscopy showed that gf treatment eliminated the anthropogenic organic matter associated with aromatic groups and proteins enhanced effluent biodegradability did not increase toxicity and reduced the sub lethal effects observed for lettuce radicles most importantly the removal efficiencies of gf treatment were comparable with those of analogous electrochemical advanced oxidation processes based on fenton reactions keywords industrial wastewater galvanic galvanic fenton total organic carbon chemical oxygen demand 1 introduction two million tons of wastewater are discharged into the world s waterways daily 1 this wastewater has a complex composition comprising mainly organic matter organic refractory compounds inorganic ions such as nitrates sulfates and phosphates total dissolved solids suspended material dyes detergents fats and oils and recently emergent compounds such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and hormones 2 all these materials have environmental and human health effects ranging from eutrophication and generation of anaerobic conditions in water bodies to carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects in humans 3 5 it is estimated that the upper course of the lerma river uclr a drainage basin that is associated with an area of 2118 km2 located in the state of mexico receives 536 106 m3 of municipal and industrial wastewater per year both treated and untreated from approximately 20 municipalities and the hundreds of industries located in the industrial parks in toluca city consequently the river carries an organic load of 350 946 tons 33 of which comes from urban discharge and 67 of which originates from industrial discharge 6 approximately 190 factories located at the industrial park in toluca state mexico send the wastewater they generate during industrial production for centralized treatment before it is discharged into the environment the influent is typically treated by primary sedimentation biological treatment and secondary sedimentation however the soluble chemical oxygen demand cod at the end of the treatment train is around 1500 mg l with a biodegradability index bi defined as the biochemical oxygen demand bod cod ratio by metcalf and eddy of around 0 2 4 this is a matter of concern because wastewater with a bi index lower than 0 5 is considered poorly biodegradable 7 in addition this wastewater has a persistent brown color caused mainly by the presence of humic acids and melanoidines and exhibits high salinity which translates into high electrical conductivity the treated wastewater also contains dissolved solids that are inorganic and may constitute the majority of the pollutants in the wastewater 80 the fixed solids in the wastewater correspond to cations and anions such as na k cl so4 2 and po4 3 and the wastewater is also excessively alkaline owing to the presence of hco3 the biodegradability index is low because of the large quantity of inert cod established technologies such as biological treatments are no longer able to remove persistent compounds 8 furthermore environmental regulations and their enforcement have become more stringent so there is growing interest in the development of new treatment methods a combination of advanced oxidation processes aops and advanced electrochemical systems has been developed for the removal of persistent organic pollutants and represent an attractive alternative to conventional methods 9 15 these techniques involve the use and generation of strong oxidant species o3 h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh 10 12 14 a highly reactive species that acts as a higher oxidant to destroy refractory compounds and has an electrochemical oxidation potential eop of 2 80 v its attack mode is non selective it can operate at normal temperature and pressure and it can oxidize almost all materials in wastewater 4 consequently electrochemical aops have been successfully employed for the treatment of leachates 16 17 municipal wastewater 18 and dyes 19 20 a more recent classification of these techniques includes electrocoagulation which uses sacrificial iron or aluminum anodes to induce coagulation or flotation of pollutants anodic oxidation and electroperoxidation for in situ and bulk pollutant oxidation by oh physisorbed h2o2 and o3 oxidants and electro fenton treatment and peroxicoagulation which exploits the fenton reaction reaction 1 between h2o2 produced at the cathode and fe2 added or produced at the anode to oxidize and coagulate pollutants 21 however although renewable energy sources can be incorporated into these systems 22 all the methods mentioned above require external energy and expensive electrode materials such as boron doped diamond pt and iro2 making these treatments an expensive option 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh o h given the current global energy crisis galvanic systems such as those used in cathodic and anodic protection employed to prevent the corrosion of metals that do not require external energy to produce metal ions have been developed as an alternative method to treat wastewater the principles of these systems may be explained by considering the corrosion of a typical metal m in an acidic environment the electrochemical reactions that occur are basically the dissolution of the metal and the evolution of hydrogen gas 2 m m n ne 3 2 h 2 e h 2 g the active metal serves as a sacrificial anode in the electrochemical couple as it is consumed oxidation and dissolution of the sacrificial metal is faster in a galvanic couple than they would be for an individual metal likewise if the mn species needs to be controlled the cathodic anodic area can be optimized 23 consequently in previous studies galvanic reactors have been investigated for the treatment of industrial wastewater containing hexavalent chromium in these studies the ratio of anode cathode areas and ph were optimized leading to excellent results i e the removal of 100 92 50 and 38 cr vi chlorides nitrates and sulfates respectively in batch mode 24 accordingly the aim of this study was to propose and evaluate an industrial wastewater treatment method involving the application of a galvanic system and a novel galvanic fenton gf system to remove the organic matter from industrial effluent iron copper electrodes were proposed as the anode cathode in both systems these electrodes produce fe2 ions that in the galvanic system induce coagulation of organic matter and in the gf system oxidize organic matter through the fenton reaction that occurs upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide it is important to mention that neither the galvanic nor the gf systems require energy unlike the analogous electro fenton system peroxicoagulation and electroperoxidation thus the system is inexpensive sustainable self contained and portable for operation in remote locations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization of wastewater a combined sample was obtained from six simple samples of wastewater taken before the primary clarifiers in an industrial wastewater treatment plant that receives the effluent from 190 factories in different sectors including chemical food and pharmaceutical manufacturers slaughterhouses municipal waste sources and tanneries three hour periods were allowed to elapse between the taking of each simple sample over the course of a 16 h operation in order to obtain a representative sample of the influent the sample was collected in a plastic container and was stored at 4 c prior to physicochemical characterization and further treatments raw and treated wastewater samples were characterized physicochemically to compare results and evaluate the removal efficiencies the parameters determined according to standard methods 25 were color total organic carbon toc total inorganic carbon tic total carbon tc ph

transform infrared ftir spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds and acute toxicity analysis were performed 2 2 galvanic treatment gt the galvanic system was designed for use in a 1 l glass cell considering the following criteria a a monopolar system comprising parallel carbon steel sae 1010 electrodes as sacrificial iron anodes and electrolytic copper as cathodes was used the electrodes were conditioned previously by sanding and polishing with alumina followed by washing with distilled water and immediate drying b an inter electrode gap of 2 mm c an electrode area liquid volume ratio suggested by holt 26 of 124 500 cm2 cm3 and d an optimum copper iron area ratio of 3 5 1 as reported by lugo et al 23 to maintain the iron corrosion rate fig 1 shows the experimental set up a 0 5 l sample of the selected industrial wastewater was added to a batch system so that it entirely covered the electrodes the treatment was carried out over 4 h the operational ph values evaluated were 2 8 4 0 and 5 0 in the course of the treatment time aliquots were taken for monitor control parameters such as cod toc color and turbidity finally the whole procedure was performed in triplicate 2 3 gf treatment for the gf treatment galvanic design volume time and ph values were investigated to promote the generation of oh radicals and induce the fenton reaction thus achieving a gf treatment hydrogen peroxide jt baker brand reagent grade h2o2 at 30 density 1 1 g ml was supplied to the system and the amount of h2o2 used was calculated as a function of the ratio suggested by ince and tezcanli 27 i e 1 g of cod 0 03125 mol of o2 0 0625 mol of h2o2 according to this protocol 39 236 g h2o2 would be necessary to oxidize the organic matter present per liter of raw wastewater however only 7840 mg l h2o2 was applied for the 408 mg fe l that was produced galvanically thereby maintaining an optimum ratio of 19 1 the h2o2 was dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min during the 120 min of treatment cod toc color and turbidity parameters were also monitored 2 4 hydrogen peroxide treatment considering the optimal conditions determined for the gf system 7840 mg l hydrogen peroxide was added to 0 5 l of the selected industrial wastewater and the peroxide was dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min during a treatment time of 120 min experiments were carried out at ph 2 8 in triplicate and control parameters such as cod toc color and turbidity were determined this experiment was performed as a control to contrast the effects of the galvanic and gf processes 2 5 sludge characterization and quantification samples were analyzed by sem and x ray microanalysis analysis was performed on a jeol jsm5900 lv microscope to observe the composition and configuration of the sludge structure sem provides images of rough materials with a resolution of fractions of a micrometer whereas eds offers in situ elemental analysis secondary electron imaging sei was employed in low vacuum mode at 15 kv voltage 20 pa pressure and 100 500 and 1000 magnifications samples were placed over aluminum tape and uncoated for the test a semi quantitative analysis of the elemental composition was performed by eds with an oxford probe 2 6 ftir and fluorescence spectroscopy to gain better insight into the transformation characteristics of organic pollutants in raw industrial wastewater galvanic gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments were performed and the dry sludges were analyzed by ftir spectroscopy which has been widely used to characterize organic compounds and ammonium in wastewater and to determine the general functional groups present a shimadzu ftir spectrophotometer ir affinity is was used and spectra were obtained in the 4500 450 cm 1 wavenumber range in addition industrial wastewater samples and treated effluents were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the dissolved organic matter dom fluorescence analysis was performed on each sample following the procedure proposed by westerhoff et al 28 for this analysis a perkin elmer model ls55 spectrometer was used in the sample characterization 45 individual emission spectra were recorded at excitation wavelengths λex between 200 and 450 nm and emission wavelengths λem between 280 and 550 nm the samples were analyzed at a concentration 2 mg l cod adjusted by dilution and at ph 3 adjusted by the addition of 4 m sulfuric acid to minimize the potential for metal binding and subsequent fluorescence a 290 nm filter was used in all analyses to eliminate raleigh peak light interference in the same way the excitation emission matrix eem of distilled water was obtained and subtracted from the eem of the raw and treated industrial wastewater samples to eliminate interference caused by raman peaks 2 7 toxicity to compare the toxicity of the raw and treated wastewater a bioassay with lettuce seeds lactuca sativa based on protocols for short term toxicity screening of hazardous waste sites 29 was performed batches of 20 lettuce seeds l sativa lot 1409 vita brand were distributed in 90 15 mm plastic petri dishes over filter paper with 4 ml of each sample raw galvanic gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments at concentrations of 0 1 1 10 50 and 100 in triplicate the different concentrations were achieved by dilution with reconstituted hard water 25 which was prepared by dissolving 2 4 g mgso4 3 84 g nahco3 and 0 16 g kcl in 19 l distilled water and adding 2 4 g caso4 2h2o dissolved in 1 l distilled water the prepared petri dishes were protected from light inside a plastic bag and were incubated for 120 h at 20 c as a first approach to determining the ec50 median effective concentration once the results were evaluated new concentrations were prepared and incubated according to the number of germinated seeds at each concentration the radicle and hypocotyl lengths were measured and phytotoxic indicators or abnormal growth such as necrosis or poorly developed absorbent hair were assessed abnormal germination seeds emergence of cotyledons or both cotyledons and hypocotyl without radicles were considered non germinated to validate the test a control was prepared with reconstituted hard water and 90 germination was considered effective considering the visible appearance of a radicle 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of industrial wastewater table 1 shows the physicochemical characterization results for the raw wastewater the industrial wastewater has a slightly alkaline ph of 7 95 an alkalinity of 2991 5 mg l caco3 and an electrical conductivity of 12 94 ms which indicates that the water contains a high concentration of dissolved solids 10150 mg l the inorganic ions present are characterized as chlorides 2950 1 mg l sulfates 1139 mg l and nitrates 16 54 mg l the wastewater exhibits high concentrations of cations mainly sodium 2588 mg l and potassium 258 mg l in addition the organic matter is represented by a total cod of 5264 mg l bod of 2116 mg l toc of 1744 mg l turbidity of 1838 fau and a bi of 0 28 indicating low biodegradability nitrogenous matter and total phosphorus are present at 238 mg l and 860 mg l respectively 3 2 gt ph is a key parameter for wastewater treatment and the pollutant removal efficiency decreases by either increasing or decreasing the ph of the solution the effect of ph in the galvanic treatment was investigated the response variables investigated were cod toc and color removal efficiencies and the results are summarized in fig 2 as can be seen the efficiencies for color and cod increase in response to initial ph at ph 2 8 the following maximum removal efficiencies were obtained 59 color 21 6 soluble cod and 10 toc fig 3 shows the kinetics behavior of the galvanic system the above behavior is typical of electrocoagulation treatments in which higher cod removal percentages are obtained under acidic conditions 30 in the case of galvanic systems acidic conditions are necessary for iron corrosion and the release of fe2 into the bulk solution thus ph 2 8 was adopted as the optimum ph for subsequent kinetics analysis and gf treatments the experimental data were fitted to zero first and second order kinetic models to calculate the kinetic constants and correlation coefficients by nonlinear regression originpro 8 program the best correlation coefficients were obtained with the second order model with correlation coefficients values higher than 0 95 for cod and color however for the toc data the correlation coefficient was around 0 7 owing to the large standard deviation of the experimental data according to this model the rate constant for color degradation k2 is higher than those for cod and toc degradation while the rate constant for tic removal is negative which could be due to mineralization of the organic matter co2 the gt process involves different chemical and physical mechanisms generally in a galvanic system anodic metal dissolution occurs and a number of cations coagulant species and hydroxides are formed that destabilize and coagulate suspended particles or precipitate and adsorb dissolved contaminants in the current study because iron electrodes were used as sacrificial anodes the anodic oxidation of fe0 s to fe2 occurred eq 4 and the reduction of cu2 to cu0 on the cathode occurred simultaneously eq 5 additionally due to the enhanced polarization of the electrodes by the proposed area relationship the simultaneous reduction of water eq 6 evolution of hydrogen eq 7 and possibly the reduction of iron eq 8 are involved anodic reaction 4 fe 0 fe 2 2 e cathodic reactions 5 c u aq 2 2 e cu s 6 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 h 2 g 2 oh 7 2h aq 2e h2 g 8 fe 3 e fe 2 the reactions in the solution eq 4 according to the equilibrium diagram show that fe2 is present at acidic ph however ph 3 8 corresponds to the formation of hydroxides eqs 9 and 10 therefore the main mechanism for the removal of contaminants by gt is most likely coagulation flocculation this mechanism has also been observed by fan and ma 31 who used a fe cu system to pretreat mixed wastewater industry and urban sewage their reports indicated that 20 cod removal was achieved and the bi was consequently increased bulk solution reactions 9 fe 2 2 oh fe oh 2 10 4 fe oh 2 2 h 2 o o 2 4 fe oh 3 conversely only 36 nitrates and 12 total nitrogen are removed during 4 h treatment time it is also important to note that the bi increases from 0 4 to 0 45 table 1 3 3 gf treatment it has been reported in the literature that the fenton and electro fenton processes are more efficient in acidic mediaum for most treated effluents and that ph is an important parameter for a successful treatment most studies have reported that the optimum ph for the fenton process is around 2 8 3 because iron species commonly begin to precipitate and form as ferric hydroxides at higher ph values consequently the oxidation efficiency decreases dramatically for this reason the behavior of the galvanic system allows us to define ph 2 8 as the optimum value to evaluate the gf process fig 4 shows the removal efficiencies obtained at ph 2 8 with the addition of 7840 mg l hydrogen peroxide dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min and with a h2o2 fe2 ratio of 19 1 the results indicate 76 color removal 71 soluble cod degradation and 79 toc decrease the experimental results were also fitted to zero first and second order kinetic models to calculate kinetic constants of these the second order model was the most suitable for representing the experimental data as can be seen in table 2 the kinetic rates k2 and correlation coefficients r2 for all parameters are much higher than those obtained for gt especially for color which reaches a value of 0 8749 l pt co u min as can be seen the tic increases as the toc decreases due to mineralization of the inorganic matter to understand the above behavior it is important to consider that fenton s reagent is very effective for the oxidation of a large number of hazardous and organic pollutants in this research the fenton reaction was promoted using a galvanic system fe cu which produces fe2 at the anode eq 11 as a result of the potential difference obtained in the fe cu system and the co generation of hydroxyl radicals produced by the reaction between fe2 and the added hydrogen peroxide eq 12 normally the organic substances are removed via two processes a oxidation due to the production of oh radicals eq 13 and b coagulation ascribed to the formation of ferric hydroxo complexes eqs 14 and 15 15 32 furthermore the fenton reaction could be catalyzed by fe2 reduction at the cathode eq 8 thereby increasing the rate of reaction 12 in fig 5 a diagram of the proposed mechanism of the novel gf system is presented anodic reaction 11 fe 0 fe 2 2 e bulk solution reactions 12 fe 2 h 2 o 2 h fe 3 oh h 2 o 13 rh ho r h 2 o where rh denotes organic pollutants 14 r fe 3 r fe 2 15 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh as can be seen in table 1 a bod reduction of 43 was observed and removal of 48 of the nitrates and 99 of the total phosphorous was also obtained nitrate reduction by aqueous fe2 release is possible but it has been demonstrated that in the absence of fe0 no reaction occurs between aqueous fe2 and nitrate in an acidified anoxic solution so the more probable reducing agents include fe0 or fe0 coated with iron oxides in acidic conditions 24 the copper cathode surface in the galvanic system may also contribute to the reduction of nitrates eq 16 24 16 n o 3 aq 10 h aq 8 e n h 4 aq 3 h 2 o phosphorous in aqueous solutions at ph 2 6 is present as h2po 4 according to the equilibrium diagram the h2po 4 can be reduced in gf to h2po 3 eq 17 as a result of the reducing power in the presence of the fe2 catalyst and colloidal metals 33 even though these ions can be adsorbed in the form of a complex with fe oh 2 eq 18 and can be removed by flocculation and sedimentation 31 17 h 2 p o 4 3 h 2 e h 2 p o 3 h 2 o 18 fe oh 2 2 h 2 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 ho feoh h 2 p o 4 3 4 hydrogen peroxide treatment in addition hydrogen peroxide treatment at different peroxide doses was performed according to the optimal conditions determined for the gf system 7840 mg h2o2 l dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min for 120 min of treatment and at a ph of 2 8 to observe the changes in color cod toc tic and tc in the absence of gt the results reveal lower efficiencies and correlation coefficients than those of gf for all parameters with the exception of color as shown in fig 6 the obtained removal efficiencies are 29 cod 78 color 79 bod and 52 toc with a considerably low bi of 0 08 as compared to those of the gt and gf systems the kinetics were also fitted to kinetics models and the second order model presented the best correlation coefficient with a rate constant for color of 1 1456 l ptco u min while the rate and efficiency for the cod are considerably lower the tic content increases as the toc decreases which may be attributed to the mineralization of organic matter eq 19 the oxidation rate for organic matter may be correlated with the decomposition rate of the hydrogen peroxide eq 20 19 r h 2 o 2 co 2 h 2 o 20 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 the results indicate the controlled oxidation of chlorides into gaseous chlorine at ph 3 chlorine can be obtained by the oxidation of acid solutions that have a sufficiently high chloride concentration after h2o2 action bicarbonates are thermodynamically stable in the presence of water and aqueous solutions at ph 5 4 however at lower ph bicarbonate is transformed into carbonic acid 3 5 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence is the result of a process that occurs in certain molecules generally polyaromatic hydrocarbons or heterocycles called fluorophores or fluorescent dyes it is widely known that industrial effluents contain a type of molecules called melanoidines and significant amounts of humic and fulvic materials that are difficult to treat 34 for this reason the fluorescence spectra of raw and treated wastewater were recorded with the aim of establishing the anthropic origin of the dom according to westerhoff et al s 28 methodology the excitation emission matrix eem was divided into five regions and the region that corresponds to raw wastewater shows three defined peaks in the ii iii and v regions associated with aromatic proteins and fulvic and humic acids respectively fig 7 and a marked shoulder in region iv that corresponds to soluble microbial byproducts table 3 shows the fluorescence intensities fis of the eems in the performed treatments the gt eem shows a decrease of 22 fi in the ii and iv regions while hydrogen peroxide treatment decreases the fi in regions ii iii iv and v by 39 45 44 and 33 respectively however gf treatment eliminates the ii region peak which corresponds to anthropogenic organic matter associated with aromatic proteins peaks in the regions iv and v decrease in fi by 67 and 42 respectively peak iii is undefined due to displacement of the coordinate λex λem and it does not disappear entirely thereby confirming the presence of natural organic matter nom and the presence of humic and fulvic acids 3 6 ftir spectroscopy according to the general characteristics of the samples it has been identified that some of the most important constituents are melanoidines which are very complex brown nitrogenous biopolymers with unknown structures that are usually formed by the reaction of the amino and carbonyl groups in the byproducts of sugar degradation they are commonly found in effluents from the fermentation and distillation of sugarcane molasses humic and fulvic acids ethanol production and yeast processing by bakers and the brewing industry 35 37 according to stevenson 38 typical ir spectra of humic and fulvic acids show the main absorption bands at 3300 cm 1 h bonded and oh groups 2900 cm 1 aliphatic ch stretching 1720 cm 1 co stretching of cooh and ketones 1630 cm 1 aromatic cc and h bonded co and 1200 1230 cm 1 co stretching and oh deformation of cooh in addition small bands are often evident at 1500 cm 1 aromatic cc and 1460 cm 1 ch deformation of ch2 or ch3 groups bands at 1635 and 1573 cm 1 which are assigned to amide group vibrations show significant changes upon treatment for example the band at 1635 cm 1 decreases upon peroxide treatment but disappears completely upon gf treatment while the band at 1573 cm 1 completely disappears for all treatments suggesting the decomposition of proteins peptides and combined amino acids as reported by zhang et al 39 finally decomposition bands centered at 1050 cm 1 related to the co stretching of aliphatic ethers and the carbon rings in cyclic compounds suggest the degradation of aromatic compounds 39 this agrees with the ir spectra shown in fig 8 obtained from the sludges of a raw wastewater b gt c hydrogen peroxide treatment and d gf treatment as shown when different treatments are applied the intensity of the bands decreases gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments result in the greatest decreases in color with 76 and 78 being achieved respectively 3 7 sem eds sem images provide information about sample morphology and the elemental composition of a solid surface is given by eds fig 9 shows different morphological images and eds spectra of the sludges from a raw b galvanic c hydrogen peroxide and d gf treatments the sludge of the raw sample fig 9a shows a uniform and defined shape while the morphological characteristics of the sludge derived from gt fig 9b shows more agglomeration and floccules of greater size than those in raw wastewater sludge which may be attributed to the iron hydroxides formed during gt the sludge derived from hydrogen peroxide treatment also shows agglomeration fig 9c in contrast the sludge resulting from gf treatment shows a large mass of mud and no well defined flocs are observed fig 9d which can be attributed to the scission of organic chains by the fenton reagent that is galvanically generated eds analyses of the raw and galvanic sludges show similar characteristics due to them containing mostly carbon which corresponds to the organic matter as well as oxygen associated with oxyanions silicon and minority atoms such as ca mg cl k and s in the case of the sludge from the treatment with peroxide an increment in oxygen content is observed owing to the residual peroxide still present in the system sludge from the gf treatment shows a clear decrease in carbon content compared to that of the original sample owing to the reduction of organic matter by the fenton reagent iron is present as a result of the enhanced fe2 electro generation in this system as expected 3 8 toxicity assessing the toxicity of the treated effluents is of major importance owing to their discharge into the lerma river and possible reuse in irrigation systems two measures of toxicity were assessed 29 for the tests which were performed on raw and treated wastewater galvanic hydrogen peroxide and gf treatments using l sativa i e percent mortality lethal effect and effect proportion sub lethal effect percent mortality i e number of non germinated seeds total number of test seeds 100 was calculated for each test dilution and this toxicity index was used to estimate ec50 values with a 95 confidence interval for each sample through probit analysis using ibm spss version 22 0 statistics software the control solution validated the test showing 95 germination ec50 values of 64 05 64 95 and 65 07 were obtained for raw wastewater gt and gf treatment effluents respectively which indicates that even though there is no reduction in toxicity for the applied treatments the toxicity does not increase and this could indicate that particularly in the gf treatment the residual h2o2 40 mg l does not affect lettuce germination conversely the large amount of residual h2o2 1570 mg l for the hydrogen peroxide treatment effluent strongly inhibits the germination of l sativa seeds with an ec50 of 29 57 table 4 shows the results of ec50 as percent concentration effect proportion e and radicle and hypocotyl length for some of the concentrations tested effect proportion e is given by t c c where t is the mean growth in the concentration tests and c is the mean growth in the control which were calculated for radicle elongation for each test the raw wastewater exhibits no toxic effects as e 0 009 which is positive t c at 0 1 concentration however when the concentration increases to 1 e 0 043 which is negative t c so the effluent is toxic at this concentration an effect on hypocotyl length decrease 9 89 mm was observed at 50 concentration the gt effluent becomes toxic at 10 concentration and the hypocotyl length decreases to 7 37 mm at 60 concentration this improvement is probably due to increased copper from electrode corrosion which can act as a vegetal micronutrient at low concentrations 40 this agrees with the gf treatment values in which the effluent shows a toxicity improvement compared to the raw wastewater as e 0 414 when the concentration increases to 50 and the hypocotyl length decreases to 9 19 mm at the same concentration the hydrogen peroxide treatment effluent shows an evident increase in radicle length 7 35 mm from the lowest concentration 0 1 which is larger than the rest of the effluents and the control itself a toxic effect is evident at 20 dilution both for e and the hypocotyl length decrease 9 28 mm the above can be explained by the dual role of h2o2 the stimulating effect of which upon seed germination and subsequent seedling vigor have been observed in a number of species this indicates that this chemical acts as a respiration stimulant resulting in the production of o2 for mitochondrial respiration and metabolic activities which accelerates the breakdown of reserve food substances and thus provides a more rapid supply of energy and materials for synthesis at the growing point 41 42 secondly h2o2 accumulation has a deleterious effect and thus the mutual relationship between the positive and negative functions depends on hydrogen peroxide concentration 43 4 conclusions the initial physicochemical characterization of the industrial wastewater revealed its high alkalinity and large inorganic load mainly in the form of sodium chlorides and sulfates besides the refractory organic matter its bi was found to be 0 28 meaning that biological treatment alone would not be effective for degradation galvanic treatment using the fe cu system allowed for the removal of 12 6 cod 7 6 bod 59 color and 10 toc however the bi remained similar changing only from 0 28 to 0 21 and 36 nitrates and 12 total phosphorous were removed during 4 h treatment at ph 2 8 hydrogen peroxide treatment was conducted with a dosing of 7840 mg l at 1 5 10 and 15 min during a treatment time of 120 min at ph 2 8 and the removal efficiencies were 29 for cod 78 for color 79 for bod and 52 for toc however the bi was significantly low at 0 02 and toxicity was increased to an ec50 of 29 5 a synergistic effect was obtained with gf treatment at ph 2 8 upon adding 7840 mg l hydrogen peroxide dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min and 408 mg l fe ratio 19 1 obtaining a reduction of 76 for color 71 for soluble cod 43 for bod 79 for toc and 48 for nitrates the bi increased to 0 55 as can be seen the gf system is a promising option for industrial wastewater treatment it does not require energy enhances effluent biodegradability does not increase its toxicity and reduces its sub lethal effects no fluorescence by anthropogenic organic matter was detected but most importantly the removal efficiencies may be comparable with those of the analogous electro fenton process acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the centro interamericano de recursos del agua cira for its support in the realization of the experiments and conacyt for providing a scholarship grant and for economic support of the 219743 project 
14573,industrial wastewater containing effluents from 190 factories located at an industrial park in toluca state mexico was subjected to galvanic gt galvanic fenton gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments to remove organic matter the galvanic system uses iron copper electrodes to produce fe2 in situ for the gf system hydrogen peroxide was applied to produce hydroxyl radicals the gf system does not require energy unlike the analogous electro fenton system and in fact it is possible to generate an electric current 220 mv from the chemical reactions a synergistic effect was observed with gf treatment at ph 2 8 and a h2o2 fe2 ratio of 19 1 i e 7840 mg h2o2 l and 408 mg fe2 l leading to high removal percentages for color 76 soluble chemical oxygen demand 71 and total organic carbon 79 while degradations of 43 and 48 were achieved for biochemical oxygen demand and nitrates respectively fluorescence and ir spectroscopy analyses of raw and treated wastewater samples were performed with the aim of establishing the anthropic origin of the dissolved organic matter fluorescence spectroscopy showed that gf treatment eliminated the anthropogenic organic matter associated with aromatic groups and proteins enhanced effluent biodegradability did not increase toxicity and reduced the sub lethal effects observed for lettuce radicles most importantly the removal efficiencies of gf treatment were comparable with those of analogous electrochemical advanced oxidation processes based on fenton reactions keywords industrial wastewater galvanic galvanic fenton total organic carbon chemical oxygen demand 1 introduction two million tons of wastewater are discharged into the world s waterways daily 1 this wastewater has a complex composition comprising mainly organic matter organic refractory compounds inorganic ions such as nitrates sulfates and phosphates total dissolved solids suspended material dyes detergents fats and oils and recently emergent compounds such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and hormones 2 all these materials have environmental and human health effects ranging from eutrophication and generation of anaerobic conditions in water bodies to carcinogenic mutagenic and teratogenic effects in humans 3 5 it is estimated that the upper course of the lerma river uclr a drainage basin that is associated with an area of 2118 km2 located in the state of mexico receives 536 106 m3 of municipal and industrial wastewater per year both treated and untreated from approximately 20 municipalities and the hundreds of industries located in the industrial parks in toluca city consequently the river carries an organic load of 350 946 tons 33 of which comes from urban discharge and 67 of which originates from industrial discharge 6 approximately 190 factories located at the industrial park in toluca state mexico send the wastewater they generate during industrial production for centralized treatment before it is discharged into the environment the influent is typically treated by primary sedimentation biological treatment and secondary sedimentation however the soluble chemical oxygen demand cod at the end of the treatment train is around 1500 mg l with a biodegradability index bi defined as the biochemical oxygen demand bod cod ratio by metcalf and eddy of around 0 2 4 this is a matter of concern because wastewater with a bi index lower than 0 5 is considered poorly biodegradable 7 in addition this wastewater has a persistent brown color caused mainly by the presence of humic acids and melanoidines and exhibits high salinity which translates into high electrical conductivity the treated wastewater also contains dissolved solids that are inorganic and may constitute the majority of the pollutants in the wastewater 80 the fixed solids in the wastewater correspond to cations and anions such as na k cl so4 2 and po4 3 and the wastewater is also excessively alkaline owing to the presence of hco3 the biodegradability index is low because of the large quantity of inert cod established technologies such as biological treatments are no longer able to remove persistent compounds 8 furthermore environmental regulations and their enforcement have become more stringent so there is growing interest in the development of new treatment methods a combination of advanced oxidation processes aops and advanced electrochemical systems has been developed for the removal of persistent organic pollutants and represent an attractive alternative to conventional methods 9 15 these techniques involve the use and generation of strong oxidant species o3 h2o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh 10 12 14 a highly reactive species that acts as a higher oxidant to destroy refractory compounds and has an electrochemical oxidation potential eop of 2 80 v its attack mode is non selective it can operate at normal temperature and pressure and it can oxidize almost all materials in wastewater 4 consequently electrochemical aops have been successfully employed for the treatment of leachates 16 17 municipal wastewater 18 and dyes 19 20 a more recent classification of these techniques includes electrocoagulation which uses sacrificial iron or aluminum anodes to induce coagulation or flotation of pollutants anodic oxidation and electroperoxidation for in situ and bulk pollutant oxidation by oh physisorbed h2o2 and o3 oxidants and electro fenton treatment and peroxicoagulation which exploits the fenton reaction reaction 1 between h2o2 produced at the cathode and fe2 added or produced at the anode to oxidize and coagulate pollutants 21 however although renewable energy sources can be incorporated into these systems 22 all the methods mentioned above require external energy and expensive electrode materials such as boron doped diamond pt and iro2 making these treatments an expensive option 1 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh o h given the current global energy crisis galvanic systems such as those used in cathodic and anodic protection employed to prevent the corrosion of metals that do not require external energy to produce metal ions have been developed as an alternative method to treat wastewater the principles of these systems may be explained by considering the corrosion of a typical metal m in an acidic environment the electrochemical reactions that occur are basically the dissolution of the metal and the evolution of hydrogen gas 2 m m n ne 3 2 h 2 e h 2 g the active metal serves as a sacrificial anode in the electrochemical couple as it is consumed oxidation and dissolution of the sacrificial metal is faster in a galvanic couple than they would be for an individual metal likewise if the mn species needs to be controlled the cathodic anodic area can be optimized 23 consequently in previous studies galvanic reactors have been investigated for the treatment of industrial wastewater containing hexavalent chromium in these studies the ratio of anode cathode areas and ph were optimized leading to excellent results i e the removal of 100 92 50 and 38 cr vi chlorides nitrates and sulfates respectively in batch mode 24 accordingly the aim of this study was to propose and evaluate an industrial wastewater treatment method involving the application of a galvanic system and a novel galvanic fenton gf system to remove the organic matter from industrial effluent iron copper electrodes were proposed as the anode cathode in both systems these electrodes produce fe2 ions that in the galvanic system induce coagulation of organic matter and in the gf system oxidize organic matter through the fenton reaction that occurs upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide it is important to mention that neither the galvanic nor the gf systems require energy unlike the analogous electro fenton system peroxicoagulation and electroperoxidation thus the system is inexpensive sustainable self contained and portable for operation in remote locations 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization of wastewater a combined sample was obtained from six simple samples of wastewater taken before the primary clarifiers in an industrial wastewater treatment plant that receives the effluent from 190 factories in different sectors including chemical food and pharmaceutical manufacturers slaughterhouses municipal waste sources and

designed for use in a 1 l glass cell considering the following criteria a a monopolar system comprising parallel carbon steel sae 1010 electrodes as sacrificial iron anodes and electrolytic copper as cathodes was used the electrodes were conditioned previously by sanding and polishing with alumina followed by washing with distilled water and immediate drying b an inter electrode gap of 2 mm c an electrode area liquid volume ratio suggested by holt 26 of 124 500 cm2 cm3 and d an optimum copper iron area ratio of 3 5 1 as reported by lugo et al 23 to maintain the iron corrosion rate fig 1 shows the experimental set up a 0 5 l sample of the selected industrial wastewater was added to a batch system so that it entirely covered the electrodes the treatment was carried out over 4 h the operational ph values evaluated were 2 8 4 0 and 5 0 in the course of the treatment time aliquots were taken for monitor control parameters such as cod toc color and turbidity finally the whole procedure was performed in triplicate 2 3 gf treatment for the gf treatment galvanic design volume time and ph values were investigated to promote the generation of oh radicals and induce the fenton reaction thus achieving a gf treatment hydrogen peroxide jt baker brand reagent grade h2o2 at 30 density 1 1 g ml was supplied to the system and the amount of h2o2 used was calculated as a function of the ratio suggested by ince and tezcanli 27 i e 1 g of cod 0 03125 mol of o2 0 0625 mol of h2o2 according to this protocol 39 236 g h2o2 would be necessary to oxidize the organic matter present per liter of raw wastewater however only 7840 mg l h2o2 was applied for the 408 mg fe l that was produced galvanically thereby maintaining an optimum ratio of 19 1 the h2o2 was dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min during the 120 min of treatment cod toc color and turbidity parameters were also monitored 2 4 hydrogen peroxide treatment considering the optimal conditions determined for the gf system 7840 mg l hydrogen peroxide was added to 0 5 l of the selected industrial wastewater and the peroxide was dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min during a treatment time of 120 min experiments were carried out at ph 2 8 in triplicate and control parameters such as cod toc color and turbidity were determined this experiment was performed as a control to contrast the effects of the galvanic and gf processes 2 5 sludge characterization and quantification samples were analyzed by sem and x ray microanalysis analysis was performed on a jeol jsm5900 lv microscope to observe the composition and configuration of the sludge structure sem provides images of rough materials with a resolution of fractions of a micrometer whereas eds offers in situ elemental analysis secondary electron imaging sei was employed in low vacuum mode at 15 kv voltage 20 pa pressure and 100 500 and 1000 magnifications samples were placed over aluminum tape and uncoated for the test a semi quantitative analysis of the elemental composition was performed by eds with an oxford probe 2 6 ftir and fluorescence spectroscopy to gain better insight into the transformation characteristics of organic pollutants in raw industrial wastewater galvanic gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments were performed and the dry sludges were analyzed by ftir spectroscopy which has been widely used to characterize organic compounds and ammonium in wastewater and to determine the general functional groups present a shimadzu ftir spectrophotometer ir affinity is was used and spectra were obtained in the 4500 450 cm 1 wavenumber range in addition industrial wastewater samples and treated effluents were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy to characterize the dissolved organic matter dom fluorescence analysis was performed on each sample following the procedure proposed by westerhoff et al 28 for this analysis a perkin elmer model ls55 spectrometer was used in the sample characterization 45 individual emission spectra were recorded at excitation wavelengths λex between 200 and 450 nm and emission wavelengths λem between 280 and 550 nm the samples were analyzed at a concentration 2 mg l cod adjusted by dilution and at ph 3 adjusted by the addition of 4 m sulfuric acid to minimize the potential for metal binding and subsequent fluorescence a 290 nm filter was used in all analyses to eliminate raleigh peak light interference in the same way the excitation emission matrix eem of distilled water was obtained and subtracted from the eem of the raw and treated industrial wastewater samples to eliminate interference caused by raman peaks 2 7 toxicity to compare the toxicity of the raw and treated wastewater a bioassay with lettuce seeds lactuca sativa based on protocols for short term toxicity screening of hazardous waste sites 29 was performed batches of 20 lettuce seeds l sativa lot 1409 vita brand were distributed in 90 15 mm plastic petri dishes over filter paper with 4 ml of each sample raw galvanic gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments at concentrations of 0 1 1 10 50 and 100 in triplicate the different concentrations were achieved by dilution with reconstituted hard water 25 which was prepared by dissolving 2 4 g mgso4 3 84 g nahco3 and 0 16 g kcl in 19 l distilled water and adding 2 4 g caso4 2h2o dissolved in 1 l distilled water the prepared petri dishes were protected from light inside a plastic bag and were incubated for 120 h at 20 c as a first approach to determining the ec50 median effective concentration once the results were evaluated new concentrations were prepared and incubated according to the number of germinated seeds at each concentration the radicle and hypocotyl lengths were measured and phytotoxic indicators or abnormal growth such as necrosis or poorly developed absorbent hair were assessed abnormal germination seeds emergence of cotyledons or both cotyledons and hypocotyl without radicles were considered non germinated to validate the test a control was prepared with reconstituted hard water and 90 germination was considered effective considering the visible appearance of a radicle 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of industrial wastewater table 1 shows the physicochemical characterization results for the raw wastewater the industrial wastewater has a slightly alkaline ph of 7 95 an alkalinity of 2991 5 mg l caco3 and an electrical conductivity of 12 94 ms which indicates that the water contains a high concentration of dissolved solids 10150 mg l the inorganic ions present are characterized as chlorides 2950 1 mg l sulfates 1139 mg l and nitrates 16 54 mg l the wastewater exhibits high concentrations of cations mainly sodium 2588 mg l and potassium 258 mg l in addition the organic matter is represented by a total cod of 5264 mg l bod of 2116 mg l toc of 1744 mg l turbidity of 1838 fau and a bi of 0 28 indicating low biodegradability nitrogenous matter and total phosphorus are present at 238 mg l and 860 mg l respectively 3 2 gt ph is a key parameter for wastewater treatment and the pollutant removal efficiency decreases by either increasing or decreasing the ph of the solution the effect of ph in the galvanic treatment was investigated the response variables investigated were cod toc and color removal efficiencies and the results are summarized in fig 2 as can be seen the efficiencies for color and cod increase in response to initial ph at ph 2 8 the following maximum removal efficiencies were obtained 59 color 21 6 soluble cod and 10 toc fig 3 shows the kinetics behavior of the galvanic system the above behavior is typical of electrocoagulation treatments in which higher cod removal percentages are obtained under acidic conditions 30 in the case of galvanic systems acidic conditions are necessary for iron corrosion and the release of fe2 into the bulk solution thus ph 2 8 was adopted as the optimum ph for subsequent kinetics analysis and gf treatments the experimental data were fitted to zero first and second order kinetic models to calculate the kinetic constants and correlation coefficients by nonlinear regression originpro 8 program the best correlation coefficients were obtained with the second order model with correlation coefficients values higher than 0 95 for cod and color however for the toc data the correlation coefficient was around 0 7 owing to the large standard deviation of the experimental data according to this model the rate constant for color degradation k2 is higher than those for cod and toc degradation while the rate constant for tic removal is negative which could be due to mineralization of the organic matter co2 the gt process involves different chemical and physical mechanisms generally in a galvanic system anodic metal dissolution occurs and a number of cations coagulant species and hydroxides are formed that destabilize and coagulate suspended particles or precipitate and adsorb dissolved contaminants in the current study because iron electrodes were used as sacrificial anodes the anodic oxidation of fe0 s to fe2 occurred eq 4 and the reduction of cu2 to cu0 on the cathode occurred simultaneously eq 5 additionally due to the enhanced polarization of the electrodes by the proposed area relationship the simultaneous reduction of water eq 6 evolution of hydrogen eq 7 and possibly the reduction of iron eq 8 are involved anodic reaction 4 fe 0 fe 2 2 e cathodic reactions 5 c u aq 2 2 e cu s 6 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 h 2 g 2 oh 7 2h aq 2e h2 g 8 fe 3 e fe 2 the reactions in the solution eq 4 according to the equilibrium diagram show that fe2 is present at acidic ph however ph 3 8 corresponds to the formation of hydroxides eqs 9 and 10 therefore the main mechanism for the removal of contaminants by gt is most likely coagulation flocculation this mechanism has also been observed by fan and ma 31 who used a fe cu system to pretreat mixed wastewater industry and urban sewage their reports indicated that 20 cod removal was achieved and the bi was consequently increased bulk solution reactions 9 fe 2 2 oh fe oh 2 10 4 fe oh 2 2 h 2 o o 2 4 fe oh 3 conversely only 36 nitrates and 12 total nitrogen are removed during 4 h treatment time it is also important to note that the bi increases from 0 4 to 0 45 table 1 3 3 gf treatment it has been reported in the literature that the fenton and electro fenton processes are more efficient in acidic mediaum for most treated effluents and that ph is an important parameter for a successful treatment most studies have reported that the optimum ph for the fenton process is around 2 8 3 because iron species commonly begin to precipitate and form as ferric hydroxides at higher ph values consequently the oxidation efficiency decreases dramatically for this reason the behavior of the galvanic system allows us to define ph 2 8 as the optimum value to evaluate the gf process fig 4 shows the removal efficiencies obtained at ph 2 8 with the addition of 7840 mg l hydrogen peroxide dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min and with a h2o2 fe2 ratio of 19 1 the results indicate 76 color removal 71 soluble cod degradation and 79 toc decrease the experimental results were also fitted to zero first and second order kinetic models to calculate kinetic constants of these the second order model was the most suitable for representing the experimental data as can be seen in table 2 the kinetic rates k2 and correlation coefficients r2 for all parameters are much higher than those obtained for gt especially for color which reaches a value of 0 8749 l pt co u min as can be seen the tic increases as the toc decreases due to mineralization of the inorganic matter to understand the above behavior it is important to consider that fenton s reagent is very effective for the oxidation of a large number of hazardous and organic pollutants in this research the fenton reaction was promoted using a galvanic system fe cu which produces fe2 at the anode eq 11 as a result of the potential difference obtained in the fe cu system and the co generation of hydroxyl radicals produced by the reaction between fe2 and the added hydrogen peroxide eq 12 normally the organic substances are removed via two processes a oxidation due to the production of oh radicals eq 13 and b coagulation ascribed to the formation of ferric hydroxo complexes eqs 14 and 15 15 32 furthermore the fenton reaction could be catalyzed by fe2 reduction at the cathode eq 8 thereby increasing the rate of reaction 12 in fig 5 a diagram of the proposed mechanism of the novel gf system is presented anodic reaction 11 fe 0 fe 2 2 e bulk solution reactions 12 fe 2 h 2 o 2 h fe 3 oh h 2 o 13 rh ho r h 2 o where rh denotes organic pollutants 14 r fe 3 r fe 2 15 fe 2 ho fe 3 oh as can be seen in table 1 a bod reduction of 43 was observed and removal of 48 of the nitrates and 99 of the total phosphorous was also obtained nitrate reduction by aqueous fe2 release is possible but it has been demonstrated that in the absence of fe0 no reaction occurs between aqueous fe2 and nitrate in an acidified anoxic solution so the more probable reducing agents include fe0 or fe0 coated with iron oxides in acidic conditions 24 the copper cathode surface in the galvanic system may also contribute to the reduction of nitrates eq 16 24 16 n o 3 aq 10 h aq 8 e n h 4 aq 3 h 2 o phosphorous in aqueous solutions at ph 2 6 is present as h2po 4 according to the equilibrium diagram the h2po 4 can be reduced in gf to h2po 3 eq 17 as a result of the reducing power in the presence of the fe2 catalyst and colloidal metals 33 even though these ions can be adsorbed in the form of a complex with fe oh 2 eq 18 and can be removed by flocculation and sedimentation 31 17 h 2 p o 4 3 h 2 e h 2 p o 3 h 2 o 18 fe oh 2 2 h 2 p o 4 h 2 p o 4 ho feoh h 2 p o 4 3 4 hydrogen peroxide treatment in addition hydrogen peroxide treatment at different peroxide doses was performed according to the optimal conditions determined for the gf system 7840 mg h2o2 l dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min for 120 min of treatment and at a ph of 2 8 to observe the changes in color cod toc tic and tc in the absence of gt the results reveal lower efficiencies and correlation coefficients than those of gf for all parameters with the exception of color as shown in fig 6 the obtained removal efficiencies are 29 cod 78 color 79 bod and 52 toc with a considerably low bi of 0 08 as compared to those of the gt and gf systems the kinetics were also fitted to kinetics models and the second order model presented the best correlation coefficient with a rate constant for color of 1 1456 l ptco u min while the rate and efficiency for the cod are considerably lower the tic content increases as the toc decreases which may be attributed to the mineralization of organic matter eq 19 the oxidation rate for organic matter may be correlated with the decomposition rate of the hydrogen peroxide eq 20 19 r h 2 o 2 co 2 h 2 o 20 2 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o o 2 the results indicate the controlled oxidation of chlorides into gaseous chlorine at ph 3 chlorine can be obtained by the oxidation of acid solutions that have a sufficiently high chloride concentration after h2o2 action bicarbonates are thermodynamically stable in the presence of water and aqueous solutions at ph 5 4 however at lower ph bicarbonate is transformed into carbonic acid 3 5 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence is the result of a process that occurs in certain molecules generally polyaromatic hydrocarbons or heterocycles called fluorophores or fluorescent dyes it is widely known that industrial effluents contain a type of molecules called melanoidines and significant amounts of humic and fulvic materials that are difficult to treat 34 for this reason the fluorescence spectra of raw and treated wastewater were recorded with the aim of establishing the anthropic origin of the dom according to westerhoff et al s 28 methodology the excitation emission matrix eem was divided into five regions and the region that corresponds to raw wastewater shows three defined peaks in the ii iii and v regions associated with aromatic proteins and fulvic and humic acids respectively fig 7 and a marked shoulder in region iv that corresponds to soluble microbial byproducts table 3 shows the fluorescence intensities fis of the eems in the performed treatments the gt eem shows a decrease of 22 fi in the ii and iv regions while hydrogen peroxide treatment decreases the fi in regions ii iii iv and v by 39 45 44 and 33 respectively however gf treatment eliminates the ii region peak which corresponds to anthropogenic organic matter associated with aromatic proteins peaks in the regions iv and v decrease in fi by 67 and 42 respectively peak iii is undefined due to displacement of the coordinate λex λem and it does not disappear entirely thereby confirming the presence of natural organic matter nom and the presence of humic and fulvic acids 3 6 ftir spectroscopy according to the general characteristics of the samples it has been identified that some of the most important constituents are melanoidines which are very complex brown nitrogenous biopolymers with unknown structures that are usually formed by the reaction of the amino and carbonyl groups in the byproducts of sugar degradation they are commonly found in effluents from the fermentation and distillation of sugarcane molasses humic and fulvic acids ethanol production and yeast processing by bakers and the brewing industry 35 37 according to stevenson 38 typical ir spectra of humic and fulvic acids show the main absorption bands at 3300 cm 1 h bonded and oh groups 2900 cm 1 aliphatic ch stretching 1720 cm 1 co stretching of cooh and ketones 1630 cm 1 aromatic cc and h bonded co and 1200 1230 cm 1 co stretching and oh deformation of cooh in addition small bands are often evident at 1500 cm 1 aromatic cc and 1460 cm 1 ch deformation of ch2 or ch3 groups bands at 1635 and 1573 cm 1 which are assigned to amide group vibrations show significant changes upon treatment for example the band at 1635 cm 1 decreases upon peroxide treatment but disappears completely upon gf treatment while the band at 1573 cm 1 completely disappears for all treatments suggesting the decomposition of proteins peptides and combined amino acids as reported by zhang et al 39 finally decomposition bands centered at 1050 cm 1 related to the co stretching of aliphatic ethers and the carbon rings in cyclic compounds suggest the degradation of aromatic compounds 39 this agrees with the ir spectra shown in fig 8 obtained from the sludges of a raw wastewater b gt c hydrogen peroxide treatment and d gf treatment as shown when different treatments are applied the intensity of the bands decreases gf and hydrogen peroxide treatments result in the greatest decreases in color with 76 and 78 being achieved respectively 3 7 sem eds sem images provide information about sample morphology and the elemental composition of a solid surface is given by eds fig 9 shows different morphological images and eds spectra of the sludges from a raw b galvanic c hydrogen peroxide and d gf treatments the sludge of the raw sample fig 9a shows a uniform and defined shape while the morphological characteristics of the sludge derived from gt fig 9b shows more agglomeration and floccules of greater size than those in raw wastewater sludge which may be attributed to the iron hydroxides formed during gt the sludge derived from hydrogen peroxide treatment also shows agglomeration fig 9c in contrast the sludge resulting from gf treatment shows a large mass of mud and no well defined flocs are observed fig 9d which can be attributed to the scission of organic chains by the fenton reagent that is galvanically generated eds analyses of the raw and galvanic sludges show similar characteristics due to them containing mostly carbon which corresponds to the organic matter as well as oxygen associated with oxyanions silicon and minority atoms such as ca mg cl k and s in the case of the sludge from the treatment with peroxide an increment in oxygen content is observed owing to the residual peroxide still present in the system sludge from the gf treatment shows a clear decrease in carbon content compared to that of the original sample owing to the reduction of organic matter by the fenton reagent iron is present as a result of the enhanced fe2 electro generation in this system as expected 3 8 toxicity assessing the toxicity of the treated effluents is of major importance owing to their discharge into the lerma river and possible reuse in irrigation systems two measures of toxicity were assessed 29 for the tests which were performed on raw and treated wastewater galvanic hydrogen peroxide and gf treatments using l sativa i e percent mortality lethal effect and effect proportion sub lethal effect percent mortality i e number of non germinated seeds total number of test seeds 100 was calculated for each test dilution and this toxicity index was used to estimate ec50 values with a 95 confidence interval for each sample through probit analysis using ibm spss version 22 0 statistics software the control solution validated the test showing 95 germination ec50 values of 64 05 64 95 and 65 07 were obtained for raw wastewater gt and gf treatment effluents respectively which indicates that even though there is no reduction in toxicity for the applied treatments the toxicity does not increase and this could indicate that particularly in the gf treatment the residual h2o2 40 mg l does not affect lettuce germination conversely the large amount of residual h2o2 1570 mg l for the hydrogen peroxide treatment effluent strongly inhibits the germination of l sativa seeds with an ec50 of 29 57 table 4 shows the results of ec50 as percent concentration effect proportion e and radicle and hypocotyl length for some of the concentrations tested effect proportion e is given by t c c where t is the mean growth in the concentration tests and c is the mean growth in the control which were calculated for radicle elongation for each test the raw wastewater exhibits no toxic effects as e 0 009 which is positive t c at 0 1 concentration however when the concentration increases to 1 e 0 043 which is negative t c so the effluent is toxic at this concentration an effect on hypocotyl length decrease 9 89 mm was observed at 50 concentration the gt effluent becomes toxic at 10 concentration and the hypocotyl length decreases to 7 37 mm at 60 concentration this improvement is probably due to increased copper from electrode corrosion which can act as a vegetal micronutrient at low concentrations 40 this agrees with the gf treatment values in which the effluent shows a toxicity improvement compared to the raw wastewater as e 0 414 when the concentration increases to 50 and the hypocotyl length decreases to 9 19 mm at the same concentration the hydrogen peroxide treatment effluent shows an evident increase in radicle length 7 35 mm from the lowest concentration 0 1 which is larger than the rest of the effluents and the control itself a toxic effect is evident at 20 dilution both for e and the hypocotyl length decrease 9 28 mm the above can be explained by the dual role of h2o2 the stimulating effect of which upon seed germination and subsequent seedling vigor have been observed in a number of species this indicates that this chemical acts as a respiration stimulant resulting in the production of o2 for mitochondrial respiration and metabolic activities which accelerates the breakdown of reserve food substances and thus provides a more rapid supply of energy and materials for synthesis at the growing point 41 42 secondly h2o2 accumulation has a deleterious effect and thus the mutual relationship between the positive and negative functions depends on hydrogen peroxide concentration 43 4 conclusions the initial physicochemical characterization of the industrial wastewater revealed its high alkalinity and large inorganic load mainly in the form of sodium chlorides and sulfates besides the refractory organic matter its bi was found to be 0 28 meaning that biological treatment alone would not be effective for degradation galvanic treatment using the fe cu system allowed for the removal of 12 6 cod 7 6 bod 59 color and 10 toc however the bi remained similar changing only from 0 28 to 0 21 and 36 nitrates and 12 total phosphorous were removed during 4 h treatment at ph 2 8 hydrogen peroxide treatment was conducted with a dosing of 7840 mg l at 1 5 10 and 15 min during a treatment time of 120 min at ph 2 8 and the removal efficiencies were 29 for cod 78 for color 79 for bod and 52 for toc however the bi was significantly low at 0 02 and toxicity was increased to an ec50 of 29 5 a synergistic effect was obtained with gf treatment at ph 2 8 upon adding 7840 mg l hydrogen peroxide dosed at 1 5 10 and 15 min and 408 mg l fe ratio 19 1 obtaining a reduction of 76 for color 71 for soluble cod 43 for bod 79 for toc and 48 for nitrates the bi increased to 0 55 as can be seen the gf system is a promising option for industrial wastewater treatment it does not require energy enhances effluent biodegradability does not increase its toxicity and reduces its sub lethal effects no fluorescence by anthropogenic organic matter was detected but most importantly the removal efficiencies may be comparable with those of the analogous electro fenton process acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the centro interamericano de recursos del agua cira for its support in the realization of the experiments and conacyt for providing a

14574,this work presents the first attempt in the treatment of high strength organic wastewater at organic loading rate olr up to 30 kg m3 d in an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor the reactor was operated for 100 days divided into two main periods according to the applied olr in the first period aerobic granules were cultivated and allowed to stabilize at an olr of 10 2 2 1 kg cod m3 d from the reactor start up until day 41 in the second period from day 42 to day 100 the applied olr was 27 0 3 5 kg cod m3 d stable aerobic granules of average diameter of 1 2 mm dominated the reactor after 30 days improving the settleability of the biomass the cod removal efficiency was 98 4 1 1 during the first 45 days of operation however after increasing the olr the cod removal efficiency decreased drastically to 64 4 13 7 from days 46 to 64 thereafter the reactor recovered from the shock load and the removal efficiency increased to 96 2 7 until the end of the 100 days the effect of cod n ratio was investigated for the treatment of nitrogen deficient wastewater it was shown that under severe nitrogen deficient conditions cod n ratio 70 the cod removal efficiency was 64 4 13 7 a cod n ratio of 25 30 should be attained to ensure that there is no limitation in heterotrophic growth the results from this study indicate that aerobic granulation can provide a promising high strength organic wastewater treatment technology keywords aerobic granular sludge high strength organic wastewater nutrients removal organics removal 1 introduction with the continuous industrial development massive quantities of high strength organic wastewater are produced which could cause a major threat to human and environmental health the definition of high strength organic wastewater is not clear cut and it is widely accepted that high strength organic wastewaters were identified as those of cod chemical oxygen demand concentration greater than 4000 mg l 1 3 the treatment of high strength organic wastewaters proves challenging due to the presence of excessive amounts of organics moreover high strength organic wastewater typically requires nutrients adjustment and higher removal efficiency processes to meet the constantly rising environmental standards on treated effluents for many years high strength organic wastewaters were preferably treated in an anaerobic reactor producing low surplus sludge and at the same time utilizing the elevated level of organic content for energy generation 3 4 however in practical applications anaerobic treatment suffers from low growth rate of the microorganisms high sensitivity to toxic loadings low temperatures ph changes and fluctuations in environmental conditions a low settling rate of biomass and the need for post treatment of the noxious anaerobic effluent which often contains ammonium ion nh4 and hydrogen sulfide hs 2 3 5 6 moreover complete stabilization of high strength organic matter cannot be achieved anaerobically and this results in effluent quality that usually fails to comply with the standards 7 an aerobic post treatment is usually required to bring the water quality within regulations depending on the desired end use 8 during the last 25 years aerobic granulation has evolved and proved to be one of the most efficient biological wastewater treatment technologies such granules are spherical aggregates of microorganisms without any media for attachment offering dense and strong microbial structure good settling ability high biomass retention tolerance to toxicity and resistance to shock loading and can achieve rapid treatment of wastewater in a smaller footprint when compared to floccular sludge cultures 9 25 53 aerobic granulation offers the unique advantage of the ability to be developed in a much shorter time compared to 2 8 months for anaerobic granules 26 and the potential for simultaneous organics and nutrients removal 16 22 27 28 this was attributed to the spatial structure of aerobic granule allowing for the co existence of aerobic and anaerobic populations 22 29 31 aerobic granulation has been reported to withstand olr up to 15 kg cod m3 d in sequencing batch reactors sbrs 22 32 33 with the utilization of support material such as shell carriers granules could withstand olr up to 15 kg cod m3 d 34 in a 330 day study using aerobic granular sludge in treating effluent from a seafood industry at olr of 2 13 kg cod m3 d it was reported that aerobic granules could withstand olr only up to 4 4 kg scod m3 d without disintegration 35 adav et al 19 reported that aerobic granules disintegrated at olr of 21 3 kg scod m3 long et al 36 reported that aerobic granules lost stability at olr of 18 kg m3 d due to the increase of the granule size which resulted in the formation of massive dead cells inside the core of the granules causing disintegration of the granular structures in addition despite the report that the formation of aerobic granules is independent of the substrate concentration the size of aerobic granules slightly increased with an increase in substrate concentration while granule strength decreased with substrate concentration 37 it was indicated that aerobic granules can withstand 5000 mg cod l however high aeration rate of 3 2 cm s is required at olr 15 kg m3 d while aeration rate of 2 4 cm s can provide stable granules up to 9 kg m3 d olr 38 adav et al 19 reported that the critical cod values for granule disintegration was 3000 4000 mg l and that the tested isolates did not grow in the medium at cod 3000 mg l the long time required for granule formation and maturation and granule disintegration remain unresolved problems of the aerobic granulation technology 25 39 moreover the present available information with respect to the favorable operational conditions is not sufficient for predictable startup and operation of aerobic granular sludge reactor for treatment of high strength organic wastewater therefore this work aimed at examining aerobic granule cultivation characteristics and performance for the treatment of high strength organic wastewater particularly nutrient deficient substrate this work is designed to achieve the following three objectives 1 to evaluate the performance in terms of treatment efficiency as well as granules physical properties and stability under high olrs 2 to investigate the effect of cod n ratio on reactor performance and 3 to examine the effect of pulse feeding and starvation conditions on granule stability under high olrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and seed sludge one cylindrical acrylic reactor with an internal diameter of 150 mm and a working volume of 16 l was used as the sbr to cultivate aerobic granules aeration was provided by means of fine air bubble diffusers located at the bottom of the reactor with an air flow rate of 28 l min which resulted in a superficial upflow air velocity of 2 8 cm s influent was introduced through a port located at the bottom of the reactor while effluent was discharged through an outlet port placed at intermediate height of the reactor resulting in a volumetric exchange ratio of 56 the reactor was operated at 4 h per cycle sequentially influent filling 8 min aeration settling and effluent withdrawal 2 min the settling time was decreased from 20 min to 8 min in cultivation stage first week of operation with the remaining being aeration stage return activated sludge ras from pine creek wastewater treatment plant in calgary was used as inoculum to start up the system the seed sludge was greyish brown in colour and had a suspended solids ss concentration of 5 1 g l sludge volume index svi of 155 5 ml g and a mean particle size of 115 μm 2 2 media the synthetic wastewater consisted of sodium acetate as sole carbon source and the composition of wastewater was as follows naac anhydrous 2930 mg l nh4cl 350 mg l k2hpo4 30 mg l kh2po4 25 mg l and other necessary elements were similar to that detailed elsewhere 29 this resulted in an initial substrate cod concentration of 2600 450 mg l and an olr of 10 2 2 1 kg cod m3 d for the reactor after 41 days from start up the cod concentration was increased to 7500 600 mg l by proportionally adjusting the concentration of naac to attain higher olrs of 27 0 3 5 kg cod m3 d nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were kept constant until 60 days of operation from 60 days to the end of the experiment nitrogen and phosphorus were supplemented at a cod n p ratio of 100 2 5 0 3 to meet the minimal growth requirements the experiment was conducted at room temperature 18 2 c 2 3 analytical methods biomass characteristics mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and svi30 were analyzed in accordance with the standard methods 56 for the measurement of sludge svi5 5 min settling time was used instead of the 30 min used for the analysis of svi30 as described in liu et al 54 influent and

characteristics of granules 3 1 1 settling property the settleability of sludge is indicated by the sludge volume index svi in general flocculent sludge exhibits svi values 120 ml g while granular biomass offers considerably reduced svi values 50 ml g 12 55 the profile of svi showed a declining trend during the operation as shown in fig 1 a after 10 days of operation granules started to be observed in the reactor however the biomass settleability fluctuated during the first three weeks of operation after four weeks from start up stable and mature granules dominated improving the settleability of sludge svi dropped to below 40 ml gss and the svi5 started approaching svi30 i e no compression settling confirming stable granulation in the reactor it was highlighted that a granular system is practically identified when the difference between svi5 and svi30 is within 10 26 54 3 1 2 biomass concentration the mlss maintained a rising overall profile during the operation as can been seen in fig 1 b the biomass concentration in the reactor fluctuated between 3000 to 5000 mg tss l in the first 25 days of operation it increased rapidly after the 26th day and reached a maximum value of 25 000 mg tss l on the 65th day after 70 days of operation the biomass concentration dropped due to the formation of flocculent sludge as a response to the rapid biomass growth resulting from the high cod concentration however the strong selection pressure imposed by the short settling time resulted in the biomass with slower settling properties being washed out of the system the biomass concentration stabilized after 78 days at around 12 000 mg tss l until the end of the 100 days experiment 3 1 3 granule size distribution fig 1 c shows the granule size and particle size distribution with time digital camera images of granule development are shown in fig 2 a transition from floccular sludge to dense sludge was observed starting from the third day of operation at day 6 granules started to form and the reactor became predominantly granular after 13 days i e mean size of granules 200 μm with a clear and spherical outline at steady state the compact granules had an average diameter in the range of 952 1330 μm when particle size was analysed using the mastersizer when the granule size increased to more than 2000 μm their digital camera images were analyzed for granule size using imagej an image processing program the average diameter of granules from the imagej analyses was 1 9 0 2 mm from 50 days until the end of the 100 day experiment the granulation percent can be determined following the equation 100 svi30 svi5 33 after 28 days of the reactor start up the granulation percentage was 95 2 7 however after 80 days of operation the granulation percentage decreased to about 55 this can be attributed to the high cod concentration which stimulated rapid bacterial growth that out competed the aggregation process of biomass resulting in the coexistence of granules and dense flocs nevertheless svi5 and svi30 were consistently below 60 and 35 ml g respectively from day 80 until the end of the experiment 3 1 4 microbial community composition the microbial community composition of mature granules after 80 days of operation was analyzed and compared to that of the seed sludge the results showed that betaproteobacteria was the most abundant class 87 9 in the aerobic granules compared to 26 9 in the seed sludge the dominant genera in the aerobic granules belongs to the family rhodocyclaceae thaurera 87 6 fig 3 these taxa are well known extracellular polymeric substances eps producers and heterotrophs 42 the betaproteobacteria is also the most abundant class in municipal wastewater treatment plants worldwide largely responsible for organic and nutrients removal 43 45 thauera sp was also reported to be polysaccharide producers for binding together the growing cells 46 however adav et al 19 reported that the role of polysaccharides on granule stability should be minimal and that the decrease in protein productivity by isolates under high olr indicated that the eps structure of granules was weak leading to granule breakdown in the present study the increase in the cod concentration resulted in the active growing and dominance of thauera this heterotrophic and polysaccharide producing genus improved cod consumption yet reduced the aggregation potential of biomass which explains the coexistence of granular and floccular biomass during this stage of the experiment 3 2 reactor performance and removal efficiencies the sbr was operated for 100 days where experiment was divided into two main periods according to the applied olr in the first period the applied olr had a value of 10 2 2 1 kg cod m3 d which was implemented from the beginning of the experimental period until day 41 in the second period from day 42 until the end of the operational period the applied olr was 27 0 3 5 kg cod m3 d fig 4 depicts the profiles of cod ammonia and phosphate removal performances of the sbr throughout the entire period of operation during the first 45 days of operation the cod removal efficiency was 98 4 1 1 however after increasing the olr doubled at the beginning of second period the cod removal efficiency decreased drastically to 64 4 13 7 from days 46 to 64 thereafter the reactor recovered from the shock load and the removal efficiency increased to 96 2 7 until the end of the 100 days the effect of cod n ratio was investigated in this study to evaluate the feasibility of treating high strength organic and nitrogen deficient wastewater using aerobic granulation during the cultivation phase and the first period of the study from the beginning until day 41 nitrogen was supplemented to ensure that there was no limitation in heterotrophic growth at a cod n ratio of 25 30 after granulation the nh4 n removal was consistently above 92 when the cod concentration increased in the second period of the experiment the cod n ratio increased to over 100 cod n range of 70 113 no nh4 n was detected 0 015 mg nh3 n l in the effluent while cod removal was detrimentally affected this indicated that under these severe nitrogen deficient conditions the heterotrophic growth was limited moreover at an average olr of 27 kg cod m3 d combined with high cod n ratios of 40 70 the granules started disintegrating into fluffy and viscous flocs yet no low filamentous organisms were detected under the microscope when nitrogen was supplemented after day 60 to maintain a cod n ratio of 30 40 the biomass showed rapid recovery in terms of cod removal efficiency exceeding 96 while maintaining undetectable nh4 n levels in the effluent until the end of the 100 days of the experiment comparable results were found by kocaturk and erguder 33 where a high and stable cod removal efficiency of 94 1 and 93 3 were obtained at cod n ratios of 20 and 30 respectively it was demonstrated that high olr 4 12 kg cod m3 d cod tan total ammonia nitrogen ratios 10 30 and influent cod concentrations 2000 6000 mg l favored heterotrophic bacteria growth and that the dominancy of heterotrophic bacteria increased the biomass content in the reactor and provided resistance to ammonia inhibition on the other hand it was highlighted that while the cod removal efficiency was not affected the structural integrity of the granules deteriorated and the reactor had fluffy and sticky flocs at cod tan ratio of 30 33 the profile of phosphate removal showed a very similar trend to that of cod with phosphate being completely removed throughout the 100 days of operation except for days 47 60 when olr exceeded 30 kg cod m3 d as mentioned earlier phosphorus was supplemented to meet the need for heterotrophic growth of microorganisms during the start up cod p ratio was 100 0 5 and after 40 days it increased to 100 0 3 since the presence of cations was believed to play a major role in phosphorus precipitation inside the granules during reactor start up the molar ratio of cations to phosphorus at startup was 0 57 0 45 and 0 2 for ca mg and fe respectively these ratios are comparable to those reported by stubbé 47 in full scale reactors 3 3 pollutants degradation and biomass activity in sbr cycle reactor performance and degradation profiles of cod nh3 n no3 n and no2 n during an sbr cycle was also investigated on the 40th day of operation to determine the substrate depletion behavior during the cycle analysis the dissolved oxygen do concentration within the bulk was measured to identify the feast and famine phases the test was conducted at an influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l corresponding to an olr of 13 kg cod m3 d dosed under anaerobic fast feeding 8 min strategy from fig 5 a a rapid decrease in cod concentration was experienced following an approximate zero order consumption rate for external substrate after 90 min the cod concentration decreased by about 97 and remained almost constant until the end of the cycle indicating the occurrence of a famine phase controversial results have been broadly reported in the literature regarding the influence of feeding strategy and implementation of a periodic starvation time in many granulation studies anaerobic feeding was adopted to ensure the consumption of easily biodegradable substrate such as acetate by pao phosphate accumulating organisms or gao glycogen accumulating organisms bacteria and its conversion to storage polymers to be used during the aerobic phase and thus maintain a relatively low growth rate favoring the granule stability 48 49 however in many instances high strength organic wastewaters are deficient in nutrients and require supplementing nitrogen and phosphorus to avoid limitation in heterotrophic bacterial growth pulse feeding of substrate was reported in early granulation studies to be preferred over continuous feeding as it ensures the penetration of substrate into the granule depth as opposed to continuous feeding where substrate penetration is minimal and thus limiting the cell growth 12 in the absence of anaerobic feeding alternating feast and famine conditions is believed to play a key role in granule stability during the feast period the organic matter is oxidized and stored inside bacterial cells as poly hydroxyalkanoates phas while during the famine period the bacteria grow on the stored compounds this periodic starvation has a strong effect on cell hydrophobicity which is a key factor on the formation of aggregates 8 12 15 from the perspective of quorum sensing extended starvation periods stimulate the production of eps with large molecular weight short starvation period could accelerate granulation while long starvation period was favorable to granule stability therefore a combination of different starvation periods was proposed to achieve aerobic granulation effectively where short starvation period could be adopted at the beginning of aerobic granulation to accelerate formation of granules while starvation period can be prolonged to enhance granule stability 50 di bella and torregrossa 51 reported successful simultaneous organics and nitrogen removal in a controlled feast famine sbr operation where a relatively large granule size 1 5 mm remained stable for over 100 days of operation tay et al 15 reported a starvation period of around 75 of the aeration period at an olr of 6 kg m3 d lópez palau et al 8 stated that the optimal conditions are accomplished when the famine period lasts twice longer than feast period in this study the feast condition lasted only for 37 of the duration of the sbr cycle starvation time of 60 of the whole aeration period the microbial activity in terms of specific oxygen uptake rate sour was determined in batch cultures incubated at the same substrate as the feed wastewater by measuring the do at time intervals of 5 min over a 4 h period and calculated by dividing the oxygen consumption rate by vss concentration from fig 5 a the sour range for the sbr cycle ranged from 11 24 mg o2 g vss h the relatively low sour and high do also confirm the depletion of substrate after 90 min of the sbr cycle it was illustrated that the transition from feast to famine was directly related to an increase in the do concentration 12 8 in fact during the feast period the do in the reactor was low 75 air saturation due to the oxygen consumption for acetate degradation after 90 min when nearly all external substrate was consumed cod dropped from 2100 to 88 mg l the do immediately increased to almost 100 air saturation fig 5b and the sour dropped to below 15 mg o2 g vss h fig 5a likewise chen et al 52 found that at an olr of 12 kg cod m3 d the maximum sour was around 23 mg o2 g vss h while it dropped to below 5 mg o2 g vss h at the end of the 240 min cycle the decreased bioactivity at the end of the cycle was believed to be due to the famine conditions and that the stored substrate in the form of polymers in the feast conditions are consumed during the famine conditions for endogenous processes only the ph increased drastically due to the oxidation of sodium acetate where the ph increased from 7 0 in the influent wastewater to 8 9 at the start of aeration and reached 9 1 at the end of the cycle as shown in fig 5 b fig 5 c shows the variation of cod ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrate during an sbr cycle of an influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l corresponding to an olr of 13 kg cod m3 and cod n p ratio of 100 2 8 1 it indicates ammonia nitrogen deficit was before cod deficit this indicates that nitrogen deficiency may have limited cod degradation moreover neither nitrates nor nitrites were detected which indicates that no nitrifiers were present and that the ammonia nitrogen removal was due to heterotrophic assimilation moreover partial ammonia removal can be attributed to ammonia stripping due to the high ph 4 conclusions treatment of high strength organic wastewater in agsbr was investigated aerobic granules were cultivated at an olr of 10 2 2 1 kg cod m3 d stressed substrate loading accelerated the formation of aerobic granules and the reactor was granule dominated after 2 weeks from start up after granulation the biomass properties and system performance improved significantly where svi decreased to below 50 ml g and the cod removal efficiency was consistently above 98 for over 40 days when the applied olr was increased to 27 0 3 5 kg cod m3 the cod removal efficiency decreased to 64 4 13 7 from days 46 to 64 thereafter the reactor recovered from the shock load and the removal efficiency increased to 96 2 7 until the end of the 100 days experiment findings from this study show that cod n ratio of 25 30 should be attained to ensure that there is no limitation in heterotrophic growth moreover pulse feeding could be used without affecting the stability of granules when the influent wastewater is deficient in nutrients under favorable cultivation and operational conditions aerobic granulation can provide a promising high strength organic wastewater treatment technology furthermore it might be advantageous in the treatment of high strength organics to allow for the presence of dense floccular sludge and small size granules to avoid mass transfer limitation inside the large size granule to enhance the degradation capability and removal efficiency of the biomass combined strong hydraulic selection pressure such as short cycle time and short settling time with high olr can be considered the fastest and the simplest granulation strategy as the washout of flocculent biomass led to an immediate exponential growth of biomass aggregates after successful formation periodic starvation can enhance granule stability and control granules size and integrity further research is needed to optimize the operating conditions to achieve long term stable aerobic granular system with high treatment efficiency for high strength organic wastewaters acknowledgement this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada 
14574,this work presents the first attempt in the treatment of high strength organic wastewater at organic loading rate olr up to 30 kg m3 d in an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor the reactor was operated for 100 days divided into two main periods according to the applied olr in the first period aerobic granules were cultivated and allowed to stabilize at an olr of 10 2 2 1 kg cod m3 d from the reactor start up until day 41 in the second period from day 42 to day 100 the applied olr was 27 0 3 5 kg cod m3 d stable aerobic granules of average diameter of 1 2 mm dominated the reactor after 30 days improving the settleability of the biomass the cod removal efficiency was 98 4 1 1 during the first 45 days of operation however after increasing the olr the cod removal efficiency decreased drastically to 64 4 13 7 from days 46 to 64 thereafter the reactor recovered from the shock load and the removal efficiency increased to 96 2 7 until the end of the 100 days the effect of cod n ratio was investigated for the treatment of nitrogen deficient wastewater it was shown that under severe nitrogen deficient conditions cod n ratio 70 the cod removal efficiency was 64 4 13 7 a cod n ratio of 25 30 should be attained to ensure that there is no limitation in heterotrophic growth the results from this study indicate that aerobic granulation can provide a promising high strength organic wastewater treatment technology keywords aerobic granular sludge high strength organic wastewater nutrients removal organics removal 1 introduction with the continuous industrial development massive quantities of high strength organic wastewater are produced which could cause a major threat to human and environmental health the definition of high strength organic wastewater is not clear cut and it is widely accepted that high strength organic wastewaters were identified as those of cod chemical oxygen demand concentration greater than 4000 mg l 1 3 the treatment of high strength organic wastewaters proves challenging due to the presence of excessive amounts of organics moreover high strength organic wastewater typically requires nutrients adjustment and higher removal efficiency processes to meet the constantly rising environmental standards on treated effluents for many years high strength organic wastewaters were preferably treated in an anaerobic reactor producing low surplus sludge and at the same time utilizing the elevated level of organic content for energy generation 3 4 however in practical applications anaerobic treatment suffers from low growth rate of the microorganisms high sensitivity to toxic loadings low temperatures ph changes and fluctuations in environmental conditions a low settling rate of biomass and the need for post treatment of the noxious anaerobic effluent which often contains ammonium ion nh4 and hydrogen sulfide hs 2 3 5 6 moreover complete stabilization of high strength organic matter cannot be achieved anaerobically and this results in effluent quality that usually fails to comply with the standards 7 an aerobic post treatment is usually required to bring the water quality within regulations depending on the desired end use 8 during the last 25 years aerobic granulation has evolved and proved to be one of the most efficient biological wastewater treatment technologies such granules are spherical aggregates of microorganisms without any media for attachment offering dense and strong microbial structure good settling ability high biomass retention tolerance to toxicity and resistance to shock loading and can achieve rapid treatment of wastewater in a smaller footprint when compared to floccular sludge cultures 9 25 53 aerobic granulation offers the unique advantage of the ability to be developed in a much shorter time compared to 2 8 months for anaerobic granules 26 and the potential for simultaneous organics and nutrients removal 16 22 27 28 this was attributed to the spatial structure of aerobic granule allowing for the co existence of aerobic and anaerobic populations 22 29 31 aerobic granulation has been reported to withstand olr up to 15 kg cod m3 d in sequencing batch reactors sbrs 22 32 33 with the utilization of support material such as shell carriers granules could withstand olr up to 15 kg cod m3 d 34 in a 330 day study using aerobic granular sludge in treating effluent from a seafood industry at olr of 2 13 kg cod m3 d it was reported that aerobic granules could withstand olr only up to 4 4 kg scod m3 d without disintegration 35 adav et al 19 reported that aerobic granules disintegrated at olr of 21 3 kg scod m3 long et al 36 reported that aerobic granules lost stability at olr of 18 kg m3 d due to the increase of the granule size which resulted in the formation of massive dead cells inside the core of the granules causing disintegration of the granular structures in addition despite the report that the formation of aerobic granules is independent of the substrate concentration the size of aerobic granules slightly increased with an increase in substrate concentration while granule strength decreased with substrate concentration 37 it was indicated that aerobic granules can withstand 5000 mg cod l however high aeration rate of 3 2 cm s is required at olr 15 kg m3 d while aeration rate of 2 4 cm s can provide stable granules up to 9 kg m3 d olr 38 adav et al 19 reported that the critical cod values for granule disintegration was 3000 4000 mg l and that the tested isolates did not grow in the medium at cod 3000 mg l the long time required for granule formation and maturation and granule disintegration remain unresolved problems of the aerobic granulation technology 25 39 moreover the present available information with respect to the favorable operational conditions is not sufficient for predictable startup and operation of aerobic granular sludge reactor for treatment of high strength organic wastewater therefore this work aimed at examining aerobic granule cultivation characteristics and performance for the treatment of high strength organic wastewater particularly nutrient deficient substrate this work is designed to achieve the following three objectives 1 to evaluate the performance in terms of treatment efficiency as well as granules physical properties and stability under high olrs 2 to investigate the effect of cod n ratio on reactor performance and 3 to examine the effect of pulse feeding and starvation conditions on granule stability under high olrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and seed sludge one cylindrical acrylic reactor with an internal diameter of 150 mm and a working volume of 16 l was used as the sbr to cultivate aerobic granules aeration was provided by means of fine air bubble diffusers located at the bottom of the reactor with an air flow rate of 28 l min which resulted in a superficial upflow air velocity of 2 8 cm s influent was introduced through a port located at the bottom of the reactor while effluent was discharged through an outlet port placed at intermediate height of the reactor resulting in a volumetric exchange ratio of 56 the reactor was operated at 4 h per cycle sequentially influent filling 8 min aeration settling and effluent withdrawal 2 min the settling time was decreased from 20 min to 8 min in cultivation stage first week of operation with the remaining being aeration stage return activated sludge ras from pine creek wastewater treatment plant in calgary was used as inoculum to start up the system the seed sludge was greyish brown in colour and had a suspended solids ss concentration of 5 1 g l sludge volume index svi of 155 5 ml g and a mean particle size of 115 μm 2 2 media the synthetic wastewater consisted of sodium acetate as sole carbon source and the composition of wastewater was as follows naac anhydrous 2930 mg l nh4cl 350 mg l k2hpo4 30 mg l kh2po4 25 mg l and other necessary elements were similar to that detailed elsewhere 29 this resulted in an initial substrate cod concentration of 2600 450 mg l and an olr of 10 2 2 1 kg cod m3 d for the reactor after 41 days from start up the cod concentration was increased to 7500 600 mg l by proportionally adjusting the concentration of naac to attain higher olrs of 27 0 3 5 kg cod m3 d nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were kept constant until 60 days of operation from 60 days to the end of the experiment nitrogen and phosphorus were supplemented at a cod n p ratio of 100 2 5 0 3 to meet the minimal growth requirements the experiment was

by pao phosphate accumulating organisms or gao glycogen accumulating organisms bacteria and its conversion to storage polymers to be used during the aerobic phase and thus maintain a relatively low growth rate favoring the granule stability 48 49 however in many instances high strength organic wastewaters are deficient in nutrients and require supplementing nitrogen and phosphorus to avoid limitation in heterotrophic bacterial growth pulse feeding of substrate was reported in early granulation studies to be preferred over continuous feeding as it ensures the penetration of substrate into the granule depth as opposed to continuous feeding where substrate penetration is minimal and thus limiting the cell growth 12 in the absence of anaerobic feeding alternating feast and famine conditions is believed to play a key role in granule stability during the feast period the organic matter is oxidized and stored inside bacterial cells as poly hydroxyalkanoates phas while during the famine period the bacteria grow on the stored compounds this periodic starvation has a strong effect on cell hydrophobicity which is a key factor on the formation of aggregates 8 12 15 from the perspective of quorum sensing extended starvation periods stimulate the production of eps with large molecular weight short starvation period could accelerate granulation while long starvation period was favorable to granule stability therefore a combination of different starvation periods was proposed to achieve aerobic granulation effectively where short starvation period could be adopted at the beginning of aerobic granulation to accelerate formation of granules while starvation period can be prolonged to enhance granule stability 50 di bella and torregrossa 51 reported successful simultaneous organics and nitrogen removal in a controlled feast famine sbr operation where a relatively large granule size 1 5 mm remained stable for over 100 days of operation tay et al 15 reported a starvation period of around 75 of the aeration period at an olr of 6 kg m3 d lópez palau et al 8 stated that the optimal conditions are accomplished when the famine period lasts twice longer than feast period in this study the feast condition lasted only for 37 of the duration of the sbr cycle starvation time of 60 of the whole aeration period the microbial activity in terms of specific oxygen uptake rate sour was determined in batch cultures incubated at the same substrate as the feed wastewater by measuring the do at time intervals of 5 min over a 4 h period and calculated by dividing the oxygen consumption rate by vss concentration from fig 5 a the sour range for the sbr cycle ranged from 11 24 mg o2 g vss h the relatively low sour and high do also confirm the depletion of substrate after 90 min of the sbr cycle it was illustrated that the transition from feast to famine was directly related to an increase in the do concentration 12 8 in fact during the feast period the do in the reactor was low 75 air saturation due to the oxygen consumption for acetate degradation after 90 min when nearly all external substrate was consumed cod dropped from 2100 to 88 mg l the do immediately increased to almost 100 air saturation fig 5b and the sour dropped to below 15 mg o2 g vss h fig 5a likewise chen et al 52 found that at an olr of 12 kg cod m3 d the maximum sour was around 23 mg o2 g vss h while it dropped to below 5 mg o2 g vss h at the end of the 240 min cycle the decreased bioactivity at the end of the cycle was believed to be due to the famine conditions and that the stored substrate in the form of polymers in the feast conditions are consumed during the famine conditions for endogenous processes only the ph increased drastically due to the oxidation of sodium acetate where the ph increased from 7 0 in the influent wastewater to 8 9 at the start of aeration and reached 9 1 at the end of the cycle as shown in fig 5 b fig 5 c shows the variation of cod ammonia nitrogen nitrite and nitrate during an sbr cycle of an influent cod concentration of 4500 mg l corresponding to an olr of 13 kg cod m3 and cod n p ratio of 100 2 8 1 it indicates ammonia nitrogen deficit was before cod deficit this indicates that nitrogen deficiency may have limited cod degradation moreover neither nitrates nor nitrites were detected which indicates that no nitrifiers were present and that the ammonia nitrogen removal was due to heterotrophic assimilation moreover partial ammonia removal can be attributed to ammonia stripping due to the high ph 4 conclusions treatment of high strength organic wastewater in agsbr was investigated aerobic granules were cultivated at an olr of 10 2 2 1 kg cod m3 d stressed substrate loading accelerated the formation of aerobic granules and the reactor was granule dominated after 2 weeks from start up after granulation the biomass properties and system performance improved significantly where svi decreased to below 50 ml g and the cod removal efficiency was consistently above 98 for over 40 days when the applied olr was increased to 27 0 3 5 kg cod m3 the cod removal efficiency decreased to 64 4 13 7 from days 46 to 64 thereafter the reactor recovered from the shock load and the removal efficiency increased to 96 2 7 until the end of the 100 days experiment findings from this study show that cod n ratio of 25 30 should be attained to ensure that there is no limitation in heterotrophic growth moreover pulse feeding could be used without affecting the stability of granules when the influent wastewater is deficient in nutrients under favorable cultivation and operational conditions aerobic granulation can provide a promising high strength organic wastewater treatment technology furthermore it might be advantageous in the treatment of high strength organics to allow for the presence of dense floccular sludge and small size granules to avoid mass transfer limitation inside the large size granule to enhance the degradation capability and removal efficiency of the biomass combined strong hydraulic selection pressure such as short cycle time and short settling time with high olr can be considered the fastest and the simplest granulation strategy as the washout of flocculent biomass led to an immediate exponential growth of biomass aggregates after successful formation periodic starvation can enhance granule stability and control granules size and integrity further research is needed to optimize the operating conditions to achieve long term stable aerobic granular system with high treatment efficiency for high strength organic wastewaters acknowledgement this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada
