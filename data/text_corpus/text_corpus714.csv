3570,sustainable urban drainage systems suds promote environmental protection and climate resilience suds implementation in cold climates faces concerns of impaired hydrological function due to infiltration reducing frost the goal of this research was to assess the seasonal variations in infiltration and how different surface covers prevalent in and near coastal cities respond to frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw cycles a total of 28 constant head infiltration measurements were conducted over a period of 28 months in urridaholt in gardabaer iceland 64 4 18 46 n 21 54 37 11 w in a grass swale lupine and barren terrains all test locations exhibited infiltration inhibiting frost in winter whose severity increased with frequent snow and freeze thaw cycles the grass swale resisted structural deformations resulting from frost which was attributed to the high near surface porosity within the intertwined root layer and the high drainage capacity of the underlying soil the sparsely vegetated lupine and the barren area experienced severe frost heaving and cracking and soil structural collapse which led to bypass flow upon thawing the non vegetated site had 30 to 50 times lower infiltration during winter 19 mm h 1 compared to the grass swale and lupine field 630 and 890 mm h 1 respectively and twenty times lower during summer and fall 45 mm h 1 vs 1000 mm h 1 the study concludes that frequent warming and cooling renders soils particularly vulnerable to frost vegetation plays an instrumental role in maintaining the hydrological functions of suds in winter therefore the greening of urban centers is an important step towards climate resiliency plant selection and suds design criteria need to account for cold climate hydrological performance in that regard plants that limit sunlight and fully shed their vegetation in winter such as the invasive lupine can potentially contribute to frost formation and increase runoff generation keywords grass swales infiltration frozen soil suds runoff urban drainage 1 introduction climate change and urbanization have motivated a shift in urban drainage policy from a single purpose approach of reducing runoff to a multi functional approach that provides social economic and health benefits davis et al 2012 deletic and fletcher fletcher et al wong and brown 2009 decentralized infiltration based stormwater management using sustainable urban drainage systems suds has gained increased popularity in the recent decades barrett 2008 caraco and claytor fletcher et al wong and brown 2009 suds effectiveness in reducing and treating surface runoff largely relies on their infiltration capacity davis et al 2012 garcía serrana et al rujner et al 2018 one of the key concerns with the wide adoption of suds in cold climates is the potential occurrence of infiltration limiting frost fach et al 2011 khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2016 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 which can render the normally permeable surfaces non conductive bengtsson and westerström 1992 westerström 1984 yet there are also indications that bioretention systems can still perform well in freezing temperatures 80 peak flow reduction khan et al 2012 roseen et al 2009 the conflicting reports on winter infiltration and frost formation are linked to a complex interplay between the soil vegetation cover and climatic conditions fine textured compacted organic rich soils hamper infiltration and drainage hillel 1998 rawls et al 1983 while macropores and cracks formed by plant roots and freeze thaw cycles aid it beven and germann 1982 gray et al densely vegetated surfaces such as grass tend to maintain a lower soil water content higher infiltration rate and are less prone to frost formation than sparsely vegetated surfaces in rural areas van der kamp et al 2003 moreover dense vegetation accompanied with deep roots such as in deciduous forests allows for greater infiltration and less ice formation potential than dense vegetation or deep roots alone as exemplary of coniferous evergreen forests bormann and klaassen 2008 orradottir et al 2008 the type of frost and the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils are in turn largely governed by the soil moisture content at the onset of freezing al houri et al 2009 fach et al flerchinger et al 2013 more so than the freezing temperature benoit 1973 relatively dry soils and dense vegetation promote granular and porous frost while saturated soils and sparse vegetation are prone to concrete frost formation kane 1980 kane and stein 1983 stoeckeler and weitzman 1960 orradottir et al 2008 severe surface flooding occurs during sudden snowmelt events when all the filtering media pores are filled with ice or during saturated conditions bengtsson 1985 bengtsson and westerström frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw is the key cause of urban flooding in cold maritime climate andradóttir et al 2021 the repeated supply of cold liquid water from melting snow and the lack of thermal insulation from the atmospheric cooling provided by a continuous seasonal snow cover render the soils wet for extended periods and susceptible to frequent freezing and thawing zaqout and andradóttir 2021 flerchinger et al 2013 muthanna et al 2008 repeated freeze thaw in dry soils enhances the formation of preferential flow paths and near surface cracks fouli et al 2013 kane and stein 1983 baratta 2013 flerchinger et al 2013 aggregate stability may increase after the first freeze thaw cycle in wet soils while decrease as more freezing cycles occur due to ice lens and fractures formation arnalds 2015 flerchinger et al 2013 lehrsch 1998 considerable uncertainty remains on the role of freeze thaw cycles on infiltration for example infiltration was observed to increase in clayey silt with the number of freeze thaw cycles sterpi 2015 while it remained unaffected or decreased slightly in loamy sand and clayey soils fouli et al 2013 as a result of climate change more cities around the globe are predicted to experience frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw cycles dong and menzel 2020 garvelmann et al the performance of suds during frost is however still poorly understood and a limiting factor in their adoption in cold climates ekka et al 2021 fletcher et al studies that evaluated infiltration capacity during winter freezing conditions are either based on laboratory soil columns without a vegetation cover e g fach et al 2011 moghadas et al 2016 focused on sparse large rooted vegetation in bioretention cells with underdrains e g khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2016 or conducted in rural areas e g fouli et al 2013 gray et al kane and stein 1983 orradottir et al 2008 additionally no studies have comprehensively investigated the efficiency of grass swales in cold climatic conditions ekka et al 2021 urban terrains differ from their rural counterparts because of soil compaction clogging and disruption which results in inaccurate prediction of runoff volumes and peaks pitt et al 2002 therefore to successfully transition to more climate resilient cities the response of different kinds of permeable urban surfaces to maritime winter conditions needs to be better understood especially grass which constitutes a major share of green surfaces in the temperate and arctic regions kane and stein 1983 the goal of this study was to quantify the changes in infiltration between summer and winter in three different surface covers in an urban area subject to the same hydro climatological conditions for this purpose field infiltration experiments were conducted over 28 months in a grass swale specifically designed to infiltrate water and two adjacent terrains a land covered with lupine lupinus nootkatensis introduced for restoring deteriorated ecosystems vetter et al 2018 and a bare soil hereafter referred to as barren each surface cover has a different plant density and root characteristics and constitutes large areas in public or undeveloped urban areas a particular focus was on relating infiltration capacity to surface frost and structural deformations as well as soil moisture content and soil drainage the latter of which is relatively little discussed in previous infiltration experiments studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the breeam building research establishment s environmental assessment method certified residential neighborhood of urridaholt in gardabaer iceland 64 4 18 46 n 21 54 37 11 w implemented suds to preserve the pre development water cycle the study site encompasses a grass swale and two nearby surface covers in a sloping landscape fig 1 a the swale is approximately 3 m wide with a trapezoidal shape to infiltrate and convey excess runoff from private lots linearly to the downstream pond urridavatn fig 1b the swale is separated into sections by check dams to attenuate the flow on one side of the swale is a lupine field lupinus nootkatensis and on the other side a gravelly path that was paved with asphalt in february 2019 the lupine was introduced from alaska during the last century and has been used to facilitate the reclamation of degraded surfaces further uphill an area of barren soils can be found fig 1a the three surfaces at this site represent varying plant densities and different root structures and depths table 1 being located close to one another the different surfaces develop a similar thick snow cover in winter and of similar density andradóttir and zaqout unpublished data the grass swale was constructed without specific layering or an underdrain a 50 cm thick soil overlies a natural clay layer and basaltic rock the dominant soil texture class in the three tested sections of the swale was sandy loam according to usda soil textural classification usda 1987 the soil in the swale consisted of 15 20 gravel 75 82 sand and 2 5 4 fines in accordance with astm d6913 astm 2017 the soil in the lupine field was also classified as sandy loam but contained a higher portion of fines 16 5 while the sand portion was similar to the one in the swale 72 the soil bulk density and porosity were measured in the laboratory as intact soil cores were extracted at 10 cm intervals from the 30 cm soil horizon which showed a higher porosity in the grass swale than in the lupine field table 1 2 2 experimental approach many studies on soil freeze thaw cycles have been conducted in controlled incubators or growth chambers using repacked soil columns or intact mesocosms henry 2007 while providing valuable information laboratory tests underestimate field infiltration because of the artificial packing of the soil and lack of naturally formed cracks and pores due to vegetation ding et al 2019 the small volumes of the collected soils also lead to a rapid equilibrium with ambient air temperatures which causes unrealistically severe freezing and large temperature fluctuations henry 2007 field experiments in turn can account for the spatial variability of a heterogeneous terrain over different seasons ring infiltrometers are thin walled single or double open ended cylinders that are inserted in the ground and can be used to estimate the cumulative infiltration rate and the field saturated hydraulic conductivity elrick et al 1995 reynolds and elrick 1990 dane et al 2002 the approach taken in this study was to use single ring infiltrometers to assess water infiltration at the top 20 cm of soil that is prone to frost formation in a cold maritime climate the perceived advantage of using double ring infiltrometers is questionable during freezing conditions as the effectiveness of the outer ring in eliminating lateral flows is not proven except for shallow ponded depths and impractically large diameters swartzendruber and olson 1961 youngs 1987 shallow ponded water depth is not appropriate in subfreezing temperature as it increases the risk of water freezing within the ring during the experiment additionally in seasonally wet soils with high water holding capacity zaqout and andradóttir 2021 such as in this study an overestimation of the infiltration capacity due to lateral flow resulting from the capillarity of the surrounding unsaturated soil reynolds and elrick 1990 is less of a concern the small set of single infiltrometers may serve as a good indicator of whether and to which degree infiltration is reduced in winter 2 3 experimental design and procedure a total of 8 infiltration rings were installed at the study site in the summer of 2018 the infiltrometers were placed close to one another with easy access to water supply along a walking path fig 1a the rings were 22 5 cm in diameter and 40 cm in height the infiltrometers were gently hammered to establish good contact with the soil and to minimize disturbances down to 15 17 cm depths perpendicular to the slope of the soil surface a drainage hole was drilled at the bottom of each ring to prevent the accumulation of water inside in between measurements which is plugged before the commencement of a measurement four infiltration rings were added in the summer of 2019 in order to get a better representative sample in the grass swale a mesh was placed within the infiltration ring to ensure that the water poured into the ring uniformly spread over the surface an initial volume of water was added instantly at time t 0 until the water level within the ring stabilized and using a stopwatch the recording of time was started the water level or ponded depth h was maintained at approximately 5 cm by adding water continuously using graduated cylinders with volumes of 1 and 2 l the added volume was recorded every 5 min and timed using a timer the experiment was discontinued when the added volume remained constant for three consecutive iterations which occurred after approximately 45 60 min during summer and 30 45 min during winter the measurements were conducted once every 3 4 weeks to minimize the disturbance of the study site prior to each measurement before each infiltration measurement the surface water and air temperatures were measured using a handheld thermometer pictures were taken of the terrain surface within the rings the presence of surface frost was noted by visually observing the presence of ice lenses see fig 1c soil structural changes and frost heave were evaluated by measuring the distance between the pre set soil surface elevation and the surface elevation on the measurement day using a hand held measuring tape 2 4 continuous data monitoring soil conditions soil water content and temperature were measured at a grass swale located 50 m downhill of the study locations at depths from 5 to 45 cm at 10 cm intervals readings were logged using a data logger type cs650 campbell scientific inc accuracy 1 caldwell et al 2018 every 1 min similarly the adjacent lupine field was instrumented with the same instruments at 5 15 and 25 cm depths starting september 2019 a soil specific calibration was conducted in the laboratory and a linear user defined calibration equation was derived for volcanic soils e g icelandic andosols described in campbell scientific inc 2021 soil temperature measured by the local utility veitur ehf at the heiðmörk station located 10 km inland from the study site was obtained for reference veitur 2021 the measurements were made at 5 10 15 20 and 50 cm depths from december 12 2018 to october 31 2020 meteorology ten minute weather air temperature and rainfall data were collected from a weather station installed in february 2019 and operated by the icelandic meteorological office imo on behalf of the gardabaer municipality imo 2020a the station is located approx 100 m downstream from the location of the measurements hourly temperature snow depth and rainfall were also collected from the reykjavik no 1 station located on a hilltop 6 km away from the study site imo 2020b for reference purposes 2 5 data analyses winter climate and soil conditions the seasonal number of air freeze thaw cycles and the freezing and thawing indices were calculated to assess the intensity of these air temperature variations using the degree day method andersland and ladanyi 1994 zwissler et al 2016 the air freezing degree days fdd were estimated as the sum of the daily average temperatures below zero tavg 0 c during winter november to march and the thawing degree days tdd were estimated as the sum of the daily average temperatures above freezing tavg 0 c 1 degree d a y t avg 0 c 2 cumulative d e g r e e d a y t avg 0 c similarly a soil frost cycle was derived based on the average daily temperature at 5 cm depth so that if the soil temperature dropped below zero for one day would be counted as a cycle maximum frost penetration was derived as the maximum soil depth at which the average daily temperature was below zero a rain on snow ros event was defined as a day with precipitation concurrent with a reduction in snow depth a snow cycle was defined as 24 hours with a snow depth of 1 cm measured at 9 am saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was estimated with two significant digits from the measured steady state flow rate qs in m3 s following the analytical expression of reynolds and elrick 1990 for the one ponding depth approach 3 k sat α γ q s t where 4 t a α h 1 γ α π a 2 and 5 γ g e 0 316 d a 0 184 where α in m 1 is a parameter defined by soil texture taken as 12 for loam soils gardner 1958 ge is a shape factor t is a function of the soil texture ponding depth and the radius a is the ring radius in meters 0 04 m2 d is the depth of ring insertion in the ground in meters 0 15 m and h is the ponded water level in meters 0 05 m the relationships between ksat and soil and water temperature were then compared with the theoretical relationship describing the variations in water density and viscosity hillel 1998 6 k sat k ρ g μ where k is the intrinsic soil permeability cm2 ρ is the water density g cm3 g is the gravitational acceleration cm s2 and μ is the water dynamic viscosity in poise units dyn sec cm2 statistical analyses the similarity in temporal evolution of infiltration amongst different testing locations within the same terrain was tested with linear regression analyses similarly the relationship between infiltration and weather conditions was tested with linear regression inter and between terrain variability were assessed using one way analysis of variance anova where the different terrains grass swale lupine barren were treated as main effects the differences between terrains were analyzed by performing multiple comparisons using the student s t test to look for significant differences data used for analysis was transformed where required in order to account for the assumptions of normality the normality of the data was tested using the kolmogorov smirnov test k s and shapiro wilk test the normality is accepted at p 0 05 the spatial variation within the swale was assessed by comparing the arithmetic mean of the infiltration rates from each of the six infiltrometers statistical difference was based on the 5 significance level unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions an overview of the weather during the 28 month study period is presented in fig 2 in the first winter the snow season started unusually late in the middle of january with a 32 day long snow cycle with a maximum 31 cm depth fig 2a this corresponds to one of the longest snow cycles ever recorded in reykjavík andradóttir et al 2021 arnardóttir 2020 at the same time the air temperature fluctuated around the freezing point fig 2b reflected in a balance between freezing and thawing days fdd and tdd fig 2c the second winter however was representative of average maritime cold climate conditions with 21 freeze thaw cycles intermittent snow cover 13 snow cycles longest lasting 23 days starting november 18 and moderate snow depth max 12 cm table 2 the subsurface also experienced more days of frost more intense and deeper frost penetration as well as more thaw cycles the spring and summer conditions were equally warm but summer 2019 was drier with total precipitation of 307 mm compared to a 409 mm total rainfall during summer 2020 3 2 seasonal evolution of infiltration tested locations within each terrain exhibited a similar seasonal evolution during the 28 field campaigns fig 3 top panels reflected in good correlation coefficients and low p values fig 3 bottom panels in winter 2018 2019 with the long standing snow cover fig 2a the infiltration in the grass swale s sections was not impeded or slightly increased however insignificantly p 0 05 fig 3a compared to summer this is in stark contrast to the less dense vegetation cover lupine fig 3c and bare ground fig 3e where the winter infiltration dropped to half that of the antecedent summer during the following winter characterized by intermittent snow and frequent freeze thaw infiltration inhibiting frost formed in all terrains the sites covered with the dense grass turf remained infiltrative during the freezing period the sparsely vegetated areas exhibited both a reduction and a subsequent increase in infiltration around mid winter in the lupine field fig 3c and late winter in the barren soil terrain fig 3e the high infiltration rates coincided with structural deformations observed at the surface discussed in section 3 3 to follow it is interesting to note that after the structural deformations in the latter part of winter the infiltration rates did not return to the same values as the summer before thus suggesting that the soil structure was rearranged as a result of intense freeze thaw cycles the linear regression between the tested locations fig 3 bottom panels indicates that despite the differences in absolute values each terrain exhibited a similar response to seasonal and event based changes except for the test location s1 which behaved differently during the testing period infiltration measurement pairs were well correlated within each location r2 0 32 0 65 and statistically significant at the 95 level p 0 05 the less vegetated sites that were susceptible to structural changes i e the lupine and barren fields also showed consistent patterns in infiltration during frost freezing and thawing behavior and soil deformation as well as when returned to normal conditions in spring this high similarity between test sites within the same terrain supports the use of a small number of infiltrometers to assess the potential formation of infiltration inhibiting frost during frequent freeze thaw cycles 3 3 frost heave observations the areas with sparse or absent vegetation cover i e lupine and barren were vulnerable to freezing and thawing and frost heave while the grass swale exhibited no signs of frost related surface cracks or heave fig 4 a specifically during the second winter which was representative of maritime climate frost heave was physically observed on both test locations in the lupine field after 3 ftcs on december 18 2019 fig 4a middle column concurrent with a 58 reduction in infiltration capacity fig 3c a month later after 5 ftcs the soil structure at the lupine location l2 had collapsed inward within the ring when thawed forming large cracks and a separation between the infiltration ring and the soil concurrent with the observed soil surface collapse abnormally rapid water infiltration rate was observed on january 17 2020 which is interpreted as bypass flow along the side walls of the infiltration ring lupine location l1 followed after 7 ftcs a month later the soil recovered in spring but the average infiltration rates in the lupine terrain were 34 lower than summer averages in the barren sites the infiltration dropped by 34 after only one ftc plunging to only 4 mm h 1 after 3 ftcs on december 18 when frost heave was physically observed fig 4a rightmost concurrent with such low infiltration was low drainage that maintained the soil wet and ultimately resulted in the formation of an ice layer on the surface which impeded infiltration throughout winter 2019 2020 during the spring thaw the barren soil became supersaturated the infiltration ring moved vertically upwards by 8 cm fig 4a bottom panel and water seeped from underneath the ring during an infiltration experiment indicative that the soil was still frozen underneath blocking infiltration hence these physical observations suggest deep frost formation in the barren ground which was neither observed in the lupine nor grass the structural changes in the barren were accompanied with an increase in measured infiltration rates as high as 1753 corresponding to 685 mm h 1 during the milder winter frost related deformations were also observed but only towards the end of winter and beginning of spring thaw fig 4b frost heave was physically observed not only within but also between the two tested locations in the lupine terrain fig 4b top and bottom left in addition large cracks were observed outside the test rings in the barren area fig 4b bottom right frost heave large cracks and subsequent collapse that contributed to observed bypass flow during the second winter with frequent freeze thaw cycles fig 2a were not bound to the location of the metal infiltration rings but a prevalent phenomenon in the lupine and barren terrains in the following analyses the primary focus is on the infiltration measurements representing porous media flow therefore the high infiltration rates related to the occurrence of bypass flow are not included in the analyses 3 4 underlying soil conditions continuous water content and temperature data in the lupine and swale fields give insights into the susceptibility of the soil in the lupine terrain to frost the soil at 5 cm depth started to freeze one month earlier under the sparsely vegetated terrain lupine than in the more permanently vegetated grass swale in winter 2019 2020 fig 5 a but more importantly the drainage capacity of the soil in the swale was much higher than in the lupine the 24 hour average reduction in saturation was 14 in the swale compared to only 4 in lupine during winter runoff events fig 5b as expected under such conditions the degree of saturation in the lupine field was on average higher than in the grass 85 vs 80 respectively consistent with a higher field capacity moreover the soil in the grass swale repeatedly reached high saturation levels 88 100 in response to rainfall and or snowmelt but never reached saturation max 92 in the lupine this indicates that the near surface porosity in the grass was higher due to the interlinked roots system beyond the grass cover this could also be explained by the presence of more fine materials silt and clay in the lupine terrain than in the manmade grass swale consistent with high water holding capacity and poor drainage the soil under lupine reached supersaturation during spring thaw on march 20 fig 5b however the soil at 5 cm depth in the grass swale seems to form porous near surface frost more easily than lupine which was observed in the sharp reductions in water content following three natural snowmelt ros events due to a phase change from water to ice fig 5d the type of frost seemed to permit vertical water movement which was confirmed during the synthetic runoff experiments conducted by zaqout and andradóttir 2021 in the same swale section lastly the seasonal evolution of the temperature of the deep soils at 25 cm is statistically similar in winter with frost never reaching this depth for both lupine and grass fig 5c the lupine however provided sun shading in summer as reflected in 0 6 c lower soil temperature than in the grass swale 3 5 temperature dependence water and surface temperature contribute to changes in infiltration rates as temperature decreases the infiltration capacity drops because of the increased water viscosity equations 3 6 the average water temperature used in the infiltration experiments during summer and fall experiments were 13 and 11 c respectively the average water temperature was significantly lower during winter 3 c similarly the surface temperature measured next to each infiltration ring was lowest during winter with an average of 0 42 c compared to an average surface temperature during summer of 12 5 c the theoretical relationship of increasing hydraulic conductivity with water temperature is confirmed with a linear regression analyses of measured infiltration rates in the grass swale fig 6 a the correlation is weak but significant at the 95 confidence level r2 0 27 the relationship between infiltration capacity and ground surface temperature was stronger than that between infiltration and water temperature r2 0 42 fig 6b supporting that the temperature of the soil medium exerts a control on the infiltration rate the large residuals between the observed rates and the theoretical relationship reflect the importance of other seasonal processes than the effect of temperature variations on infiltration capacity during summer biological activity and root growth contribute to enhancing infiltration whereas the formation of pore ice and structural changes reduces permeability in winter garcía serrana et al 2017 however no statistically significant correlation between temperature and infiltration was found for lupine and barren soil fig 6c and d this suggests that the antecedent moisture and frost formation processes play a more influential role than water viscosity in these terrains 3 6 impact of snow cycles on infiltration the two studied winter seasons exhibited different meteorological conditions which reflected on frost formation and infiltration capacity to identify which meteorological driver influenced infiltration capacity the most the temporal evolution of infiltration during winter was analyzed with respect to representatives readily available hydroclimatic factors 1 no of fdd to represent seasonal cooling 2 no of snow cycles snow depth 1 cm to represent the fluctuations in surface soil conditions in a maritime climate the number of freezing degree days did not explain the temporal evolution of infiltration in winter and between winters in general the response of each terrain was consistent between years when plotted against the number of snow cycles fig 7 the infiltration rate dropped with increasing snow cycles in the grass and barren fig 7a c the lupine started to show deformations after 2 4 snow cycles fig 7b this supports the interpretation that structural changes due to frost heave and the potential formation of macropores are related to the frequency of freeze thaw more than the severity of cooling 3 7 variability within and across terrains while the primary focus of this study was to resolve the effects of frequent freeze thaw on infiltration in the different terrains the experiments also provided insights into spatial variability a summary of all measurements conducted within each test site during the two year monitoring program is presented in fig 8 the variability shown as boxes representing the median 25th and 75th percentiles and the extreme data points whiskers represent both seasonal variability and variability between the two winters with different frost intensity as discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 6 of the six test sites in the grass swale three s2 to s4 did not significantly differ p 0 05 s5 and s6 were both statistically different from the remaining test locations p 0 05 the unusually high infiltration in s6 fig 8a was attributed to the presence of large rocks at the bottom of the infiltration ring despite some statistical differences consistent drops were recorded in winter across all the test locations within the grass swale the two lupine test sites were statistically different but within the same range fig 8b the infiltration capacity in the two barren sites did not significantly differ fig 8c while acknowledging the spatial variability the infiltration in each location can be compared on an order of magnitude basis the comparison suggests that infiltration in the vegetated terrains was on the same order of magnitude during the two year study period the infiltration in the non vegetated terrain was however an order to two magnitudes lower table 3 4 discussion 4 1 role of suds in a cold maritime climate suds aim to reduce urban flooding via infiltration and flow retardance by replacing traditionally impervious areas with permeable green areas besides the known hydrological benefits reducing and treating runoff of harmful pollutants suds also enhance biodiversity and the aesthetical value of urban areas this study provides new insights into the potential role of infiltration based solutions in strengthening the resilience of urban areas against winter flooding in a maritime climate characterized by frequent freeze thaw cycles infiltration experiments physical observations and continuous monitoring table 4 demonstrated that an engineered grass swale with a continuous and finely woven root mat and more porous underlying soils drained faster developed less frost resisted soil deformations due to frost in comparison with two undisturbed terrains lupine and barren during frequent freeze thaw winter 2019 2020 these surface and soil properties resulted in a sustained infiltration throughout repeated freeze thaw the non vegetated terrain i e barren was prone to frost formation and infiltration inhibiting concrete frost the sparsely vegetated field i e lupine maintained high saturation during winter which led to a singular occurrence of concrete frost formation frost heave during both winters and bypass flow following a structural collapse upon thawing in the second winter while macropores might be beneficial in alleviating urban flood risks by increasing infiltration during winter flow through large preferential paths reduces the pollutant removal efficiency associated with water movement through porous media this contradicts the integral function of suds which ultimately aim to preserve the integrity of receiving waters and can be particularly dangerous in cold regions where snow that accumulates more pollutants than rainfall induced runoff is often cleared from streets and deposited in roadside swales andradóttir and vollertsen 2015 gavrić et al bypass flow through cracks and fissures has been observed to severely limit solute removal within the top 1 m of soils flury et al 1994 while the water quality of infiltration was not a focus in this study the rapid water seepage observed following the severe structural deformation in the lupine and barren suggests a potential water quality risk structural changes due to freezing and thawing resulted in a semi permanent decrease of 29 and 26 in the lupine and barren respectively between summer 2019 and 2020 while the grass swale increased infiltration by 50 in summary this study highlights that surface vegetation plays an essential role in improving infiltration in summer and winter bare soils had a significantly lower infiltration capacity than the vegetated surfaces during the two year study period which can amplify runoff peaks and volumes in urban areas making such non vegetated areas undesirable for sustainable urban development this research also shows that repeated freeze thaw characteristic of cold maritime climate is detrimental to infiltration in manufactured and undisturbed terrains by studying two distinct winters one with a 32 day long snow cycle together with a few short lived ones the other with intermittent snow cover over five months soil freezing and reduced infiltration were linked to repeated cycles of snow rather than cumulative degree days of cooling represented by fdd table 2 this confirms previous hypotheses e g muthanna et al 2008 roseen et al 2009 and observations zaqout and andradóttir 2021 that repeated melting and refreezing of meltwater within the soil media is an influential factor for the formation of frost and deeper frost 15 cm compared to 5 cm in the first winter previous research conducted in cold coastal regions e g khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2016 also emphasized the need for good drainage capacity to minimize the adverse effects of freeze thaw cycles this research however also suggests that vegetation cover can enhance the near surface soil porosity that is repeatedly exposed to freezing air temperature in cold maritime climates which in return improves the drainage capacity and minimizes the potential for frost formation 4 2 practical implications for urban landscapes suds are usually designed based on local experience using available residual material onsite rujner et al 2018 this study supports the importance of re manufacturing local soils that are poorly draining for usage in infiltration based urban drainage systems to avoid high water contents that can form impermeable frost lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 the grass swale s good performance is attributed to the fact that the swale s media was man made and contained coarser material than the local soils present in the undisturbed terrains i e barren lupine and because of the vegetation cover common complications resulting from cold climate conditions are altered surface roughness increased runoff peaks and volumes reduced or impeded infiltration capacity due to frost dormant vegetation and infiltration of de icing salts roseen et al 2009 however such complications can be partially avoided by including a gravel based drainage layer and or underdrains to promote faster drainage lefevre et al 2009 maintenance practices might need to also be reconsidered which can include regular inspections following melt events to remove residual sand and sediments and prepare damages to vegetation and mulching to restore the moisture capacity and soil structure in spring caraco and claytor 1997 secondly large areas of bare soils should be avoided because of their significantly worse seasonal infiltration potential and concrete frost potential in winter bare grounds within the built environment also tend to be more affected by human activity and increased compaction than vegetated terrains due to the lack of a root system that can sustain porosity barbosa et al 2020 leaving robust vegetated terrains undisturbed with native plants may be a cost effective solution for peak flow and volume reduction during extreme summer rainfall events lastly the suds literature focuses on selecting plants that can tolerate highly variable soil moisture conditions the local soil ph and texture and pollutant loading prince george s county 1999 this study highlights that plant selection criteria need to be expanded to ensure optimal cold climate hydrological performance sparsely vegetated e g lupinus nootkatensis that fully shed their vegetation in winter and bare surfaces might not be a recommended practice because their susceptibility to the formation of cracks and macropore structures can lead to the bypassing of infiltrating water therefore jeopardizing the quality of groundwater lupine also tends to limit sun penetration to lower vegetation leaving the ground similar to bare soil and frost sensitive than the densely vegetated surfaces 4 3 data strengths and limitations assessing winter infiltration during frequent frost and snow cycles is not an easy task and difficult to optimize due to practical considerations time resources sunshine duration frost the approach taken in this study was to conduct single ring infiltrometer experiments within the first 20 cm of soils that are prone to frost formation as a robust time efficient method that minimally disturbed the soil the measured seasonal evolution of infiltration exhibited high similarity between the test points within the same terrain which supports the use of this technique to assess the impacts of frequent freeze and thaw infiltration within the same site fig 3 overall the measured infiltration in non vegetated terrain in this study conforms well with measurements in sandy loam soils which varied from 1 to 87 mm h 1 in frozen and nonfrozen conditions in a laboratory setting al houri et al 2009 the grass swale and lupine exhibited slightly higher summer and winter infiltration than a bioretention cell 450 mm h 1 and 5 10 mm h 1 in summer vs winter paus et al 2016 which can be attributed to the high porosity and low bulk density of icelandic andosols arnalds 2015 table 1 the study also confirms that spatial variability can be considerable even within small distances due to the heterogeneous nature of soils and frost formation infiltration rates measured in the field using ring infiltrometers are always higher than rainfall induced infiltration observed in real events due to the larger ponding depth hillel 1998 rawls et al 1983 the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured using ring infiltrometer was 2 to 5 times higher in this study compared to synthetic runoff experiments at the same site zaqout and andradóttir 2021 consistent with observations in bioretention cells made by paus et al 2016 bypass flow was observed in sparsely vegetated terrains undergoing frequent freeze thaw but not quantified in this study the use of intrusive metal rings may exacerbate the occurrence of macropore flow associated with frost heave and soil collapse as the wall of the metal infiltration ring was observed to separate from surrounding soil the inclusion of an outer ring dual ring infiltrometer is also expected to be vulnerable to bypass flow amplification as the surface area of the metal in contact with the soil would be larger to quantify the increased infiltration due to frost induced macropore formation non intrusive methods such as synthetic runoff events over a larger area e g bäckström davis et al 2012 rujner et al 2018 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 would be preferred such methods however are not suitable for resolving spatial variability require large amounts of running water and have a greater potential of generating synthetic freezing at the surface as discussed in section 2 2 lastly the performance of infiltration based systems can change considerably over extended periods years due to clogging vegetation roots growth and structural changes both natural due to soil deformations and intentional due to compaction and management practices therefore the findings presented in this study cannot be extrapolated to longer time periods 5 conclusions observations made over 28 months in this study provide insights into the hydrological performance of grass swales urban runoff generation the design and implementation of green infrastructure in cold maritime climates the field measurements were conducted in a grass swale with a permanent vegetation cover a lupine field and a barren terrain the results indicate that the grass swale was more resilient to the developing infiltration inhibiting frost compared to the other less vegetated terrains the swale s infiltration capacity was maintained throughout the study period despite the significant reduction in infiltration rates in winter compared to the summer and fall averages 630 vs 980 mm h 1 the sparsely non vegetated surfaces i e lupine and barren however were more susceptible to frost formation and frost heave than the grass swale which resulted in pronounced structural changes due to freeze thaw cycles and led to a structural breakdown in the two terrains the vegetated terrains were also considerably more infiltrative than the barren area throughout the study period suggesting that the bare ground can generate higher runoff rates and volumes and can lead to a higher flooding risk especially when soil frost is present in addition the structural deformation in those terrains which may lead to the formation of large cracks can result in groundwater contamination as the soil ceases to function as a filter and crack flow may carry organic soil particles to groundwater systems the findings of this research suggest that the stormwater control measures that provide sustainable urban drainage solutions in cold maritime areas should aim to minimize non vegetated or impermeable areas and promote the integration of green surfaces for flood mitigation because of frequent rain on snow and intermittent snowmelt the soils tend to be more saturated in cold maritime climates than in continental areas and thus well drained and vegetated soils are preferred to avoid media freezing and regular maintenance is required to sustain the

3570,sustainable urban drainage systems suds promote environmental protection and climate resilience suds implementation in cold climates faces concerns of impaired hydrological function due to infiltration reducing frost the goal of this research was to assess the seasonal variations in infiltration and how different surface covers prevalent in and near coastal cities respond to frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw cycles a total of 28 constant head infiltration measurements were conducted over a period of 28 months in urridaholt in gardabaer iceland 64 4 18 46 n 21 54 37 11 w in a grass swale lupine and barren terrains all test locations exhibited infiltration inhibiting frost in winter whose severity increased with frequent snow and freeze thaw cycles the grass swale resisted structural deformations resulting from frost which was attributed to the high near surface porosity within the intertwined root layer and the high drainage capacity of the underlying soil the sparsely vegetated lupine and the barren area experienced severe frost heaving and cracking and soil structural collapse which led to bypass flow upon thawing the non vegetated site had 30 to 50 times lower infiltration during winter 19 mm h 1 compared to the grass swale and lupine field 630 and 890 mm h 1 respectively and twenty times lower during summer and fall 45 mm h 1 vs 1000 mm h 1 the study concludes that frequent warming and cooling renders soils particularly vulnerable to frost vegetation plays an instrumental role in maintaining the hydrological functions of suds in winter therefore the greening of urban centers is an important step towards climate resiliency plant selection and suds design criteria need to account for cold climate hydrological performance in that regard plants that limit sunlight and fully shed their vegetation in winter such as the invasive lupine can potentially contribute to frost formation and increase runoff generation keywords grass swales infiltration frozen soil suds runoff urban drainage 1 introduction climate change and urbanization have motivated a shift in urban drainage policy from a single purpose approach of reducing runoff to a multi functional approach that provides social economic and health benefits davis et al 2012 deletic and fletcher fletcher et al wong and brown 2009 decentralized infiltration based stormwater management using sustainable urban drainage systems suds has gained increased popularity in the recent decades barrett 2008 caraco and claytor fletcher et al wong and brown 2009 suds effectiveness in reducing and treating surface runoff largely relies on their infiltration capacity davis et al 2012 garcía serrana et al rujner et al 2018 one of the key concerns with the wide adoption of suds in cold climates is the potential occurrence of infiltration limiting frost fach et al 2011 khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2016 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 which can render the normally permeable surfaces non conductive bengtsson and westerström 1992 westerström 1984 yet there are also indications that bioretention systems can still perform well in freezing temperatures 80 peak flow reduction khan et al 2012 roseen et al 2009 the conflicting reports on winter infiltration and frost formation are linked to a complex interplay between the soil vegetation cover and climatic conditions fine textured compacted organic rich soils hamper infiltration and drainage hillel 1998 rawls et al 1983 while macropores and cracks formed by plant roots and freeze thaw cycles aid it beven and germann 1982 gray et al densely vegetated surfaces such as grass tend to maintain a lower soil water content higher infiltration rate and are less prone to frost formation than sparsely vegetated surfaces in rural areas van der kamp et al 2003 moreover dense vegetation accompanied with deep roots such as in deciduous forests allows for greater infiltration and less ice formation potential than dense vegetation or deep roots alone as exemplary of coniferous evergreen forests bormann and klaassen 2008 orradottir et al 2008 the type of frost and the hydraulic conductivity of frozen soils are in turn largely governed by the soil moisture content at the onset of freezing al houri et al 2009 fach et al flerchinger et al 2013 more so than the freezing temperature benoit 1973 relatively dry soils and dense vegetation promote granular and porous frost while saturated soils and sparse vegetation are prone to concrete frost formation kane 1980 kane and stein 1983 stoeckeler and weitzman 1960 orradottir et al 2008 severe surface flooding occurs during sudden snowmelt events when all the filtering media pores are filled with ice or during saturated conditions bengtsson 1985 bengtsson and westerström frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw is the key cause of urban flooding in cold maritime climate andradóttir et al 2021 the repeated supply of cold liquid water from melting snow and the lack of thermal insulation from the atmospheric cooling provided by a continuous seasonal snow cover render the soils wet for extended periods and susceptible to frequent freezing and thawing zaqout and andradóttir 2021 flerchinger et al 2013 muthanna et al 2008 repeated freeze thaw in dry soils enhances the formation of preferential flow paths and near surface cracks fouli et al 2013 kane and stein 1983 baratta 2013 flerchinger et al 2013 aggregate stability may increase after the first freeze thaw cycle in wet soils while decrease as more freezing cycles occur due to ice lens and fractures formation arnalds 2015 flerchinger et al 2013 lehrsch 1998 considerable uncertainty remains on the role of freeze thaw cycles on infiltration for example infiltration was observed to increase in clayey silt with the number of freeze thaw cycles sterpi 2015 while it remained unaffected or decreased slightly in loamy sand and clayey soils fouli et al 2013 as a result of climate change more cities around the globe are predicted to experience frequent rain on snow and freeze thaw cycles dong and menzel 2020 garvelmann et al the performance of suds during frost is however still poorly understood and a limiting factor in their adoption in cold climates ekka et al 2021 fletcher et al studies that evaluated infiltration capacity during winter freezing conditions are either based on laboratory soil columns without a vegetation cover e g fach et al 2011 moghadas et al 2016 focused on sparse large rooted vegetation in bioretention cells with underdrains e g khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2016 or conducted in rural areas e g fouli et al 2013 gray et al kane and stein 1983 orradottir et al 2008 additionally no studies have comprehensively investigated the efficiency of grass swales in cold climatic conditions ekka et al 2021 urban terrains differ from their rural counterparts because of soil compaction clogging and disruption which results in inaccurate prediction of runoff volumes and peaks pitt et al 2002 therefore to successfully transition to more climate resilient cities the response of different kinds of permeable urban surfaces to maritime winter conditions needs to be better understood especially grass which constitutes a major share of green surfaces in the temperate and arctic regions kane and stein 1983 the goal of this study was to quantify the changes in infiltration between summer and winter in three different surface covers in an urban area subject to the same hydro climatological conditions for this purpose field infiltration experiments were conducted over 28 months in a grass swale specifically designed to infiltrate water and two adjacent terrains a land covered with lupine lupinus nootkatensis introduced for restoring deteriorated ecosystems vetter et al 2018 and a bare soil hereafter referred to as barren each surface cover has a different plant density and root characteristics and constitutes large areas in public or undeveloped urban areas a particular focus was on relating infiltration capacity to surface frost and structural deformations as well as soil moisture content and soil drainage the latter of which is relatively little discussed in previous infiltration experiments studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the breeam building research establishment s environmental assessment method certified residential neighborhood of urridaholt in gardabaer iceland 64 4 18 46 n 21 54 37 11 w implemented suds to preserve the pre development water cycle the study site encompasses a grass swale and two nearby surface covers in a sloping landscape fig 1 a the swale is approximately 3 m wide with a trapezoidal shape to infiltrate and convey excess runoff from private lots linearly to the downstream pond urridavatn fig 1b the swale is separated into sections by check dams to attenuate the flow on one side of the swale is a lupine field lupinus nootkatensis and on the other side a gravelly path that was paved with asphalt in february 2019 the lupine was introduced from alaska during the last century and has been used to facilitate the reclamation of degraded surfaces further uphill an area of barren soils can be found fig 1a the three surfaces at this site represent varying plant densities and different root structures and depths table 1 being located close to one another the different surfaces develop a similar thick snow cover in winter and of similar density andradóttir and zaqout unpublished data the grass swale was constructed without specific layering or an underdrain a 50 cm thick soil overlies a natural clay layer and basaltic rock the dominant soil texture class in the three tested sections of the swale was sandy loam according to usda soil textural classification usda 1987 the soil in the swale consisted of 15 20 gravel 75 82 sand and 2 5 4 fines in accordance with astm d6913 astm 2017 the soil in the lupine field was also classified as sandy loam but contained a higher portion of fines 16 5 while the sand portion was similar to the one in the swale 72 the soil bulk density and porosity were measured in the laboratory as intact soil cores were extracted at 10 cm intervals from the 30 cm soil horizon which showed a higher porosity in the grass swale than in the lupine field table 1 2 2 experimental approach many studies on soil freeze thaw cycles have been conducted in controlled incubators or growth chambers using repacked soil columns or intact mesocosms henry 2007 while providing valuable information laboratory tests underestimate field infiltration because of the artificial packing of the soil and lack of naturally formed cracks and pores due to vegetation ding et al 2019 the small volumes of the collected soils also lead to a rapid equilibrium with ambient air temperatures which causes unrealistically severe freezing and large temperature fluctuations henry 2007 field experiments in turn can account for the spatial variability of a heterogeneous terrain over different seasons ring infiltrometers are thin walled single or double open ended cylinders that are inserted in the ground and can be used to estimate the cumulative infiltration rate and the field saturated hydraulic conductivity elrick et al 1995 reynolds and elrick 1990 dane et al 2002 the approach taken in this study was to use single ring infiltrometers to assess water infiltration at the top 20 cm of soil that is prone to frost formation in a cold maritime climate the perceived advantage of using double ring infiltrometers is questionable during freezing conditions as the effectiveness of the outer ring in eliminating lateral flows is not proven except for shallow ponded depths and impractically large diameters swartzendruber and olson 1961 youngs 1987 shallow ponded water depth is not appropriate in subfreezing temperature as it increases the risk of water freezing within the ring during the experiment additionally in seasonally wet soils with high water holding capacity zaqout and andradóttir 2021 such as in this study an overestimation of the infiltration capacity due to lateral flow resulting from the capillarity of the surrounding unsaturated soil reynolds and elrick 1990 is less of a concern the small set of single infiltrometers may serve as a good indicator of whether and to which degree infiltration is reduced in winter 2 3 experimental design and procedure a total of 8 infiltration rings were installed at the study site in the summer of 2018 the infiltrometers were placed close to one another with easy access to water supply along a walking path fig 1a the rings were 22 5 cm in diameter and 40 cm in height the infiltrometers were gently hammered to establish good contact with the soil and to minimize disturbances down to 15 17 cm depths perpendicular to the slope of the soil surface a drainage hole was drilled at the bottom of each ring to prevent the accumulation of water inside in between measurements which is plugged before the commencement of a measurement four infiltration rings were added in the summer of 2019 in order to get a better representative sample in the grass swale a mesh was placed within the infiltration ring to ensure that the water poured into the ring uniformly spread over the surface an initial volume of water was added instantly at time t 0 until the water level within the ring stabilized and using a stopwatch the recording of time was started the water level or ponded depth h was maintained at approximately 5 cm by adding water continuously using graduated cylinders with volumes of 1 and 2 l the added volume was recorded every 5 min and timed using a timer the experiment was discontinued when the added volume remained constant for three consecutive iterations which occurred after approximately 45 60 min during summer and 30 45 min during winter the measurements were conducted once every 3 4 weeks to minimize the disturbance of the study site prior to each measurement before each infiltration measurement the surface water and air temperatures were measured using a handheld thermometer pictures were taken of the terrain surface within the rings the presence of surface frost was noted by visually observing the presence of ice lenses see fig 1c soil structural changes and frost heave were evaluated by measuring the distance between the pre set soil surface elevation and the surface elevation on the measurement day using a hand held measuring tape 2 4 continuous data monitoring soil conditions soil water content and temperature were measured at a grass swale located 50 m downhill of the study locations at depths from 5 to 45 cm at 10 cm intervals readings were logged using a data logger type cs650 campbell scientific inc accuracy 1 caldwell et al 2018 every 1 min similarly the adjacent lupine field was instrumented with the same instruments at 5 15 and 25 cm depths starting september 2019 a soil specific calibration was conducted in the laboratory and a linear user defined calibration equation was derived for volcanic soils e g icelandic andosols described in campbell scientific inc 2021 soil temperature measured by the local utility veitur ehf at the heiðmörk station located 10 km inland from the study site was obtained for reference veitur 2021 the measurements were made at 5 10 15 20 and 50 cm depths from december 12 2018 to october 31 2020 meteorology ten minute weather air temperature and rainfall data were collected from a weather station installed in february 2019 and operated by the icelandic meteorological office imo on behalf of the gardabaer municipality imo 2020a the station is located approx 100 m downstream from the location of the measurements hourly temperature snow depth and rainfall were also collected from the reykjavik no 1 station located on a hilltop 6 km away from the study site imo 2020b for reference purposes 2 5 data analyses winter climate and soil conditions the seasonal number of air freeze thaw cycles and the freezing and thawing indices were calculated to assess the intensity of these air temperature variations using the degree day method andersland and ladanyi 1994 zwissler et al 2016 the air freezing degree days fdd were estimated as the sum of the daily average temperatures below zero tavg 0 c during winter november to march and the thawing degree days tdd were estimated as the sum of the daily average temperatures above freezing tavg 0 c 1 degree d a y t avg 0 c 2 cumulative d e g r e e d a y t avg 0 c similarly a soil frost cycle was derived based on the average daily temperature at 5 cm depth so that if the soil temperature dropped below zero for one day would be counted as a cycle maximum frost penetration was derived as the maximum soil depth at which the average daily temperature was below zero a rain on snow ros event was defined as a day with precipitation concurrent with a reduction in snow depth a snow cycle was defined as 24 hours with a snow depth of 1 cm measured at 9 am saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was estimated with two significant digits from the measured steady state flow rate qs in m3 s following the analytical expression of reynolds and elrick 1990 for the one ponding depth approach 3 k sat α γ q s t where 4 t a α h 1 γ α π a 2 and 5 γ g e

the ring radius in meters 0 04 m2 d is the depth of ring insertion in the ground in meters 0 15 m and h is the ponded water level in meters 0 05 m the relationships between ksat and soil and water temperature were then compared with the theoretical relationship describing the variations in water density and viscosity hillel 1998 6 k sat k ρ g μ where k is the intrinsic soil permeability cm2 ρ is the water density g cm3 g is the gravitational acceleration cm s2 and μ is the water dynamic viscosity in poise units dyn sec cm2 statistical analyses the similarity in temporal evolution of infiltration amongst different testing locations within the same terrain was tested with linear regression analyses similarly the relationship between infiltration and weather conditions was tested with linear regression inter and between terrain variability were assessed using one way analysis of variance anova where the different terrains grass swale lupine barren were treated as main effects the differences between terrains were analyzed by performing multiple comparisons using the student s t test to look for significant differences data used for analysis was transformed where required in order to account for the assumptions of normality the normality of the data was tested using the kolmogorov smirnov test k s and shapiro wilk test the normality is accepted at p 0 05 the spatial variation within the swale was assessed by comparing the arithmetic mean of the infiltration rates from each of the six infiltrometers statistical difference was based on the 5 significance level unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions an overview of the weather during the 28 month study period is presented in fig 2 in the first winter the snow season started unusually late in the middle of january with a 32 day long snow cycle with a maximum 31 cm depth fig 2a this corresponds to one of the longest snow cycles ever recorded in reykjavík andradóttir et al 2021 arnardóttir 2020 at the same time the air temperature fluctuated around the freezing point fig 2b reflected in a balance between freezing and thawing days fdd and tdd fig 2c the second winter however was representative of average maritime cold climate conditions with 21 freeze thaw cycles intermittent snow cover 13 snow cycles longest lasting 23 days starting november 18 and moderate snow depth max 12 cm table 2 the subsurface also experienced more days of frost more intense and deeper frost penetration as well as more thaw cycles the spring and summer conditions were equally warm but summer 2019 was drier with total precipitation of 307 mm compared to a 409 mm total rainfall during summer 2020 3 2 seasonal evolution of infiltration tested locations within each terrain exhibited a similar seasonal evolution during the 28 field campaigns fig 3 top panels reflected in good correlation coefficients and low p values fig 3 bottom panels in winter 2018 2019 with the long standing snow cover fig 2a the infiltration in the grass swale s sections was not impeded or slightly increased however insignificantly p 0 05 fig 3a compared to summer this is in stark contrast to the less dense vegetation cover lupine fig 3c and bare ground fig 3e where the winter infiltration dropped to half that of the antecedent summer during the following winter characterized by intermittent snow and frequent freeze thaw infiltration inhibiting frost formed in all terrains the sites covered with the dense grass turf remained infiltrative during the freezing period the sparsely vegetated areas exhibited both a reduction and a subsequent increase in infiltration around mid winter in the lupine field fig 3c and late winter in the barren soil terrain fig 3e the high infiltration rates coincided with structural deformations observed at the surface discussed in section 3 3 to follow it is interesting to note that after the structural deformations in the latter part of winter the infiltration rates did not return to the same values as the summer before thus suggesting that the soil structure was rearranged as a result of intense freeze thaw cycles the linear regression between the tested locations fig 3 bottom panels indicates that despite the differences in absolute values each terrain exhibited a similar response to seasonal and event based changes except for the test location s1 which behaved differently during the testing period infiltration measurement pairs were well correlated within each location r2 0 32 0 65 and statistically significant at the 95 level p 0 05 the less vegetated sites that were susceptible to structural changes i e the lupine and barren fields also showed consistent patterns in infiltration during frost freezing and thawing behavior and soil deformation as well as when returned to normal conditions in spring this high similarity between test sites within the same terrain supports the use of a small number of infiltrometers to assess the potential formation of infiltration inhibiting frost during frequent freeze thaw cycles 3 3 frost heave observations the areas with sparse or absent vegetation cover i e lupine and barren were vulnerable to freezing and thawing and frost heave while the grass swale exhibited no signs of frost related surface cracks or heave fig 4 a specifically during the second winter which was representative of maritime climate frost heave was physically observed on both test locations in the lupine field after 3 ftcs on december 18 2019 fig 4a middle column concurrent with a 58 reduction in infiltration capacity fig 3c a month later after 5 ftcs the soil structure at the lupine location l2 had collapsed inward within the ring when thawed forming large cracks and a separation between the infiltration ring and the soil concurrent with the observed soil surface collapse abnormally rapid water infiltration rate was observed on january 17 2020 which is interpreted as bypass flow along the side walls of the infiltration ring lupine location l1 followed after 7 ftcs a month later the soil recovered in spring but the average infiltration rates in the lupine terrain were 34 lower than summer averages in the barren sites the infiltration dropped by 34 after only one ftc plunging to only 4 mm h 1 after 3 ftcs on december 18 when frost heave was physically observed fig 4a rightmost concurrent with such low infiltration was low drainage that maintained the soil wet and ultimately resulted in the formation of an ice layer on the surface which impeded infiltration throughout winter 2019 2020 during the spring thaw the barren soil became supersaturated the infiltration ring moved vertically upwards by 8 cm fig 4a bottom panel and water seeped from underneath the ring during an infiltration experiment indicative that the soil was still frozen underneath blocking infiltration hence these physical observations suggest deep frost formation in the barren ground which was neither observed in the lupine nor grass the structural changes in the barren were accompanied with an increase in measured infiltration rates as high as 1753 corresponding to 685 mm h 1 during the milder winter frost related deformations were also observed but only towards the end of winter and beginning of spring thaw fig 4b frost heave was physically observed not only within but also between the two tested locations in the lupine terrain fig 4b top and bottom left in addition large cracks were observed outside the test rings in the barren area fig 4b bottom right frost heave large cracks and subsequent collapse that contributed to observed bypass flow during the second winter with frequent freeze thaw cycles fig 2a were not bound to the location of the metal infiltration rings but a prevalent phenomenon in the lupine and barren terrains in the following analyses the primary focus is on the infiltration measurements representing porous media flow therefore the high infiltration rates related to the occurrence of bypass flow are not included in the analyses 3 4 underlying soil conditions continuous water content and temperature data in the lupine and swale fields give insights into the susceptibility of the soil in the lupine terrain to frost the soil at 5 cm depth started to freeze one month earlier under the sparsely vegetated terrain lupine than in the more permanently vegetated grass swale in winter 2019 2020 fig 5 a but more importantly the drainage capacity of the soil in the swale was much higher than in the lupine the 24 hour average reduction in saturation was 14 in the swale compared to only 4 in lupine during winter runoff events fig 5b as expected under such conditions the degree of saturation in the lupine field was on average higher than in the grass 85 vs 80 respectively consistent with a higher field capacity moreover the soil in the grass swale repeatedly reached high saturation levels 88 100 in response to rainfall and or snowmelt but never reached saturation max 92 in the lupine this indicates that the near surface porosity in the grass was higher due to the interlinked roots system beyond the grass cover this could also be explained by the presence of more fine materials silt and clay in the lupine terrain than in the manmade grass swale consistent with high water holding capacity and poor drainage the soil under lupine reached supersaturation during spring thaw on march 20 fig 5b however the soil at 5 cm depth in the grass swale seems to form porous near surface frost more easily than lupine which was observed in the sharp reductions in water content following three natural snowmelt ros events due to a phase change from water to ice fig 5d the type of frost seemed to permit vertical water movement which was confirmed during the synthetic runoff experiments conducted by zaqout and andradóttir 2021 in the same swale section lastly the seasonal evolution of the temperature of the deep soils at 25 cm is statistically similar in winter with frost never reaching this depth for both lupine and grass fig 5c the lupine however provided sun shading in summer as reflected in 0 6 c lower soil temperature than in the grass swale 3 5 temperature dependence water and surface temperature contribute to changes in infiltration rates as temperature decreases the infiltration capacity drops because of the increased water viscosity equations 3 6 the average water temperature used in the infiltration experiments during summer and fall experiments were 13 and 11 c respectively the average water temperature was significantly lower during winter 3 c similarly the surface temperature measured next to each infiltration ring was lowest during winter with an average of 0 42 c compared to an average surface temperature during summer of 12 5 c the theoretical relationship of increasing hydraulic conductivity with water temperature is confirmed with a linear regression analyses of measured infiltration rates in the grass swale fig 6 a the correlation is weak but significant at the 95 confidence level r2 0 27 the relationship between infiltration capacity and ground surface temperature was stronger than that between infiltration and water temperature r2 0 42 fig 6b supporting that the temperature of the soil medium exerts a control on the infiltration rate the large residuals between the observed rates and the theoretical relationship reflect the importance of other seasonal processes than the effect of temperature variations on infiltration capacity during summer biological activity and root growth contribute to enhancing infiltration whereas the formation of pore ice and structural changes reduces permeability in winter garcía serrana et al 2017 however no statistically significant correlation between temperature and infiltration was found for lupine and barren soil fig 6c and d this suggests that the antecedent moisture and frost formation processes play a more influential role than water viscosity in these terrains 3 6 impact of snow cycles on infiltration the two studied winter seasons exhibited different meteorological conditions which reflected on frost formation and infiltration capacity to identify which meteorological driver influenced infiltration capacity the most the temporal evolution of infiltration during winter was analyzed with respect to representatives readily available hydroclimatic factors 1 no of fdd to represent seasonal cooling 2 no of snow cycles snow depth 1 cm to represent the fluctuations in surface soil conditions in a maritime climate the number of freezing degree days did not explain the temporal evolution of infiltration in winter and between winters in general the response of each terrain was consistent between years when plotted against the number of snow cycles fig 7 the infiltration rate dropped with increasing snow cycles in the grass and barren fig 7a c the lupine started to show deformations after 2 4 snow cycles fig 7b this supports the interpretation that structural changes due to frost heave and the potential formation of macropores are related to the frequency of freeze thaw more than the severity of cooling 3 7 variability within and across terrains while the primary focus of this study was to resolve the effects of frequent freeze thaw on infiltration in the different terrains the experiments also provided insights into spatial variability a summary of all measurements conducted within each test site during the two year monitoring program is presented in fig 8 the variability shown as boxes representing the median 25th and 75th percentiles and the extreme data points whiskers represent both seasonal variability and variability between the two winters with different frost intensity as discussed in sections 3 1 and 3 6 of the six test sites in the grass swale three s2 to s4 did not significantly differ p 0 05 s5 and s6 were both statistically different from the remaining test locations p 0 05 the unusually high infiltration in s6 fig 8a was attributed to the presence of large rocks at the bottom of the infiltration ring despite some statistical differences consistent drops were recorded in winter across all the test locations within the grass swale the two lupine test sites were statistically different but within the same range fig 8b the infiltration capacity in the two barren sites did not significantly differ fig 8c while acknowledging the spatial variability the infiltration in each location can be compared on an order of magnitude basis the comparison suggests that infiltration in the vegetated terrains was on the same order of magnitude during the two year study period the infiltration in the non vegetated terrain was however an order to two magnitudes lower table 3 4 discussion 4 1 role of suds in a cold maritime climate suds aim to reduce urban flooding via infiltration and flow retardance by replacing traditionally impervious areas with permeable green areas besides the known hydrological benefits reducing and treating runoff of harmful pollutants suds also enhance biodiversity and the aesthetical value of urban areas this study provides new insights into the potential role of infiltration based solutions in strengthening the resilience of urban areas against winter flooding in a maritime climate characterized by frequent freeze thaw cycles infiltration experiments physical observations and continuous monitoring table 4 demonstrated that an engineered grass swale with a continuous and finely woven root mat and more porous underlying soils drained faster developed less frost resisted soil deformations due to frost in comparison with two undisturbed terrains lupine and barren during frequent freeze thaw winter 2019 2020 these surface and soil properties resulted in a sustained infiltration throughout repeated freeze thaw the non vegetated terrain i e barren was prone to frost formation and infiltration inhibiting concrete frost the sparsely vegetated field i e lupine maintained high saturation during winter which led to a singular occurrence of concrete frost formation frost heave during both winters and bypass flow following a structural collapse upon thawing in the second winter while macropores might be beneficial in alleviating urban flood risks by increasing infiltration during winter flow through large preferential paths reduces the pollutant removal efficiency associated with water movement through porous media this contradicts the integral function of suds which ultimately aim to preserve the integrity of receiving waters and can be particularly dangerous in cold regions where snow that accumulates more pollutants than rainfall induced runoff is often cleared from streets and deposited in roadside swales andradóttir and vollertsen 2015 gavrić et al bypass flow through cracks and fissures has been observed to severely limit solute removal within the top 1 m of soils flury et al 1994 while the water quality of infiltration was not a focus in this study the rapid water seepage observed following the severe structural deformation in the lupine and barren suggests a potential water quality risk structural changes due to freezing and thawing resulted in a semi permanent decrease of 29 and 26 in the lupine and barren respectively between summer 2019 and 2020 while the grass swale increased infiltration by 50 in summary this study highlights that surface vegetation plays an essential role in improving infiltration in summer and winter bare soils had a significantly lower infiltration capacity than the vegetated surfaces during the two year study period which can amplify runoff peaks and volumes in urban areas making such non vegetated areas undesirable for sustainable urban development this research also shows that repeated freeze thaw characteristic of cold maritime climate is detrimental to infiltration in manufactured and undisturbed terrains by studying two distinct winters one with a 32 day long snow cycle together with a few short lived ones the other with intermittent snow cover over five months soil freezing and reduced infiltration were linked to repeated cycles of snow rather than cumulative degree days of cooling represented by fdd table 2 this confirms previous hypotheses e g muthanna et al 2008 roseen et al 2009 and observations zaqout and andradóttir 2021 that repeated melting and refreezing of meltwater within the soil media is an influential factor for the formation of frost and deeper frost 15 cm compared to 5 cm in the first winter previous research conducted in cold coastal regions e g khan et al 2012 muthanna et al 2008 paus et al 2016 also emphasized the need for good drainage capacity to minimize the adverse effects of freeze thaw cycles this research however also suggests that vegetation cover can enhance the near surface soil porosity that is repeatedly exposed to freezing air temperature in cold maritime climates which in return improves the drainage capacity and minimizes the potential for frost formation 4 2 practical implications for urban landscapes suds are usually designed based on local experience using available residual material onsite rujner et al 2018 this study supports the importance of re manufacturing local soils that are poorly draining for usage in infiltration based urban drainage systems to avoid high water contents that can form impermeable frost lefevre et al 2009 muthanna et al 2008 the grass swale s good performance is attributed to the fact that the swale s media was man made and contained coarser material than the local soils present in the undisturbed terrains i e barren lupine and because of the vegetation cover common complications resulting from cold climate conditions are altered surface roughness increased runoff peaks and volumes reduced or impeded infiltration capacity due to frost dormant vegetation and infiltration of de icing salts roseen et al 2009 however such complications can be partially avoided by including a gravel based drainage layer and or underdrains to promote faster drainage lefevre et al 2009 maintenance practices might need to also be reconsidered which can include regular inspections following melt events to remove residual sand and sediments and prepare damages to vegetation and mulching to restore the moisture capacity and soil structure in spring caraco and claytor 1997 secondly large areas of bare soils should be avoided because of their significantly worse seasonal infiltration potential and concrete frost potential in winter bare grounds within the built environment also tend to be more affected by human activity and increased compaction than vegetated terrains due to the lack of a root system that can sustain porosity barbosa et al 2020 leaving robust vegetated terrains undisturbed with native plants may be a cost effective solution for peak flow and volume reduction during extreme summer rainfall events lastly the suds literature focuses on selecting plants that can tolerate highly variable soil moisture conditions the local soil ph and texture and pollutant loading prince george s county 1999 this study highlights that plant selection criteria need to be expanded to ensure optimal cold climate hydrological performance sparsely vegetated e g lupinus nootkatensis that fully shed their vegetation in winter and bare surfaces might not be a recommended practice because their susceptibility to the formation of cracks and macropore structures can lead to the bypassing of infiltrating water therefore jeopardizing the quality of groundwater lupine also tends to limit sun penetration to lower vegetation leaving the ground similar to bare soil and frost sensitive than the densely vegetated surfaces 4 3 data strengths and limitations assessing winter infiltration during frequent frost and snow cycles is not an easy task and difficult to optimize due to practical considerations time resources sunshine duration frost the approach taken in this study was to conduct single ring infiltrometer experiments within the first 20 cm of soils that are prone to frost formation as a robust time efficient method that minimally disturbed the soil the measured seasonal evolution of infiltration exhibited high similarity between the test points within the same terrain which supports the use of this technique to assess the impacts of frequent freeze and thaw infiltration within the same site fig 3 overall the measured infiltration in non vegetated terrain in this study conforms well with measurements in sandy loam soils which varied from 1 to 87 mm h 1 in frozen and nonfrozen conditions in a laboratory setting al houri et al 2009 the grass swale and lupine exhibited slightly higher summer and winter infiltration than a bioretention cell 450 mm h 1 and 5 10 mm h 1 in summer vs winter paus et al 2016 which can be attributed to the high porosity and low bulk density of icelandic andosols arnalds 2015 table 1 the study also confirms that spatial variability can be considerable even within small distances due to the heterogeneous nature of soils and frost formation infiltration rates measured in the field using ring infiltrometers are always higher than rainfall induced infiltration observed in real events due to the larger ponding depth hillel 1998 rawls et al 1983 the saturated hydraulic conductivity measured using ring infiltrometer was 2 to 5 times higher in this study compared to synthetic runoff experiments at the same site zaqout and andradóttir 2021 consistent with observations in bioretention cells made by paus et al 2016 bypass flow was observed in sparsely vegetated terrains undergoing frequent freeze thaw but not quantified in this study the use of intrusive metal rings may exacerbate the occurrence of macropore flow associated with frost heave and soil collapse as the wall of the metal infiltration ring was observed to separate from surrounding soil the inclusion of an outer ring dual ring infiltrometer is also expected to be vulnerable to bypass flow amplification as the surface area of the metal in contact with the soil would be larger to quantify the increased infiltration due to frost induced macropore formation non intrusive methods such as synthetic runoff events over a larger area e g bäckström davis et al 2012 rujner et al 2018 zaqout and andradóttir 2021 would be preferred such methods however are not suitable for resolving spatial variability require large amounts of running water and have a greater potential of generating synthetic freezing at the surface as discussed in section 2 2 lastly the performance of infiltration based systems can change considerably over extended periods years due to clogging vegetation roots growth and structural changes both natural due to soil deformations and intentional due to compaction and management practices therefore the findings presented in this study cannot be extrapolated to longer time periods 5 conclusions observations made over 28 months in this study provide insights into the hydrological performance of grass swales urban runoff generation the design and implementation of green infrastructure in cold maritime climates the field measurements were conducted in a grass swale with a permanent vegetation cover a lupine field and a barren terrain the results indicate that the grass swale was more resilient to the developing infiltration inhibiting frost compared to the other less vegetated terrains the swale s infiltration capacity was maintained throughout the study period despite the significant reduction in infiltration rates in winter compared to the summer and fall averages 630 vs 980 mm h 1 the sparsely non vegetated surfaces i e lupine and barren however were more susceptible to frost formation and frost heave than the grass swale which resulted in pronounced structural changes due to freeze thaw cycles and led to a structural breakdown in the two terrains the vegetated terrains were also considerably more infiltrative than the barren area throughout the study period suggesting that the bare ground can generate higher runoff rates and volumes and can lead to a higher flooding risk especially when soil frost is present in addition the structural deformation in those terrains which may lead to the formation of large cracks can result in groundwater contamination as the soil ceases to function as a filter and crack flow may carry organic soil particles to groundwater systems the findings of this research suggest that the stormwater control measures that provide sustainable urban drainage solutions in cold maritime areas should aim to minimize non vegetated or impermeable areas and promote the integration of green surfaces for flood mitigation because of frequent rain on snow and intermittent snowmelt the soils tend to be more saturated in cold maritime climates than in continental areas and thus well drained and vegetated soils are preferred to avoid media freezing and regular maintenance is required to sustain the

3571,to discuss the effects of discharge on the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in a meandering river a generalized meandering channel model was designed and the instantaneous velocities and water levels in thirteen cross sections and the digital elevations of the bed surfaces were measured the results show that for the same discharge the transverse water surface gradients are large at the downstream positions adjacent to the apex sections and small near the middle positions of the crossover areas with increasing discharge the transverse water surface gradients in the curved segments increase the transverse underflows strengthen and the transverse surface flows exhibit no obvious changes if the curvature of a meandering channel is large and there are a large number of sediment particles whose incipient velocities are smaller than the transverse underflow velocities near the apex sections then the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas are prone to sediment deposition and the frequency distributions of the bed surface elevations are positively skewed for the same cross section the cross sectional average velocity increases with increasing discharge for the same discharge the cross sectional average velocities are large near the middle positions of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections the thalweg swings randomly along the channel but its overall trend is approximately the same as that of the flow dynamic axis in a cross section the positions with large turbulent kinetic energy are located in the mainstream area and the average turbulent kinetic energy increases with increasing discharge keywords meandering channel transverse water surface gradient secondary flow velocity distribution riverbed evolution 1 introduction natural rivers are mostly curved after flow enters a bend due to the boundary restriction the fluid particles exhibit curvilinear motion states fluid particles in curvilinear motion states are controlled by not only gravity hydrodynamic pressure and friction which control fluid particles in linear motion states but also centrifugal force the existence of the additional centrifugal force makes the flow and sediment movements in curved channels fairly complicated to deepen the understanding of flow structure reveal riverbed evolution mechanisms and improve river management systems we must study flow and sediment movement in curved channels most of the published studies on flow and sediment movements in curved channels are conducted in open channels with only one bend for example leeder and bridges 1975 defined an empirical criterion for predicting the onset of flow separation in natural bends blanckaert and graf 2001 found that a cross sectional motion in a curved open channel usually contains two cells of circulation in addition to the classical helical motion a weaker counterrotating cell is also observed in the corner formed by the outer bank and the water surface blanckaert and graf 2004 suggested that the secondary flows in open channel bends redistribute the boundary shear stress and thereby significantly affect the riverbed topography lu et al 2004 developed an improved semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent simplec algorithm with velocity pressure free surface coupled correction and applied it to simulate the free surface flow in a curved open channel balen et al 2009 applied a large eddy simulation to study the complex bicellular pattern of the secondary flow and the turbulence characteristics in a curved open channel abhari et al 2010 experimentally simulated the flow pattern in a 90 bend and concluded that the flow pattern is greatly influenced by the secondary flow and centrifugal force riley and rhoads 2012 found that the tributary flow on the concave side of a natural bend can deflect the secondary flow toward the convex side inducing riverbed scour and inhibiting point bar development palmsten et al 2015 applied a new optical remote sensing technique to measure the riverbed morphology of a sandy bend marcin 2016 investigated the influence of the development of a single bend on multiple chute cutoff formation engel and rhoads 2017 deemed that the turbulence structure in a bend is linked to the curvature induced effects of the high momentum fluids toward the outer bank francisco et al 2017 presented a new method for the bed load measurements in a river bend hamidifar et al 2019 analyzed the effects of different tree configurations on the mean flow bed topography and bed shear stress in curved channels termini and moramarco 2020 concluded that the location of the maximum velocity varies not only along the bend but also along the water depth depending on the cross circulation properties and the convective flow acceleration natural rivers exhibit numerous consecutive curves the flow and sediment movement in a certain bend are affected by not only the geometric boundary and riverbed morphology but also those of the adjacent bends therefore many scholars have begun to study the flow and sediment movements in meandering channels for instance shiono et al 2008 compared the total energy losses due to friction secondary flow and interfacial turbulence in meandering channels with nonmobile and mobile beds yilmaz 2008 measured the sediment transport rate of an experimental meandering channel and concluded that it was closely related to the varying bottom shear stress afzalimehr and singh 2009 carried out field experiments in the five reaches of a meandering cobble bed river and found that the position of the maximum velocity was independent of the relative submergence and relative curvature duan and julien 2010 developed a 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model to simulate the complex interactions among secondary flow bed load and suspended sediment transport and bank erosion stoesser et al 2010 computed the turbulent flow in a meandering channel by different turbulence closure approaches jia et al 2013 studied the velocity distribution and riverbed deformation patterns in a meandering channel xu and bai 2013 held that highly sinuous channels have more uncertainties in riverbed morphology compared with slightly sinuous channels dey 2014 discussed the influences of hydrodynamic parameters on the evolution processe of a natural meandering channel binns and da silva 2015 proposed an equation to predict the riverbed development time in alluvial meandering streams mera et al 2015 analyzed the spatial turbulence distributions based on a physical froude model of a river mero reach for bankfull flow and flood conditions termini 2015 investigated the influence of momentum transport by cross stream circulation on the bed shear stress redistribution in a meandering channel dash and khatua 2016 investigated the effects of the geometry and flow parameters on the meandering channel resistances ferreira da silva and ebrahimi 2017 suggested that the erodibility difference between riverbed and bank significantly affects the riverbed evolution in a meandering channel shan et al 2018 proposed a model for predicting the depth averaged flow directions in a meandering compound channel with vegetated floodplains shahosainy et al 2018 discussed the effects of hydraulic geometry parameters on flow structure and riverbed evolution in a meandering river moncho esteve et al 2018 conducted a large eddy simulation to analyze the effect exerted by the inundation level on the flow structure pan et al 2019 discussed the effects of asymmetrically vegetated floodplains on the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity of a meandering main channel lanzoni et al 2018 estimated the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in a meandering alluvial river mohanty 2019 analyzed the effect of sinuosity on the boundary shear stress distributions in a meandering compound channel pradhan and khatua 2019 proposed a new discharge estimation method at the apex sections in a compound meandering channel kim et al 2020 performed 3d numerical simulations of meandering channels to investigate the impact of meander geometry on velocity distribution somsook et al 2020 illustrated the spatial distribution of classical secondary circulation in a meandering estuary for both flood and ebb phases the reach downstream of the three gorges dam in china is a typical meandering riverway in fig 1 since the three gorges dam was built most of the upstream sediments are intercepted in the reservoir area making the flow discharged from the dam basically clear water the sediment carrying capacity of clear water is usually larger than its sediment load so sediment from the riverbed can become entrained which greatly influences the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution of the downstream riverway as a world famous national project the three gorges dam not only provides water storage and power generation but also is used for many functions such as flood control navigation improvement and water transfer to ensure dam safety and harmonize the water supply and demand of the downstream regions the flow output discharged from the dam in different periods is varied how discharge affects the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in a meandering riverway remains unknown therefore in this paper a generalized meandering river model was designed and the instantaneous velocities and water levels in thirteen cross sections and the digital elevations of the bed surfaces were measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv a digital water level altimeter and a 3d laser scanner respectively the influences of discharge on the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in the experimental model were discussed 2 experimental arrangements the plane shape of a meandering riverway in nature is close to a sine curve as a rough approximation the curve can be fitted by a series of arcs and straight lines shan et al 2018 pan et al 2019 the generalized meandering channel model was constructed in the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering at sichuan university in fig 2 its sinuosity is 1 38 l λ 1 38 and belongs to a moderate sinuosity which was selected referring to the sinuosity range 1 1 3 0 shao and wang 2005 of the changjiang river in china a pump a triangular weir and an energy dissipation grid were installed upstream of the experimental model a grit chamber and a tail water outlet were built at the downstream end the channel bottom was horizontal and its geometric parameters such as bending radius rc central angle φ meander belt wavelength λ meander belt width w crossover area length l flow path length l channel width b and channel depth h are shown in fig 3 a multidimensional measurement system including a measuring bridge a measuring platform a numerical control equipment produced by the in beijing was installed on the model sidewalls after the measuring devices were fixed on the measurement platform in fig 2 the experimenters could horizontally and vertically manipulate the measurement platform by the numerical control equipment so that the results of the measuring devices met the measurement requirements natural river sediment was used in the experiment and its gradation is presented in fig 4 a layer of natural sediment with a thickness of approximately 10 cm was first filled to the meandering channel and then the experimenters injected an appropriate volume of clear water into the meandering channel to make the sediment naturally dense and then the experimenters horizontally scraped the sediment layer by a gradienter to a thickness of approximately 8 cm so as to complete the preparation of the initial bed surface the inlet discharges corresponding to the experimental cases increased in turn but the inlet discharge for the same experimental case was constant and the outlet conditions were always free outfalls in table 1 the experimental model included two complete meanders but the measurements were only carried out within the central meander a total of 13 cross sections were measured in the test area cs01 cs13 in fig 3 the measurements of each cross section were collected along 21 vertical lines with a uniform adjacent space of 3 5 cm 1 21 in fig 3 water level measurements were performed along all the vertical lines by a digital water level altimeter in fig 2 with a sampling frequency of 100 hz and a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm and the sampling duration for each vertical line was at least 80 s the velocity measurements were conducted only for the vertical lines 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 and 19 by an acoustic doppler velocimeter in fig 2 with a 3d side view probe a sampling frequency of 25 hz and a measurement accuracy of 1 mm s the velocity measurements of a vertical line started near the water surface and ended near the bed surface and the sampling duration at any a measured point was at least 80 s the vertical spaces of the measured points in the same experimental case were the same but these spaces varied among the experimental cases the vertical spaces corresponding to experimental cases ① ⑥ were 1 cm 1 cm 1 5 cm 2 cm 2 cm and 2 cm respectively before the water level and velocity measurements of the first experimental case were conducted a constant discharge was maintained for more than 48 h to continuously scour the initial bed surface then the experimenters collected the bed load at the outlet and weighed the collected bed load per hour by an electronic balance with a measurement accuracy of 1 g in fig 4 a therein the collected bed load is first dried by an electric oven before weighing the mass when the bed load transport rate was less than 50 g h and the movement of the large particles on the bed surface can t be observed by human eyes we considered the bed surface stable and started to measure the water level and velocity data when the first group of water level and velocity measurements was completed the experimenters turned off the pump after the bed surface was naturally dried a handheld 3d laser scanner in fig 2 with an approximate sampling density of 1 point mm2 and a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm was used to scan the bed surface morphology then the experimenters restarted the pump set the discharge as the designed value of the second experimental case and maintained this constant discharge to continuously scour the bed surface for more than 48 h and subsequently measured the sediment transport rate when the bed surface became stable again the measurements for the second experimental case were carried out other experimental cases were then conducted following the above mentioned steps 3 calculational methods to facilitate the analyses an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system is established as shown in fig 3 the coordinate origin is located at the midpoint of the bottom edge of the initial cross section cs01 taking the flow direction as a reference the positive x axis is along the longitudinal flow path the y axis is along the transverse direction positive towards the right and the z axis is perpendicular to the xoy coordinate plane positive upward in this paper the thalweg is defined as the line connecting the lowest points of the cross sections along the meandering channel the line connecting the points with the maximum depth averaged velocity for each cross section is defined as the flow dynamic axis in addition

notations 4 results and discussion 4 1 transverse water surface gradient as shown in fig 5 in the curved segments of the meandering channel the water surfaces near the concave sides are always higher than those near the convex sides and the transverse water surface gradients increase with increasing discharge to discuss the formation mechanism of the transverse water surface gradient we select a fluid particle p dm u w r near the water surface of a cross section cs xi in a curved segment and analyze its subjected forces in fig 6 where r dm u w represent the curvature radius the mass and the time averaged longitudinal velocity of the fluid particle respectively when fluid particle p reaches a curved segment its movement is mainly dominated by gravity dg and centrifugal force dfc gravity and centrifugal force are both mass forces the gravitational direction is vertical downward and the centrifugal force direction is horizontal from the convex side to the concave side so the resultant mass force will be inclined from the upper part of the convex side to the lower part of the concave side the water surface is an isobaric surface therefore for a constant flow the direction of the resultant mass force on a fluid particle near the water surface is approximately consistent with the direction of the normal vector of the corresponding water surface position as described by the following mathematical relationship 16 d f c dg u w 2 gr tan θ d z w dr where u w r and g are all greater than 0 so when dr is greater than 0 dzw must be greater than 0 namely the water surface near the concave side is always higher than that near the convex side as shown in fig 7 when the discharge increases the time averaged longitudinal velocities of the fluid particles near the water surface increase so the centrifugal forces on the fluid particles will also increase consequently the transverse inclination angle θ increases and the transverse water surface gradient will also increase in addition it can be found that for the same discharge the transverse water surface gradients are large at the downstream positions cs02 and cs08 adjacent to the apex sections and small near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel when the mainstream reaches an apex section the mainstream direction dominated by the inertia cannot be adjusted in a timely manner therefore the mainstream will directly rush against the opposite concave sidewall in this process part of the flow kinetic energy will be converted into gravitational potential energy which will undoubtedly increase the water levels at the downstream positions adjacent to the apex sections so the transverse water surface gradients also increase because of the rotational symmetry of the adjacent curved segments relative to the middle positions of the crossover areas the water surface rising directions of the adjacent curved segments are opposite the time averaged water surface can be deemed a continuous surface so its shape cannot change suddenly and the change can only be gradual therefore only when the transverse water surface gradients near the middle positions of the crossover areas approximately equal 0 can this kind of gradual transition occur as pointed out above when the mainstreams cross the apex sections and rush against the opposite concave sidewalls a part of the flow kinetic energy is converted into gravitational potential energy which increases the transverse water surface gradients in the downstream regions adjacent to the apex sections cs01 and cs07 however this is only a cause for that the transverse water surface gradients in the downstream region adjacent to an apex section are larger than the corresponding values in the upstream region adjacent to the apex section as shown in fig 7 after the initial bed surface is worked by the flow the convex sides are aggraded and the concave sides are degrade in the downstream regions adjacent to the apex sections generating obvious transverse bed surface gradients which can also contribute to the increasing transverse water surface gradients how do the transverse bed surface gradients influence the transverse water surface gradients we analyze the microelement shown in fig 8 to answer this question the centrifugal force fc acting on the microelement the water pressures p 1 p 2 p 3 acting on its left and right sides and its bottom and the friction force ff acting on its bottom are calculated according to formulas 17 21 the gravity acting on the microelement and the water pressures acting on its front and back sides are not considered because they are irrelevant to the following deductions 17 f c 1 2 ρ 2 h r d z w d z s α x i r u p x i r 2 r 18 p 1 1 2 ρ g h r 2 19 p 2 1 2 ρ g h r d z w d z s 2 20 p 3 1 2 ρ g 2 h r d z w d z s 1 cos β 21 f f τ b cos β where α x i r is a correction coefficient u p x i r is the depth averaged longitudinal velocity τ b is the friction force per unit area on the microelement bottom the transverse dynamic equation related to the microelement can be expressed as follows 22 p 1 p 2 p 3 sin β f c f f cos β 0 by substituting formulas 17 21 into equation 22 the following equation is obtained 23 1 2 ρ g h r 2 1 2 ρ g h r d z w d z s 2 1 2 ρ g 2 h r d z w d z s tan β 1 2 ρ 2 h r d z w d z s α x

z w d z s are high order small quantities and thus are assumed to be negligible therefore the transverse dynamic equation can be simplified as follows 25 1 α x i r u p x i r 2 2 r g h r d z w α x i r u p x i r 2 rg α x i r u p x i r 2 2 r g h r d z s added term τ b ρ g h r according to equation 25 in the downstream region adjacent to an apex section the bed surface morphology of that the convex side is aggraded and the concave side is degrade can increase the transverse water surface gradients which accounts for the transverse water surface gradients being larger in the downstream region adjacent to an apex section than the corresponding values in the upstream region adjacent to the apex section 4 2 secondary flow when the fluids flow through a curved segment due to the driving effect of the centrifugal forces the water surface near the concave side will rise and that near the convex side will decrease forming transverse water surface gradients the centrifugal force is proportional to the squared time averaged longitudinal velocity because the time averaged longitudinal velocities are usually large near the water surface and small near the bed surface the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles near the water surface are large and the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles near the bed surface are small however the transverse pressure differences from the concave side to the convex side caused by the transverse water surface gradients are constant along the water depth therefore as shown in fig 9 when the centrifugal forces and the transverse pressure differences are combined the resultant action is equivalent to a force couple the equivalent couple will drive the upper fluids to flow towards the concave side and the lower fluids to flow towards the convex side which is the fundamental reason for the secondary flow based on the above analyses if the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 the equivalent couple disappears causing the secondary flow to disappear however fig 10 indicates that the secondary flows do not disappear near the middle or even the outlet of the crossover area and the rotational directions of the secondary flows are entirely consistent with those of the secondary flows in the adjacent upstream curved segment the rotating secondary flow possesses rotational kinetic energy and the energy dissipation must go through a process therefore the position where the secondary flow disappears occurs downstream from where the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 this is why the rotational direction of the secondary flow at the outlet of the upstream crossover area does not change in addition when the discharge increases the transverse underflows in the curved segments strengthen while the transverse surface flows exhibit no obvious changes as shown in fig 7 when the discharge increases the time averaged longitudinal velocities of the fluid particles near the water surface usually increase so the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles will also increase these increases in the centrifugal forces will cause increases in the transverse water surface gradients so the transverse pressure differences from the concave side to convex side are also increased because the directions of the centrifugal forces are opposite to those of the transverse pressure differences the incremental changes cancel each other out thus the transverse surface flows exhibit no obvious changes the situation near the bed surface is quite different than that near the water surface when the discharge increases due to the intense retardation of the armor layers the time averaged longitudinal velocities near the bed surface do not significantly increase so the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles near the bed surface are almost unchanged however the increases in the transverse water surface gradients will increase the transverse pressure differences acting on the fluid particles near the bed surface and thus enhance the transverse driving effects on the transverse underflows which causes the enhancement of the transverse underflows 4 3 bed surface elevations as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the elevation frequency distribution of the artificially paved initial bed surface approximately presents a thin and tall normal distribution however after the initial bed surface is worked by the discharge of 25 52 l s sediment deposition occurs between the convex sides of the apex sections and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas the local sediment depositions increase the quantitative proportion of the higher elevation points relative to the total sampling points so the frequency distribution of the bed surface elevations becomes positively skewed the bed surface elevations in areas other than the sediment deposition regions are decreased to different extents so the mode of the elevation frequency distribution decreases and the corresponding distribution shifts as a whole toward the direction of decreasing elevation the local sediment depositions and the elevation decreases at most bed surface positions naturally enlarge the range of the elevation frequency distribution which is the main factor controlling the fat and short elevation frequency distribution of the water worked bed surface since there is no sediment supply at the inlet of the experimental meandering channel most of the deposited sediment is transported from the upstream regions to the sediment deposition regions however why does sediment deposition occur in the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas the answer is closely related to the curvature of the experimental meandering channel and the secondary flow movement due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel when the mainstream reaches an apex section the mainstream direction dominated by the inertia cannot be adjusted in a timely manner therefore the mainstream will directly rush against the opposite concave sidewall after that the mainstream rapidly adjusts its flow direction and flows near the sidewall connected with the concave side of the apex section due to the larger momentum of the mainstream and the intensely scoured bed surface below the mainstream the corresponding bed surface elevations decrease considerably meanwhile the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas become the mainstream separation regions cs01 cs05 and 0 y b 2 cs07 cs11 and b 2 y 0 fig 7 a shows that when the discharge is 25 52 l s the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the mainstream separation regions are not too large which undoubtedly provides a necessary condition for sediment deposition when the sediment particles on the upstream bed surfaces are transported to an apex section due to the transverse driving effect of the secondary underflow many sediment particles will enter the mainstream separation region and deposit there fig 10 a as time passes the sediment deposition volume gradually increases ultimately forming a narrow and long sediment deposition region because the secondary flow intensities in the experimental meandering channel are relatively small the secondary underflows can only transversely drive the small sediment particles not the large ones this is why the particle sizes of the deposited sediments are much smaller than the maximum particle size of the experimental sediment furthermore the particle sizes in a sediment deposition region also gradually decrease along the longitudinal direction which is obviously caused by the dissipation of flow kinetic energy along the longitudinal direction in other words the velocity distribution in a meandering channel is non uniform enough that transverse and longitudinal particle size classifications can occur anywhere if the curvature of a meandering channel is large and there are a large number of sediment particles whose incipient velocities are less than the transverse underflow velocities near the apex sections then the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas are prone to sediment deposition this finding has important guiding significance in relevant practical engineering applications if the curvature of a meandering riverway is large and its riverbed sediment gradation is wide many engineering designs regarding wharf construction water intake site selection waterway regulation etc should avoid the sediment deposition regions stated above to reduce the damage of sediment deposition as pointed out above in the experimental meandering channel the mainstream is adjacent to the convex side when the flow reaches an apex section and the sediment deposition occurs in the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas these two phenomena both reduce the curvature of the experimental meandering channel which is undoubtedly the most direct evidence of automatic river adjustment in short if there is a prominent factor affecting the flow and sediment transport in a natural riverway the general trend of the flow and sediment movement always weaken the effect caused the by prominent factor due to the large proportion of the small particles in the experimental sediment and the relatively small first stage discharge 25 52 l s when the initial bed surface is continuously scoured and then stabilizes there is still a large amount of small particles among the large particles near the bed surface and the armor layer formed at this stage is cannot resist the flow erosion corresponding to a larger discharge when the discharge increases to 33 45 l s many small particles among the large particles near the bed surface will be entrained by the flow so the equilibrium bed surface elevations generally decrease when the discharge increases to 42 09 or 51 37 l s the mode of the elevation frequency distribution continues to decrease and the figure still shifts as a whole toward the direction of decreasing elevation only at this stage does the decreasing extent of the elevation mode become small and the change in the elevation frequency distribution slows which indicates that the stability of the armor layer increases with increasing discharge notably when the discharge increases the average particle size near the bed surface increases due to the more intense flow erosion so the stability of the armor layer increases but the increase in the average particle size near the bed surface is only one factor that enhances the stability of the armor layer when the fluid flows through the bed surface the turbulence and impingement of the fluid will cause the bed surface to vibrate slightly and allow the sediment particles near the bed surface to selectively embed themselves into stable positions which will also enhance the stability of the bed surface in addition the elevation frequency distributions corresponding to inlet discharges of 33 45 and 42 09 l s are very similar in shape this shows that when the discharge increases from 33 45 to 42 09 l s the sediment erosion volumes at the different positions of the bed surface are approximately the same and the riverbed evolves via approximately uniform subsidence when the discharge increases to 65 68 l s sediment deposition occurs again in the deposition regions which makes the elevation frequency distribution fatter and shorter and the positively skewed characteristic more obvious this indicates that although the armor layer can protect the riverbed to a certain extent its effect is fairly limited once the flow intensity exceeds the limit that the static armor layer can bear the static armor layer can no longer resist the corresponding flow erosion when the discharge increases to 65 68 l s the flow intensity is too large and the armor layer corresponding to a discharge of 51 37 l s can no longer resist flow erosion at this stage so the riverbed undergoes a drastic evolution henceforth only after the bed surface reached a new erosion and deposition equilibrium state does the riverbed reconstitution tend to stop when the armor layer corresponding to the discharge of 51 37 l s is destroyed the small particles under the armor layer are exposed and then transported downstream by the flow when the small particles are transported to an apex section due to the transverse driving effect of the transverse underflows caused by the secondary flows many of the small particles enter the sediment deposition region and deposit there which is why redeposition occurs in the sediment deposition region due to the serious destruction of the armor layer worked by the discharge of 51 37 l s the positions where the mainstream goes are seriously scoured by the discharge of 65 68 l s when the elevations at the positions where the mainstream goes decrease and those in the sediment deposition regions increase the range of the elevation frequency distribution certainly increases therefore the elevation frequency distribution becomes fatter and shorter and the positively skewed characteristic becomes obvious when the discharge increases to 74 83 l s the sediments near the concave sidewalls of the apex sections are seriously eroded and a large area of channel bottom is exposed this situation is closely relevant to the impact effect of the mainstreams on the opposite concave sidewalls when the mainstream reaches an apex section the mainstream direction dominated by the inertia cannot be adjusted in a timely manner owing to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel therefore the mainstream directly rushes against the opposite concave sidewall which can cause strong flow turbulence and erosion of the riverbed in the mainstream impact region due to the limited particle size of the experimental sediment the maximum anti erosion ability of the armor layer is limited for the discharge of 74 83 l s the armor layer in the mainstream impact region can no longer resist the mainstream erosion after the sediment in the mainstream impact region is completely eroded the sediment around the mainstream impact region becomes unstable due to lose of support and eventually becomes partially eroded which is the reason for the expansion of the exposed channel bottom along the upstream and downstream regions to a certain extent from subsequent analyses we can conclude that the more downstream an apex section is located the larger its cross sectional average velocity is moreover the larger the apex sectional average velocity is the stronger the impact effect of the mainstream on the opposite concave sidewall is and the larger the exposed bottom area is for this discharge a local bulge with an elevation of approximately 0 appears in the elevation frequency distribution under the condition of laying uniformly measured points the frequency corresponding to the local bulge represents the approximate proportion of the exposed bottom area relative to the total bottom area in a complete meander 4 4 cross sectional average velocity fig 13 shows that for the same discharge the cross sectional average velocities are large near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections cs01 cs07 and cs13 which are obviously related to the existence of the sediment deposition regions as shown in fig 11 the cross sectional average velocities are basically large at the positions where the transverse width and vertical height of the sediment deposition regions are large large sediment deposition volumes are present at these positions which significantly narrows the transverse effective widths of the channel thereby the cross sectional average velocities are large due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel the mainstreams near the apex sections are adjacent to the convex sides which makes it difficult for sediment depositions to occur near the apex sections therefore the cross sectional areas near the apex sections are large and the cross sectional average velocities are small as shown in fig 14 for any a discharge fr 2 2 is large near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections cs01 cs07 and cs13 which are completely consistent with the changes in cross sectional average velocities along the meandering channel to explore the main reason behind this consistency we analyze the froude number fr according to formula 12 fr 2 2 is equal to the ratio of the average kinetic energy to the average potential energy of the fluid particles in a cross section therefore an increasing fr 2 2 implies the conversion of a part of the flow potential energy into the flow kinetic energy whereas a decreasing fr 2 2 implies the conversion of a part of the flow kinetic energy into the flow potential energy these results suggest that the cross sectional average velocity increases mainly due to the conversion of the flow potential energy into the flow kinetic energy whereas the decrease in cross sectional average velocity is ostensibly due to the conversion of the flow kinetic energy into the flow potential energy and the existence of the sediment deposition regions is the external cause for the energy conversion the discharge is determined by the cross sectional area and the cross sectional average velocity as shown in fig 7 or fig 10 when the discharge increases the cross sectional areas also increase furthermore fig 13 shows that for the same cross section the cross sectional average velocity also increases with increasing discharge then why cannot the increase in the discharge only cause the increases in the cross sectional areas or the increases in the cross sectional average velocities especially when the transverse width of the channel is the same why cannot the increase in the discharge only cause the increases in the water depths the increases in the water depths can be realized by the way that the flow scours the riverbed and can also be achieved by increasing the cross sectional average water levels when the flow scours the riverbed composed of non uniform sediment the average particle size near the bed surface will increase once the armor layer is completely formed the bed surface is basically stable so it does not contribute enough to the increases in the cross sectional areas however if the cross sectional areas are increased by increasing the water levels the water surface will be subjected to gravitational obstruction therefore when the discharge increases although the cross sectional areas also increase their increments are not enough to compensate for the discharge increment so the cross sectional average velocities must be increased this phenomenon can also be explained by the minimum variance theory proposed by langbein and leopold 1964 the theory points out that when the conditions of the flow and sediment discharged in a natural river change the hydraulic factors will accordingly adjust themselves to the changes but the general trend is to minimize the total adjustment amount of the hydraulic factors under the natural state the adjustment will not be undertaken by a single hydraulic factor but will be scattered among all hydraulic factors so that the change in each hydraulic factor will be as small as possible this explains why for the same cross section the cross sectional area and the cross sectional average velocity synchronously increase with increasing discharge in fact the minimum variance theory is also a direct expression of river adaptability or automatic adjustment in addition it can be found that for any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander the cross sectional average velocity corresponding to the downstream cross section is slightly larger than that corresponding to the upstream cross section since the initial bed surface is horizontally paved with evenly stirred nonuniform sediment and the experimental flow is completely driven by gravity the gravitational potential energies corresponding to any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander must be decreased there are two ways to decrease the gravitational potential energies one is a decrease in the bed surface elevations and the other is a decrease in the cross sectional average water levels due to the strict geometric periodicity of the experimental meandering channel and the similar sediment gradation at the different positions of the initial bed surface the elevation distributions corresponding to any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander are fairly similar in fig 11 and then the decrease in the gravitational potential energies is mainly caused by the decrease in the cross sectional average water levels when the riverbed profile morphologies corresponding to any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander are approximately the same the decrease in the average water level corresponding to the downstream cross section will make the cross sectional area slightly decrease so the cross sectional average velocity will slightly increase 4 5 depth averaged velocity and flow dynamic axis as shown in fig 15 due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel when the flow reaches an apex section the mainstream is adjacent to the convex side when the mainstream is dominated by its own inertia some fluid particles with larger longitudinal velocities will be inclined to the concave sides due to the transversal driving effects of the centrifugal forces which makes the mainstream near the apex section split generating the flow separation phenomenon henceforth the centrifugal forces and the flow inertia continue to exert their effects in the regions from the apex sections to the inlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas cs01 cs03 and cs07 cs09 so the flow separation points gradually change from positions near the convex sides to near the channel centerline as shown in fig 7 b with increasing discharge the time averaged longitudinal velocities of the fluid particles near the water surfaces of the apex sections correspondingly increase so the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles also increase which makes the flow separation phenomenon more obvious after the mainstream separates near an apex section a stream jet rushes to the opposite concave sidewall while the other stream jet continues near the convex side therein the stream jet rushing to the opposite concave sidewall has a stronger scouring effect on the riverbed which is not difficult to conclude from the locations of the thalwegs shown in fig 16 influenced by many uncertain factors such as the flow pulsation the irregularity of the sediment particles and the diversity of the arrangement patterns of the sediment particles the locations of the thalwegs randomly swing along the meandering channel which is undoubtedly the most direct reflection of the complicated fine structure of the armor layers however the overall trends of the thalwegs are approximately consistent with those of the flow dynamic axes the flow dynamic axis corresponds to where the flow momentum is the largest and the riverbed is most strongly scoured so there is a large probability that the thalweg will appear there after the mainstream separates near an apex section for the two stream jets the stream jet near the convex side impacts the formation and development of the sediment deposition region the sediment particles in the deposition region are completely transported from the adjacent upstream apex section by this stream jet the two stream jets will finally converge near the middle position of the adjacent downstream crossover area and when they reach the next apex section they will separate again and then converge again to circulate 4 6 turbulence characteristics fig 17 shows that in a cross section the positions with large turbulent kinetic energy are located in the mainstream area the resultant velocities in the mainstream area are large so the kinetic energies of the fluid particles are also large if the kinetic energy of a fluid particle is large its motion state would be more unstable any small disturbance can easily trigger a large instantaneous velocity fluctuation so the positions with large turbulent kinetic energy usually appear in the mainstream area in addition the cross sectional average turbulent kinetic energies are large near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections cs01 cs07 and cs13 and increase with increasing discharge these two phenomena are closely relevant to the reynolds number distributions along the meandering channel the reynolds number represents the ratio of inertial force to viscous force the larger the reynolds number is the stronger the momentum exchange between the adjacent fluid layers is and the greater the cross sectional average turbulent kinetic energy is as shown in fig 18 the reynolds numbers are large near the middle positions of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections and increase with increasing discharge this means that the cross sectional average turbulent kinetic energies are large near the middle positions of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections and increase with increasing discharge this observation is entirely consistent with the conclusions based on fig 17 as shown in fig 19 near the bed surface the longitudinal transverse and vertical turbulence intensities tu tv and tw are approximately equal which indicates that the velocity fluctuations near the bed surface are approximately isotropic however in the mainstream areas the transverse turbulence intensity is obviously greater than the vertical turbulence intensity and the longitudinal turbulence intensity is significantly greater than the transverse turbulence intensity which indicates that the velocity fluctuations in the mainstream areas are anisotropic and that the longitudinal velocity fluctuation contributes the most to the turbulent kinetic energy while the transverse velocity fluctuation contributes the second most and the vertical velocity fluctuation contributes the least the large turbulent kinetic energy at a certain position can indicate that the velocity fluctuation amplitude of the fluid particle at the position is large but it does not mean that the kinetic energy loss at the position is large because the dissipation rate of the flow kinetic energy is also closely related to the velocity fluctuation frequency in fig 20 the turbulent kinetic energy near the bed surface is small so the velocity fluctuation amplitude is small however due to the high velocity fluctuation frequency the flow kinetic energy consumed near the bed surface is quite large it is just because the retardation effect of the riverbed on the flow is mainly concentrated near the bed surface that the longitudinal velocity distributions shown in fig 7 exhibit large vertical gradients near the bed surface in addition fig 20 a shows that the negative fluctuation amplitudes of longitudinal velocities in the mainstream areas are much greater than the positive fluctuation amplitudes indicating that the fluid particles in the mainstream areas transfer energy to lower fluid layers because kinetic energy dissipation mainly occurs near the bed surface the fluid near the bed surface must absorb energy from the mainstream areas to continuously flow the phenomenon that the negative fluctuation amplitudes of the mainstream velocities are much greater than the positive fluctuation amplitudes is undoubtedly the most direct evidence of this energy transfer 5 conclusions six groups of laboratory experiments were conducted in a meandering channel the inlet discharge was set as the control variable the instantaneous velocities and water levels in thirteen cross sections and the digital elevations of the bed surfaces were measured in detail several conclusions concerning the effects of discharge on the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in the meandering channel were drawn 1 for the same discharge the transverse water surface gradients are large at the downstream positions adjacent to the apex sections and small near the middle positions of the crossover areas when the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 the secondary flow does not disappear and where the secondary flow disappears lags behind where the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 with increasing discharge the transverse water surface gradients in the curved segments increase the transverse underflows strengthen and the transverse surface flows exhibit no obvious changes 2 when the sediment carrying capacity of the upstream flow is in an unsaturated state the bed surface composed of non uniformly sized sediment will be changed by the flow after the smaller particles are washed away the average particle size of the remaining particles increases and the riverbed will ultimately form a static armor layer the static armor layer can protect the riverbed but its effect is fairly limited once the flow intensity exceeds the limit that the static armor layer can bear the static armor layer can no longer resist the corresponding flow erosion 3 if the curvature of a meandering channel is large and there are a large number of sediment particles whose incipient velocities are less than the transverse underflow velocities near the apex sections then the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas are prone to sediment deposition and the frequency distributions of the bed surface elevations are positively skewed 4 for the same cross section the cross sectional average velocity increases with increasing discharge for the same discharge the cross sectional average velocities are large near the middle positions of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections 5 affected by many uncertain factors such as the flow turbulence irregularity of sediment particles and diversity of sediment arrangements the thalweg always swings randomly along the channel but its overall trend is approximately the same as that of the flow dynamic axis 6 in a cross section the positions with large turbulent kinetic energy are located in the mainstream area and the average turbulent kinetic energy increases with increasing discharge the longitudinal velocity fluctuation contributes the most to the turbulent kinetic energy while the transverse velocity fluctuation contributes the second most and the vertical velocity fluctuation contributes the least the velocity fluctuations near the bed surface are approximately isotropic while those in the mainstream area are anisotropic declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

3571,to discuss the effects of discharge on the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in a meandering river a generalized meandering channel model was designed and the instantaneous velocities and water levels in thirteen cross sections and the digital elevations of the bed surfaces were measured the results show that for the same discharge the transverse water surface gradients are large at the downstream positions adjacent to the apex sections and small near the middle positions of the crossover areas with increasing discharge the transverse water surface gradients in the curved

kinetic energy are located in the mainstream area and the average turbulent kinetic energy increases with increasing discharge keywords meandering channel transverse water surface gradient secondary flow velocity distribution riverbed evolution 1 introduction natural rivers are mostly curved after flow enters a bend due to the boundary restriction the fluid particles exhibit curvilinear motion states fluid particles in curvilinear motion states are controlled by not only gravity hydrodynamic pressure and friction which control fluid particles in linear motion states but also centrifugal force the existence of the additional centrifugal force makes the flow and sediment movements in curved channels fairly complicated to deepen the understanding of flow structure reveal riverbed evolution mechanisms and improve river management systems we must study flow and sediment movement in curved channels most of the published studies on flow and sediment movements in curved channels are conducted in open channels with only one bend for example leeder and bridges 1975 defined an empirical criterion for predicting the onset of flow separation in natural bends blanckaert and graf 2001 found that a cross sectional motion in a curved open channel usually contains two cells of circulation in addition to the classical helical motion a weaker counterrotating cell is also observed in the corner formed by the outer bank and the water surface blanckaert and graf 2004 suggested that the secondary flows in open channel bends redistribute the boundary shear stress and thereby significantly affect the riverbed topography lu et al 2004 developed an improved semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent simplec algorithm with velocity pressure free surface coupled correction and applied it to simulate the free surface flow in a curved open channel balen et al 2009 applied a large eddy simulation to study the complex bicellular pattern of the secondary flow and the turbulence characteristics in a curved open channel abhari et al 2010 experimentally simulated the flow pattern in a 90 bend and concluded that the flow pattern is greatly influenced by the secondary flow and centrifugal force riley and rhoads 2012 found that the tributary flow on the concave side of a natural bend can deflect the secondary flow toward the convex side inducing riverbed scour and inhibiting point bar development palmsten et al 2015 applied a new optical remote sensing technique to measure the riverbed morphology of a sandy bend marcin 2016 investigated the influence of the development of a single bend on multiple chute cutoff formation engel and rhoads 2017 deemed that the turbulence structure in a bend is linked to the curvature induced effects of the high momentum fluids toward the outer bank francisco et al 2017 presented a new method for the bed load measurements in a river bend hamidifar et al 2019 analyzed the effects of different tree configurations on the mean flow bed topography and bed shear stress in curved channels termini and moramarco 2020 concluded that the location of the maximum velocity varies not only along the bend but also along the water depth depending on the cross circulation properties and the convective flow acceleration natural rivers exhibit numerous consecutive curves the flow and sediment movement in a certain bend are affected by not only the geometric boundary and riverbed morphology but also those of the adjacent bends therefore many scholars have begun to study the flow and sediment movements in meandering channels for instance shiono et al 2008 compared the total energy losses due to friction secondary flow and interfacial turbulence in meandering channels with nonmobile and mobile beds yilmaz 2008 measured the sediment transport rate of an experimental meandering channel and concluded that it was closely related to the varying bottom shear stress afzalimehr and singh 2009 carried out field experiments in the five reaches of a meandering cobble bed river and found that the position of the maximum velocity was independent of the relative submergence and relative curvature duan and julien 2010 developed a 2d depth averaged hydrodynamic model to simulate the complex interactions among secondary flow bed load and suspended sediment transport and bank erosion stoesser et al 2010 computed the turbulent flow in a meandering channel by different turbulence closure approaches jia et al 2013 studied the velocity distribution and riverbed deformation patterns in a meandering channel xu and bai 2013 held that highly sinuous channels have more uncertainties in riverbed morphology compared with slightly sinuous channels dey 2014 discussed the influences of hydrodynamic parameters on the evolution processe of a natural meandering channel binns and da silva 2015 proposed an equation to predict the riverbed development time in alluvial meandering streams mera et al 2015 analyzed the spatial turbulence distributions based on a physical froude model of a river mero reach for bankfull flow and flood conditions termini 2015 investigated the influence of momentum transport by cross stream circulation on the bed shear stress redistribution in a meandering channel dash and khatua 2016 investigated the effects of the geometry and flow parameters on the meandering channel resistances ferreira da silva and ebrahimi 2017 suggested that the erodibility difference between riverbed and bank significantly affects the riverbed evolution in a meandering channel shan et al 2018 proposed a model for predicting the depth averaged flow directions in a meandering compound channel with vegetated floodplains shahosainy et al 2018 discussed the effects of hydraulic geometry parameters on flow structure and riverbed evolution in a meandering river moncho esteve et al 2018 conducted a large eddy simulation to analyze the effect exerted by the inundation level on the flow structure pan et al 2019 discussed the effects of asymmetrically vegetated floodplains on the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity of a meandering main channel lanzoni et al 2018 estimated the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in a meandering alluvial river mohanty 2019 analyzed the effect of sinuosity on the boundary shear stress distributions in a meandering compound channel pradhan and khatua 2019 proposed a new discharge estimation method at the apex sections in a compound meandering channel kim et al 2020 performed 3d numerical simulations of meandering channels to investigate the impact of meander geometry on velocity distribution somsook et al 2020 illustrated the spatial distribution of classical secondary circulation in a meandering estuary for both flood and ebb phases the reach downstream of the three gorges dam in china is a typical meandering riverway in fig 1 since the three gorges dam was built most of the upstream sediments are intercepted in the reservoir area making the flow discharged from the dam basically clear water the sediment carrying capacity of clear water is usually larger than its sediment load so sediment from the riverbed can become entrained which greatly influences the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution of the downstream riverway as a world famous national project the three gorges dam not only provides water storage and power generation but also is used for many functions such as flood control navigation improvement and water transfer to ensure dam safety and harmonize the water supply and demand of the downstream regions the flow output discharged from the dam in different periods is varied how discharge affects the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in a meandering riverway remains unknown therefore in this paper a generalized meandering river model was designed and the instantaneous velocities and water levels in thirteen cross sections and the digital elevations of the bed surfaces were measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv a digital water level altimeter and a 3d laser scanner respectively the influences of discharge on the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in the experimental model were discussed 2 experimental arrangements the plane shape of a meandering riverway in nature is close to a sine curve as a rough approximation the curve can be fitted by a series of arcs and straight lines shan et al 2018 pan et al 2019 the generalized meandering channel model was constructed in the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering at sichuan university in fig 2 its sinuosity is 1 38 l λ 1 38 and belongs to a moderate sinuosity which was selected referring to the sinuosity range 1 1 3 0 shao and wang 2005 of the changjiang river in china a pump a triangular weir and an energy dissipation grid were installed upstream of the experimental model a grit chamber and a tail water outlet were built at the downstream end the channel bottom was horizontal and its geometric parameters such as bending radius rc central angle φ meander belt wavelength λ meander belt width w crossover area length l flow path length l channel width b and channel depth h are shown in fig 3 a multidimensional measurement system including a measuring bridge a measuring platform a numerical control equipment produced by the in beijing was installed on the model sidewalls after the measuring devices were fixed on the measurement platform in fig 2 the experimenters could horizontally and vertically manipulate the measurement platform by the numerical control equipment so that the results of the measuring devices met the measurement requirements natural river sediment was used in the experiment and its gradation is presented in fig 4 a layer of natural sediment with a thickness of approximately 10 cm was first filled to the meandering channel and then the experimenters injected an appropriate volume of clear water into the meandering channel to make the sediment naturally dense and then the experimenters horizontally scraped the sediment layer by a gradienter to a thickness of approximately 8 cm so as to complete the preparation of the initial bed surface the inlet discharges corresponding to the experimental cases increased in turn but the inlet discharge for the same experimental case was constant and the outlet conditions were always free outfalls in table 1 the experimental model included two complete meanders but the measurements were only carried out within the central meander a total of 13 cross sections were measured in the test area cs01 cs13 in fig 3 the measurements of each cross section were collected along 21 vertical lines with a uniform adjacent space of 3 5 cm 1 21 in fig 3 water level measurements were performed along all the vertical lines by a digital water level altimeter in fig 2 with a sampling frequency of 100 hz and a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm and the sampling duration for each vertical line was at least 80 s the velocity measurements were conducted only for the vertical lines 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 and 19 by an acoustic doppler velocimeter in fig 2 with a 3d side view probe a sampling frequency of 25 hz and a measurement accuracy of 1 mm s the velocity measurements of a vertical line started near the water surface and ended near the bed surface and the sampling duration at any a measured point was at least 80 s the vertical spaces of the measured points in the same experimental case were the same but these spaces varied among the experimental cases the vertical spaces corresponding to experimental cases ① ⑥ were 1 cm 1 cm 1 5 cm 2 cm 2 cm and 2 cm respectively before the water level and velocity measurements of the first experimental case were conducted a constant discharge was maintained for more than 48 h to continuously scour the initial bed surface then the experimenters collected the bed load at the outlet and weighed the collected bed load per hour by an electronic balance with a measurement accuracy of 1 g in fig 4 a therein the collected bed load is first dried by an electric oven before weighing the mass when the bed load transport rate was less than 50 g h and the movement of the large particles on the bed surface can t be observed by human eyes we considered the bed surface stable and started to measure the water level and velocity data when the first group of water level and velocity measurements was completed the experimenters turned off the pump after the bed surface was naturally dried a handheld 3d laser scanner in fig 2 with an approximate sampling density of 1 point mm2 and a measurement accuracy of 0 1 mm was used to scan the bed surface morphology then the experimenters restarted the pump set the discharge as the designed value of the second experimental case and maintained this constant discharge to continuously scour the bed surface for more than 48 h and subsequently measured the sediment transport rate when the bed surface became stable again the measurements for the second experimental case were carried out other experimental cases were then conducted following the above mentioned steps 3 calculational methods to facilitate the analyses an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system is established as shown in fig 3 the coordinate origin is located at the midpoint of the bottom edge of the initial cross section cs01 taking the flow direction as a reference the positive x axis is along the longitudinal flow path the y axis is along the transverse direction positive towards the right and the z axis is perpendicular to the xoy coordinate plane positive upward in this paper the thalweg is defined as the line connecting the lowest points of the cross sections along the meandering channel the line connecting the points with the maximum depth averaged velocity for each cross section is defined as the flow dynamic axis in addition

notations 4 results and discussion 4 1 transverse water surface gradient as shown in fig 5 in the curved segments of the meandering channel the water surfaces near the concave sides are always higher than those near the convex sides and the transverse water surface gradients increase with increasing discharge to discuss the formation mechanism of the transverse water surface gradient we select a fluid particle p dm u w r near the water surface of a cross section cs xi in a curved segment and analyze its subjected forces in fig 6 where r dm u w represent the curvature radius the mass and the time averaged longitudinal velocity of the fluid particle respectively when fluid particle p reaches a curved segment its movement is mainly dominated by gravity dg and centrifugal force dfc gravity and centrifugal force are both mass forces the gravitational direction is vertical downward and the centrifugal force direction is horizontal from the convex side to the concave side so the resultant mass force will be inclined from the upper part of the convex side to the lower part of the concave side the water surface is an isobaric surface therefore for a constant flow the direction of the resultant mass force on a fluid particle near the water surface is approximately consistent with the direction of the normal vector of the corresponding water surface position as described by the following mathematical relationship 16 d f c dg u w 2 gr tan θ d z w dr where u w r and g are all greater than 0 so when dr is greater than 0 dzw must be greater than 0 namely the water surface near the concave side is always higher than that near the convex side as shown in fig 7 when the discharge increases the time averaged longitudinal velocities of the fluid particles near the water surface increase so the centrifugal forces on the fluid particles will also increase consequently the transverse inclination angle θ increases and the transverse water surface gradient will also increase in addition it can be found that for the same discharge the transverse water surface gradients are large at the downstream positions cs02 and cs08 adjacent to the apex sections and small near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel when the mainstream reaches an apex section the mainstream direction dominated by the inertia cannot be adjusted in a timely manner therefore the mainstream will directly rush against the opposite concave sidewall in this process part of the flow kinetic energy will be converted into gravitational potential energy which will undoubtedly increase the water levels at the downstream positions adjacent to the apex sections so the transverse water surface gradients also increase because of the rotational symmetry of the adjacent curved segments relative to the middle positions of the crossover areas the water surface rising directions of the adjacent curved segments are opposite the time averaged water surface can be deemed a continuous surface so its shape cannot change suddenly and the change can only be gradual therefore only when the transverse water surface gradients near the middle positions of the crossover areas approximately equal 0 can this kind of gradual transition occur as pointed out above when the mainstreams cross the apex sections and rush against the opposite concave sidewalls a part of the flow kinetic energy is converted into gravitational potential energy which increases the transverse water surface gradients in the downstream regions adjacent to the apex sections cs01 and cs07 however this is only a cause for that the transverse water surface gradients in the downstream region adjacent to an apex section are larger than the corresponding values in the upstream region adjacent to the apex section as shown in fig 7 after the initial bed surface is worked by the flow the convex sides are aggraded and the concave sides are degrade in the downstream regions adjacent to the apex sections generating obvious transverse bed surface gradients which can also contribute to the increasing transverse water surface gradients how do the transverse bed surface gradients influence the transverse water surface gradients we analyze the microelement shown in fig 8 to answer this question the centrifugal force fc acting on the microelement the water pressures p 1 p 2 p 3 acting on its left and right sides and its bottom and the friction force ff acting on its bottom are calculated according to formulas 17 21 the gravity acting on the microelement and the water pressures acting on its front and back sides are not considered because they are irrelevant to the following deductions 17 f c 1 2 ρ 2 h r d z w d z s α x i r

z w d z s are high order small quantities and thus are assumed to be negligible therefore the transverse dynamic equation can be simplified as follows 25 1 α x i r u p x i r 2 2 r g h r d z w α x i r u p x i r 2 rg α x i r u p x i r 2 2 r g h r d z s added term τ b ρ g h r according to equation 25 in the downstream region adjacent to an apex section the bed surface morphology of that the convex side is aggraded and the concave side is degrade can increase the transverse water surface gradients which accounts for the transverse water surface gradients being larger in the downstream region adjacent to an apex section than the corresponding values in the upstream region adjacent to the apex section 4 2 secondary flow when the fluids flow through a curved segment due to the driving effect of the centrifugal forces the water surface near the concave side will rise and that near the convex side will decrease forming transverse water surface gradients the centrifugal force is proportional to the squared time averaged longitudinal velocity because the time averaged longitudinal velocities are usually large near the water surface and small near the bed surface the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles near the water surface are large and the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles near the bed surface are small however the transverse pressure differences from the concave side to the convex side caused by the transverse water surface gradients are constant along the water depth therefore as shown in fig 9 when the centrifugal forces and the transverse pressure differences are combined the resultant action is equivalent to a force couple the equivalent couple will drive the upper fluids to flow towards the concave side and the lower fluids to flow towards the convex side which is the fundamental reason for the secondary flow based on the above analyses if the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 the equivalent couple disappears causing the secondary flow to disappear however fig 10 indicates that the secondary flows do not disappear near the middle or even the outlet of the crossover area and the rotational directions of the secondary flows are entirely consistent with those of the secondary flows in the adjacent upstream curved segment the rotating secondary flow possesses rotational kinetic energy and the energy dissipation must go through a process therefore the position where the secondary flow disappears occurs downstream from where the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 this is why the rotational direction of the secondary flow at the outlet of the upstream crossover area does not change in addition when the discharge increases the transverse underflows in the curved segments strengthen while the transverse surface flows exhibit no obvious changes as shown in fig 7 when the discharge increases the time averaged longitudinal velocities of the fluid particles near the water surface usually increase so the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles will also increase these increases in the centrifugal forces will cause increases in the transverse water surface gradients so the transverse pressure differences from the concave side to convex side are also increased because the directions of the centrifugal forces are opposite to those of the transverse pressure differences the incremental changes cancel each other out thus the transverse surface flows exhibit no obvious changes the situation near the bed surface is quite different than that near the water surface when the discharge increases due to the intense retardation of the armor layers the time averaged longitudinal velocities near the bed surface do not significantly increase so the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles near the bed surface are almost unchanged however the increases in the transverse water surface gradients will increase the transverse pressure differences acting on the fluid particles near the bed surface and thus enhance the transverse driving effects on the transverse underflows which causes the enhancement of the transverse underflows 4 3 bed surface elevations as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 the elevation frequency distribution of the artificially paved initial bed surface approximately presents a thin and tall normal distribution however after the initial bed surface is worked by the discharge of 25 52 l s sediment deposition occurs between the convex sides of the apex sections and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas the local sediment depositions increase the quantitative proportion of the higher elevation points relative to the total sampling points so the frequency distribution of the bed surface elevations becomes positively skewed the bed surface elevations in areas other than the sediment deposition regions are decreased to different extents so the mode of the elevation frequency distribution decreases and the corresponding distribution shifts as a whole toward the direction of decreasing elevation the local sediment depositions and the elevation decreases at most bed surface positions naturally enlarge the range of the elevation frequency distribution which is the main factor controlling the fat and short elevation frequency distribution of the water worked bed surface since there is no sediment supply at the inlet of the experimental meandering channel most of the deposited sediment is transported from the upstream regions to the sediment deposition regions however why does sediment deposition occur in the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas the answer is closely related to the curvature of the experimental meandering channel and the secondary flow movement due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel when the mainstream reaches an apex section the mainstream direction dominated by the inertia cannot be adjusted in a timely manner therefore the mainstream will directly rush against the opposite concave sidewall after that the mainstream rapidly adjusts its flow direction and flows near the sidewall connected with the concave side of the apex section due to the larger momentum of the mainstream and the intensely scoured bed surface below the mainstream the corresponding bed surface elevations decrease considerably meanwhile the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas become the mainstream separation regions cs01 cs05 and 0 y b 2 cs07 cs11 and b 2 y 0 fig 7 a shows that when the discharge is 25 52 l s the time averaged longitudinal velocities in the mainstream separation regions are not too large which undoubtedly provides a necessary condition for sediment deposition when the sediment particles on the upstream bed surfaces are transported to an apex section due to the transverse driving effect of the secondary underflow many sediment particles will enter the mainstream separation region and deposit there fig 10 a as time passes the sediment deposition volume gradually increases ultimately forming a narrow and long sediment deposition region because the secondary flow intensities in the experimental meandering channel are relatively small the secondary underflows can only transversely drive the small sediment particles not the large ones this is why the particle sizes of the deposited sediments are much smaller than the maximum particle size of the experimental sediment furthermore the particle sizes in a sediment deposition region also gradually decrease along the longitudinal direction which is obviously caused by the dissipation of flow kinetic energy along the longitudinal direction in other words the velocity distribution in a meandering channel is non uniform enough that transverse and longitudinal particle size classifications can occur anywhere if the curvature of a meandering channel is large and there are a large number of sediment particles whose incipient velocities are less than the transverse underflow velocities near the apex sections then the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas are prone to sediment deposition this finding has important guiding significance in relevant practical engineering applications if the curvature of a meandering riverway is large and its riverbed sediment gradation is wide many engineering designs regarding wharf construction water intake site selection waterway regulation etc should avoid the sediment deposition regions stated above to reduce the damage of sediment deposition as pointed out above in the experimental meandering channel the mainstream is adjacent to the convex side when the flow reaches an apex section and the sediment deposition occurs in the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas these two phenomena both reduce the curvature of the experimental meandering channel which is undoubtedly the most direct evidence of automatic river adjustment in short if there is a prominent factor affecting the flow and sediment transport in a natural riverway the general trend of the flow and sediment movement always weaken the effect caused the by prominent factor due to the large proportion of the small particles in the experimental sediment and the relatively small first stage discharge 25 52 l s when the initial bed surface is continuously scoured and then stabilizes there is still a large amount of small particles among the large particles near the bed surface and the armor layer formed at this stage is cannot resist the flow erosion corresponding to a larger discharge when the discharge increases to 33 45 l s many small particles among the large particles near the bed surface will be entrained by the flow so the equilibrium bed surface elevations generally decrease when the discharge increases to 42 09 or 51 37 l s the mode of the elevation frequency distribution continues to decrease and the figure still shifts as a whole toward the direction of decreasing elevation only at this stage does the decreasing extent of the elevation mode become small and the change in the elevation frequency distribution slows which indicates that the stability of the armor layer increases with increasing discharge notably when the discharge increases the average particle size near the bed surface increases due to the more intense flow erosion so the stability of the armor layer increases but the increase in the average particle size near the bed surface is only one factor that enhances the stability of the armor layer when the fluid flows through the bed surface the turbulence and impingement of the fluid will cause the bed surface to vibrate slightly and allow the sediment particles near the bed surface to selectively embed themselves into stable positions which will also enhance the stability of the bed surface in addition the elevation frequency distributions corresponding to inlet discharges of 33 45 and 42 09 l s are very similar in shape this shows that when the discharge increases from 33 45 to 42 09 l s the sediment erosion volumes at the different positions of the bed surface are approximately the same and the riverbed evolves via approximately uniform subsidence when the discharge increases to 65 68 l s sediment deposition occurs again in the deposition regions which makes the elevation frequency distribution fatter and shorter and the positively skewed characteristic more obvious this indicates that although the armor layer can protect the riverbed to a certain extent its effect is fairly limited once the flow intensity exceeds the limit that the static armor layer can bear the static armor layer can no longer resist the corresponding flow erosion when the discharge increases to 65 68 l s the flow intensity is too large and the armor layer corresponding to a discharge of 51 37 l s can no longer resist flow erosion at this stage so the riverbed undergoes a drastic evolution henceforth only after the bed surface reached a new erosion and deposition equilibrium state does the riverbed reconstitution tend to stop when the armor layer corresponding to the discharge of 51 37 l s is destroyed the small particles under the armor layer are exposed and then transported downstream by the flow when the small particles are transported to an apex section due to the transverse driving effect of the transverse underflows caused by the secondary flows many of the small particles enter the sediment deposition region and deposit there which is why redeposition occurs in the sediment deposition region due to the serious destruction of the armor layer worked by the discharge of 51 37 l s the positions where the mainstream goes are seriously scoured by the discharge of 65 68 l s when the elevations at the positions where the mainstream goes decrease and those in the sediment deposition regions increase the range of the elevation frequency distribution certainly increases therefore the elevation frequency distribution becomes fatter and shorter and the positively skewed characteristic becomes obvious when the discharge increases to 74 83 l s the sediments near the concave sidewalls of the apex sections are seriously eroded and a large area of channel bottom is exposed this situation is closely relevant to the impact effect of the mainstreams on the opposite concave sidewalls when the mainstream reaches an apex section the mainstream direction dominated by the inertia cannot be adjusted in a timely manner owing to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel therefore the mainstream directly rushes against the opposite concave sidewall which can cause strong flow turbulence and erosion of the riverbed in the mainstream impact region due to the limited particle size of the experimental sediment the maximum anti erosion ability of the armor layer is limited for the discharge of 74 83 l s the armor layer in the mainstream impact region can no longer resist the mainstream erosion after the sediment in the mainstream impact region is completely eroded the sediment around the mainstream impact region becomes unstable due to lose of support and eventually becomes partially eroded which is the reason for the expansion of the exposed channel bottom along the upstream and downstream regions to a certain extent from subsequent analyses we can conclude that the more downstream an apex section is located the larger its cross sectional average velocity is moreover the larger the apex sectional average velocity is the stronger the impact effect of the mainstream on the opposite concave sidewall is and the larger the exposed bottom area is for this discharge a local bulge with an elevation of approximately 0 appears in the elevation frequency distribution under the condition of laying uniformly measured points the frequency corresponding to the local bulge represents the approximate proportion of the exposed bottom area relative to the total bottom area in a complete meander 4 4 cross sectional average velocity fig 13 shows that for the same discharge the cross sectional average velocities are large near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections cs01 cs07 and cs13 which are obviously related to the existence of the sediment deposition regions as shown in fig 11 the cross sectional average velocities are basically large at the positions where the transverse width and vertical height of the sediment deposition regions are large large sediment deposition volumes are present at these positions which significantly narrows the transverse effective widths of the channel thereby the cross sectional average velocities are large due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel the mainstreams near the apex sections are adjacent to the convex sides which makes it difficult for sediment depositions to occur near the apex sections therefore the cross sectional areas near the apex sections are large and the cross sectional average velocities are small as shown in fig 14 for any a discharge fr 2 2 is large near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections cs01 cs07 and cs13 which are completely consistent with the changes in cross sectional average velocities along the meandering channel to explore the main reason behind this consistency we analyze the froude number fr according to formula 12 fr 2 2 is equal to the ratio of the average kinetic energy to the average potential energy of the fluid particles in a cross section therefore an increasing fr 2 2 implies the conversion of a part of the flow potential energy into the flow kinetic energy whereas a decreasing fr 2 2 implies the conversion of a part of the flow kinetic energy into the flow potential energy these results suggest that the cross sectional average velocity increases mainly due to the conversion of the flow potential energy into the flow kinetic energy whereas the decrease in cross sectional average velocity is ostensibly due to the conversion of the flow kinetic energy into the flow potential energy and the existence of the sediment deposition regions is the external cause for the energy conversion the discharge is determined by the cross sectional area and the cross sectional average velocity as shown in fig 7 or fig 10 when the discharge increases the cross sectional areas also increase furthermore fig 13 shows that for the same cross section the cross sectional average velocity also increases with increasing discharge then why cannot the increase in the discharge only cause the increases in the cross sectional areas or the increases in the cross sectional average velocities especially when the transverse width of the channel is the same why cannot the increase in the discharge only cause the increases in the water depths the increases in the water depths can be realized by the way that the flow scours the riverbed and can also be achieved by increasing the cross sectional average water levels when the flow scours the riverbed composed of non uniform sediment the average particle size near the bed surface will increase once the armor layer is completely formed the bed surface is basically stable so it does not contribute enough to the increases in the cross sectional areas however if the cross sectional areas are increased by increasing the water levels the water surface will be subjected to gravitational obstruction therefore when the discharge increases although the cross sectional areas also increase their increments are not enough to compensate for the discharge increment so the cross sectional average velocities must be increased this phenomenon can also be explained by the minimum variance theory proposed by langbein and leopold 1964 the theory points out that when the conditions of the flow and sediment discharged in a natural river change the hydraulic factors will accordingly adjust themselves to the changes but the general trend is to minimize the total adjustment amount of the hydraulic factors under the natural state the adjustment will not be undertaken by a single hydraulic factor but will be scattered among all hydraulic factors so that the change in each hydraulic factor will be as small as possible this explains why for the same cross section the cross sectional area and the cross sectional average velocity synchronously increase with increasing discharge in fact the minimum variance theory is also a direct expression of river adaptability or automatic adjustment in addition it can be found that for any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander the cross sectional average velocity corresponding to the downstream cross section is slightly larger than that corresponding to the upstream cross section since the initial bed surface is horizontally paved with evenly stirred nonuniform sediment and the experimental flow is completely driven by gravity the gravitational potential energies corresponding to any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander must be decreased there are two ways to decrease the gravitational potential energies one is a decrease in the bed surface elevations and the other is a decrease in the cross sectional average water levels due to the strict geometric periodicity of the experimental meandering channel and the similar sediment gradation at the different positions of the initial bed surface the elevation distributions corresponding to any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander are fairly similar in fig 11 and then the decrease in the gravitational potential energies is mainly caused by the decrease in the cross sectional average water levels when the riverbed profile morphologies corresponding to any two cross sections with a longitudinal interval of half a meander are approximately the same the decrease in the average water level corresponding to the downstream cross section will make the cross sectional area slightly decrease so the cross sectional average velocity will slightly increase 4 5 depth averaged velocity and flow dynamic axis as shown in fig 15 due to the large curvature of the experimental meandering channel when the flow reaches an apex section the mainstream is adjacent to the convex side when the mainstream is dominated by its own inertia some fluid particles with larger longitudinal velocities will be inclined to the concave sides due to the transversal driving effects of the centrifugal forces which makes the mainstream near the apex section split generating the flow separation phenomenon henceforth the centrifugal forces and the flow inertia continue to exert their effects in the regions from the apex sections to the inlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas cs01 cs03 and cs07 cs09 so the flow separation points gradually change from positions near the convex sides to near the channel centerline as shown in fig 7 b with increasing discharge the time averaged longitudinal velocities of the fluid particles near the water surfaces of the apex sections correspondingly increase so the centrifugal forces acting on the fluid particles also increase which makes the flow separation phenomenon more obvious after the mainstream separates near an apex section a stream jet rushes to the opposite concave sidewall while the other stream jet continues near the convex side therein the stream jet rushing to the opposite concave sidewall has a stronger scouring effect on the riverbed which is not difficult to conclude from the locations of the thalwegs shown in fig 16 influenced by many uncertain factors such as the flow pulsation the irregularity of the sediment particles and the diversity of the arrangement patterns of the sediment particles the locations of the thalwegs randomly swing along the meandering channel which is undoubtedly the most direct reflection of the complicated fine structure of the armor layers however the overall trends of the thalwegs are approximately consistent with those of the flow dynamic axes the flow dynamic axis corresponds to where the flow momentum is the largest and the riverbed is most strongly scoured so there is a large probability that the thalweg will appear there after the mainstream separates near an apex section for the two stream jets the stream jet near the convex side impacts the formation and development of the sediment deposition region the sediment particles in the deposition region are completely transported from the adjacent upstream apex section by this stream jet the two stream jets will finally converge near the middle position of the adjacent downstream crossover area and when they reach the next apex section they will separate again and then converge again to circulate 4 6 turbulence characteristics fig 17 shows that in a cross section the positions with large turbulent kinetic energy are located in the mainstream area the resultant velocities in the mainstream area are large so the kinetic energies of the fluid particles are also large if the kinetic energy of a fluid particle is large its motion state would be more unstable any small disturbance can easily trigger a large instantaneous velocity fluctuation so the positions with large turbulent kinetic energy usually appear in the mainstream area in addition the cross sectional average turbulent kinetic energies are large near the middle positions cs04 and cs10 of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections cs01 cs07 and cs13 and increase with increasing discharge these two phenomena are closely relevant to the reynolds number distributions along the meandering channel the reynolds number represents the ratio of inertial force to viscous force the larger the reynolds number is the stronger the momentum exchange between the adjacent fluid layers is and the greater the cross sectional average turbulent kinetic energy is as shown in fig 18 the reynolds numbers are large near the middle positions of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections and increase with increasing discharge this means that the cross sectional average turbulent kinetic energies are large near the middle positions of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections and increase with increasing discharge this observation is entirely consistent with the conclusions based on fig 17 as shown in fig 19 near the bed surface the longitudinal transverse and vertical turbulence intensities tu tv and tw are approximately equal which indicates that the velocity fluctuations near the bed surface are approximately isotropic however in the mainstream areas the transverse turbulence intensity is obviously greater than the vertical turbulence intensity and the longitudinal turbulence intensity is significantly greater than the transverse turbulence intensity which indicates that the velocity fluctuations in the mainstream areas are anisotropic and that the longitudinal velocity fluctuation contributes the most to the turbulent kinetic energy while the transverse velocity fluctuation contributes the second most and the vertical velocity fluctuation contributes the least the large turbulent kinetic energy at a certain position can indicate that the velocity fluctuation amplitude of the fluid particle at the position is large but it does not mean that the kinetic energy loss at the position is large because the dissipation rate of the flow kinetic energy is also closely related to the velocity fluctuation frequency in fig 20 the turbulent kinetic energy near the bed surface is small so the velocity fluctuation amplitude is small however due to the high velocity fluctuation frequency the flow kinetic energy consumed near the bed surface is quite large it is just because the retardation effect of the riverbed on the flow is mainly concentrated near the bed surface that the longitudinal velocity distributions shown in fig 7 exhibit large vertical gradients near the bed surface in addition fig 20 a shows that the negative fluctuation amplitudes of longitudinal velocities in the mainstream areas are much greater than the positive fluctuation amplitudes indicating that the fluid particles in the mainstream areas transfer energy to lower fluid layers because kinetic energy dissipation mainly occurs near the bed surface the fluid near the bed surface must absorb energy from the mainstream areas to continuously flow the phenomenon that the negative fluctuation amplitudes of the mainstream velocities are much greater than the positive fluctuation amplitudes is undoubtedly the most direct evidence of this energy transfer 5 conclusions six groups of laboratory experiments were conducted in a meandering channel the inlet discharge was set as the control variable the instantaneous velocities and water levels in thirteen cross sections and the digital elevations of the bed surfaces were measured in detail several conclusions concerning the effects of discharge on the velocity distribution and riverbed evolution in the meandering channel were drawn 1 for the same discharge the transverse water surface gradients are large at the downstream positions adjacent to the apex sections and small near the middle positions of the crossover areas when the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 the secondary flow does not disappear and where the secondary flow disappears lags behind where the transverse water surface gradient is equal to 0 with increasing discharge the transverse water surface gradients in the curved segments increase the transverse underflows strengthen and the transverse surface flows exhibit no obvious changes 2 when the sediment carrying capacity of the upstream flow is in an unsaturated state the bed surface composed of non uniformly sized sediment will be changed by the flow after the smaller particles are washed away the average particle size of the remaining particles increases and the riverbed will ultimately form a static armor layer the static armor layer can protect the riverbed but its effect is fairly limited once the flow intensity exceeds the limit that the static armor layer can bear the static armor layer can no longer resist the corresponding flow erosion 3 if the curvature of a meandering channel is large and there are a large number of sediment particles whose incipient velocities are less than the transverse underflow velocities near the apex sections then the regions between the apex sectional convex sides and the outlets of the adjacent downstream crossover areas are prone to sediment deposition and the frequency distributions of the bed surface elevations are positively skewed 4 for the same cross section the cross sectional average velocity increases with increasing discharge for the same discharge the cross sectional average velocities are large near the middle positions of the crossover areas and small near the apex sections 5 affected by many uncertain factors such as the flow turbulence irregularity of sediment particles and diversity of sediment arrangements the thalweg always swings randomly along the channel but its overall trend is approximately the same as that of the flow dynamic axis 6 in a cross section the positions with large turbulent kinetic energy are located in the mainstream area and the average turbulent kinetic energy increases with increasing discharge the longitudinal velocity fluctuation contributes the most to the turbulent kinetic energy while the transverse velocity fluctuation contributes the second most and the vertical velocity fluctuation contributes the least the velocity fluctuations near the bed surface are approximately isotropic while those in the mainstream area are anisotropic declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

3572,the mismatch between the space time scales of flash flood occurrence and those of the typical hydro meteorological monitoring networks has stimulated the development of forensic flash flood analysis which involves post flood indirect peak discharge estimation in ungauged channels and flood response modelling driven by weather radar rainfall estimates however both approaches are potentially affected by significant uncertainties assessment of scale dependence of such uncertainties is important to identify how uncertainty affecting forensic flash flood analysis increases with decreasing basin size in this work we apply the forensic methodology to the flash flood of november 18 2013 in sardinia italy we introduce the flash flood forensic consistency index as a tool to compare the probability distribution of peak discharge uncertainties from observational and model estimates and to determine the scale effects of the forensic analysis concept uncertainties in field based peak flow estimates are evaluated through a first order error analysis of the taylor series approximation of the slope conveyance method whereas uncertainties in flash flood modelling are based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methodology using a distributed hydrologic model results show no significant relationship between observational and modelling uncertainties considered independently and basin area and channel bed slope conversely when considering the interaction between the two uncertainty distributions a relationship arises between their degree of overlap and basin size in particular with decreasing basin area or increasing channel bed slope the absolute relative bias between the estimated peak flow values increases more than their relative uncertainties decreasing the consistency index this calls for more robust approaches for the analysis of flash flood response in small sized rugged relief mountain basins which are of high interest for flood risk management keywords flash floods peak discharge post flood surveys flood modelling uncertainty analysis 1 introduction flash floods constitute about 56 of flood events in europe paprotny et al 2018 and are characterized by the highest average mortality when compared with other types of floods doocy et al 2013 the high risk potential of flash floods is related to their rapid occurrence and to the small and dispersed spatial extent of the impacted areas their characteristic limited spatial and temporal scales usually less than 3000 km2 and 48 h respectively marchi et al 2010 amponsah et al 2018 make the monitoring of flash floods by conventional rain gauge and stream gauge networks challenging leading to uncertain quantification and modelling of the events magnitude borga et al 2008 a general methodology for the detailed reconstruction of flash floods where no direct or sparse systematic hydrometeorological data and observations are available termed flash flood forensic analysis has been advanced in the last decade keating et al 2016 bronstert et al 2018 borga et al 2019 this methodology involves post flood surveys of flood peaks from high water marks hwms hereinafter re analysis of weather radar rainfall estimates berne and krajewski 2013 park et al 2019 and hydrological modelling to ensure consistency among the various types of observations rinat et al 2021 amponsah et al 2016 presented a forensic analysis framework for achieving sound estimates of peak flood discharge at multiple sections along ungauged river networks the framework consists of three steps involving i indirect peak discharge reconstruction from hwms ii flood response simulations using spatially distributed hydrological models and iii comparison of the two estimates within an uncertainty framework the indirect reconstruction of peak discharge is often carried out by using the slope conveyance method gaume and borga 2008 amponsah et al 2016 costa and jarrett 2008 illustrate some limitations of the slope conveyance method for post flood assessment of discharge and point out that the slope area method based on multiple section surveys should be preferred however the slope conveyance method has some practical advantages in the case of flash floods because it allows a single representative cross section to be selected where high water marks are well defined consequently this method is widely applied especially in mountain rivers of complex topography the slope conveyance method is however affected by several observational errors these errors include but are not limited to the accuracy of measurements and the choice of the roughness coefficient that may affect the indirect estimation of peak discharges wohl 1998 lumbroso and gaume 2012 also channel erosion and or aggradation can cause the cross section surveyed after the event to be different from the hydraulic conditions at peak flow kirby 1987 jarrett 1987 the impact of these sources of errors has motivated several attempts for the specific assessment of uncertainties affecting indirect peak discharge estimation e g kirby 1987 mccuen and knight 2006 stewart et al 2012 the simulation of flood responses through hydrological modelling driven by radar rainfall estimates permits to compare flood peaks from simulations with indirect post event estimates e g borga et al 2007 marchi et al 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2012 amponsah et al 2016 as form of consistency check however hydrological simulations of flash flood response are subject to considerable uncertainties due to model structure parameterization as well as input data it is therefore important that these uncertainties are quantified for comparison with indirect post event peak flow estimates the comparison between modelled and indirect post event peak flow estimates plays an important role in forensic analysis as it permits to identify and remove either erroneous field estimates or biased flood simulations and to isolate consistent hydrological simulations it is also possible to identify in this way flood peaks which are due to non hydrological processes such as geomorphic processes related to landslides debris flows and hyper concentrated flows these estimates may require specific estimation methods for dam break or non newtonian flows prochaska et al 2008 bodoque et al 2011 as a matter of fact the degree of overlap between the uncertainty distributions of modelled and indirectly observed peak discharges provides a quantification of the confidence in peak flood estimation however to the best of our knowledge no methodologies are available to quantify this confidence so far an important research question concerns the scale dependence of the observational and modelling uncertainty distributions as well as of their degree of overlap if the evidence of scale dependence in these uncertainty measures exists and in particular the evidence of decreasing degree of overlap with decreasing basin size then this may limit the use of flash flood estimates at a range of basin scales since it is at small catchment scales that flash flood research may provide the most interesting findings borga et al 2014 this evidence may lead to invest more resources in both the modelling and field survey phases literature suggests that these scale effects may not be negligible and that should be considered especially the evidence that model performance is related to the catchment area e g merz et al 2009 van esse et al 2013 poncelet et al 2017 merz et al 2009 for instance simulated the water balance dynamics of 269 catchments in austria with sizes ranging between 10 and 130 000 km2 using a semi distributed conceptual model with rain gauge derived precipitation input the simulation results suggest that the model efficiency increases over the scale range of 10 to 10 000 km2 these authors were able to identify a number of factors that may contribute to this scale effect on one hand the spatial variability averages out with scale so less detail is needed as one moves up in scale on the other hand the average number of rain gauges per catchment increases with catchment scale obviously the larger the sampling density of stations with respect to the typical scales of variability of precipitation the better rainfall can be estimated in addition lumbroso and gaume 2012 report that uncertainty of flash flood peak flows estimates from indirect methods increases with the gradient of the watercourses more specifically reaches with gradient higher than 1 were frequently found to have a high degree of uncertainty often greater than 25 similar conclusions are reported by wohl 1998 who was able to show that peak flow estimates in small and steep gradient rivers with low width depth ratios show higher sensitivity to changes in the roughness coefficient than in large rivers given this background this work contributes to the forensic research on flash flood by i introducing an index to quantify the degree of overlap between the modelling and observational uncertainty distributions termed flash flood forensic consistency index in the following and by ii analysing the effects of basin scale and river bed slope on both the modelling and observational uncertainties and on the flash flood forensic consistency index this work expands the framework presented by amponsah et al 2016 developing a complete presentation of the statistical framework of the slope conveyance discharge determination where some basic assumptions are removed these assumptions include the dependence of the errors affecting the estimation of the energy line gradient on the accuracy of the surveying instrument as well as the dependence of the errors affecting the evaluation of roughness coefficient on the intensity of geomorphic impacts the november 18 2013 flash flood in the cedrino and posada river basins north eastern sardinia italy provides a template for this scale effect analysis this flash flood was characterised by extreme unit peak discharges and contributed to determining the upper envelope curve for the relationship between basin area and unit peak discharges for european and mediterranean flash floods amponsah et al 2018 amponsah et al 2020 this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the concept of forensic flash flood analysis with assessment of both observational and modelling uncertainties section 3 presents a description of the november 18 2013 flash flood event and elaboration of the collated data section 4 presents the results of the scale dependence analysis for the studied flash flood with the discussion of the flash flood forensic consistency index presented in section 5 finally section 6 provides the conclusions of the study 2 methodology for observational and modelling uncertainty assessment forensic analysis of flash floods relies on the combined analysis of discharge estimations from stream gauge observations and post event surveys and hydrological modelling driven by spatio temporal rainfall estimates borga et al 2008 gaume and borga 2008 marchi et al 2010 amponsah et al 2016 borga et al 2019 fig 1 presents a flow chart of forensic flash flood analysis framework with the uncertainty assessments of the observational and modelling components the following sections describe the uncertainty assessments for both indirect peak discharge estimates and flood response modelling as well as the framework to compare the two distributions of uncertainty 2 1 uncertainty assessment of the slope conveyance method 2 1 1 the slope conveyance indirect peak discharge determination the slope conveyance method gaume and borga 2008 amponsah et al 2016 computes peak discharge q m3 s 1 by means of the one dimensional manning strickler equation as follows 1 q 1 n a 5 3 p 2 3 s e 1 2 where a m2 is the wetted cross sectional area p m is the wetted cross sectional perimeter computed as a r where r m is the hydraulic radius s e m m 1 is the energy line gradient and n is the channel roughness coefficient in the solution of the slope conveyance discharge determination fig 2 we consider multiple data points of hwms along the longitudinal profile of the channel banks flood plains and riparian vegetation to estimate the energy line gradient using least squares regression model fig 2a one river section is used for the survey of the transversal profile of the channel geometry fig 2b 2 1 2 linear error analysis of the discharge formula the linear error analysis uses a first order taylor series approximation of the manning strickler discharge equation eq 1 the error analysis is based on the equation for the variance of a sum of correlated random variates kirby 1987 amponsah et al 2016 from eq 1 q is a function of the following variables q f n a p s e the error in q δ q due to errors δ n δ a δ p and δ s e in n a p and s e respectively may then be treated as a first order taylor series approximation as follows 2 δ q q n δ n q a δ a q p δ p q s e δ s e 2 q a q p δ p δ a where q z δ z is the error in q due to an error δ z in the generic variable z assuming the covariance terms to be negligible the variance of δ q can be expressed as 3 var δ q q n 2 v a r δ n q a 2 v a r δ a q p 2 v a r δ p q s e 2 v a r δ s e taking the partial derivatives from eq 1 eq 3 can be written as 4 var δ q q 2 var δ n n 2 25 9 var δ a a 2 4 9 var δ p p 2 1 4 var δ s e s e 2 by using ε z 2 v a r δ z z 2 to represent the relative error variance of the variable z eq 4 can then be written as 5 ε q 2 ε n 2 25 9 ε a 2 4 9 ε p 2 1 4 ε s e 2 the uncertainty in the estimated peak discharge can then be expressed as the relative error that extends one standard deviation on both sides of the field estimated value as 6 ε q ε n 2 25 9 ε a 2 4 9 ε p 2 1 4 ε s e 2 1 2 2 1 3 error analysis of the cross sectional properties cross sectional properties area a and wetted perimeter p with corresponding error variances var δ a and var δ p result from errors in the measurements of the section width b section mean depths d and scour s fig 2c shows the measurements which are considered in the surveying of the cross section geometry transversal profile in fig 2b at any point i r i is a rod reading y is an equivalent measurement down to the water surface as defined by the regression of the hwms and s is the scour depth scour is assumed to be of constant depth across the section whereas fill is treated as negative scour under these assumptions the relationship for the flow depth d i corresponding to flood peak at any point in the cross section is d i r i y s which permits to develop the error analysis of the two cross sectional properties from fig 2c the cross sectional area and wetted perimeter at peak flow can be estimated as follows 7 a i 1 n b i r i r i 1 2 b y b s 8 p i 1 n b i 2 r i r i 1 2 1 2 where b i is the transverse distance between ground points i 1 and i n 1 is the number of ground points used to survey the channel cross section and b b i is the top channel width corresponding to the water surface of the flood peak the errors in d i and s are represented by relative error variances ε d 2 and ε s 2 respectively which are referenced to the mean flow depth d a b the errors in b i are also represented by relative error variance ε b 2 referenced to the average spacing between ground points b b n we assume here that i the ground points are approximately equally spaced ii the flow depth at all points is approximately equal to the mean depth d and iii measurement errors in b d and s are statistically uncorrelated from eq 7 the error variance in the surveyed cross sectional area can be simplified as 9 var δ a i 1 n a b i 2 v a r δ b i i 1 n a r i 2 v a r δ r i a y 2 v a r δ y a s 2 v a r δ s taking the partial derivatives from eq 7 the relative error variance in the measured cross sectional area can then be expressed as 10 var δ a a 2 ε a 2 ε b 2 n ε d 2 ε s 2 in a similar approach the errors in wetted perimeter can be derived from eq 8 as follows 11 var δ p i 1 n p b i 2 v a r δ b i i 0 n p r i 2 v a r δ r i for relatively wide shallow and uniform channel cross sections we may assume that the wetted perimeter is approximately equal to the top channel width then p b i 1 and p r i 0 relative error variance in measured wetted perimeter can then be expressed as 12 var δ p p 2 ε p 2 ε b 2 n substituting eq 10 and eq 12 into eq 6 yields 13 ε q ε n 2 29 9 ε b 2 n 25 9 ε d 2 ε s 2 1 4 ε s e 2 1 2 eq 13 represents a weighted sum of the error variances of the various measured and estimated variables with the weights depending on the geometric and hydraulic configuration of the channel reach this accounts for five observational error sources affecting the measurement or estimation of the following variables energy line gradient s e section width b section mean depth d scour fill after peak s and the channel roughness parameter n 2 1 4 error analysis of the energy line gradient the water surface fall over the channel reach length defines the energy line gradient s e this is obtained as the slope of the least squared regression of i 1 2 m hwms longitudinal profile in fig 2a such that the sum of squared residual errors is minimised the observational error variance in the estimation of s e is then obtained as follows 14 var δ s e i 1 m y i y i 2 i 1 m x i x 2 m 1 where y i is the hwms elevation and x i is the corresponding i th position along the reach length x is mean longitudinal distance between the hwm points y i b 0 b 1 x i is the least squared estimate of hwm point y i for a given point x i and b 0 and b 1 are the estimated intercept and slope of the linear regression respectively the relative error variance in the estimated energy line gradient is thus 15 ε s e 2 var δ s e s e 2 2 1 5 estimation of the discharge error variance observational error variances related to the measurement and estimation of the roughness parameter n cross sectional geometry in relation to section width b and section mean depth d and unidentified scour and or fill after flood peak s are incorporated with the evaluated observational error variance of the energy line gradient eq 15 to derive the observational relative error for the slope conveyance indirect peak discharge determination eq 13 the estimation of the roughness parameter is based on the analysis of the various factors affecting the estimation of the manning s n lumbroso and gaume 2012 during field surveys flood geomorphologists provide a range of roughness parameter around an expected value due to complex channel morphology in mountain streams pictures of the channel reach are also analysed which represent a precious help for providing sound roughness estimates yochum et al 2014 surveyed cross sectional geometry is primarily affected by measurement errors in section width b and section mean depth d to recall the assumption made is that the ground points are approximately equally spaced and that the depth at all points is approximately equal to the mean depth however this is not always the case especially for section depths in mountain streams with complex morphology with high degree of nonuniformity for this reason we followed the approaches by amponsah et al 2016 and kirby 1987 for the measurement errors in b and d relative errors ε b and ε d are therefore estimated as 0 01 and 0 02 respectively which are influenced by the accuracy of topographic instrument used the uncertainty associated with the evaluation of the scour fill parameter was ranked into three classes of intensity of the geomorphic impacts of the flood marchi et al 2016 following amponsah et al 2016 the relative error ε s was quantified as 0 04 0 12 and 0 20 for cross sections that underwent negligible moderate and major geomorphic changes respectively thus the more intense the flood related geomorphic impacts within a channel reach the more uncertain is the flood peak estimate the various error analyses presented above yield an expected value of the relative errors in the field estimated peak discharge which can be developed from eq 13 as follows 16 ε q ε n 2 0 25 ε s e 2 3 22 10 4 n δ 1 2 where δ 5 55 10 3 41 1 10 3 and 112 2 10 3 for negligible moderate and major geomorphic impacts respectively 2 2 uncertainty assessment of flash flood response modelling flash flood model prediction uncertainty arises from a variety of sources such as model structural errors parameter uncertainty and input error while we are currently working on methodologies to account for rainfall input uncertainty in the typical flash flood conditions with just a few or not at all rain gauges available in this work we focus only on model parameter uncertainty the uncertainty in the model parameters results from an inability to accurately quantify the input parameters of a model 2 2 1 spatially distributed flood response model the kinematic local excess model klem is an event based conceptual rainfall runoff model which has successfully been implemented to simulate extreme flash floods in europe over the past 15 years e g borga et al 2007 zanon et al 2010 marchi et al 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2012 amponsah et al 2016 the model combines a spatially distributed runoff generation module and a geomorphological description of the drainage network for runoff propagation modelling runoff generation is simulated by applying the scs cn approach ponce and hawkins 1996 to quantify effective rainfall the scs cn method is applied by using an infiltration storativity parameter x for the overall calibration of the method the use of this parameter allows one to calibrate a spatial distribution of curve number cn values in order to simulate correctly the observed flood water balance on consideration of the role played by geology on runoff generation during flash floods norbiato et al 2009 vannier et al 2016 the cn parameter spatial distribution over all basins involved in the model application was derived based on the lithology map a simple model da ros and borga 1997 giannoni et al 2003 is used to represent the runoff propagation for the response of the drainage system this requires the use of a channelization support area to separate hillslope and channel transport paths and two invariant hillslope and channel velocities the model computes discharge q t at any location x y along the river network as follows 17 q t a q t τ x y x y d a where a is the area draining to the specific outlet location q t x y is the runoff at time t and location x y and τ x y is the routing time from point x y to the outlet of the basin specified by the area a the routing time is defined as 18 τ x y l h x y v h l c x y v c where l h x y is the flow distance from the point x y to the channel network following the steepest descent path l c x y is the length of the subsequent channel drainage path to the basin outlet and v c and v h are the two invariant channel and hillslope velocities respectively the model also includes a linear conceptual reservoir for base flow modelling which is controlled by a temporal parameter a k 2 the model requires the identification of the parameters described in table 1 see borga et al 2007 for more details the model was run at 15 min time interval 2 2 2 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 montanari 2005 blasone et al 2008 stedinger et al 2008 is applied to evaluate the parameter uncertainties in flood response model predictions the glue methodology instead of seeking for an ideal set of parameters to simulate the observed flood dynamics considers the existence of many parameter sets that give acceptable predictions behavioural these sets of parameters are analysed within a pseudo bayesian framework and provide a distribution of predictions conditioned on the available observational data the model parameters were conditioned based on the observed flood hydrograph three sensitive model parameters were considered for the application of the klem model and were sampled using a latin hypercube method i the infiltration storativity parameter x ii the initial abstraction parameter ia and iii the subsurface reservoir parameter ak2 table 1 the nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion with an exponent of four ns4 was used as likelihood estimator to give more weight to the peaks which is the most important variable in forensic flash flood analysis models with likelihood above zero are considered as behavioural for each temporal interval t the likelihood weighted quantiles of predicted discharge were calculated following beven and freer 2001 as 19 p q t q i 1 b l m θ i q t i q where p q t q is the prediction quantile for discharge q t below a given threshold q b is the number of behavioural models analysed and l m θ i q t i q is the likelihood of the i th model such that predictions q t i are below the threshold the model conditioned based on the glue methodology was implemented to the set of basins considered for the ipec application for this the behavioural model parameter sets were transposed to these basins together with their likelihood values 2 3 framework for the comparison of the observational and model uncertainties a framework for the comparison of the observational and model uncertainties is required to remove either erroneous field derived estimates or biased flood simulations and to isolate consistent hydrological simulations a comparison between observational and model uncertainties can be represented as a difference between probability distributions this difference can be quantified with various distance measures which differ in their properties and interpretation schöniger et al 2015 a dimensionless measure with fixed bounds between zero maximum distance and one minimum distance might provide an intuitive basis to judge model performance the bhattacharyya coefficient bhattacharyya 1943 is such a relative measure however we found that the computation of the bhattacharyya coefficient is heavily influenced by the number of partitions used to evaluate the integral with too few partitions losing accuracy by overestimating the overlap region and too many partitions losing accuracy by creating individual partitions with no members despite being in a densely populated sample space to measure the degree of overlap between observational and modelling uncertainties given as probability distributions we use an index similar to that advanced by abramowitz and gupta 2008 this index was found less sensitive than the bhattacharyya coefficient to the number of partitions used to evaluate the integral for the two observational and model probability density functions o x and m x the flash flood forensic consistency index ci om is given as follows 20 ci om min o m d x the index ranges between 0 and 1 where ci om 0 implies no overlap at all whereas ci om 1 indicate completely identical distributions the flash flood forensic consistency index provides a measure of the degree of consistency between model predictions and observations accounting for uncertainty in both terms 3 the november 18 2013 flash flood in sardinia on november 18 2013 the north eastern part of the sardinia island fig 3 was impacted by a western mediterranean extratropical cyclone which caused extreme flash flooding as cold air flowing from the north entered the mediterranean and interacted with warm moist air to the east slow moving embedded thunderstorm complex was developed the intense phase of the rainstorm lasted approximately 12 h starting at 06 00 cet and brought cumulative rainfall amounts up to 450 mm resulting in flooding over a large area and swollen rivers bursting their banks the flash flooding caused 19 casualties and up to 1 billion euros in economic damages niedda et al 2015 the main impacted areas in the island which are considered in this study included the two catchments closing at the cedrino dam 627 km2 and the posada dam 611 km2 and an intermediary river sologo 300 km2 a tributary of cedrino downstream of the dam fig 3 two dominant geological landscapes can be distinguished in the impacted region metamorphic and granitic rocks and sedimentary rocks dolostones and limestones sedimentary rocks outcrop especially in the rio flumineddu catchment within the catchment closing at the cedrino dam fig 3 the rio flumineddu catchment is characterised by karst landscape de waele et al 2010 metamorphic and granitic rocks occupy most of the remaining part of cedrino catchment and a good portion of the posada catchment alluvial deposits are widespread in the floors of the main valleys land cover is characterized by mediterranean maquis on the palaeozoic rocks with a thin soil cover and degraded holm oak quercus ilex forests on the carbonate rocks the largest urban area is the town of nuoro approximately 37 000 inhabitants in the upper part of cedrino catchment fig 3 several smaller settlements are present in the studied catchments this case study is particularly interesting due to the wide range of spatial scales of the affected catchments and to the lack of large geomorphic effects landslides and debris flows on streamflow which might seriously hamper the quality of post flood surveys particularly at small spatial scales e g scorpio et al 2018 the flood is examined by means of an integrated analysis of data from hydro meteorological monitoring networks an intensive post event campaign ipec hereinafter aimed at reconstructing peak discharge from hwms and documenting geomorphic impacts in ungauged streams and hydrological simulations from a spatially distributed model comprehensive data concerning rainfall discharge and topography for the studied flood are made available to the public through the hymex euromedeff database amponsah et al 2018 the following sections describe the data collection and elaboration processes 3 1 rainfall estimation rainfall estimates were obtained by combining weather radar observations with rain gauge data a single polarization c band doppler radar located on monte rasu 1300 m a s l about 50 km from the study basin fig 4 provided rainfall estimates at spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 km2 and 15 min respectively radar data already treated for the removal of ground echoes were provided by regione autonoma della sardegna as gridded matrices for three beam elevations measurement errors due to beam blockage and measurement gaps due to ground echoes contamination were reduced considering the maximum values over the vertical dimension marra and morin 2015 radar and raingauge measurements were merged using the adaptive multi quadric surface fitting algorithm described by martens et al 2013 the assessment of the final radar rainfall estimates was carried out using a leave one out cross validation technique efron 1983 radar rainfall estimates are almost unbiased at the event accumulation scale 0 6 overestimation the standard error between radar and rain gauge event accumulations is 44 of the average rain gauge measurement and the correlation coefficient is 0 895 which indicates that only 20 of the observed variance is due to estimation error the spatial distribution of maximum hourly rainfall intensities and total event rainfall accumulation are reported in fig 4 two convective bands impacted the region with s se to n nw direction and both developed during two storm bursts at 06 00 12 00 and 13 00 20 00 cet despite the strong observed winds convection continued to be triggered over approximately the same locations accumulating rainfall over a relatively small area fig 4 maximum hourly rainfall amounts and event rainfall accumulation derived from the radar reanalysis exceeded 300 and 450 mm respectively with mean areal event rainfall accumulation over cedrino and posada reaching 250 and 195 mm respectively 3 2 flood hydrograph estimation at the cedrino dam the flood hydrograph for the cedrino basin was derived based on the application of the water balance equation over the reservoir as follows 21 q t v t v t δ t δ t e t r t s t q s t where δ t is the time step q t is the flood discharge entering the reservoir at time t v t is the water volume in the reservoir at time t and e t r t s t and q s t are the estimated evaporation flux rainfall flux percolation from the reservoir bottom and discharged water at time t respectively we considered the evaporation and percolation fluxes as negligible for this application the reservoir water volume was estimated based on water stage recorded during the flood and the stage volume relationship the uncertainties arising from these estimates are comparatively less important than those associated to the post flood analyses and therefore their assessment was not considered here the peak discharge estimated in this way was 3022 m3 s 1 at 18 00 cet discharge data of the posada basin were not used in this study because the streamgauge at the dam was submerged and destroyed before flood peak with maximum recorded discharge of 2905 m3 s 1 at 16 45 cet 3 3 ipec peak flow estimation and geomorphic impact characterisation field surveys were carried out from may 19 to 23 2014 with the objective of estimating peak discharges and characterizing geomorphic impacts in ungauged tributaries of the cedrino posada and sologo rivers seventeen 17 cross sections featuring upstream drainage areas ranging between 3 9 and 550 km2 were surveyed and peak discharges were computed by means of the manning strickler discharge equation eq 1 summary of the ipec surveys for the 17 cross sections is reported in table 2 together with mean areal basin rainfall accumulation derived from the radar reanalysis central values are reported for the energy gradient peak flow velocity froude number manning s n and peak discharge table 2 the estimated froude number ranges from 0 54 to 1 03 and is greater than 0 8 in 14 out of the 17 cross sections indicating that the flow regime was relatively close to critical these values are consistent with the extreme intensity of the flood with very high mean flow velocities at flood peak we categorised the geomorphic impacts of the ipec cross sections into three classes following marchi et al 2016 and amponsah et al 2016 i negligible no significant scour fill or widening of the cross section ii moderate small scour fill limited widening of the cross section and iii major significant channel erosion and or aggradation and widening from the 17 surveyed cross sections nine 9 underwent moderate geomorphic changes whereas four 4 each underwent major and negligible geomorphic changes table 2 the dominant moderate geomorphic impacts in spite of the high flood response can be attributed to the channel morphology and geo lithological features as well as the presence of riparian vegetation within the channel reach the study reaches are predominantly set in semi alluvial channels alternating with bedrock outcrops and wide alluvial valley downstream righini et al 2017 4 results 4 1 parameter uncertainty assessment of the flash flood model at the cedrino dam the flood response model was conditioned based on the glue methodology by comparison with the reconstructed flood hydrograph at the cedrino dam table 3 reports a summary of the three sensitive model parameters included in the glue analysis for the simulation and distribution of the behavioural sets the channel and hillslope velocities were kept constant based on previous works marchi et al 2010 amponsah et al 2016 considering the high flow currents associated with the flash flood model conditioning on observed discharge data at the cedrino dam was based on 20 000 iterations using the parameter sets within the intervals in table 3 out of which 70 were considered as behavioural ns4 0 the likelihood weighted quantiles of the simulations are reported in fig 5 together with the observed flood hydrograph qobs and the areal hyetograph for the basin closed at the cedrino dam the likelihood weighted quantiles of the simulated flood hydrographs include the median of the likelihood q50 the range between the 5th and 95th likelihood weighted quantiles q5 q95 and the inter quartile range q25 q75 i e the middle 50 of the likelihood weighted quantiles peak discharges of the likelihood weighted quantiles range between 2311 and 4179 m3 s 1 with a median of 3055 m3 s 1 compared to 3022 m3 s 1 of observed peak discharge at the cedrino dam the observed discharge is out of the simulated uncertainty ranges during two short periods of the rising limb at approximately 15 00 and 17 00 cet fig 5 showing some limits in either the model simulations or in the reconstructed hydrograph 4 2 assessment of observational and model uncertainties at the ipec sections the behavioural parameter sets and their likelihoods calibrated on the discharge data obtained from the cedrino dam were transposed to simulate the flood peaks at the 17 ipec sections the model uncertainty differs in these flood peak simulations depending on the cn parameter and rainfall distributions table 4 reports a summary of the observational and modelling relative errors with 68 confidence intervals 1σ for the ipec cross sections we chose 68 confidence interval to make it easier to compare the uncertainties from the observations which are provided in the form of standard deviations and from the modelling which are provided in quantiles the observational relative errors as well as the resulting uncertainties are normally distributed which fall within 68 confidence interval on a gaussian distribution also starting from the percentiles distribution of likelihood over the peak we calculated the middle 68 confidence interval of the model simulated likelihood weighted quantiles the observational percentage relative errors range between 15 and 36 4 for the 17 estimated peak discharges with mean and standard deviation values of 25 2 and 7 1 respectively these are essentially influenced by the intensity of the observed geomorphic impacts with ranges mean of 15 17 7 16 6 21 8 25 8 24 1 and 35 8 36 4 36 2 for negligible moderate and major categories further than geomorphic impacts the observational uncertainties depend primarily on the difficulties in identifying hwms for estimating the energy line gradient and on the evaluation of the channel roughness parameter in complex terrains the modelled relative errors are consistently larger than the observational ones ranging between 22 5 and 45 6 with mean and standard deviation values of 34 8 and 4 9 respectively the flash flood forensic consistency index ciom is very small 0 10 for the two smallest catchments p09 and p03 indicating that the two uncertainty distributions almost do not overlap table 4 for the other 15 ipec catchments the index ranges between 0 21 and 0 64 with mean and standard deviation values of 0 43 and 0 12 respectively the probability density functions of the observational and model distribution of unit peak discharges for the two ipec catchments p04 and p09 at the extreme tails of the area and slope scales are presented in fig 6 as mentioned earlier the observational distribution is normally distributed whereas the model distribution is obtained as the percentiles distribution of likelihood over the peak from the glue methodology the ciom values presented in table 4 were then computed using eq 20 as the integral of the minimum of the two distributions 4 3 scale dependence of observational and model uncertainties we evaluated the dependence of the observational and model uncertainties on basin area and on channel bed slope fig 7 a reports the comparison between the distribution of the observed and modelled unit peak discharge uncertainty bounds with the ipec catchments arranged in increasing order of upstream drainage area whereas fig 7b reports the relationship with increasing order of channel bed slope note that the limits of the drainage areas and channel bed slopes reported in the figures are not drawn to scale but represent the scales the individual ipec catchments fall within we note from fig 7a that in the three smallest basins with catchment areas less than 10 km2 the model shows a tendency to underestimate the observed peak flows two ipec catchments p09 and p03 provided modelled uncertainty bound outside the observational uncertainty range whereas simulations for p10 are clearly underestimating the observed median value we also note from fig 8 b that for 10 ipec catchments with channel bed slopes less than 1 5 both observational and model uncertainties overlap for the other ipec catchments with slopes greater than 1 5 only two catchments c01 and s03 were consistent the contrasting results for the two catchments p04 and p09 at the extreme tails of the area and slope scales fig 7a and b are worth noting ipec catchment p04 characterised by the largest drainage area and the lowest slope value produced consistent observed and modelled results whereas ipec catchment p09 characterised by the smallest drainage area and the steepest slope in the dataset produced largely inconsistent results fig 8a and b report the relationship between 68 relative errors for both observational and model uncertainties and drainage area plotted on a logarithmic scale and channel bed slope respectively the results show that we cannot reject at 95 confidence interval the null hypothesis that the two slopes are zero with p values largely exceeding 0 05 the lack of relationship between the relative errors and the geomorphological independent variable is in stark contrast with the results presented in fig 9 a and b where the relationship of the same variables with the absolute relative bias between the central values of the observed and modelled flood peaks normalized by the observation are reported these relationships are both statistically significant p less than 0 05 showing that the absolute relative bias increases with decreasing drainage area and increasing channel bed slope the combination of these results shows that with decreasing the basin area the spread of uncertainty around the central values remains the same whereas the divergence between the central values tends to increase significantly then the relatively strong relationship between the flash flood forensic consistency index ciom and both drainage area and channel bed slope shown in fig 10 a and b respectively is not unexpected the relationship between the consistency index and basin area is positive whereas that with channel bed slope is negative with spearman nonparametric rank correlations of 0 57 and 0 58 respectively and p values of 0 003 and 0 004 respectively the inverse relationship between bed slope and the flash flood consistency index is an obvious result of the inverse relationship between basin area and bed slope 5 discussion the estimated observational relative errors we have reported 15 to 36 4 are generally consistent with errors of indirectly estimated peak discharges reported by stewart et al 2012 mccuen and knight 2006 and kirby 1987 stewart et al 2012 reported peak flow uncertainties between 12 3 and 15 5 for moderate to large flows in ephemeral channels of southeast arizona usa which can be compared to uncertainties associated with negligible geomorphic effects in this study kirby 1987 also reported values ranging from 16 to 24 for sections not specifically impacted by geomorphic effects these values are comparable to our estimates for sections that either underwent negligible mean of 16 6 or moderate mean of 24 1 geomorphic impacts measurement errors associated with indirect peak discharge estimates are particularly high for streams with higher gradient e g wohl 1998 lumbroso and gaume 2012 indeed small drainage area coupled with steep channel gradient may control the observational uncertainty through the increasing role of erosional processes which makes indirect flood peak reconstruction from hwms more uncertain the uncertainties in the evaluations of the channel roughness parameter still remain a quagmire in indirect peak flood estimates this is because the estimation of the manning s n for extreme floods comes with a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the lack of exact methods for evaluating all the components that are required for determining the parameter lumbroso and gaume 2012 lumbroso and gaume 2012 reported high degree of uncertainty 25 for reaches with gradient higher than 1 wohl 1998 showed that uncertainty of 25 in channel roughness translates to uncertainty of about 20 in flood peaks for channel reaches with gradients less than or equal to 1 percentage change in flood peaks associated with uncertainty in channel roughness evaluation has been found to relate inversely with channel bed slope and to width depth ratio and directly with roughness wohl 1998 our observational uncertainties increased with channel bed slope though the relationship is not significant fig 8b this is largely due to the introduction of the scour fill term which magnifies the uncertainties the uncertainties from the glue application of the flash flood response model represent parametric and model structural uncertainties but do not include rainfall input uncertainty therefore these uncertainties account only for the effect of transposing the behavioural parameters from the basin closed at the cedrino dam to the set of ipec basins parametric uncertainties come into play because of different basin characteristics and eventually affect the flood responses it is interesting to see that the modelled uncertainty tends to increase with basin size even though this increase is not statistically significant fig 8a this is contrary to the expectation that uncertainty bounds increase as the basin size decreases as reported for instance by merz et al 2009 van esse et al 2013 and poncelet et al 2017 the reduction of uncertainty is mainly driven by results from the ipec basins p03 p09 and p10 with areas less than 10 km2 which are located in regions with strong rainfall gradients if the rainfall input is affected by a residual negative bias in radar rainfall estimation due in these cases to errors in the radar correction in areas with strong rainfall gradients the parametric uncertainty bound will also be reduced more generally there is an implication here that the rainfall bias term operates in a multiplicative sense on the width of the model parameter uncertainty limits by either magnifying or reducing it according to the sign of the bias this also shows the importance of accounting for radar rainfall uncertainties in flash flood forensic hydrology rainfall uncertainty is a recognized major factor in these applications due to the errors affecting radar estimation under heavy precipitation and in orographic environment germann et al 2006 villarini and krajewski 2010 and to the lack of dense local rain gauge networks to validate and adjust radar estimates at small spatial scales peleg et al 2013 in general radar errors may have complex spatio temporal characteristics which may directly affect the simulated peak discharges bronstert and bárdossy 2003 berne and krajewski 2013 cecinati et al 2017 as well as their uncertainties liechti et al 2013 however most of the current approaches to quantify radar rainfall uncertainties such as germann et al 2009 rely on rain gauge data to characterize the mean and covariance matrix of residual errors in radar precipitation estimates transposing these techniques to flash flood events proves difficult due to sparseness of ground based observations for instance in this case study no rain gauge was found to sample the core of the high intensity convective bands fig 4 the results reported in fig 9a show an increase of the divergence between the central values of the two uncertainty distributions with decreasing basin size thus supporting the indications reported above about the effects of residual radar rainfall bias on flood response modelling the residual negative bias likely affecting the rainfall estimates for the basins less than 10 km2 translates into a bias in the central values of the model uncertainty distributions as well as into a reduced spread of the same distributions the introduction of the novel flash flood forensic consistency index to measure of the degree of overlap of the two uncertainty distributions observational and model advances over the study by amponsah et al 2016 by incorporating uncertainties associated with flash flood response models with those from indirect estimates this index may help in making decisions on accepting or rejecting peak flood estimates from surveys and from model simulations we have shown that the index increases significantly with increasing drainage area and decreasing channel bed slope in this way supporting the results obtained by merz et al 2009 this shows that a combination of small drainage area and steep channel bed slope makes peak flow quantification through forensic flash flood analysis more uncertain at certain scales and therefore calls for the development of more robust approaches for flash flood assessment in small sized rugged relief mountain basins further research in forensic flash flood analysis at small spatial scales should advance toward including the rainfall input uncertainty in the modelling framework it is likely that a formal introduction of the term related to the rainfall input uncertainty would have led to different results increasing the model uncertainty for instance however this would require a radar rainfall uncertainty assessment method that can operate with the typical scarce availability of data from rain gauges as it happens for flash flood analysis the main task would be to get a reliable estimation of rainfall uncertainty with high spatial and temporal resolution then rainfall uncertainty can be independently included in a modelling framework for example by generating multiple realizations with each model parameter set the observational framework can also benefit from the use of different ways to report observational uncertainty that remove some assumptions in our framework mccuen and knight 2006 for instance applied fuzzy set analysis to develop confidence interval for indirect peak discharge estimates the use of automatic techniques such as structure for motion to survey the channel morphology and structure e g smith et al 2014 andreadakis et al 2020 can help to better evaluate channel roughness and provide a quantitative measure of the scour fill term thus helping to limit these uncertainty sources finally the forensic concept would benefit from advancing the use of measures to assess the intersection between observational and modelling uncertainty distribution this will provide the modeler with a measure of the statistical confidence in order to reject a certain observation or a given model prediction 6 conclusions in this work we introduced a flash flood forensic consistency index to evaluate the degree of overlap between the observational and model uncertainty distributions and thus to assess the expected accuracy of flash flood peak estimates when a combination of post flood surveying and hydrological modelling is used we analyse how the observational and model uncertainty distributions and their degree of overlap quantified by means of the consistency index scale with basin area and channel bed slope the study is focused on the november 2013 flash flood in sardinia by means of post flood indirect peak discharge estimation in ungauged channels and flood response modelling driven by weather radar rainfall estimates the main findings of the study are summarised as follows the observational uncertainties are influenced by in decreasing order of importance the estimation the energy line gradient the intensity of geomorphic adjustment and the evaluation of the channel roughness parameter observational uncertainties do not show any significant relationship with basin scale or channel bed slope mainly because we have considered the scour fill geomorphic term which magnifies the relevant uncertainties the absolute relative biases between the central values of the two uncertainty distributions are shown to increase significantly with decreasing drainage area and increasing channel bed slope this is related to the effects of residual negative radar rainfall bias which mainly affects small basins in the specific case study as well as the increasing role of erosional processes in steep channels scale dependence is reported for the degree of overlap between observational and model uncertainty distributions with the consistency index significantly increasing with increasing basin area and decreasing channel reach slope this shows that a combination of small basin area 10 km2 and steep channel bed slope 1 5 makes peak flow quantification through forensic flash flood analysis more uncertain the framework presented in this study should be extended to other case studies and assess how the scale dependence of flash flood consistency arises in different hydroclimatic environments when we use different radar measurement techniques and the application of different hydrological models on one hand this may help to identify merits in the improved measurement and modelling techniques and on the other hand we can identify ways to place limits for the flash flood confidence index and then identify limits to forensic assessment of flash floods minimal area for instance assessing a model s performance in the presence of measurement noise with our suggested approach helps to decide whether more effort should be invested in improving the existing models and or extending the set with better performing models or whether first of all more accurate data are

3572,the mismatch between the space time scales of flash flood occurrence and those of the typical hydro meteorological monitoring networks has stimulated the development of forensic flash flood analysis which involves post flood indirect peak discharge estimation in ungauged channels and flood response modelling driven by weather radar rainfall estimates however both approaches are potentially affected by significant uncertainties assessment of scale dependence of such uncertainties is important to identify how uncertainty affecting forensic flash flood analysis increases with decreasing basin size in this work we apply the forensic methodology to the flash flood of november 18 2013 in sardinia italy we introduce the flash flood forensic consistency index as a tool to compare the probability distribution of peak discharge uncertainties from observational and model estimates and to determine the scale effects of the forensic analysis concept uncertainties in field based peak flow estimates are evaluated through a first order error analysis of the taylor series approximation of the slope conveyance method whereas uncertainties in flash flood modelling are based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methodology using a distributed hydrologic model results show no significant relationship between observational and modelling uncertainties considered independently and basin area and channel bed slope conversely when considering the interaction between the two uncertainty distributions a relationship arises between their degree of overlap and basin size in particular with decreasing basin area or increasing channel bed slope the absolute relative bias between the estimated peak flow values increases more than their relative uncertainties decreasing the consistency index this calls for more robust approaches for the analysis of flash flood response in small sized rugged relief mountain basins which are of high interest for flood risk management keywords flash floods peak discharge post flood surveys flood modelling uncertainty analysis 1 introduction flash floods constitute about 56 of flood events in europe paprotny et al 2018 and are characterized by the highest average mortality when compared with other types of floods doocy et al 2013 the high risk potential of flash floods is related to their rapid occurrence and to the small and dispersed spatial extent of the impacted areas their characteristic limited spatial and temporal scales usually less than 3000 km2 and 48 h respectively marchi et al 2010 amponsah et al 2018 make the monitoring of flash floods by conventional rain gauge and stream gauge networks challenging leading to uncertain quantification and modelling of the events magnitude borga et al 2008 a general methodology for the detailed reconstruction of flash floods where no direct or sparse systematic hydrometeorological data and observations are available termed flash flood forensic analysis has been advanced in the last decade keating et al 2016 bronstert et al 2018 borga et al 2019 this methodology involves post flood surveys of flood peaks from high water marks hwms hereinafter re analysis of weather radar rainfall estimates berne and krajewski 2013 park et al 2019 and hydrological modelling to ensure consistency among the various types of observations rinat et al 2021 amponsah et al 2016 presented a forensic analysis framework for achieving sound estimates of peak flood discharge at multiple sections along ungauged river networks the framework consists of three steps involving i indirect peak discharge reconstruction from hwms ii flood response simulations using spatially distributed hydrological models and iii comparison of the two estimates within an uncertainty framework the indirect reconstruction of peak discharge is often carried out by using the slope conveyance method gaume and borga 2008 amponsah et al 2016 costa and jarrett 2008 illustrate some limitations of the slope conveyance method for post flood assessment of discharge and point out that the slope area method based on multiple section surveys should be preferred however the slope conveyance method has some practical advantages in the case of flash floods because it allows a single representative cross section to be selected where high water marks are well defined consequently this method is widely applied especially in mountain rivers of complex topography the slope conveyance method is however affected by several observational errors these errors include but are not limited to the accuracy of measurements and the choice of the roughness coefficient that may affect the indirect estimation of peak discharges wohl 1998 lumbroso and gaume 2012 also channel erosion and or aggradation can cause the cross section surveyed after the event to be different from the hydraulic conditions at peak flow kirby 1987 jarrett 1987 the impact of these sources of errors has motivated several attempts for the specific assessment of uncertainties affecting indirect peak discharge estimation e g kirby 1987 mccuen and knight 2006 stewart et al 2012 the simulation of flood responses through hydrological modelling driven by radar rainfall estimates permits to compare flood peaks from simulations with indirect post event estimates e g borga et al 2007 marchi et al 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2012 amponsah et al 2016 as form of consistency check however hydrological simulations of flash flood response are subject to considerable uncertainties due to model structure parameterization as well as input data it is therefore important that these uncertainties are quantified for comparison with indirect post event peak flow estimates the comparison between modelled and indirect post event peak flow estimates plays an important role in forensic analysis as it permits to identify and remove either erroneous field estimates or biased flood simulations and to isolate consistent hydrological simulations it is also possible to identify in this way flood peaks which are due to non hydrological processes such as geomorphic processes related to landslides debris flows and hyper concentrated flows these estimates may require specific estimation methods for dam break or non newtonian flows prochaska et al 2008 bodoque et al 2011 as a matter of fact the degree of overlap between the uncertainty distributions of modelled and indirectly observed peak discharges provides a quantification of the confidence in peak flood estimation however to the best of our knowledge no methodologies are available to quantify this confidence so far an important research question concerns the scale dependence of the observational and modelling uncertainty distributions as well as of their degree of overlap if the evidence of scale dependence in these uncertainty measures exists and in particular the evidence of decreasing degree of overlap with decreasing basin size then this may limit the use of flash flood estimates at a range of basin scales since it is at small catchment scales that flash flood research may provide the most interesting findings borga et al 2014 this evidence may lead to invest more resources in both the modelling and field survey phases literature suggests that these scale effects may not be negligible and that should be considered especially the evidence that model performance is related to the catchment area e g merz et al 2009 van esse et al 2013 poncelet et al 2017 merz et al 2009 for instance simulated the water balance dynamics of 269 catchments in austria with sizes ranging between 10 and 130 000 km2 using a semi distributed conceptual model with rain gauge derived precipitation input the simulation results suggest that the model efficiency increases over the scale range of 10 to 10 000 km2 these authors were able to identify a number of factors that may contribute to this scale effect on one hand the spatial variability averages out with scale so less detail is needed as one moves up in scale on the other hand the average number of rain gauges per catchment increases with catchment scale obviously the larger the sampling density of stations with respect to the typical scales of variability of precipitation the better rainfall can be estimated in addition lumbroso and gaume 2012 report that uncertainty of flash flood peak flows estimates from indirect methods increases with the gradient of the watercourses more specifically reaches with gradient higher than 1 were frequently found to have a high degree of uncertainty often greater than 25 similar conclusions are reported by wohl 1998 who was able to show that peak flow estimates in small and steep gradient rivers with low width depth ratios show higher sensitivity to changes in the roughness coefficient than in large rivers given this background this work contributes to the forensic research on flash flood by i introducing an index to quantify the degree of overlap between the modelling and observational uncertainty distributions termed flash flood forensic consistency index in the following and by ii analysing the effects of basin scale and river bed slope on both the modelling and observational uncertainties and on the flash flood forensic consistency index this work expands the framework presented by amponsah et al 2016 developing a complete presentation of the statistical framework of the slope conveyance discharge determination where some basic assumptions are removed these assumptions include the dependence of the errors affecting the estimation of the energy line gradient on the accuracy of the surveying instrument as well as the dependence of the errors affecting the evaluation of roughness coefficient on the intensity of geomorphic impacts the november 18 2013 flash flood in the cedrino and posada river basins north eastern sardinia italy provides a template for this scale effect analysis this flash flood was characterised by extreme unit peak discharges and contributed to determining the upper envelope curve for the relationship between basin area and unit peak discharges for european and mediterranean flash floods amponsah et al 2018 amponsah et al 2020 this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the concept of forensic flash flood analysis with assessment of both observational and modelling uncertainties section 3 presents a description of the november 18 2013 flash flood event and elaboration of the collated data section 4 presents the results of the scale dependence analysis for the studied flash flood with the discussion of the flash flood forensic consistency index presented in section 5 finally section 6 provides the conclusions of the study 2 methodology for observational and modelling uncertainty assessment forensic analysis of flash floods relies on the combined analysis of discharge estimations from stream gauge observations and post event surveys and hydrological modelling driven by spatio temporal rainfall estimates borga et al 2008 gaume and borga 2008 marchi et al 2010 amponsah et al 2016 borga et al 2019 fig 1 presents a flow chart of forensic flash flood analysis framework with the uncertainty assessments of the observational and modelling components the following sections describe the uncertainty assessments for both indirect peak discharge estimates and flood response modelling as well as the framework to compare the two distributions of uncertainty 2 1 uncertainty assessment of the slope conveyance method 2 1 1 the slope conveyance indirect peak discharge determination the slope conveyance method gaume and borga 2008 amponsah et al 2016 computes peak discharge q m3 s 1 by means of the one dimensional manning strickler equation as follows 1 q 1 n a 5 3 p 2 3 s e 1 2 where a m2 is the wetted cross sectional area p m is the wetted cross sectional perimeter computed as a r where r m is the hydraulic radius s e m m 1 is the energy line gradient and n is the channel roughness coefficient in the solution of the slope conveyance discharge determination fig 2 we consider multiple data points of hwms along the longitudinal profile of the channel banks flood plains and riparian vegetation to estimate the energy line gradient using least squares regression model fig 2a one river section is used for the survey of the transversal profile of the channel geometry fig 2b 2 1 2 linear error analysis of the discharge formula the linear error analysis uses a first order taylor series approximation of the manning strickler discharge equation eq 1 the error analysis is based on the equation for the variance of a sum of correlated random variates kirby 1987 amponsah et al 2016 from eq 1 q is a function of the following variables q f n a p s e the error in q δ q due to errors δ n δ a δ p and δ s e in n a p and s e respectively may then be treated as a first order taylor series approximation as follows 2 δ q q n δ n q a δ a q p δ p q s e δ s e 2 q a q p δ p δ a where q z δ z is the error in q due to an error δ z in the generic variable z assuming the covariance terms to be negligible the variance of δ q can be expressed as 3 var δ q q n 2 v a r δ n q a 2 v a r δ a q p 2 v a r δ p q s e 2 v a r δ s e taking the partial derivatives from eq 1 eq 3 can be written as 4 var δ q q 2 var δ n n 2 25 9 var δ a a 2 4 9 var δ p p 2 1 4 var δ s e s e 2 by using ε z 2 v a r δ z z 2 to represent the relative error variance of the variable z eq 4 can then be written as 5 ε q 2 ε n 2 25 9 ε a 2 4 9 ε p 2 1 4 ε s e 2 the uncertainty in the estimated peak discharge can then be expressed as the relative error that extends one standard deviation on both sides of the field estimated value as 6 ε q ε n 2 25 9 ε a 2 4 9 ε p 2 1 4 ε s e 2 1 2 2 1 3 error analysis of the cross sectional properties cross sectional properties area a and wetted perimeter p with corresponding error variances var δ a and var δ p result from errors in the measurements of the section width b section mean depths d and scour s fig 2c shows the measurements which are considered in the surveying of the cross section geometry transversal profile in fig 2b at any point i r i is a rod reading y is an equivalent measurement down to the water surface as defined by the regression of the hwms and s is the scour depth scour is assumed to be of constant depth across the section whereas fill is treated as negative scour under these assumptions the relationship for the flow depth d i corresponding to flood peak at any point in the cross section is d i r i y s which permits to develop the error analysis of the two cross sectional properties from fig 2c the cross sectional area and wetted perimeter at peak flow can be estimated as follows 7 a i 1 n b i r i r i 1 2 b y b s 8 p i 1 n b i 2 r i r i 1 2 1 2 where b i is the transverse distance between ground points i 1 and i n 1 is the number of ground points used to survey the channel cross section and b b i is the top channel width corresponding to the water surface of the flood peak the errors in d i and s are represented by relative error variances ε d 2 and ε s 2 respectively which are referenced to the mean flow depth d a b the errors in b i are also represented by relative error variance ε b 2 referenced to the average spacing between ground points b b n we assume here that i the ground points are approximately equally spaced ii the flow depth at all points is approximately equal to the mean depth d and iii measurement errors in b d and s are statistically uncorrelated from eq 7 the error variance in the surveyed cross sectional area can be simplified as 9 var δ a i 1 n a b i 2 v a r δ b i i 1 n a r i 2 v a r δ r i a y 2 v a r δ y a s 2 v a r δ s taking the partial derivatives from eq 7 the relative error variance in the measured cross sectional area can then be expressed as 10 var δ a a 2 ε a 2 ε b 2 n ε d 2 ε s 2 in a similar approach the errors in wetted perimeter can be derived from eq 8 as follows 11 var δ p i 1 n p b i 2 v a r δ b i i 0 n p r i 2 v a r δ r i for relatively wide shallow and uniform channel cross sections we may assume that the wetted perimeter is approximately equal to the top channel width then p b i 1 and p r i 0 relative error variance in measured wetted perimeter can then be expressed as 12 var δ p p 2 ε p 2 ε b 2 n substituting eq 10 and eq 12 into eq 6 yields 13 ε q ε n 2 29 9 ε b 2 n 25 9 ε d 2 ε s 2 1 4 ε s e 2 1 2 eq 13 represents a weighted sum of the error variances of the various measured and estimated variables with the weights depending on the geometric and hydraulic configuration of the channel reach this accounts for five observational error sources affecting the measurement or estimation of the following variables energy line gradient s e section width b section mean depth d scour fill after peak s and the channel roughness parameter n 2 1 4 error analysis of the energy line gradient the water surface fall over the channel reach length defines the energy line gradient s e this is obtained as the slope of the least squared regression of i 1 2 m hwms longitudinal profile in fig 2a such that the sum of squared residual errors is minimised the observational error variance in the estimation of s e is then obtained as follows 14 var δ s e i 1 m y i y i 2 i 1 m x i x 2 m 1 where y i is the hwms elevation and x i is the corresponding i th position along the reach length x is mean longitudinal distance between the hwm points y i b 0 b 1 x i is the least squared estimate of hwm point y i for a given point x i and b 0 and b 1 are the estimated intercept and slope of the linear regression respectively the relative error variance in the estimated energy line gradient is thus 15 ε s e 2 var δ s e s e 2 2 1 5 estimation of the discharge error variance observational error variances related to the measurement and estimation of the roughness parameter n cross sectional geometry in relation to section width b and section mean depth d and unidentified scour and or fill after flood peak s are incorporated with the evaluated observational error variance of the energy line gradient eq 15 to derive the observational relative error for the slope conveyance indirect peak discharge determination eq 13 the estimation of the roughness parameter is based on the analysis of the various factors affecting the estimation of the manning s n lumbroso and gaume 2012 during field surveys flood geomorphologists provide a range of roughness parameter around an expected value due to complex channel morphology in mountain streams pictures of the channel reach are also analysed which represent a precious help for providing sound roughness estimates yochum et al 2014 surveyed cross sectional geometry is primarily affected by measurement errors in section width b and section mean depth d to recall the assumption made is that the ground points are approximately equally spaced and that the depth at all points is approximately equal to the mean depth however this is not always the case especially for section depths in mountain streams with complex morphology with high degree of nonuniformity for this reason we followed the approaches by amponsah et al 2016 and kirby 1987 for the measurement errors in b and d relative errors ε b and ε d are therefore estimated as 0 01 and 0 02 respectively which are influenced by the accuracy of topographic instrument used the uncertainty associated with the evaluation of the scour fill parameter was ranked into three classes of intensity of the geomorphic impacts of the flood marchi et al 2016 following amponsah et al 2016 the relative error ε s was quantified as 0 04 0 12 and 0 20 for cross sections that underwent negligible moderate and major geomorphic changes respectively thus the more intense the flood related geomorphic impacts within a channel reach the more uncertain is the flood peak estimate the various error analyses presented above yield an expected value of the relative errors in the field estimated peak discharge which can be developed from eq 13 as follows 16 ε q ε n 2 0 25 ε s e 2 3 22 10 4 n δ 1 2 where δ 5 55 10 3 41 1 10 3 and 112 2 10 3 for negligible moderate and major geomorphic impacts respectively 2 2 uncertainty assessment of flash flood response modelling flash flood model prediction uncertainty arises from a variety of sources such as model structural errors parameter uncertainty and input error while we are currently working on methodologies to account for rainfall input uncertainty in the typical flash flood conditions with just a few or not at all rain gauges available in this work we focus only on model parameter uncertainty the uncertainty in the model parameters results from an inability to accurately quantify the input parameters of a model 2 2 1 spatially distributed flood response model the kinematic local excess model klem is an event based conceptual rainfall runoff model which has successfully been implemented to simulate extreme flash floods in europe over the past 15 years e g borga et al 2007 zanon et al 2010 marchi et al 2010 ruiz villanueva et al 2012 amponsah et al 2016 the model combines a spatially distributed runoff generation module and a geomorphological description of the drainage network for runoff propagation modelling runoff generation is simulated by applying the scs cn approach ponce and hawkins 1996 to quantify effective rainfall the scs cn method is applied by using an infiltration storativity parameter x for the overall calibration of the method the use of this parameter allows one to calibrate a spatial distribution of curve number cn values in order to simulate correctly the observed flood water balance on consideration of the role played by geology on runoff generation during flash floods norbiato et al 2009 vannier et al 2016 the cn parameter spatial distribution over all basins involved in the model application was derived based on the lithology map a simple model da ros and borga 1997 giannoni et al 2003 is used to represent the runoff propagation for the response of the drainage system this requires the use of a channelization support area to separate hillslope and channel transport paths and two invariant hillslope and channel velocities the model computes discharge q t at any location x y along the river network as follows 17 q t a q t τ x y x y d a where a is the area draining to the specific outlet location q t x y is the runoff at time t and location x y and τ x y is the routing time from point x y to the outlet of the basin specified by the area a the routing time is defined as 18 τ x y l h x y v h l c x y v c where l h x y is the flow distance from the point x y to the channel network following the steepest descent path l c x y is the length of the subsequent channel drainage path to the basin outlet and v c and v h are the two invariant channel and hillslope velocities respectively the model also includes a linear conceptual reservoir for base flow modelling which is controlled by a temporal parameter a k 2 the model requires the identification of the parameters described in table 1 see borga et al 2007 for more details the model was run at 15 min time interval 2 2 2 the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology the glue methodology beven and binley 1992 montanari 2005 blasone et al 2008 stedinger et al 2008 is applied to evaluate the parameter uncertainties in flood response model predictions the glue methodology instead of seeking for an ideal set of parameters to simulate the observed flood dynamics considers the existence of many parameter sets that give acceptable predictions behavioural these sets of parameters are analysed within a pseudo bayesian framework and provide a distribution of predictions conditioned on the available observational data the model parameters were conditioned based on the observed flood hydrograph three sensitive model parameters were considered for the application of the klem model and were sampled using a latin hypercube method i the infiltration storativity parameter x ii the initial abstraction parameter ia and iii the subsurface reservoir parameter ak2 table 1 the nash and sutcliffe 1970 criterion with an exponent of four ns4 was used as likelihood estimator to give more weight to the peaks which is the most important variable in forensic flash flood analysis models with likelihood above zero are considered as behavioural for each temporal interval t the likelihood weighted quantiles of predicted discharge were calculated following beven and freer 2001 as 19 p q t q i 1 b l m θ i q t i q where p q t q is the prediction quantile for discharge q t below a given threshold q b is the number of behavioural models analysed and l m θ i q t i q is the likelihood of the i th model such that predictions q t i are below the threshold the model conditioned based on the glue methodology was implemented to the set of basins considered for the ipec application for this the behavioural model parameter sets were transposed to these basins together with their likelihood values 2 3 framework for the comparison of the observational and model uncertainties a framework for the comparison of the observational and model uncertainties is required to remove either erroneous field derived estimates or biased flood simulations and to isolate consistent hydrological simulations a comparison between observational and model uncertainties can be represented as a difference between probability distributions this difference can be quantified with various distance measures which differ in their properties and interpretation schöniger et al 2015 a dimensionless measure with fixed bounds between zero maximum distance and one minimum distance might provide an intuitive basis to judge model performance the bhattacharyya coefficient bhattacharyya 1943 is such a relative measure however we found that the computation of the bhattacharyya coefficient is heavily influenced by the number of partitions used to evaluate the integral with too few partitions losing accuracy by overestimating the overlap region and too many partitions losing accuracy by creating individual partitions with no members despite being in a densely populated sample space to measure the degree of overlap between observational and modelling uncertainties given as probability distributions we use an index similar to that advanced by abramowitz and gupta 2008 this index was found less sensitive than the bhattacharyya coefficient to the number of partitions used to evaluate the integral for the two observational and model probability density functions o x and m x the flash flood forensic consistency index ci om is given as follows 20 ci om min o m d x the index ranges between 0 and 1 where ci om 0 implies no overlap at all whereas ci om 1 indicate completely identical distributions the flash flood forensic consistency index provides a measure of the degree of consistency between model predictions and observations accounting for uncertainty in both terms 3 the november 18 2013 flash flood in sardinia on november 18 2013 the north eastern part of the sardinia island fig 3 was impacted by a western mediterranean extratropical cyclone which caused extreme flash flooding as cold air flowing from the north entered the mediterranean and interacted with warm moist air to the east slow moving embedded thunderstorm complex was developed the intense phase of the rainstorm lasted approximately 12 h starting at 06 00 cet and brought cumulative rainfall amounts up to 450 mm resulting in flooding over a large area and swollen rivers bursting their banks the flash flooding caused 19 casualties and up to 1 billion euros in economic damages niedda et al 2015 the main impacted areas in the island which are considered in this study included the two catchments closing at the cedrino dam 627 km2 and the posada dam 611 km2 and an intermediary river sologo 300 km2 a tributary of cedrino downstream of the dam fig 3 two dominant geological landscapes can be distinguished in the impacted region metamorphic and granitic rocks and sedimentary rocks dolostones and limestones sedimentary rocks outcrop especially in the rio flumineddu catchment within the catchment closing at the cedrino dam fig 3 the rio flumineddu catchment is characterised by karst landscape de waele et al 2010 metamorphic and granitic rocks occupy most of the remaining part of cedrino catchment and a good portion of the posada catchment alluvial deposits are widespread in the floors of the main valleys land cover is characterized by mediterranean maquis on the palaeozoic rocks with a thin soil cover and degraded holm oak quercus ilex forests on the carbonate rocks the largest urban area is the town of nuoro approximately 37 000 inhabitants in the upper part of cedrino catchment fig 3 several smaller settlements are present in the studied catchments this case study is particularly interesting due to the wide range of spatial scales of the affected catchments and to the lack of large geomorphic effects landslides and debris flows on streamflow which might seriously hamper the quality of post flood surveys particularly at small spatial scales e g scorpio et al 2018 the flood is examined by means of an integrated analysis of data from hydro meteorological monitoring networks an intensive post event campaign ipec hereinafter aimed at reconstructing peak discharge from hwms and documenting geomorphic impacts in ungauged streams and hydrological simulations from a spatially distributed model comprehensive data concerning rainfall discharge and topography for the studied flood are made available to the public through the hymex euromedeff database amponsah et al 2018 the following sections describe the data collection and elaboration processes 3 1 rainfall estimation rainfall estimates were obtained by combining weather radar observations with rain gauge data a single polarization c band doppler radar located on monte rasu 1300 m a s l about 50 km from the study basin fig 4 provided rainfall estimates at spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 km2 and 15 min respectively radar data already treated for the removal of ground echoes were provided by regione autonoma della sardegna as gridded matrices for three beam elevations measurement errors due to beam blockage and measurement gaps due to ground echoes contamination were reduced considering the maximum values over the vertical dimension marra and morin 2015 radar and raingauge measurements were merged using the adaptive multi quadric surface fitting algorithm described by martens et al 2013 the assessment of the final radar rainfall estimates was carried out using a leave one out cross validation technique efron 1983 radar rainfall estimates are almost unbiased at the event accumulation scale 0 6 overestimation the standard error between radar and rain gauge event accumulations is 44 of the average rain gauge measurement and the correlation coefficient is 0 895 which indicates that only 20 of the observed variance is due to estimation error the spatial distribution of maximum hourly rainfall intensities and total event rainfall accumulation are reported in fig 4 two convective bands impacted the region with s se to n nw direction and both developed during two storm bursts at 06 00 12 00 and 13 00 20 00 cet despite the strong observed winds convection continued to be triggered over approximately the same locations accumulating rainfall over a relatively small area fig 4 maximum hourly rainfall amounts and event rainfall accumulation derived from the radar reanalysis exceeded 300 and 450 mm respectively with mean areal event rainfall accumulation over cedrino and posada reaching 250 and 195 mm respectively 3 2 flood hydrograph estimation at the cedrino dam the flood hydrograph for the cedrino basin was derived based on the application of the water balance equation over the reservoir as follows 21 q t v t v t δ t δ t e t r t s t q s t where δ t is the time step q t is the flood discharge entering the reservoir at time t v t is the water volume in the reservoir at time t and e t r t s t and q s t are the estimated evaporation flux rainfall flux percolation from the reservoir bottom and discharged water at time t respectively we considered the evaporation and percolation fluxes as negligible for this application the reservoir water volume was estimated based on water stage recorded during the flood and the stage volume relationship the uncertainties arising from these estimates are comparatively less important than those associated to the post flood analyses and therefore their assessment was not considered here the peak discharge estimated in this way was 3022 m3 s 1 at 18 00 cet discharge data of the posada basin were not used in this study because the streamgauge at the dam was submerged and destroyed before flood peak with maximum recorded discharge of 2905 m3 s 1 at 16 45 cet 3 3 ipec peak flow estimation and geomorphic impact characterisation field surveys were carried out from may 19 to 23 2014 with the objective of estimating peak discharges and characterizing geomorphic impacts in ungauged tributaries of the cedrino posada and sologo rivers seventeen 17 cross sections featuring upstream drainage areas ranging between 3 9 and 550 km2 were surveyed and peak discharges were computed by means of the manning strickler discharge equation eq 1 summary of the ipec surveys for the 17 cross sections is reported in table 2 together with mean areal basin rainfall accumulation derived from the radar reanalysis central values are reported for the energy gradient peak flow velocity froude number manning s n and peak discharge table 2 the estimated froude number ranges from 0 54 to 1 03 and is greater than 0 8 in 14 out of the 17 cross sections indicating that the flow regime was relatively close to critical these values are consistent with the extreme intensity of the flood with very high mean flow velocities at flood peak we categorised the geomorphic impacts of the ipec cross sections into three classes following marchi et al 2016 and amponsah et al 2016 i negligible no significant scour fill or widening of the cross section ii moderate small scour fill limited widening of the cross section and iii major significant channel erosion and or aggradation and widening from the 17 surveyed cross sections nine 9 underwent moderate geomorphic changes whereas four 4 each underwent major and negligible geomorphic changes table 2 the dominant moderate geomorphic impacts in spite of the high flood response can be attributed to the channel morphology and geo lithological features as well as the presence of riparian vegetation within the channel reach the study reaches are predominantly set in semi alluvial channels alternating with bedrock outcrops and wide alluvial valley downstream righini et al 2017 4 results 4 1 parameter uncertainty assessment of the flash flood model at the cedrino dam the flood response model was conditioned based on the glue methodology by comparison with the reconstructed flood hydrograph at the cedrino dam table 3 reports a summary of the three sensitive model parameters included in the glue analysis for the simulation and distribution of the behavioural sets the channel and hillslope velocities were kept constant based on previous works marchi et al 2010 amponsah et al 2016 considering the high flow currents associated with the flash flood model conditioning on observed discharge data at the cedrino dam was based on 20 000 iterations using the parameter sets within the intervals in table 3 out of which 70 were considered as behavioural ns4 0 the likelihood weighted quantiles of the simulations are reported in fig 5 together with the observed flood hydrograph qobs and the areal hyetograph for the basin closed at the cedrino dam the likelihood weighted quantiles of the simulated flood hydrographs include the median of the likelihood q50 the range between the 5th and 95th likelihood weighted quantiles q5 q95 and the inter quartile range q25 q75 i e the middle 50 of the likelihood weighted quantiles peak discharges of the likelihood weighted quantiles range between 2311 and 4179 m3 s 1 with a median of 3055 m3 s 1 compared to 3022 m3 s 1 of observed peak discharge at the cedrino dam the observed discharge is out of the simulated uncertainty ranges during two short periods of the rising limb at approximately 15 00 and 17 00 cet fig 5 showing some limits in either the model simulations or in the reconstructed hydrograph 4 2 assessment of observational and model uncertainties at the ipec sections the behavioural parameter sets and their likelihoods calibrated on the discharge data obtained from the cedrino dam were transposed to simulate the flood peaks at the 17 ipec sections the model uncertainty differs in these flood peak simulations depending on the cn parameter and rainfall distributions table 4 reports a summary of the observational and modelling relative errors with 68 confidence intervals 1σ for the ipec cross sections we chose 68 confidence interval to make it easier to compare the uncertainties from the observations which are provided in the form of standard deviations and from the modelling which are provided in quantiles the observational relative errors as well as the resulting uncertainties are normally distributed which fall within 68 confidence interval on a gaussian distribution also starting from the percentiles distribution of likelihood over the peak we calculated the middle 68 confidence interval of the model simulated likelihood weighted quantiles the observational percentage relative errors range between 15 and 36 4 for the 17 estimated peak discharges with mean and standard deviation values of 25 2 and 7 1 respectively these are essentially influenced by the intensity of the observed geomorphic impacts with ranges mean of 15 17 7 16 6 21 8 25 8 24 1 and 35 8 36 4 36 2 for negligible moderate and major categories further than geomorphic impacts the observational uncertainties depend primarily on the difficulties in identifying hwms for estimating the energy line gradient and on the evaluation of the channel roughness parameter in complex terrains the modelled relative errors are consistently larger than the observational ones ranging between 22 5 and 45 6 with mean and standard deviation values of 34 8 and 4 9 respectively the flash flood forensic consistency index ciom is very small 0 10 for the two smallest catchments p09 and p03 indicating that the two uncertainty distributions almost do not overlap table 4 for the other 15 ipec catchments the index ranges between 0 21 and 0 64 with mean and standard deviation values of 0 43 and 0 12 respectively the probability density functions of the observational and model distribution of unit peak discharges for the two ipec catchments p04 and p09 at the extreme tails of the area and slope scales are presented in fig 6 as mentioned earlier the observational distribution is normally distributed whereas the model distribution is obtained as the percentiles distribution of likelihood over the peak from the glue methodology the ciom values presented in table 4 were then computed using eq 20 as the integral of the minimum of the two distributions 4 3 scale dependence of observational and model uncertainties we evaluated the dependence of the observational and model uncertainties on basin area and on channel bed slope fig 7 a reports the comparison between the distribution of the observed and modelled unit peak discharge uncertainty bounds with the ipec catchments arranged in increasing order of upstream drainage area whereas fig 7b reports the relationship with increasing order of channel bed slope note that the limits of the drainage areas and channel bed slopes reported in the figures are not drawn to scale but represent the scales the individual ipec catchments fall within we note from fig 7a that in the three smallest basins with catchment areas less than 10 km2 the model shows a tendency to underestimate the observed peak flows two ipec catchments p09 and p03 provided modelled uncertainty bound outside the observational uncertainty range whereas simulations for p10 are clearly underestimating the observed median value we also note from fig 8 b that for 10 ipec catchments with channel bed slopes less than 1 5 both observational and model uncertainties overlap for the other ipec catchments with slopes greater than 1 5 only two catchments c01 and s03 were consistent the contrasting results for the two catchments p04 and p09 at the extreme tails of the area and slope scales fig 7a and b are worth noting ipec catchment p04 characterised by the largest drainage area and the lowest slope value produced consistent observed and modelled results whereas ipec catchment p09 characterised by the smallest drainage area and the steepest slope in the dataset produced largely inconsistent results fig 8a and b report the relationship between 68 relative errors for both observational and model uncertainties and drainage area plotted on a logarithmic scale and channel bed slope respectively the results show that we cannot reject at 95 confidence interval the null hypothesis that the two slopes are zero with p values largely exceeding 0 05 the lack of relationship between the relative errors and the geomorphological independent variable is in stark contrast with the results presented in fig 9 a and b where the relationship of the same variables with the absolute relative bias between the central values of the observed and modelled flood peaks normalized by the observation are reported these relationships are both statistically significant p less than 0 05 showing that the absolute relative bias increases with decreasing drainage area and increasing channel bed slope the combination of these results shows that with decreasing the basin area the spread of uncertainty around the central values remains the same whereas the divergence between the central values tends to increase significantly then the relatively strong relationship between the flash flood forensic consistency index ciom and both drainage area and channel bed slope shown in fig 10 a and b respectively is not unexpected the relationship between the consistency index and basin area is positive whereas that with channel bed slope is negative with spearman nonparametric rank correlations of 0 57 and 0 58 respectively and p values of 0 003 and 0 004 respectively the inverse relationship between bed slope and the flash flood consistency index is an obvious result of the inverse relationship between basin area and bed slope 5 discussion the estimated observational relative errors we have reported 15 to 36 4 are generally consistent with errors of indirectly estimated peak discharges reported by stewart et al 2012 mccuen and knight 2006 and kirby 1987 stewart et al 2012 reported peak flow uncertainties between 12 3 and 15 5 for moderate to large flows in ephemeral channels of southeast arizona usa which can be compared to uncertainties associated with negligible geomorphic effects in this study kirby 1987 also reported values ranging from 16 to 24 for sections not specifically impacted by geomorphic effects these values are comparable to our estimates for sections that either underwent negligible mean of 16 6 or moderate mean of 24 1 geomorphic impacts measurement errors associated with indirect peak discharge estimates are particularly high for streams with higher gradient e g wohl 1998 lumbroso and gaume 2012 indeed small drainage area coupled with steep channel gradient may control the observational uncertainty through the increasing role of erosional processes which makes indirect flood peak reconstruction from hwms more uncertain the uncertainties in the evaluations of the channel roughness parameter still remain a quagmire in indirect peak flood estimates this is because the estimation of the manning s n for extreme floods comes with a high degree of subjectivity and uncertainty due to the lack of exact methods for evaluating all the components that are required for determining the parameter lumbroso and gaume 2012 lumbroso and gaume 2012 reported high degree of uncertainty 25 for reaches with gradient higher than 1 wohl 1998 showed that uncertainty of 25 in channel roughness translates to uncertainty of about 20 in flood peaks for channel reaches with gradients less than or equal to 1 percentage change in flood peaks associated with uncertainty in channel roughness evaluation has been found to relate inversely with channel bed slope and to width depth ratio and directly with roughness wohl 1998 our observational uncertainties increased with channel bed slope though the relationship is not significant fig 8b this is largely due to the introduction of the scour fill term which magnifies the uncertainties the uncertainties from the glue application of the flash flood response model represent parametric and model structural uncertainties but do not include rainfall input uncertainty therefore these uncertainties account only for the effect of transposing the behavioural parameters from the basin closed at the cedrino dam to the set of ipec basins parametric uncertainties come into play because of different basin characteristics and eventually affect the flood responses it is interesting to see that the modelled uncertainty tends to increase with basin size even though this increase is not statistically significant fig 8a this is contrary to the expectation that uncertainty bounds increase as the basin size decreases as reported for instance by merz et al 2009 van esse et al 2013 and poncelet et al 2017 the reduction of uncertainty is mainly driven by results from the ipec basins p03 p09 and p10 with areas less than 10 km2 which are located in regions with strong rainfall gradients if the rainfall input is affected by a residual negative bias in radar rainfall estimation due in these cases to errors in the radar correction in areas with strong rainfall gradients the parametric uncertainty bound will also be reduced more generally there is an implication here that the rainfall bias term operates in a multiplicative sense on the width of the model parameter uncertainty limits by either magnifying or reducing it according to the sign of the bias this also shows the importance of accounting for radar rainfall uncertainties in flash flood forensic hydrology rainfall uncertainty is a recognized major factor in these applications due to the errors affecting radar estimation under heavy precipitation and in orographic environment germann et al 2006 villarini and krajewski 2010 and to the lack of dense local rain gauge networks to validate and adjust radar estimates at small spatial scales peleg et al 2013 in general radar errors may have complex spatio temporal characteristics which may directly affect the simulated peak discharges bronstert and bárdossy 2003 berne and krajewski 2013 cecinati et al 2017 as well as their uncertainties liechti et al 2013 however most of the current approaches to quantify radar rainfall uncertainties such as germann et al 2009 rely on rain gauge data to characterize the mean and covariance matrix of residual errors in radar precipitation estimates transposing these techniques to flash flood events proves difficult due to sparseness of ground based observations for instance in this case study no rain gauge was found to sample the core of the high intensity convective bands fig 4 the results reported in fig 9a show an increase of the divergence between the central values of the two uncertainty distributions with decreasing basin size thus supporting the indications reported above about the effects of residual radar rainfall bias on flood response modelling the residual negative bias likely affecting the rainfall estimates for the basins less than 10 km2 translates into a bias in the central values of the model uncertainty distributions as well as into a reduced spread of the same distributions the introduction of the novel flash flood forensic consistency index to measure of the degree of overlap of the two uncertainty distributions observational and model advances over the study by amponsah et al 2016 by incorporating uncertainties associated with flash flood response models with those from indirect estimates this index may help in making decisions on accepting or rejecting peak flood estimates from surveys and from model simulations we have shown that the index increases significantly with increasing drainage area and decreasing channel bed slope in this way supporting the results obtained by merz et al 2009 this shows that a combination of small drainage area and steep channel bed slope makes peak flow quantification through forensic flash flood analysis more uncertain at certain scales and therefore calls for the development of more robust approaches for flash flood assessment in small sized rugged relief mountain basins further research in forensic flash flood analysis at small spatial scales should advance toward including the rainfall input uncertainty in the modelling framework it is likely that a formal introduction of the term related to the rainfall input uncertainty would have led to different results increasing the model uncertainty for instance however this would require a radar rainfall uncertainty assessment method that can operate with the typical scarce availability of data from rain gauges as it happens for flash flood analysis the main task would be to get a reliable estimation of rainfall uncertainty with high spatial and temporal resolution then rainfall uncertainty can be independently included in a modelling framework for example by generating multiple realizations with each model parameter set the observational framework can also benefit from the use of different ways to report observational uncertainty that remove some assumptions in our framework mccuen and knight 2006 for instance applied fuzzy set analysis to develop confidence interval for indirect peak discharge estimates the use of automatic techniques such as structure for motion to survey the channel morphology and structure e g smith et al 2014 andreadakis et al 2020 can help to better evaluate channel roughness and provide a quantitative measure of the scour fill term thus helping to limit these uncertainty sources finally the forensic concept would benefit from advancing the use of measures to assess the intersection between observational and modelling uncertainty distribution this will provide the modeler with a measure of the statistical confidence in order to reject a certain observation or a given model prediction 6 conclusions in this work we introduced a flash flood forensic consistency index to evaluate the degree of overlap between the observational and model uncertainty distributions and thus to assess the expected accuracy of flash flood peak estimates when a combination of post flood surveying and hydrological modelling is used we analyse how the observational and model uncertainty distributions and their degree of overlap quantified by means of the consistency index scale with basin area and channel bed slope the study is focused on the november 2013 flash flood in sardinia by means of post flood indirect peak discharge estimation in ungauged channels and flood response modelling driven by weather radar rainfall estimates the main findings of the study are summarised as follows the observational uncertainties are influenced by in decreasing order of importance the estimation the energy line gradient the intensity of geomorphic adjustment and the evaluation of the channel roughness parameter observational uncertainties do not show any significant relationship with basin scale or channel bed slope mainly because we have considered the scour fill geomorphic term which magnifies the relevant uncertainties the absolute relative biases between the central values of the two uncertainty distributions are shown to increase significantly with decreasing drainage area and increasing channel bed slope this is related to the effects of residual negative radar rainfall bias which mainly affects small basins in the specific case study as well as the increasing role of erosional processes in steep channels scale dependence is reported for the degree of overlap between observational and model uncertainty distributions with the consistency index significantly increasing with increasing basin area and decreasing channel reach slope this shows that a combination of small basin area 10 km2 and steep channel bed slope 1 5 makes peak flow quantification through forensic flash flood analysis more uncertain the framework presented in this study should be extended to other case studies and assess how the scale dependence of flash flood consistency arises in different hydroclimatic environments when we use different radar measurement techniques and the application of different hydrological models on one hand this may help to identify merits in the improved measurement and modelling techniques and on the other hand we can identify ways to place limits for the flash flood confidence index and then identify limits to forensic assessment of flash floods minimal area for instance assessing a model s performance in the presence of measurement noise with our suggested approach helps to decide whether more effort should be invested in improving the existing models and or extending the set with better performing models or whether first of all more accurate data are

3573,reliable precipitation estimates are a crucial component for hydrologic modeling and hydro climate applications however watersheds that extend across international boundaries or those that contain large bodies of water pose particular challenges to the acquisition of consistent and accurate precipitation estimates the north american great lakes basin is characterized by both of these features which has led to long standing challenges to water budget analysis and hydrologic prediction in order to provide optimal conditions for hydrologic model calibration retrospective analyses and real time forecasting this study comprehensively evaluates four gridded datasets over the great lakes basin including the analysis of record for calibration aorc canadian precipitation analysis capa

observations and a statistical water balance model in comparison with gauge observations from the global historical climatology network daily ghcn d gridded datasets generally agree with ground observations however the international border clearly delineates a decrease in gridded precipitation accuracy over the canadian portion of the basin analysis reveals that rank in gridded precipitation accuracy differs for overland and overlake regions and between colder and warmer months overall the aorc has the lowest variance compared to gauge observations and has greater performance over temporal and spatial scales while capa and aorc may better capture atmospheric dynamics between land and lake regions comparison with a statistical water balance model suggests that aorc and mpe provide the best estimates of monthly overlake precipitation keywords gridded precipitation datasets international basins overlake precipitation national water model l2swbm overlake to overland precipitation ratio 1 introduction precipitation is a vital component of the water cycle and is the variable most commonly associated with atmospheric circulation in weather and climate research accurate and reliable precipitation estimates are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of climate and of hydrological cycles as well as the proper management of water resources agriculture and disaster mitigation kidd et al 2012 sun et al 2018 numerous precipitation datasets are accessible at regional and global scales and each can be classified into one of the three categories gauge based datasets satellite estimates or reanalysis products sun et al 2018 tapiador et al 2012 gauge based datasets provide reliable precipitation estimates for specific locations and provide ground truth information to evaluate other precipitation products khandu et al 2016 salio et al 2015 the shortcomings of gauge based datasets are the poor spatial representation of precipitation patterns owing to poor spatial coverage of observation stations especially in sparsely populated and over large inland water bodies and many gauges have not operated continuously or concurrently cole and moore 2008 kidd et al 2017 satellite estimates address these limitations and can provide precipitation information at high spatial and temporal resolutions moreover precipitation information from different satellite sources visible infrared imagery passive microwave are often combined and blended with gauge based data to improve accuracy duan et al 2016 maggioni and massari 2018 the final category reanalysis products includes datasets generated from numerical models that combine satellite and ground observations in order to generate a synthesized precipitation estimate which is consistent with the observations tapiador et al 2012 reanalysis products can provide spatially and temporally homogenous data that amalgamates all of the available high quality observations however their reliability can vary substantially across different locations and time periods due to the quality and coverage of assimilated datasets sun et al 2018 as a result it is important to assess the accuracy of satellite and reanalysis datasets prior to any hydroclimatic applications evaluation of precipitation estimates is particularly important in hydrologic modeling henn et al 2018 as errors and biases in precipitation forcing can significantly impact model calibration and regionalization renard et al 2010 developing accurate precipitation estimates across watersheds containing large inland lakes is especially difficult because simulation of physical processes across these massive freshwater surfaces is a challenging component in regional climate models xiao et al 2016 and also because there is a lack of measurements over the lake holman et al 2012 moreover many continental scale precipitation datasets are susceptible to variations in monitoring infrastructure and data dissemination protocols when watershed political and jurisdictional boundaries do not align that may cause unreliable and discontinuous precipitation data over international basins gronewold et al 2018 in these regards the laurentian great lakes basin is a unique representation of the challenges facing precipitation data development i four of the five great lakes and sub basins are bisected by the international border

constitute the largest freshwater surface and second largest volume on the planet gronewold et al 2013 they contain nearly 20 of earth s fresh unfrozen surface water approximately 23 000 km3 and with their surrounding basin cover an area of about 766 000 km2 across the united states and canada hunter et al 2015 fig 1 the great lakes basin forms a chain connecting the east central interior of north america to the atlantic ocean from the interior to the outlet at the st lawrence river water flows from superior to huron and michigan southward to erie and finally northward to lake ontario which outflows to the atlantic ocean based on hydrological characteristics the great lakes basin can be divided into four different sub basins including superior michigan huron erie and ontario fig 1

by the noaa national weather service nws the aorc surface precipitation is a reanalysis dataset that covers southern canada the contiguous united states and northern mexico the domain includes all contributing areas for contiguous u s surface waters and is also referred to as the super conus region kitzmiller et al 2018 it covers the period from 1979 at a time interval of 1 h with a grid resolution of approximately 1 km the dataset was developed based on an approach similar to the north american land data assimilation system version 2 nldas2 xia et al 2012 using multiple peer reviewed and operational inputs to assimilate all weather information for forcing land surface snow and hydrologic models in order to decrease the uncertainty associated with national precipitation datasets

climate change canada eccc the grid has a resolution of approximately 10 km and the domain covers all of north america canada usa and mexico it uses gauge data radar reflectivity and the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes imagery to modify a trial field provided by the gem numerical weather prediction model using a statistical interpolation technique the daily product has been operational since april 2011 but a hindcast starting in 2002 is available from eccc 2 2 3 mpe the mpe kitzmiller et al 2013 is currently used in the nws to produce rainfall estimates that cover the 48 contiguous united states conus as well as portions of canada and mexico mpe uses radar precipitation estimates from nws and department of defense radars hourly rain gage data and satellite precipitation estimates and several other previously processed rainfall estimates such as the noaa national severe storms laboratory nssl multi radar multi sensor mrms data these inputs are then manually analyzed by nws to produce the daily best precipitation estimate on a 4 km grid on a 1 h time step 2 2 4 merged capa mpe this merged dataset denoted as mrg in figures relies on capa over canadian land mpe over land in the united states and an arithmetic average of capa and mpe over the lake surface gronewold et al 2018 outside of conus the capa data are applied at its native resolution within conus the mpe data is resampled from its original 4 km cell size to a 10 km cell size for cross boundary areas and the great lakes a 10 km buffer polygon was created on either side of the boundary of conus and was extended across the surface of the lakes from both input datasets point features intersecting this polygon are selected and appended into a single point feature class an inverse distance weighted interpolation with a power setting of 0 5 and 10 point variable search radius is used to create a new raster dataset with a 10 kilometer resolution finally the interpolated raster data is mosaicked with the appropriate parts of the capa and resampled mpe data the daily data is available from 2004 2 2 5 ghcn d fig 1 noaa s ghcn d data menne et al 2012 are used as the reference station observations ghcn d is comprised of daily climate records from numerous sources that have been integrated and subjected to a quality control qc process during each qc processing cycle the data are first passed through a format checking program to ensure the right format of the data integration procedures and then a comprehensive sequence of fully automated quality assurance qa procedures are applied to test the quality of daily data durre et al 2010 a dense network of rain gauge stations is recorded in the database a total of 3262 stations can be identified within and up to a range of 50 km outside the great lakes basin among which 1284 stations contain records after 2010 and we selected 632 stations that met our 90 temporal coverage threshold for the entire period of 2010 2019 the spatial distribution of these 632 stations are shown in fig 1 rain gauges are particularly sparse over the northern part of the superior and michigan huron sub basins where the population density is low moreover no station records can be found over the lakes themselves which requires innovative approaches for analyzing the performance of gridded precipitation products for overlake areas these characteristics highlight the need for reliable alternative precipitation datasets to enhance understanding of water related aspects of the whole basin which is one motivation of this current study 2 2 6 glm hmd the noaa great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl hydrometeorological database glm hmd hunter et al 2015 is used as the reference for evaluation of overlake and overland precipitation at the scale of each sub basin hereafter denoted as hmd in figures glm hmd daily data are available at the site https www glerl noaa gov ftp publications tech reports glerl 083 updatedfiles daily glm hmd uses ghcn d and applies a modified version of conventional thiessen weighting interpolation method croley and hartmann 1985 to calculate both daily overlake and overland precipitation estimates for each hydrologic sub basin 3 evaluation methods 3 1 comparisons with gauge observations as described in the above sections 632 ghcn d gauge observations fig 1 are used in this study to evaluate the aorc mpe capa and merged products since these gauge stations are highly irregularly distributed over the great lakes basin in order to avoid errors related to upscaling and interpolation methods hofstra et al 2008 we directly carry out the grid point comparisons of the gridded data and point observations for each data product we extracted precipitation from the grid cells that have the centroid closest to the rain gauge geographical coordinates together with gauge based records these time series form the product gauge data pairs for evaluation we analyzed biases errors and correlations of each data product relative to gauge based precipitation from 2010 to 2019 three experiment settings have been used i overall performance at the daily resolution across all stations ii performance across different months of the year across all stations and iii performance over the u s and canadian portions of the basin over both daily and monthly resolutions in addition to the evaluation of gridded precipitation against gauge observations over the entire period from 2010 to 2019 we also investigated the performance of different products for representing precipitation extremes to define daily precipitation extremes we used the percentile approach diffenbaugh et al 2005 in particular we defined rain days as days in which the observed daily precipitation was 1 mm the p95 index value was then defined at each rain gauge station as the 95th percentile of all the observed precipitation values for the rain days in each year from 2010 to 2019 comparisons between gridded products and gauge observations were performed at each station for days in which the observed daily precipitation was greater than or equal to the corresponding p95 index value three commonly used statistical metrics were applied to analyze these product gauge data pairs including the mean absolute error mae to describe the discrepancies the percent bias pbias showing the relative bias and the coefficient of determination r2 to represent the degree of collinearity mae pbias and r2 are defined as follows 1 mae 1 n i 1 n p i g i 2 pbias 100 i 1 n p i g i i 1 n g i 3 r 2 i 1 n p i p g i g i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n g i g 2 where n refers to the number of product gauge data pairs p i and g i represent the daily rainfall values of product and gauge respectively p and g are the mean value of product and gauge precipitation respectively 3 2 comparing overland and overlake precipitation at sub basin scale as shown in table 1 lake surface area represents an important portion of the great lakes basin we separately compute the daily mean of overland and overlake precipitation across each of the four hydrologic sub basins by taking the averaged value of all grid cells within the polygon of the corresponding lake surface this average is calculated using the command line tool github com isciences exactextract which handles grid cell size inconsistency and grid cell polygon intersection in a very precise manner the glm hmd dataset is used as the reference data inter comparisons of these datasets at sub basin scales can provide information for calibration and uncertainty analysis of hydrological models the same metrics of gauge based evaluation described in section 3 1 were then used to assess the performance of each gridded product over the land and lake portions of each hydrologic sub basin 3 3 overlake precipitation analysis based on water balance closure since very few direct measurements of overlake precipitation are available the accuracy of precipitation estimates over large lakes is not well understood holman et al 2012 xiao et al 2016 this limitation has created high uncertainty in water accounting for the laurentian great lakes region of which the water cycle is significantly influenced by a tug of war between evaporation and precipitation over the lake surface gronewold et al 2021 it is important to note that closing the water balance i e explaining changes in lake water levels by a conventional water balance equation that takes estimates of all components of the great lakes hydrological cycle as input has been one of the key responsibilities of hydrological practitioners in the laurentian great lakes region this task however is not straightforward due to the fact that estimates of each component of the water cycle including overlake precipitation evaporation lake storage inflow runoff etc are usually developed independently and do not take into account the water balance of the whole system previous studies showed that overlake precipitation derived from existing precipitation datasets may be associated with high uncertainty and thus are not able to reconcile the water balance over an extended time period when used together with estimates of other components such as runoff and evaporation gronewold et al 2016 to further investigate this uncertainty we apply the large lake statistical water balance model l2swbm do et al 2020 gronewold et al 2020 to analyze the fidelity of different overlake precipitation estimates in the context of closing the water balance the l2swbm takes a probabilistic approach and assumes that each data product is associated with an uncertainty the l2swbm then assimilates multiple data sources together with their uncertainties into a bayesian marko chain monte carlo routine to infer feasible ranges of the major components e g lake storage overlake evaporation inflow runoffs overlake precipitation etc of the water balance for each of the great lakes to ensure the new estimates can reconcile the water balance over multiple periods l2swbm uses a conventional water balance equation to constrain the posterior inference the 95 credible interval of the inferred estimates for any component of the water cycle including overlake precipitation therefore can be seen as the most credible range of that component in the context of closing the water balance fore details see do et al 2020 gronewold et al 2020 for this study we run the l2swbm for all of the great lakes from 2010 to 2019 while historical data from 1950 to 2009 were used to derive the prior beliefs of the possible ranges in addition to the four datasets being evaluated glm hmd precipitation was also assimilated in our simulations for the other components of the water balance i e lake levels overlake evaporation runoff and connecting channel flows we used a database that was synthesized by the coordinating committee do et al 2020 the reliability of different gridded datasets aorc mpe capa merged can be assessed by comparing their overlake precipitation with the l2swbm posterior inference of precipitation for each lake 4 results 4 1 comparison of precipitation products with rain gauge observations 4 1 1 evaluation at daily time steps and extreme precipitation events across all 632 rain gauges over the entire great lakes basin boxplots of mae pbias and r2 reveal discrepancies between the four gridded precipitation products and the observed precipitation for the period 2010 2019 the range of median values for these metrics across different datasets are mae around 2 mm day pbias in the range of 5 and r2 between 0 6 and 0 8 compared to existing studies duan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 these results indicate a reasonable agreement between all evaluated products and the ghcn d gauge observations however differences can be found between precipitation products as well for instance capa slightly underestimates the ghcn d data while the other datasets overestimate fig 2 b furthermore although the aorc dataset seems to have the poorest performance according to these median values its performance is less dispersed across different rain gauge stations i e aorc has a smaller interquartile range suggesting a better consistency across spatial scales for the entire basin according to fig 3 extreme precipitation events are more difficult to estimate than light medium conditions for all the gridded products compared to fig 2 the median values for mae approximately increase from 2 to 10 mm day while pbias descreased from 0 to 25 and r2 decreased from 0 7 to 0 5 it should also be noted that all of the gridded products underestimate extreme precipitation across the region fig 3b whereas mpe performs better than aorc and capa for representing heavy rains this result suggests that satellite algorithms mpe could better capture extreme events than model based products aorc capa in great lakes region 4 1 2 spatial variation and transboundary impacts spatial variation of the performance of different gridded products is illustrated by maps of statistical metrics for the entire set of selected rain gauge stations over the period of evaluation 2010 2019 fig 4 s1 s2 among these 632 stations 529 stations are located in u s and 103 stations are situated in canada using this division across the international boundary mae pbias and r2 are calculated separately for stations located in the u s and canada fig 5 in general metrics reveal the datasets perform better in the u s portion of the basin with lower mae and r2 relative to evaluation at canadian stations similar to what was noted above capa tends to underestimate on both sides of the border whereas the other products tend to overestimate precipitation on the u s side and underestimate on the canadian side figs 4 and 5 b however these differences may derive from different protocols for generating and adjusting ghcn d data for canadian stations rather than an indication of poor skill of the various products this issue is further discussed in section 5 the boxplots of mae fig 5a and r2 fig 5c confirm the consistency of the aorc with r2 values from 0 6 to 0 8 for u s stations and from 0 4 to 0 6 for canadian stations again the other datasets have larger interquartile ranges varying from 0 4 to 0 8 for u s stations and from 0 2 to 0 4 for canadian stations however the relative higher mae and lower r2 for the aorc reported in fig 2a c is driven by higher errors on the u s side as compared to the other products whereas it actually outperforms the others on the canadian side in terms of pbias fig 5b indicates that capa and merged datasets have the best performance with no considerable difference found between u s and canadian gauges yet considering the mae values for capa and merged datasets this suggests that large positive and negative biases exist for specific canadian rain gauge stations 4 1 3 seasonal and monthly variation in order to evaluate seasonal variations within gridded datasets we first compare the accumulated monthly precipitation of each data product to the values aggregated from ghcn d data as shown in fig 6 all gridded datasets generally exhibit a seasonal pattern similar to that observed in the ghcn d specifically a lower magnitude of precipitation is observed from november to march relative to the april october period june is the wettest month of the year regardless which dataset being considered while other summer months july to september have a generally lower precipitation amount relative to other wet months i e april may and october to explore the seasonal variation of the performance of each gridded product we also analyze mae and pbias relative to the ghcn d for each month separately fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the first and third quartiles of mae across different datasets and gauge stations are approximately ranged from 1 to 2 mm day for dry months nov mar and 1 to 4 mm day for wet months apr oct according to the results of pbias fig 7b all of the analyzed products tend to get larger positive bias in cold months nov mar with higher variations among stations conversely all products are more likely to have negative bias in warmer months apr oct with lower spatial variations among these products capa reveals the most significant seasonal variation capa largely overestimates the ghcn d data during nov mar the first and third quartiles of pbias during these months can be up to 10 and 50 respectively while capa significantly underestimates in summer jun aug the first and third quartiles of pbias are approximately at 0 and 20 respectively july is the month that capa records the largest negative bias compared to ghcn d furthermore the seasonal variation of aorc is less significant than other gridded products with the median values of pbias varied from 0 to 10 over different months implying a better consistency at temporal scales 4 2 comparison of averaged overland overlake precipitation at sub basin scales to explore differences in product performance for overland and overlake regions we compare annual monthly and daily accumulated precipitation for each sub basin annual accumulated precipitation for overland and overlake areas of michigan huron are described in fig 8 as an example results for other sub basins are presented in fig s3 in general an increasing trend of annual precipitation from 2010 to 2019 is observed for all five precipitation datasets this increasing trend is more pronounced in the mpe product resulting in the highest values in 2018 and 2019 conversely the aorc contains the least rise in precipitation overland and capa the least amount of rise overlake for the michigan huron sub basin fig 8 though trends are similar across other sub basins fig s3 in general the interannual change in precipitation is consistent across products with the exception of the aorc which has divergent years in michigan huron erie and ontario sub basins overall the annual dynamic patterns of different datasets are similar for overland and overlake precipitation suggesting that there is no substantial difference between overland and overlake precipitation estimates for all the evaluated products on an annual basis due to lake atmospheric feedbacks overlake precipitation across each of the great lakes is generally higher in cold months relative to the that of warm months holman et al 2012 for testing the suitability of different datasets for this assumption averaged monthly accumulated overlake to overland precipitation ratio r p is compared in fig 9 the michigan huron sub basin is presented as an example and results from the other sub basins are shown in fig s4a sc comparisons of r p values from different datasets indicate that capa reflect seasonal dynamics that are not only stronger than any other gridded datasets but that are also much closer to the gauge based estimations and what we might expect from a large lake dominated system holman et al 2012 more specifically we find that the r p values for michigan huron sub basin from capa and glm hmd range from a maximum of 1 3 in january to a minimum of 0 9 in july and are less than 1 0 from april to october whereas the difference between winter and summer r p values from mpe aorc and merged datasets are less than 0 2 and the seasonal dynamics cannot be clearly observed especially for mpe and aorc products table 3 shows the degree of agreement of daily precipitation between gridded products and glm hmd at overland and overlake portions of each sub basin from the mae and r2 values aorc fits better with glm hmd for most overlake and overland areas of different sub basins this finding is consistent to the previous findings section 4 1 because fewer canadian rain gauge stations are available canadian stations tend to carry much more weight in the interpolation procedures used by the glm hmd data at sub basin scale moreover as aorc agrees better with canadian observations as presented in fig 5 a better performance is observed at the sub basin scale in addition the mae values show that better agreements between gridded products and glm hmd can be found for superior and michigan huron than erie and ontario nevertheless in spite of the modest mae values 1 2 mm day the pbias values reveal considerable bias between products and glm hmd up to 70 particularly for the overland areas these results suggest that systematic positive bias may exist between gridded products and glm hmd 4 3 assessing the reliability of overlake precipitation with l2swbm in order to test the reliability of different overlake precipitation data to reconcile lake water balance dynamics over long time periods we then compared overlake precipitation estimates of different products with the posterior distributions of l2swbm fig 10 as explained in the methodology section 3 3 the 95 credible interval of overlake precipitation inferred through the l2swbm can be considered the most faithful estimate of the true overlake precipitation in the context of closing the water balance to explicitly demonstrate the accuracy of each data product in this respect the percentage of monthly precipitation records falling within the 95 credible intervals of l2swbm outputs are illustrated in fig 10 as well the results clearly indicate that across all lakes aorc and mpe are the most reliable overlake precipitation datasets for reconciling lake water balance with up to 80 of monthly precipitation records falling within the 95 credible intervals of l2swbm posterior distributions while aorc is slightly better for lake superior and michigan huron and mpe is lightly better for lake erie and ontario overall the performance for lake ontario is inferior to other lakes as less than of 60 of all monthly precipitation records is within the 95 credible intervals although glm hmd is used as the input for l2swbm for both prior and analysis periods aorc and mpe fit better with the l2swbm outputs suggesting closer estimates to the actual overlake precipitation whereas no significant enhancement can be observed with capa and merged meaning these datasets are not better than gauge based overlake precipitation estimates according to the timeseries plots we can find that mpe is below the 95 credible intervals for 2010 2012 particularly for lake superior and michigan huron and aorc is above the 95 credible intervals for 2012 2013 more obviously for lake michigan huron and erie these findings are in accordance with our previous results shown in fig 8 5 summary and discussion accurate precipitation estimates over international basins and large bodies of water can be a challenge to weather and hydrologic forecasting the north american great lakes basin combines these issues and poses a unique challenge for hydrologic science in this study we evaluate four leading gridded precipitation datasets which are used by the coordinating committee for operational applications and management of the great lakes basin for the period 2010 2019 the aorc mpe capa and merged mpe capa products are compared with 632 gauged observations ghcn d analyzed for overland and overlake sub basins and evaluated against a bayesian statistical analysis framework l2swbm used for water budget accounting comparisons with gauge observations indicate a generally good agreement between all evaluated products and the ghcn d dataset however a large difference is found between u s and canadian precipitation accuracy in addition based on comparisons at sub basin scales and the analysis with l2swbm model the ability of different gridded precipitation products to capture overlake precipitation and the effects of large lakes on overlying atmospheric stability varies dramatically between products in all these results reveal the discrepancies between precipitation options for international basins and those containing large bodies of water and provide insight into potential downstream impacts to hydrologic model development and prediction 5 1 poor agreement with ghcn d data of canadian stations from figs 6 and 7 a sudden change of performance of gridded datasets can be observed between u s and canadian regions of the great lakes basin in contrast to the relatively higher performance at u s stations gridded datasets poorly agreed with precipitation observations at canadian stations this phenomenon is due to the fact that ghcn d contains much less canadian stations than u s stations in great lakes region and moreover the data collection and adjustment protocols are unclear for some canadian ghcn d stations for example ghcn d collects precipitation data from dozens of separate noaa archived datasets in which these data were quality controlled at the time of archival and well documented however canadian ghcn d stations do not contain adjustments for biases resulting from historical changes in instrumentation and observing practices thus systematic bias for certain stations might be important in operational practices another example is the different approaches applied to calculate the daily snow water equivalent swe between u s and canadian ghcn d stations canadian stations use a constant conversion ratio 10 1 to calculate swe for all different stations whereas u s stations apply algorithms to calculate variable swe conversion ratio for stations under different environmental conditions location attitude wind solar radiation etc the constant swe conversion ratio across canada was found to potentially underestimate up to 15 of the total precipitation for most stations of southern canada wang et al 2017 leading to a remarkably low values of glm hmd derived from ghcn d precipitation at sub basin scales relative to other gridded products as shown in fig 8 using other adjusted canadian precipitation datasets could be an alternative of ghcn d for instance the adjusted and homogenized canadian climate data ahccd consists of homogenized adjusted daily rainfall snowfall and total precipitation for more than 460 locations in canada mekis and vincent 2011 the dataset is publicly available https crd data donnees rdc ec gc ca cdas products ec data ahccd daily and it is currently updated until december 2017 nevertheless our preliminary analysis of ahccd indicates that 89 of the 463 stations contain precipitation records until 2017 among which 7 stations are located in the great lakes region fig s9 a b moreover only 2 stations met our 90 temporal coverage threshold for the period of 2010 2017 these two ahccd stations can also be found in ghcn d database comparisons between ghcn d and ahccd at these two stations fig s9 c d table s1 indicate that there is no substantial difference between ghcn d and ahccd more adjusted precipitation datasets other than ghcn d could be considered for canadian gauge observations in future studies 5 2 resolution effects for aorc and mpe for the four gridded datasets in this study the spatial resolution of aorc 1 km and mpe 4 km is higher than that of capa and merged 10 km in order to evaluate the resolution effects of aorc and mpe we have aggregated the aorc and mpe grids into a common 10 km resolution and compared with the original datasets at the 632 selected rain gauge stations bias between aorc 1 km 10 km and mpe 4 km 10 km over the entire period from 2010 to 2019 fig 11 a and for heavy rain days fig 11b are presented below as shown in fig 11a the median values of pbias are approximately equal to zero for both aorc 1 km 10 km and mpe 4 km 10 km comparisons indicating that the upscaling of aorc and mpe may not affect the performance of these gridded products at rain gauge stations over 2010 2019 period on the contrary gridded products of finer resolution aorc 1 km and mpe 4 km estimate much higher precipitation for heavy rain days than that of 10 km resolution furthermore since fig 3b has shown that aorc 1 km and mpe 4 km already underestimate extreme precipitation across the region the performance of gridded datasets of coarse resolution would be even worse for representing heavy rains 5 3 spatial temporal variations related to precipitation data sources and algorithms according to fig 7b capa remarkably overestimate the precipitation amount in winter and underestimate in summer this result is mainly due to the bias from the gem model which is used in capa gem tend to overestimate the frequency of small precipitation events 2mm and generally underestimate the frequency of larger events 2mm lespinas et al 2015 notable positive bias can hence be observed in winter with overestimated frequency of small events while the negative bias values for large precipitation events are the strongest in summer from figs 2 3 and 7 it can be noticed that the aorc has the lowest variance compared to ground measurements and has greater performance over temporal and spatial scales this good performance may be related to the input datasets used in aorc the precipitation data of aorc is a combination of nldas2 prism and liv15 compared to nlsdas2 the introduction of prism and liv15 provides constraint of the long term precipitation information and led to improvements of the representation of space and time dependent features in the precipitation fields moreover early testing indicated that the liv15 better matched the ghcn than other datasets livneh et al 2015 in addition aorc has the highest spatial and temporal resolution 1 km 1 hour among the four gridded datasets which could also be a reason for the good agreement between aorc and ghcn datasets on the other hand although a general good agreement between mpe and ghcn datasets figs 3 and 7 the performance of mpe varied among different gauge stations since mpe uses a radar and multisensory rainfall estimation algorithm the performance of that algorithm depends on its ability to systematically and intelligently isolate and remove error sources at each stage of the processing because there are many error sources in a number of radar rainfall estimates this is a challenge that will continue to be a subject of research and development of satellite based precipitation products 5 4 precipitation estimates over large lakes according to historical measurements and studies holman et al 2012 realistic basin wide precipitation estimates could have higher relative overlake precipitation in cold months and lower overlake precipitation in warm months a common hypothesis for this phenomenon is that the relatively cool air over the lakes water temperature lower than air temperature resulting relatively lower near surface air temperature during warm season will inhibit the growth of convective storms resulting in less rain over the lakes conversely the relatively warm lake during the winter water temperature higher than air temperature resulting relatively higher near surface air temperature will initiate convective instability through the flux of heat and moisture into the cold air advecting over the lakes however this phenomenon is rarely considered by existing hydro meteorological studies at lake and sub basin scales for sub basins which feature large freshwater surfaces these processes may significantly impact the prediction of lake water budget and water balance at sub basin scales since one third of the great lakes basin water budget is derived from precipitation falling directly on the lake surface table 1 particularly for lake superior 39 and lake michigan huron 32 this study preliminarily addresses this issue by analyzing the overland overlake precipitation patterns of different products as illustrated in fig 9 fig s4 s5 and s6 the overland overlake seasonal variation is more significant for lake superior and michigan huron than lake erie and ontario this order follows the rank of lake surface areas of sub basin indicating that stronger seasonal variations can be observed for sub basins with larger lake surface proportions on the other hand it can be noted that capa and aorc reflect stronger seasonal dynamics than mpe particularly for lake superior and michigan huron since no rain gauge measurement is available over the water surfaces there is no ground truth for calibrating satellite images on these overlake areas products only derived from rain gauge observations and satellite data might not well capture these overland overlake seasonal variations results in section 4 2 reaffirm this assumption that capa and aorc which are reanalysis products relying on meteorological models can better represent the seasonal variations of the ratio of overland to overlake precipitation whereas these variations are less represented by mpe and glm hmd which are satellite gauge blended and gauge based datasets on the other hand results from analysis with l2swbm suggest that aorc and mpe could have closer estimates to the realistic overlake precipitation based on a long term water balance aspect that underscores aorc for both correctly estimating overlake precipitation and properly representing differences between overland and overlake precipitation 5 5 applications of precipitation products for hydrological modeling of the great lakes basin for the four evaluated gridded datasets capa and mpe are available for nowcast and hindcast simulations while aorc and merged can be only used for hindcast simulations for nowcasting applications according to results shown in table 3 mpe is better than capa for sub basins of lake superior lake michigan huron and lake ontario while capa performs better for the sub basin of lake erie as for hindcasting applications since the performance of aorc is less dispersed at spatial and temporal scales fig 2 fig 7 and aorc fits better with glm hmd for most sub basins table 3 aorc could be the appropriate choice of climate forcing for hydrological modeling for the entire great lakes watershed whereas for some specific sub basins i e overland areas of michigan huron other products i e mpe might be preferred in addition it is informative to notice that in table 3 overland and overlake consistently favors aorc for mae under 2 mm day and r2 above 0 6 however important pbias values can be noted 20 70 this result implies that consistent bias may exist with aorc dataset and should be considered for model calibration and uncertainty analysis on the other hand hydrological processes across overland areas and in the lake are often simulated by different models land surface hydrological models commonly use simple routing schemes for computing in lake processes i e nwm lahmers et al 2019 swat arnold et al 1998 while lake models usually do not include land surface processes i e fvcom chen et al 2003 delft3d deltares 2016 therefore when performing land surface modeling the correctness of precipitation products on overland areas is important where gridded products can be evaluated by comparing with the ground observations on the contrary for lake water modeling appropriate estimates of overlake precipitation are crucial considering seasonal variations of the ratio of overland to overlake precipitation and using l2swbm to infer reliable overlake precipitation range can help modeler to select proper products for overlake precipitation for large lake basins like the great lakes a reasonable approach would be to couple land surface hydrology models e g wrf hydro with sophisticated lake hydrodynamic models i e fvcom in which each approach could

3573,reliable precipitation estimates are a crucial component for hydrologic modeling and hydro climate applications however watersheds that extend across international boundaries or those that contain large bodies of water pose particular challenges to the acquisition of consistent and accurate precipitation estimates the north american great lakes basin is characterized by both of these features which has led to long standing challenges to water budget analysis and hydrologic prediction in order to provide optimal conditions for hydrologic model calibration retrospective analyses and real time forecasting this study comprehensively evaluates four gridded datasets over the great lakes basin including the analysis of record for calibration aorc canadian precipitation analysis capa multi sensor precipitation estimate mpe and a merged capa mpe these products are analyzed at multiple spatial overland overlake sub basin country and temporal daily monthly annual scales using station observations and a statistical water balance model in comparison with gauge observations from the global historical climatology network daily ghcn d gridded datasets generally agree with ground observations however the international border clearly delineates a decrease in gridded precipitation accuracy over the canadian portion of the basin analysis reveals that rank in gridded precipitation accuracy differs for overland and overlake regions and between colder and warmer months overall the aorc has the lowest variance compared to gauge observations and has greater performance over temporal and spatial scales while capa and aorc may better capture atmospheric dynamics between land and lake regions comparison with a statistical water balance model suggests that aorc and mpe provide the best estimates of monthly overlake precipitation keywords gridded precipitation datasets international basins overlake precipitation national water model l2swbm overlake to overland precipitation ratio 1 introduction precipitation is a vital component of the water cycle and is the variable most commonly associated with atmospheric circulation in weather and climate research accurate and reliable precipitation estimates are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of climate and of hydrological cycles as well as the proper management of water resources agriculture and disaster mitigation kidd et al 2012 sun et al 2018 numerous precipitation datasets are accessible at regional and global scales and each can be classified into one of the three categories gauge based datasets satellite estimates or reanalysis products sun et al 2018 tapiador et al 2012 gauge based datasets provide reliable precipitation estimates for specific locations and provide ground truth information to evaluate other precipitation products khandu et al 2016 salio et al 2015 the shortcomings of gauge based datasets are the poor spatial representation of precipitation patterns owing to poor spatial coverage of observation stations especially in sparsely populated and over large inland water bodies and many gauges have not operated continuously or concurrently cole and moore 2008 kidd et al 2017 satellite estimates address these limitations and can provide precipitation information at high spatial and temporal resolutions moreover precipitation information from different satellite sources visible infrared imagery passive microwave are often combined and blended with gauge based data to improve accuracy duan et al 2016 maggioni and massari 2018 the final category reanalysis products includes datasets generated from numerical models that combine satellite and ground observations in order to generate a synthesized precipitation estimate which is consistent with the observations tapiador et al 2012 reanalysis products can provide spatially and temporally homogenous data that amalgamates all of the available high quality observations however their reliability can vary substantially across different locations and time periods due to the quality and coverage of assimilated datasets sun et al 2018 as a result it is important to assess the accuracy of satellite and reanalysis datasets prior to any hydroclimatic applications evaluation of precipitation estimates is particularly important in hydrologic modeling henn et al 2018 as errors and biases in precipitation forcing can significantly impact model calibration and regionalization renard et al 2010 developing accurate precipitation estimates across watersheds containing large inland lakes is especially difficult because simulation of physical processes across these massive freshwater surfaces is a challenging component in regional climate models xiao et al 2016 and also because there is a lack of measurements over the lake holman et al 2012 moreover many continental scale precipitation datasets are susceptible to variations in monitoring infrastructure and data dissemination protocols when watershed political and jurisdictional boundaries do not align that may cause unreliable and discontinuous precipitation data over international basins gronewold et al 2018 in these regards the laurentian great lakes basin is a unique representation of the challenges facing precipitation data development i four of the five great lakes and sub basins are bisected by the international border between the united states and canada ii the vast surface waters represent 32 of the total basin area equaling 245 310 km2 hunter et al 2015 no other basin in north america poses the same combination of precipitation data development challenges established in 1953 the coordinating committee for great lakes basic hydrologic and hydraulic data coordinating committee is a bi national committee of experts from federal agencies of the united states and canada charged with the responsibility for agreeing upon the basic hydraulic hydrologic and vertical control data that is required to manage the great lakes and st lawrence river recent studies of the coordinating committee highlighted four gridded datasets for operational applications and water budget analysis for the great lakes region i canadian precipitation analysis capa fortin et al 2015 and ii multi sensor precipitation estimate mpe kitzmiller et al 2013 combine gauge and radar data to provide a best estimate of precipitation in near real time while capa also relies on the global environmental multiscale gem model côté et al 1998a côté et al 1998b gronewold et al 2018 indicated that these two datasets are the most promising sources of precipitation for long term application to the great lakes region in an effort to leverage the quality of capa and mpe the midwestern regional climate center mrcc recently developed iii a binational precipitation product that merges capa and mpe data over the great lakes basin referred to herein as merged gronewold et al 2018 in addition the iv analysis of record for calibration aorc has been used for the calibration of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national water model nwm version 2 1 across the united states alcantara et al 2018 and is under consideration for additional operational applications over the great lakes basins aorc is a reanalysis high resolution dataset of near surface weather based on gauge radar and existing precipitation datasets including stage iv and nldas2 kitzmiller et al 2018 in order to ensure robust operational products over the great lakes basin this study comprehensively evaluate these four underlined gridded datasets aorc mpe capa merged mpe capa at multiple spatial overland overlake sub basin country and temporal daily monthly annual scales the analysis aims to bring new insights into the performance of various precipitation products over large water bodies and across international boundaries and contributes to the guidance of selecting precipitation products for operational development and for water practitioners across regions in this paper we first describe the study area and the precipitation datasets that we compare over the great lakes basin section 2 we then present the evaluation methods and statistical metrics used to assess the performance of different precipitation products section 3 each precipitation product was then compared with gauge based estimates overland average and overlake averages across each of the sub basins section 4 furthermore we discuss issues related to data consistency and accuracy and make suggestions about data improvement and operational applications section 5 finally conclusions and perspectives are summarized in section 6 2 study area and precipitation datasets 2 1 study area the north american laurentian great lakes collectively constitute the largest freshwater surface and second largest volume on the planet gronewold et al 2013 they contain nearly 20 of earth s fresh unfrozen surface water approximately 23 000 km3 and with their surrounding basin cover an area of about 766 000 km2 across the united states and canada hunter et al 2015 fig 1 the great lakes basin forms a chain connecting the east central interior of north america to the atlantic ocean from the interior to the outlet at the st lawrence river water flows from superior to huron and michigan southward to erie and finally northward to lake ontario which outflows to the atlantic ocean based on hydrological characteristics the great lakes basin can be divided into four different sub basins including superior michigan huron erie and ontario fig 1 moreover the sub basins are divided among the jurisdictions of the canadian province of ontario and eight u s states michigan wisconsin minnesota illinois indiana ohio pennsylvania and new york 2 2 datasets this section briefly describes the four high resolution gridded precipitation products evaluated in this study aorc mpe capa merged and the reference data which includes rain gauge observations from the global historical climatology network daily database hereafter referred to as ghcn d and sub basin scale estimates of overlake and overland precipitation based on the gauge data glm hmd the analysis is performed from 2010 to 2019 to evaluate data performance for a recent period table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the different precipitation datasets 2 2 1 aorc developed by the noaa national weather service nws the aorc surface precipitation is a reanalysis dataset that covers southern canada the contiguous united states and northern mexico the domain includes all contributing areas for contiguous u s surface waters and is also referred to as the super conus region kitzmiller et al 2018 it covers the period from 1979 at a time interval of 1 h with a grid resolution of approximately 1 km the dataset was developed based on an approach similar to the north american land data assimilation system version 2 nldas2 xia et al 2012 using multiple peer reviewed and operational inputs to assimilate all weather information for forcing land surface snow and hydrologic models in order to decrease the uncertainty associated with national precipitation datasets the aorc was officially used as the forcing data for nwm version 2 1 model calibration lahmers et al 2019 2 2 2 capa the capa is a real time gridded precipitation product provided by environment and climate change canada eccc the grid has a resolution of approximately 10 km and the domain covers all of north america canada usa and mexico it uses gauge data radar reflectivity and the geostationary operational environmental satellite goes imagery to modify a trial field provided by the gem numerical weather prediction model using a statistical interpolation technique the daily product has been operational since april 2011 but a hindcast starting in 2002 is available from eccc 2 2 3 mpe the mpe kitzmiller et al 2013 is currently used in the nws to produce rainfall estimates that cover the 48 contiguous united states conus as well as portions of canada and mexico mpe uses radar precipitation estimates from nws and department of defense radars hourly rain gage data and satellite precipitation estimates and several other previously processed rainfall estimates such as the noaa national severe storms laboratory nssl multi radar multi sensor mrms data these inputs are then manually analyzed by nws to produce the daily best precipitation estimate on a 4 km grid on a 1 h time step 2 2 4 merged capa mpe this merged dataset denoted as mrg in figures relies on capa over canadian land mpe over land in the united states and an arithmetic average of capa and mpe over the lake surface gronewold et al 2018 outside of conus the capa data are applied at its native resolution within conus the mpe data is resampled from its original 4 km cell size to a 10 km cell size for cross boundary areas and the great lakes a 10 km buffer polygon was created on either side of the boundary of conus and was extended across the surface of the lakes from both input datasets point features intersecting this polygon are selected and appended into a single point feature class an inverse distance weighted interpolation with a power setting of 0 5 and 10 point variable search radius is used to create a new raster dataset with a 10 kilometer resolution finally the interpolated raster data is mosaicked with the appropriate parts of the capa and resampled mpe data the daily data is available from 2004 2 2 5 ghcn d fig 1 noaa s ghcn d data menne et al 2012 are used as the reference station observations ghcn d is comprised of daily climate records from numerous sources that have been integrated and subjected to a quality control qc process during each qc processing cycle the data are first passed through a format checking program to ensure the right format of the data integration procedures and then a comprehensive sequence of fully automated quality assurance qa procedures are applied to test the quality of daily data durre et al 2010 a dense network of rain gauge stations is recorded in the database a total of 3262 stations can be identified within and up to a range of 50 km outside the great lakes basin among which 1284 stations contain records after 2010 and we selected 632 stations that met our 90 temporal coverage threshold for the entire period of 2010 2019 the spatial distribution of these 632 stations are shown in fig 1 rain gauges are particularly sparse over the northern part of the superior and michigan huron sub basins where the population density is low moreover no station records can be found over the lakes themselves which requires innovative approaches for analyzing the performance of gridded precipitation products for overlake areas these characteristics highlight the need for reliable alternative precipitation datasets to enhance understanding of water related aspects of the whole basin which is one motivation of this current study 2 2 6 glm hmd the noaa great lakes environmental research laboratory glerl hydrometeorological database glm hmd hunter et al 2015 is used as the reference for evaluation of overlake and overland precipitation at the scale of each sub basin hereafter denoted as hmd in figures glm hmd daily data are available at the site https www glerl noaa gov ftp publications tech reports glerl 083 updatedfiles daily glm hmd uses ghcn d and applies a modified version of conventional thiessen weighting interpolation method croley and hartmann 1985 to calculate both daily overlake and overland precipitation estimates for each hydrologic sub basin 3 evaluation methods 3 1 comparisons with gauge observations as described in the above sections 632 ghcn d gauge observations fig 1 are used in this study to evaluate the aorc mpe capa and merged products since these gauge stations are highly irregularly distributed over the great lakes basin in order to avoid errors related to upscaling and interpolation methods hofstra et al 2008 we directly carry out the grid point comparisons of the gridded data and point observations for each data product we extracted precipitation from the grid cells that have the centroid closest to the rain gauge geographical coordinates together with gauge based records these time series form the product gauge data pairs for evaluation we analyzed biases errors and correlations of each data product relative to gauge based precipitation from 2010 to 2019 three experiment settings have been used i overall performance at the daily resolution across all stations ii performance across different months of the year across all stations and iii performance over the u s and canadian portions of the basin over both daily and monthly resolutions in addition to the evaluation of gridded precipitation against gauge observations over the entire period from 2010 to 2019 we also investigated the performance of different products for representing precipitation extremes to define daily precipitation extremes we used the percentile approach diffenbaugh et al 2005 in particular we defined rain days as days in which the observed daily precipitation was 1 mm the p95 index value was then defined at each rain gauge station as the 95th percentile of all the observed precipitation values for the rain days in each year from 2010 to 2019 comparisons between gridded products and gauge observations were performed at each station for days in which the observed daily precipitation was greater than or equal to the corresponding p95 index value three commonly used statistical metrics were applied to analyze these product gauge data pairs including the mean absolute error mae to describe the discrepancies the percent bias pbias showing the relative bias and the coefficient of determination r2 to represent the degree of collinearity mae pbias and r2 are defined as follows 1 mae 1 n i 1 n p i g i 2 pbias 100 i 1 n p i g i i 1 n g i 3 r 2 i 1 n p i p g i g i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n g i g 2 where n refers to the number of product gauge data pairs p i and g i represent the daily rainfall values of product and gauge respectively p and g are the mean value of product and gauge precipitation respectively 3 2 comparing overland and overlake precipitation at sub basin scale as shown in table 1 lake surface area represents an important portion of the great lakes basin we separately compute the daily mean of overland and overlake precipitation across each of the four hydrologic sub basins by taking the averaged value of all grid cells within the polygon of the corresponding lake surface this average is calculated using the command line tool github com isciences exactextract which handles grid cell size inconsistency and grid cell polygon intersection in a very precise manner the glm hmd dataset is used as the reference data inter comparisons of these datasets at sub basin scales can provide information for calibration and uncertainty analysis of hydrological models the same metrics of gauge based evaluation described in section 3 1 were then used to assess the performance of each gridded product over the land and lake portions of each hydrologic sub basin 3 3 overlake precipitation analysis based on water balance closure since very few direct measurements of overlake precipitation are available the accuracy of precipitation estimates over large lakes is not well understood holman et al 2012 xiao et al 2016 this limitation has created high uncertainty in water accounting for the laurentian great lakes region of which the water cycle is significantly influenced by a tug of war between evaporation and precipitation over the lake surface gronewold et al 2021 it is important to note that closing the water balance i e explaining changes in lake water levels by a conventional water balance equation that takes estimates of all components of the great lakes hydrological cycle as input has been one of the key responsibilities of hydrological practitioners in the laurentian great lakes region this task however is not straightforward due to the fact that estimates of each component of the water cycle including overlake precipitation evaporation lake storage inflow runoff etc are usually developed independently and do not take into account the water balance of the whole system previous studies showed that overlake precipitation derived from existing precipitation datasets may be associated with high uncertainty and thus are not able to reconcile the water balance over an extended time period when used together with estimates of other components such as runoff and evaporation gronewold et al 2016 to further investigate this uncertainty we apply the large lake statistical water balance model l2swbm do et al 2020 gronewold et al 2020 to analyze the fidelity of different overlake precipitation estimates in the context of closing the water balance the l2swbm takes a probabilistic approach and assumes that each data product is associated with an uncertainty the l2swbm then assimilates multiple data sources together with their uncertainties into a bayesian marko chain monte carlo routine to infer feasible ranges of the major components e g lake storage overlake evaporation inflow runoffs overlake precipitation etc of the water balance for each of the great lakes to ensure the new estimates can reconcile the water balance over multiple periods l2swbm uses a conventional water balance equation to constrain the posterior inference the 95 credible interval of the inferred estimates for any component of the water cycle including overlake precipitation therefore can be seen as the most credible range of that component in the context of closing the water balance fore details see do et al 2020 gronewold et al 2020 for this study we run the l2swbm for all of the great lakes from 2010 to 2019 while historical data from 1950 to 2009 were used to derive the prior beliefs of the possible ranges in addition to the four datasets being evaluated glm hmd precipitation was also assimilated in our simulations for the other components of the water balance i e lake levels overlake evaporation runoff and connecting channel flows we used a database that was synthesized by the coordinating committee do et al 2020 the reliability of different gridded datasets aorc mpe capa merged can be assessed by comparing their overlake precipitation with the l2swbm posterior inference of precipitation for each lake 4 results 4 1 comparison of precipitation products with rain gauge observations 4 1 1 evaluation at daily time steps and extreme precipitation events across all 632 rain gauges over the entire great lakes basin boxplots of mae pbias and r2 reveal discrepancies between the four gridded precipitation products and the observed precipitation for the period 2010 2019 the range of median values for these metrics across different datasets are mae around 2 mm day pbias in the range of 5 and r2 between 0 6 and 0 8 compared to existing studies duan et al 2016 sun et al 2018 these results indicate a reasonable agreement between all evaluated products and the ghcn d gauge observations however differences can be found between precipitation products as well for instance capa slightly underestimates the ghcn d data while the other datasets overestimate fig 2 b furthermore although the aorc dataset seems to have the poorest performance according to these median values its performance is less dispersed across different rain gauge stations i e aorc has a smaller interquartile range suggesting a better consistency across spatial scales for the entire basin according to fig 3 extreme precipitation events are more difficult to estimate than light medium conditions for all the gridded products compared to fig 2 the median values for mae approximately increase from 2 to 10 mm day while pbias descreased from 0 to 25 and r2 decreased from 0 7 to 0 5 it should also be noted that all of the gridded products underestimate extreme precipitation across the region fig 3b whereas mpe performs better than aorc and capa for representing heavy rains this result suggests that satellite algorithms mpe could better capture extreme events than model based products aorc capa in great lakes region 4 1 2 spatial variation and transboundary impacts spatial variation of the performance of different gridded products is illustrated by maps of statistical metrics for the entire set of selected rain gauge stations over the period of evaluation 2010 2019 fig 4 s1 s2 among these 632 stations 529 stations are located in u s and 103 stations are situated in canada using this division across the international boundary mae pbias and r2 are calculated separately for stations located in the u s and canada fig 5 in general metrics reveal the datasets perform better in the u s portion of the basin with lower mae and r2 relative to evaluation at canadian stations similar to what was noted above capa tends to underestimate on both sides of the border whereas the other products tend to overestimate precipitation on the u s side and underestimate on the canadian side figs 4 and 5 b however these differences may derive from different protocols for generating and adjusting ghcn d data for canadian stations rather than an indication of poor skill of the various products this issue is further discussed in section 5 the boxplots of mae fig 5a and r2 fig 5c confirm the consistency of the aorc with r2 values from 0 6 to 0 8 for u s stations and from 0 4 to 0 6 for canadian stations again the other datasets have larger interquartile ranges varying from 0 4 to 0 8 for u s stations and from 0 2 to 0 4 for canadian stations however the relative higher mae and lower r2 for the aorc reported in fig 2a c is driven by higher errors on the u s side as compared to the other products whereas it actually outperforms the others on the canadian side in terms of pbias fig 5b indicates that capa and merged datasets have the best performance with no considerable difference found between u s and canadian gauges yet considering the mae values for capa and merged datasets this suggests that large positive and negative biases exist for specific canadian rain gauge stations 4 1 3 seasonal and monthly variation in order to evaluate seasonal variations within gridded datasets we first compare the accumulated monthly precipitation of each data product to the values aggregated from ghcn d data as shown in fig 6 all gridded datasets generally exhibit a seasonal pattern similar to that observed in the ghcn d specifically a lower magnitude of precipitation is observed from november to march relative to the april october period june is the wettest month of the year regardless which dataset being considered while other summer months july to september have a generally lower precipitation amount relative to other wet months i e april may and october to explore the seasonal variation of the performance of each gridded product we also analyze mae and pbias relative to the ghcn d for each month separately fig 7 as shown in fig 7a the first and third quartiles of mae across different datasets and gauge stations are approximately ranged from 1 to 2 mm day for dry months nov mar and 1 to 4 mm day for wet months apr oct according to the results of pbias fig 7b all of the analyzed products tend to get larger positive bias in cold months nov mar with higher variations among stations conversely all products are more likely to have negative bias in warmer months apr oct with lower spatial variations among these products capa reveals the most significant seasonal variation capa largely overestimates the ghcn d data during nov mar the first and third quartiles of pbias during these months can be up to 10 and 50 respectively while capa significantly underestimates in summer jun aug the first and third quartiles of pbias are approximately at 0 and 20 respectively july is the month that capa records the largest negative bias compared to ghcn d furthermore the seasonal variation of aorc is less significant than other gridded products with the median values of pbias varied from 0 to 10 over different months implying a better consistency at temporal scales 4 2 comparison of averaged overland overlake precipitation at sub basin scales to explore differences in product performance for overland and overlake regions we compare annual monthly and daily accumulated precipitation for each sub basin annual accumulated precipitation for overland and overlake areas of michigan huron are described in fig 8 as an example results for other sub basins are presented in fig s3 in general an increasing trend of annual precipitation from 2010 to 2019 is observed for all five precipitation datasets this increasing trend is more pronounced in the mpe product resulting in the highest values in 2018 and 2019 conversely the aorc contains the least rise in precipitation overland and capa the least amount of rise overlake for the michigan huron sub basin fig 8 though trends are similar across other sub basins fig s3 in general the interannual change in precipitation is consistent across products with the exception of the aorc which has divergent years in michigan huron erie and ontario sub basins overall the annual dynamic patterns of different datasets are similar for overland and overlake precipitation suggesting that there is no substantial difference between overland and overlake precipitation estimates for all the evaluated products on an annual basis due to lake atmospheric feedbacks overlake precipitation across each of the great lakes is generally higher in cold months relative to the that of warm months holman et al 2012 for testing the suitability of different datasets for this assumption averaged monthly accumulated overlake to overland precipitation ratio r p is compared in fig 9 the michigan huron sub basin is presented as an example and results from the other sub basins are shown in fig s4a sc comparisons of r p values from different datasets indicate that capa reflect seasonal dynamics that are not only stronger than any other gridded datasets but that are also much closer to the gauge based estimations and what we might expect from a large lake dominated system holman et al 2012 more specifically we find that the r p values for michigan huron sub basin from capa and glm hmd range from a maximum of 1 3 in january to a minimum of 0 9 in july and are less than 1 0 from april to october whereas the difference between winter and summer r p values from mpe aorc and merged datasets are less than 0 2 and the seasonal dynamics cannot be clearly observed especially for mpe and aorc products table 3 shows the degree of agreement of daily precipitation between gridded products and glm hmd at overland and overlake portions of each sub basin from the mae and r2 values aorc fits better with glm hmd for most overlake and overland areas of different sub basins this finding is consistent to the previous findings section 4 1 because fewer canadian rain gauge stations are available canadian stations tend to carry much more weight in the interpolation procedures used by the glm hmd data at sub basin scale moreover as aorc agrees better with canadian observations as presented in fig 5 a better performance is observed at the sub basin scale in addition the mae values show that better agreements between gridded products and glm hmd can be found for superior and michigan huron than erie and ontario nevertheless in spite of the modest mae values 1 2 mm day the pbias values reveal considerable bias between products and glm hmd up to 70 particularly for the overland areas these results suggest that systematic positive bias may exist between gridded products and glm hmd 4 3 assessing the reliability of overlake precipitation with l2swbm in order to test the reliability of different overlake precipitation data to reconcile lake water balance dynamics over long time periods we then compared overlake precipitation estimates of different products with the posterior distributions of l2swbm fig 10 as explained in the methodology section 3 3 the 95 credible interval of overlake precipitation inferred through the l2swbm can be considered the most faithful estimate of the true overlake precipitation in the context of closing the water balance to explicitly demonstrate the accuracy of each data product in this respect the percentage of monthly precipitation records falling within the 95 credible intervals of l2swbm outputs are illustrated in fig 10 as well the results clearly indicate that across all lakes aorc and mpe are the most reliable overlake precipitation datasets for reconciling lake water balance with up to 80 of monthly precipitation records falling within the 95 credible intervals of l2swbm posterior distributions while aorc is slightly better for lake superior and michigan huron and mpe is lightly better for lake erie and ontario overall the performance for lake ontario is inferior to other lakes as less than of 60 of all monthly precipitation records is within the 95 credible intervals although glm hmd is used as the input for l2swbm for both prior and analysis periods aorc and mpe fit better with the l2swbm outputs suggesting closer estimates to the actual overlake precipitation whereas no significant enhancement can be observed with capa and merged meaning these datasets are not better than gauge based overlake precipitation estimates according to the timeseries plots we can find that mpe is below the 95 credible intervals for 2010 2012 particularly for lake superior and michigan huron and aorc is above the 95 credible intervals for 2012 2013 more obviously for lake michigan huron and erie these findings are in accordance with our previous results shown in fig 8 5 summary and discussion accurate precipitation estimates over international basins and large bodies of water can be a challenge to weather and hydrologic forecasting the north american great lakes basin combines these issues and poses a unique challenge for hydrologic science in this study we evaluate four leading gridded precipitation datasets which are used by the coordinating committee for operational applications and management of the great lakes basin for the period 2010 2019 the aorc mpe capa and merged mpe capa products are compared with 632 gauged observations ghcn d analyzed for overland and overlake sub basins and evaluated against a bayesian statistical analysis framework l2swbm used for water budget accounting comparisons with gauge observations indicate a generally good agreement between all evaluated products and the ghcn d dataset however a large difference is found between u s and canadian precipitation accuracy in addition based on comparisons at sub basin scales and the analysis with l2swbm model the ability of different gridded precipitation products to capture overlake precipitation and the effects of large lakes on overlying atmospheric stability varies dramatically between products in all these results reveal the discrepancies between precipitation options for international basins and those containing large bodies of water and provide insight into potential downstream impacts to hydrologic model development and prediction 5 1 poor agreement with ghcn d data of canadian stations from figs 6 and 7 a sudden change of performance of gridded datasets can be observed between u s and canadian regions of the great lakes basin in contrast to the relatively higher performance at u s stations gridded datasets poorly agreed with precipitation observations at canadian stations this phenomenon is due to the fact that ghcn d contains much less canadian stations than u s stations in great lakes region and moreover the data collection and adjustment protocols are unclear for some canadian ghcn d stations for example ghcn d collects precipitation data from dozens of separate noaa archived datasets in which these data were quality controlled at the time of archival and well documented however canadian ghcn d stations do not contain adjustments for biases resulting from historical changes in instrumentation and observing practices thus systematic bias for certain stations might be important in operational practices another example is the different approaches applied to calculate the daily snow water equivalent swe between u s and canadian ghcn d stations canadian stations use a constant conversion ratio 10 1 to calculate swe for all different stations whereas u s stations apply algorithms to calculate variable swe conversion ratio for stations under different environmental conditions location attitude wind solar radiation etc the constant swe conversion ratio across canada was found to potentially underestimate up to 15 of the total precipitation for most stations of southern canada wang et al 2017 leading to a remarkably low values of glm hmd derived from ghcn d precipitation at sub basin scales relative to other gridded products as shown in fig 8 using other adjusted canadian precipitation datasets could be an alternative of ghcn d for instance the adjusted and homogenized canadian climate data ahccd consists of homogenized adjusted daily rainfall snowfall and total precipitation for more than 460 locations in canada mekis and vincent 2011 the dataset is publicly available https crd data donnees rdc ec gc ca cdas products ec data ahccd daily and it is currently updated until december 2017 nevertheless our preliminary analysis of ahccd indicates that 89 of the 463 stations contain precipitation records until 2017 among which 7 stations are located in the great lakes region fig s9 a b moreover only 2 stations met our 90 temporal coverage threshold for the period of 2010 2017 these two ahccd stations can also be found in ghcn d database comparisons between ghcn d and ahccd at these two stations fig s9 c d table s1 indicate that there is no substantial difference between ghcn d and ahccd more adjusted precipitation datasets other than ghcn d could be considered for canadian gauge observations in future studies 5 2 resolution effects for aorc and mpe for the four gridded datasets in this study the spatial resolution of aorc 1 km and mpe 4 km is higher than that of capa and merged 10 km in order to evaluate the resolution effects of aorc and mpe we have aggregated the aorc and mpe grids into a common 10 km resolution and compared with the original datasets at the 632 selected rain gauge stations bias between aorc 1 km 10 km and mpe 4 km 10 km over the entire period from 2010 to 2019 fig 11 a and for heavy rain days fig 11b are presented below as shown in fig 11a the median values of pbias are approximately equal to zero for both aorc 1 km 10 km and mpe 4 km 10 km comparisons indicating that the upscaling of aorc and mpe may not affect the performance of these gridded products at rain gauge stations over 2010 2019 period on the contrary gridded products of finer resolution aorc 1 km and mpe 4 km estimate much higher precipitation for heavy rain days than that of 10 km resolution furthermore since fig 3b has shown that aorc 1 km and mpe 4 km already underestimate extreme precipitation across the region the performance of gridded datasets of coarse resolution would be even worse for representing heavy rains 5 3 spatial temporal variations related to precipitation data sources and algorithms according to fig 7b capa remarkably overestimate the precipitation amount in winter and underestimate in summer this result is mainly due to the bias from the gem model which is used in capa gem tend to overestimate the frequency of small precipitation events 2mm and generally underestimate the frequency of larger events 2mm lespinas et al 2015 notable positive bias can hence be observed in winter with overestimated frequency of small events while the negative bias values for large precipitation events are the strongest in summer from figs 2 3 and 7 it can be noticed that the aorc has the lowest variance compared to ground measurements and has greater performance over temporal and spatial scales this good performance may be related to the input datasets used in aorc the precipitation data of aorc is a combination of nldas2 prism and liv15 compared to nlsdas2 the introduction of prism and liv15 provides constraint of the long term precipitation information and led to improvements of the representation of space and time dependent features in the precipitation fields moreover early testing indicated that the liv15 better matched the ghcn than other datasets livneh et al 2015 in addition aorc has the highest spatial and temporal resolution 1 km 1 hour among the four gridded datasets which could also be a reason for the good agreement between aorc and ghcn datasets on the other hand although a general good agreement between mpe and ghcn datasets figs 3 and 7 the performance of mpe varied among different gauge stations since mpe uses a radar and multisensory rainfall estimation algorithm the performance of that algorithm depends on its ability to systematically and intelligently isolate and remove error sources at each stage of the processing because there are many error sources in a number of radar rainfall estimates this is a challenge that will continue to be a subject of research and development of satellite based precipitation products 5 4 precipitation estimates over large lakes according to historical measurements and studies holman et al 2012 realistic basin wide precipitation estimates could have higher relative overlake precipitation in cold months and lower overlake precipitation in warm months a common hypothesis for this phenomenon is that the relatively cool air over the lakes water temperature lower than air temperature resulting relatively lower near surface air temperature during warm season will inhibit the growth of convective storms resulting in less rain over the lakes conversely the relatively warm lake during the winter water temperature higher than air temperature resulting relatively higher near surface air temperature will initiate convective instability through the flux of heat and moisture into the cold air advecting over the lakes however this phenomenon is rarely considered by existing hydro meteorological studies at lake and sub basin scales for sub basins which feature large freshwater surfaces these processes may significantly impact the prediction of lake water budget and water balance at sub basin scales since one third of the great lakes basin water budget is derived from precipitation falling directly on the lake surface table 1 particularly for lake superior 39 and lake michigan huron 32 this study preliminarily addresses this issue by analyzing the overland overlake precipitation patterns of different products as illustrated in fig 9 fig s4 s5 and s6 the overland overlake seasonal variation is more significant for lake superior and michigan huron than lake erie and ontario this order follows the rank of lake surface areas of sub basin indicating that stronger seasonal variations can be observed for sub basins with larger lake surface proportions on the other hand it can be noted that capa and aorc reflect stronger seasonal dynamics than mpe particularly for lake superior and michigan huron since no rain gauge measurement is available over the water surfaces there is no ground truth for calibrating satellite images on these overlake areas products only derived from rain gauge observations and satellite data might not well capture these overland overlake seasonal variations results in section 4 2 reaffirm this assumption that capa and aorc which are reanalysis products relying on meteorological models can better represent the seasonal variations of the ratio of overland to overlake precipitation whereas these variations are less represented by mpe and glm hmd which are satellite gauge blended and gauge based datasets on the other hand results from analysis with l2swbm suggest that aorc and mpe could have closer estimates to the realistic overlake precipitation based on a long term water balance aspect that underscores aorc for both correctly estimating overlake precipitation and properly representing differences between overland and overlake precipitation 5 5 applications of precipitation products for hydrological modeling of the great lakes basin for the four evaluated gridded datasets capa and mpe are available for nowcast and hindcast simulations while aorc and merged can be only used for hindcast simulations for nowcasting applications according to results shown in table 3 mpe is better than capa for sub basins of lake superior lake michigan huron and lake ontario while capa performs better for the sub basin of lake erie as for hindcasting applications since the performance of aorc is less dispersed at spatial and temporal scales fig 2 fig 7 and aorc fits better with glm hmd for most sub basins table 3 aorc could be the appropriate choice of climate forcing for hydrological modeling for the entire great lakes watershed whereas for some specific sub basins i e overland areas of michigan huron other products i e mpe might be preferred in addition it is informative to notice that in table 3 overland and overlake consistently favors aorc for mae under 2 mm day and r2 above 0 6 however important pbias values can be noted 20 70 this result implies that consistent bias may exist with aorc dataset and should be considered for model calibration and uncertainty analysis on the other hand hydrological processes across overland areas and in the lake are often simulated by different models land surface hydrological models commonly use simple routing schemes for computing in lake processes i e nwm lahmers et al 2019 swat arnold et al 1998 while lake models usually do not include land surface processes i e fvcom chen et al 2003 delft3d deltares 2016 therefore when performing land surface modeling the correctness of precipitation products on overland areas is important where gridded products can be evaluated by comparing with the ground observations on the contrary for lake water modeling appropriate estimates of overlake precipitation are crucial considering seasonal variations of the ratio of overland to overlake precipitation and using l2swbm to infer reliable overlake precipitation range can help modeler to select proper products for overlake precipitation for large lake basins like the great lakes a reasonable approach would be to couple land surface hydrology models e g wrf hydro with sophisticated lake hydrodynamic models i e fvcom in which each approach could

3574,how to rationally optimize the allocation of surface water and groundwater resources in saline alkali areas is a difficult problem in current model optimization based on an interval two stage stochastic programming itsp method this paper considers the system risk involved in saline alkali land treatment follows a robust optimization method and constructs an interval two stage data driven subrobust optimization itdro model which can optimize the distribution of groundwater and surface water for different crops and realize the combination of wells and canals through the joint dispatch of surface water and groundwater this paper takes the urad irrigation area as the research object and the obtained results provide water distribution objectives under situations of multiple sources of water multiple crops and different robust coefficients after the successful calibration and verification of the saltmod model the water distribution target is taken as the main input parameter and substituted into the simulation model based on the principle of water and salt balance the output includes soil salinity drainage salinity groundwater salinity gws groundwater table gwt depth and drainage the results show that the integrated itdro and saltmod model can control the groundwater level below the critical depth under the premise of satisfying crop irrigation reducing the groundwater level by approximately 0 75 m and the gws in the irrigation area by approximately 0 68 g l which can provide a reference for the prevention and control of soil salinization and waterlogging this approach is suitable for arid and semiarid regions that face similar problems keywords uncertain programming data driven robust optimization saltmod model well canal combination

development has become a hot issue internationally and an enormous challenge for human society guo et al 2012 china is a large saline alkali country ranking third among the top 10 countries in terms of serious soil saline alkali problems chinese saline alkali land is distributed among 17 provinces including those in northeast china north china northwest china coastal areas and saline alkali wastelands and the total saline alkali area affecting cultivated land exceeds 500 million mu xiao 2011 the hetao area is rich in land resources and irrigated agriculture is one of most the important approaches to regional economic development however this area is located in an arid and semiarid region and sensitive to climate change with the warming of the climate and the intensification of economic activities soil salinization has increasingly restricted economic development and regional sustainable development has been seriously threatened yang 1994 the hetao plain is located inland and is the most important agricultural and ecologically fragile area in northern china the drainage of the urad irrigation area is not smooth resulting in primary and secondary salinization problems the area of saline alkali land is large and soil salinization is heavy which seriously affects the societal economic and environmental development of the hetao irrigation district yang 2012 the saline alkali land was turned into lucid waters and lush mountains and invaluable assets in line with the interests of people and fit the new development concept appropriately dealing with the relationship between ecological environmental protection and economic societal development wu and du 2019 through the joint optimized use of surface water and groundwater control and reduction in excessive surface water use and appropriate groundwater extraction the groundwater depth can be adjusted to an appropriate dynamic so that soil salinity dynamics can reach a balance within the year and for many years to come preventing salt accumulation and waterlogging the joint scheduling of surface water and groundwater not only satisfies crop irrigation but also controls the groundwater table gwt below the critical depth based on the optimal allocation and joint scheduling mode of multiple agricultural water sources surface water and groundwater a regional agricultural multiwater source joint dispatching scheme is proposed which can provide a reference for the prevention and control of soil salinization regional agricultural water and soil resources have uncertainties such as rainfall runoff planning period water supply and demand and fluctuations in the cost and benefit coefficients however in the prevention and control of soil salinization water and salt movements droughts and floods etc have intensified the complexity of such work shi 1983 which has led to traditional deterministic optimization methods such as linear programming nonlinear programming dynamic programming etc not being able to solve the problem mahmood and mohammad 2020 solving this problem requires the introduction of factorial interval analysis fuzzy number sets and probability density distribution to solve uncertainty problems in the prevention and control of soil salinization including interval programming fuzzy programming and stochastic programming li et al 2016 among uncertain mathematical programming technologies an interval two stage stochastic programming itsp model has a stronger advantage in terms of controlling soil salinization through the joint scheduling of surface water and groundwater yang 2004 li et al 2018 applied the interval linear multiobjective programming ilmp model to the hulan river irrigation area in northeastern china the model quantifies and couples the uncertainty caused by climate change and human activities and achieves the synergistic management of irrigated agriculture to increase efficiency increase production and conserve water fu et al 2014 combined two stage interval random programming with the water production function to solve the uncertainty problem in the water resource optimal allocation model of multiple sources multiple regions and multiple crops zhang lei and li chenyang 2014 2015 optimized the water resources of the sanjiang plain using an improved itsp model the above uncertain optimization models are very effective in dealing with uncertain factors but ignore the systemic risk problem in the treatment of saline alkali land after application in soil salinization control these models produce soil returning salt and a reduction in agricultural production the model results are not feasible the robust optimization method can effectively avoid risks in the planning process and weigh the relationship between variable random values and recourse costs in the system for example li et al 2010 applied a robust interval minimax regret analysis rima method to the uncertainty optimization of water resource allocation chen et al 2013 proposed a robust risk analysis method rram for uncertain water resource decision making combining interval parameter programming and robust optimization in a stochastic programming framework zhang et al 2018 combined interval parameter programming robust programming and mixed integer linear programming into a two stage stochastic programming framework and an inaccurate and robust two stage mixed integer linear programming irtmlp method was proposed for uncertain crop planting regional planning a review of the saltmod model used in soil salinization and waterlogging control is shown in table 1 the first four articles use the saltmod model alone and the last five papers combine the use of the saltmod model and that of the mathematical programming model the uncertainties in climate change research mainly include uncertainties regarding the causes of climate change the prediction of climate change and the impact of climate change mainly focusing on the below aspects 1 global warming has not changed significantly in terms of either the rate of change or the amount of change the earth has not warmed significantly in the past ten years however according to an intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report the temperature should have risen by 0 2 2 the ipcc models may overestimate climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and underestimate natural fluctuations which means that these models may have upward systematic bias in estimating such impacts 3 the logical reasoning behind global warming caused by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities is not perfect there is no consensus on climate change science and there are still many unresolved problems 4 there is a tendency to ignore different voices in the ipcc report especially in the parts that are most likely to be read by decision makers tian et al 2021 wang et al 2018 found that due to the complexity and uncertainty of water supply and demand in agricultural irrigation planning to control for soil salinization the allocation of agricultural water resources is more varied and complex which may lead to high risk status after the treatment of saline alkali land such as salt returning to the soil and a reduction in agricultural production reduction existing studies have less considered the risk issues in the water supply and demand system and cannot guarantee the absolute feasibility of the optimal solution for the model liu et al 2020 the robust optimization method embodies the risk in the function effectively evaluates this risk avoids this risk in the planning process balances the cost and risk relationship of the system and effectively increases the feasibility of the model solution and stability of the system zhang et al 2020 the solution is obtained through robust optimization for all possible situations the constraint conditions are satisfied and the function value of the objective function in the worst case is optimized sun et al 2019 over the years robust optimization has been widely used in fields such as smart grids control theory portfolio management logistics engineering and machine learning but there has been a lack of such application in soil salinization control because of the above research status this paper introduces a robust optimization theory to itsp and establishes an interval two stage data driven subrobust optimization itdro model the saltmod model can simulate the impact of long term water management measures on groundwater depth and soil salinity in this study the saltmod model is used in conjunction with the itdro model to better simulate farmers impact on waterlogging soil salinity and water shortage as well as other responses the purpose of this study is to integrate itdro programming and saltmod models to realize the joint operation of surface water and groundwater through the combination of wells and canals alleviate surface land salinization and achieve sustainable agricultural development this study includes the following aspects 1 a data driven subrobust optimization method that combines the advantages of stochastic optimization and robust optimization is used for soil salinization control 2 soil salinization controls and systemic risk issues are considered 3 a comparison of the simulated and measured values 5 years before and after the implementation of well ditch combination technology is carried out 4 the proposed method is applied to the urad irrigation area north china to solve the soil salinization control problem and 5 sustainable water resource management measures in semiarid regions are suggested 2 methodology and models 2 1 itdro programming establishment in this study as shown in fig 1 interval two stage planning and data driven subrobust programming are coupled and the maximum net benefit of agricultural irrigation is the objective function water supply demand and crop water requirements are restrictions under the premise of ensuring the water resource carrying capacity of the irrigation area the prewater allocation target of the crop is determined based on the crop water requirements for a normal level year and it is used as the decision making variable of the first stage due to the initial water storage capacity of the irrigation area the irrigation amount from the yellow river the influence of water resource evaporation and other factors the water supply amount may be smaller than the water supply target which requires decision makers to adjust by reducing the water supply in the irrigation area or increasing the irrigation amount from the yellow river to replenish the water however reducing the amount of water supply can affect crop yields increasing the irrigation amount from the yellow river increases the cost of water which results in economic penalties to reduce the cost of water it is necessary to adjust the water distribution in the first stage and use the water shortage as the deciding factor in the second stage finally the best solution to the water distribution for different crops can be determined the itdro programming model is expressed as follows 1 m a x f i 1 m j 1 n c ij w ij i 1 m j 1 n d ij k 1 3 p k s ijk α i 1 m j 1 n k 1 3 p k d ij s ijk p k k 1 3 d ij s ijk since s is affected by the amount of water in the current year and the amount of water received is significant it is a random variable therefore the water shortage under different water levels is processed according to the discrete function and the probability of incoming water quantity q in different horizontal years is assumed to be pk 0 p k 1 where k 1 2 3 indicates the water level of the water source in different years with k 1 indicating that the water quantity in the forecast year is the lowest that the flow level is low and that the water shortage is largest k 2 indicating that the water quantity becomes more in the forecast year that the flow level is medium and that the water shortage is small and k 3 indicating the highest amount of water that the flow level is high and that the water shortage is minimum 2 k 1 3 p k 1 i n f o r m u l a 1 i t e m i 1 m j 1 n

i s v a r i a b i l i t y α reflects the attitude of decision makers towards the economy and robustness of the system robustness means being strong and it is also the ability of the system to survive in abnormal and dangerous situations when it is applied in mathematical programming the purpose is to obtain such a solution for all possible situations the constraint conditions are satisfied and the value of the objective function in the worst case is optimized delage and ye 2010 when α 0 the model is an ordinary itsp model at that time the objective function considers only the minimum cost of the first and second stages indicating that decision makers consider the system economy more and ignore systemic risk issues when α 0 it indicates that decision makers pay more attention to the risk of cost start to consider the variability of cost and pursue economics of the soil salinization control system based on system security after introducing the objective function the model not only effectively reflects multiple uncertainties and complexities but also guarantees the stability and reliability of such understanding laguna 1998 t o m a k e d ij s ijk p k k 1 3 d ij s ijk i n t h e f

mathematical model constructed for the original problem can be simplified that is a convex optimization problem with polynomial computational complexity 2 2 data driven uncertainty sets in robust optimization applications it is important to choose a proper uncertainty set by conjugating different prior assumptions on the probability distribution of a hypothesis test and a random variable we receive the uncertainty sets from the available data as shown in fig 2 the statistical value is γ t n 1 1 α 2 and the threshold value is s t μ μ 0 σ n then we introduce the value at risk concept to address the modelling 6a var ε p w i n f θ p u t w θ 1 ε 6b sup p var ε p w g w ς ε α in this research according to the actual situation of the irrigation project from the yellow river in the urad irrigation area china the itdro programming model is proposed to address the surface land salinization problem the obtained results provide the water distribution targets and water shortages of multiple water sources multiple crops and multiple water levels in the urad irrigation area these water distribution targets are used as the main input parameters after the successful calibration and verification of the saltmod model those data are substituted into the model based on the principle of water and salt balance the outputs of which include groundwater salinity gws soil root layer total salt score and gwt depth 2 3 itdro programming solution in robust counterpart formulas by considering the uncertain water conveyance cost in step 1 the problem can be expressed as follows 7a max f x u

of the itdro programming solution they reformulate the problem using conditional value at risk introduce new auxiliary variables and assume that set μ ε is a box polyhedral uncertainty set finally the deterministic linear programming of the problem is constructed when dealing with robust optimization problems the traditional ant colony algorithm and particle swarm algorithm easily fall into local optimization and the convergence effect of the pareto solution is poor using nonlinear semidefinite programming for efficient solutions can strictly ensure the feasibility of the obtained robust solution the robust solution not only has good performance in the worst case but is also very close to the performance of the optimal solution from the perspective of long term average expected performance which is very important its solving efficiency depends on its parameter settings but under normal circumstances it has high computational efficiency and low memory requirements according to the characteristics of the model itself w ij has uncertainty and represents parameters in the interval it is difficult to judge the value of the system when the value is largest huang and loucks 2000 proposed a solution to this problem introducing the decision variable z ij z ij 0 1 and making w ij w ij δ w ij z ij among them δ w ij w ij w ij which is a certain value if the crop water requirement is met then w ij is close to its upper limit when z ij 1 and the economic benefits of the system increase conversely if the crop water requirements are not met then the system is subject to greater penalties similarly when w ij approaches its lower bound when z ij 0 the economics of the system decrease if the water target is not met then the risk of water shortage in the system is low and thus the consequences are minimal by introducing z ij decision variable optimal value z ijopt and pretarget water distribution w ij can be obtained by using w ij w ij δ w ij z ijopt when the value is a known condition the equation can determine wij when the net benefit of the irrigation system is at its maximum matlab was used to obtain f opt and s ijopt and finally determine the optimal water distribution target according to the above solution and the interactive algorithm proposed by xu and diwekar 2007 the above model is transformed into two deterministic submodels namely upper and lower bound submodels since the goal of these model is maximum net benefits the model corresponding to f is solved first as follows 10a m a x f i 1 m j 1 n c ij w ij δ w ij z ij i 1 m j 1 n d ij k 1 3 p k s

decision variables s ijopt and z ijopt are the solutions of the model and f opt is the maximum net benefit by bringing z ijopt into w ij w ij δ w ij z ijopt the optimal water diversion target can be calculated similarly z ijopt is brought to the lower limit of the model as follows 11a m a x f i 1 m j 1 n c ij w ij δ w ij z ij i 1 m j 1 n d ij k 1 3 p k s ijk α i 1 m j 1 n k 1 3 p k d ij s ijk p k

ijopt s ijopt i j where o ij the optimal water allocation target for water source i to crop j 2 4 introduction to the saltmod model the saltmod model was developed by professor oosterbaan from the netherlands international institute for land reclamation and improvement ilri based on the principle of water salt balance oosterbaan and senna 1990 this model has been used mainly to simulate and predict displacement and drainage salinity groundwater depth the total salt content of soil water groundwater and drainage etc oosterbaan 2000 it can also simulate farmers responses to soil salinity waterlogging water scarcity etc and is suitable for different agricultural types such as irrigated or nonirrigated agriculture paddy fields or dry crops idris et al 2006 this model has been successfully applied to the plains of mashtul in egypt and the coastal plains of leziria grande in portugal the saltmod model is based on the principle of salt and water balance the main input parameters include meteorology soil crops irrigation drainage groundwater etc the main output data include gwt depth drainage salinity gws soil salinity and displacement according to local climatic conditions crop growth etc the saltmod model can be divided into 1 to 4 simulation seasons and the water salt balance in the vertical direction of the soil can be divided into 4 layers aquifer transition layer root layer and surface in each layer both water balance and salt balance are entered as seasonal data and all factors are assumed to be evenly distributed throughout the study area the abovementioned water salt balance equation can be expressed formulas follows 13 sb 1 ρ 1 w 1 ρ 2 w 2 ρ 3 w 3 f where sb 1 is the salt balance of irrigation area t ρ 1 is the total ion content in diversion and drainage w 1 t m3 ρ 2 is the total ion content in precipitation w 2 t m3 ρ 3 is the total ion content in the exchange between irrigation area and groundwater w 3 t m3 and f is the salt content in the application of chemical fertilizer in farmland t based on the balance of water and salt in the irrigation district to meet the quality requirement for agricultural irrigation water the minimum ecological water demand that must be guaranteed in the irrigation district in dry years that is the base flow to maintain the water salt balance in the irrigation district is calculated the base flow is used as the check condition of the canal section in the irrigation district in the saltmod model which provides a scientific basis for the comprehensive regulation planning of the irrigation district tian et al 2018 the water salt model also has some shortcomings for example it is not flexible in inputting irrigation water salinity data only one salinity value can be set and the salinity of irrigation water in each season cannot be distinguished therefore simulation studies on the alternate irrigation of fresh and brackish water are limited the groundwater environment needs to be considered the change in the groundwater level must be within the safe water level range moreover the groundwater level cannot be overexploited and soil salinization cannot occur therefore it is necessary to couple the water conversion process with the constructed model framework from the perspective of optimization and simulation coupling the coordinated development between economic effects and environmental effects should be balanced 3 study area and data 3 1 regional overview the inner mongolia hetao irrigation district is located in the western part of the inner mongolia autonomous region and is the largest self flow diversion irrigation area in china this irrigation area is located in an arid and semiarid zone the rainfall is sparse and the evaporation intensity is large in this area without irrigation from the yellow river there would be no agricultural development zeng and li 1990 the urad irrigation area is located at the eastern end of the hetao basin as shown in fig 3 it belongs to bayannaoer city east of baotou and west of wuyuan originally the south is opposite the hangjin banner and dalat banner of erdos city and the north is bordered by the urad middle banner niu et al 2016 the geographical position of this irrigation area is between 108 11 109 54 east longitude and 40 28 41 16 north latitude the total area is 7 476 square kilometres and the yellow river irrigation district is 2 500 square kilometres long term changes in temperature and precipitation from 1960 to 2009 in the hetao plain basin hpb are shown in fig 4 the overall terrain is slightly tilted from the southwest to the northeast the terrain is flat and wide the elevation varies little and there are some ups and downs in the area which form a depression having a certain relationship with the formation of soil saline alkali land in this area the low lying area of the plain has poor drainage the water level is elevated and the shallow groundwater has high salt content water and salt rise to the surface with the soil capillary water then the water evaporates and the salt remains at the surface in addition the formation of saline alkali land is supplemented by drought and waterlogging disasters peng et al 1992 long term salinization has resulted in barren land and long term stagnant food production moreover the lives of the masses have been miserable they eat red sorghum and wild vegetables drink bitter and salty water and live in earthen houses and cottages ji et al 2020 3 2 data collection and analysis three crops oil sunflower wheat and maize were selected as research objects according to the data from the 1985 2015 inner mongolia autonomous region statistics bureau inner mongolia statistical yearbook 2014 and bayannaoer city statistics bureau 2014 and data obtained from field research water levels are classified into three categories low incoming water level medium water level and high water level according to the historical statistics of rainfall and runoff in the urad irrigation area of hetao irrigation district it is concluded that the probability of the occurrence of medium flow is greater than that of high and low flow and the probability of occurrence of high and low flow is the same which conforms to the normal distribution therefore this paper assumes that the probability of the occurrence of these three incoming water levels in a given year is 0 2 0 6 and 0 2 lu 2010 according to the statistics table 2 lists the upper and lower limits of the available water for crop irrigation water sources under different water levels in the forecasted year in water resource planning if the water quantity is expected to reach the water demand then only water diversion costs are incurred if the water demand is not met then it results in a water shortage penalty table 3 combines the relevant references to give the net benefit coefficient and penalty coefficient value for different water resources and different crops in the urad irrigation area the data of the main crop acreage planted in the typical year 2014 are taken as known conditions it is also assumed that the planting structure of typical crops in the forecasted year is unchanged and that the optimal water supply target is determined table 4 gives the typical indicators of crop irrigation in the urad irrigation area for advanced decision making and the expected water supply to different crops from different water sources according to survey data provided by the local water bureau 4 results and analysis 4 1 optimized water distribution plan using matlab 7 and lingo 11 programming the robustness of the itdro model for multiwater source allocation in the urad irrigation area was solved the results of which are shown in table 5 the optimal water distribution target can be obtained by the formula w ijopt w ij δ w ij z ijopt that is when zij 0 w ijopt w ij the optimal water distribution target takes the lower limit and conversely when zij 1 w ijopt w ij the optimal water distribution target takes the upper limit huang and chang 2003 for wheat z11 z21 0 table 6 the optimal water distribution target is taken as the lower limits of 12 8 106 m3 and 19 4 106 m3 for corn z12 z22 1 table 6 the optimal water distribution target is taken as the upper limit of 2 4 107 m3 and 6 3 106 m3 similarly z23 0 5 for oil sunflower the optimal water distribution target of groundwater is between the upper and lower limits the target of which is 2 6 107 m3 4 2 optimal water distribution result analysis fig 5 shows the optimal water allocation targets for wheat maize and oil sunflower in the irrigation area the optimal water distribution target for surface water is 5 68 107 m3 and that for groundwater is 5 17 107 m3 the amounts of surface water and groundwater resources are 6 02 109 6 82 109 m3 and 4 57 109 5 37 109 m3 respectively therefore water distribution is sufficient and there is no water shortage in the case of a low flow rate the available groundwater in the irrigation area is 2 05 109 2 45 109 m3 at this time the amount of water that can be distributed almost reaches the upper limit and the shortage of the crop water supply is slight zeng and li 1990 the possible reasons for this are as follows 1 the development and utilization of water resources in the hetao irrigation district is unreasonable and the groundwater in the urad irrigation area has been seriously overexploited zeng et al 2014 and 2 the joint planning and utilization of surface water and groundwater in the hetao irrigation district is unreasonable 4 3 calibration and validation results of the saltmod model to evaluate saltmod model performance statistical measures can be used to quantify the difference in the observed and measured state variables i e gwt depths and gws in this study the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and correlation r 2 were used singh 2012 14a nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 14b rmse 1

depth data are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively the simulated values reasonably match the observed data for all years approximately similar results were obtained with the gws data during the calibration and verification runs fig 7 a and b in the verification period we used those data not used in the calibration period to verify our results for gwt depth the nse values were 0 69 in calibration and 0 66 in verification and the coefficients of correlation r2 were 0 75 in calibration and 0 74 in verification for gws the nse values were 0 81 in calibration and 0 76 in verification and the coefficients of correlation r2 were 0 87 in calibration and 0 84 in verification r2 and nse values were both quite satisfactory during the calibration and verification periods as shown in table 7 4 4 salt control analysis the multiple water sources multiple crops and multiple water supply targets with different robust coefficients obtained by the itdro programming model are taken as the main input parameters and substituted into the saltmod model based on the principle of water and salt balance the output data include soil salinity gws and gwt depth from 2010 to 2014 surface water and groundwater joint scheduling was not implemented while from 2015 to 2019 the technology of well and canal combinations was implemented in the urad irrigation area by comparing observed values of gwt depth in the planting area of different crops with the gwt depth data output by the saltmod model it can be concluded that after the technology of wells and canals combination was implemented the groundwater level of different crops in the urad irrigation area was reduced by approximately 0 75 m which was below the critical depth this method effectively controlled for soil salinization prevented land desertification and promoted regional sustainable development by comparing the observed values of soil salinity and gws in different crop planting areas with the soil salinity and gws output by the saltmod model it can be concluded that after surface water and groundwater joint scheduling was implemented the soil salinity in the urad irrigation area tended to decrease by approximately 0 68 g l wheat maize and oil sunflower roots have larger growth space and wider distribution enhanced stress resistance and promoted the high quality and high yield of the three crops effectively promoting regional sustainable agricultural development the gwt depth soil salinity and gws in urad front banner from 2020 to 2025 were predicted by the saltmod model the gwt depth of urad front banner tended to decrease from 2 3 m to 2 8 m in the wheat planting area and from 1 2 m to 1 8 m in the maize and oil sunflower planting areas the soil salinity of urad front banner in the three crop planting areas tended to be in a state of shock but remained at approximately 0 15 and the gws of urad front banner tended to decrease from 16 ds m to 10 ds m in the wheat planting area and from 18 ds m to 8 ds m in the maize and oil sunflower planting areas 5 discussion 5 1 water distribution results the optimal water distribution target was obtained in the first stage of the model and the optimal water distribution was determined by o ij w ijopt s ijkopt the robust optimization method aimed to recapture net benefit expectations in the second phase and evaluate system risk tan 2011 table 5 shows the corresponding shortage of water resources and the optimal amount of water when α is taken at different values when α 0 this model is a normal itsp model which represents the decision maker s neutral attitude towards risk and does not consider cost variability table 6 shows the following results 1 for wheat the decision variable of surface water was 0 when α 0 under the low medium and high water levels the water shortage was 5 7 108 9 7 108 m3 3 5 108 5 0 108 m3 and 7 107 1 2 108 m3 respectively and therefore the optimal allocation of water was 4 4 108 8 6 108 m3 4 8 108 6 4 108 m3 and 5 0 108 9 6 108 m3 with a water content larger than the minimum water requirement the surface water of wheat could meet the water supply of rice for corn the decision variable of surface water was 1 and when α 0 the water shortage was less and the optimal water allocation was 2 5 108 6 0 108 m3 2 5 108 6 0 108 m3 and 2 5 108 m3 in the case of a sufficient water supply the system preferred to avoid penalty risk so the water allocation target upper limit was taken as the optimal water distribution target 2 as α increased the amount of water shortage increased for example at low horizontal flow when α 0 5 1 and 2 the groundwater shortage of wheat was 2 8 108 5 0 108 m3 3 3 108 4 0 108 m3 and 4 4 108 5 1 108 m3 and the optimal water distribution was 15 0 108 17 2 108 m3 13 2 108 16 7 108 m3 and 14 9 108 16 3 108 m3 respectively the surface water shortages of corn were 0 3 107 m3 0 4 107 m3 and 0 3 107 m3 and the optimal water distributions were 2 5 108 6 0 108 m3 2 2 108 5 0 108 m3 and 2 1 108 4 0 108 m3 at low flow levels the system had less water inflow and the optimal water distribution of the system was adjusted by reducing the water distribution that is the larger the robust coefficient was the stronger the robustness of the system peng et al 1992 the model increased the water shortage of crops and reduced the water distribution of crops thereby increasing the robustness of the system 3 when α gradually increased the water shortage of crops increased but when α 2 the water shortage showed almost no change for example when α 2 4 and 5 under a medium horizontal flow rate the surface water shortage of oil sunflower was 0 and the optimal water distribution was 1 4 m3 1 3 m3 and 1 3 m3 respectively the groundwater shortage of maize was 0 and the optimal water allocation was 1 8 108 3 5 108 m3 1 5 108 3 5 108 m3 and 1 4 108 3 5 108 m3 an increase in water shortage increased the robustness of the system but to ensure the minimum water requirement for the normal growth of crops the water shortage no longer increased and the system tended to be stable zeng et al 2017 figs 11 and 12 show the risk of system recourse value and net economic benefit at different α levels as α increased the risk of recourse value increased guo 2009 when α 0 it was considered an economy oriented ecp scenario in which decision makers emphasized economic development when α was between 0 and 5 it was considered sustainable development sud scenario in which decision makers desired to balance economic and environmental objectives when α 5 it was considered an environment oriented enp scenario in which decision makers emphasized environmental protection cost reduced economic returns in addition the net economic benefits of the system declined and the upper and lower limits of net economic benefits shrank when ω was between 0 and 5 the upper and lower limits of the net economic benefit of the system were 70 60 47 60 63 60 and 54 respectively these results show that the robustness of the system was improved and that the system was ultimately robust and reliable yu and rui 2007 if policy makers seek to maximize the net economic benefit then they face increased water scarcity and reduced system reliability problems therefore the itdro programming model can help decision makers comprehensively evaluate system economy and reliability yu et al 2010 policy makers must choose between two options high risk and high yield or robust but less net effective therefore our approach can help decision makers thoroughly understand the characteristics of configuration schemes for water resource optimization that can prevent the saline alkali land problem so they can make sound decisions 5 2 salt control results the gwt depth soil salinity and gws for different crop planting fields in the urad irrigation area from 2014 to 2016 which were output by the saltmod model were compared with observed values peng et al 1995 the model simulated the 2014 2016 wheat planting area annual gwt depth and compared it with the observed values in table 8 the gwt depth change process is shown in fig 8 a and the relative error of the simulation in 2014 was only approximately 15 the rest of the relative errors were within 10 and the simulation accuracy was high a comparison of the 2014 2016 observed values and simulated values for total salt in soil in the root layer of the maize planting area is shown in table 9 and fig 9 b the rmse of the total salt content in the maize planting area root layer was 0 02 0 05 from table 10 and fig 10 c a comparison of observed and simulated values for oil sunflower planting area gws in 2014 2016 minimum relative entropy mre for oil sunflower planting area gws was found to be between 12 and 16 the simulated values of the two groups reflected the dynamic process of salt change in the root layer and more accurately simulated the salt reduction process through the combination of wells and canals in 2015 2019 zeng et al 2015 6 conclusions in this study an uncertainty simulation optimization coupling model was established to coordinate resource utilization and environmental protection under various complexities and uncertainties and solve the risks inherent in preventing and controlling soil salinization system the itdro saltmod model can reflect the interaction of agricultural production and salinity control in a single framework and help decision makers formulate a regional comprehensive irrigation plan moreover this model can support agricultural irrigation and drainage under different robust coefficients and then through the formulation of relevant policies the groundwater burial depth of the urad irrigation area can be controlled below the critical depth while reducing gws this model can also be used to improve the net benefit of the soil salinization control system while ensuring the robustness of the regional socioeconomic system at the same time it can provide solutions for ecological environmental protection and ecological civilization construction in the hetao irrigation district and achieve sustainable agricultural development in this region the results show that a the introduction of robust optimization can address the shortcomings of the traditional itsp method through a robust coefficient to seek the maximum net benefit of the system and rational allocation of water resources to prevent and control soil salinization such optimization can avoid risks such as crop yield reduction after salt control taking the maize planting region in the urad irrigation area as an example the rmse of the total salt in the root zone is between 0 02 and 0 05 which proves the applicability of the model b through an itdro programming model a joint surface water groundwater dispatching scheme and an optimal decision making method combined with wells and canals have been implemented in the urat irrigation area since 2015 which have the advantages of adjusting groundwater depth and changing soil water and salt dynamics crop roots have more space to grow distribute more widely and strengthen stress resistance this approach can be popularized and applied in regions suitable for digging wells in the urad irrigation area c the saltmod model can better simulate the dynamic change in groundwater depth and soil root layer salinity for different crop planting regions in the urad irrigation area therefore the saltmod model can be used to predict the 2020 2025 gwt depth and upper limit of gws for different crop planting regions in the urad irrigation area this study provides a basis for decision makers to rationally control surface land soil salinity improve green and efficient water use in agriculture and obtain high quality high yield crops correspondingly specific recommendations to authorities can be summarized as follows first overcultivativation and overharvesting based on the existing three north shelter forest system construction project in the urad irrigation area should be avoided the crop planting structure should be adjusted the planting area of cash crops which adapt well to temperature are resistant to saline and alkali drought and short growing seasons such as sugar beet should be increased to enhance local social and economic benefits second when using uncertainty optimization technology to provide decision makers with soil salinization control programs risk control issues should be considered and methods such as robust coefficients conditional value at risk and disaster footprints zeng et al 2019 should be introduced to prevent salt return and crop yield reduction after salt control third the government s policy support and financial subsidies should continue to increase promote well ditch integration technology in regions suitable for digging wells in the urad irrigation area expand the implementation area of optimal dispatching plans for the combined use of surface water and groundwater improve the current situation of water shortages develop water saving industries promote agricultural eco environmental protection and achieve regional sustainable development credit

3574,how to rationally optimize the allocation of surface water and groundwater resources in saline alkali areas is a difficult problem in current model optimization based on an interval two stage stochastic programming itsp method this paper considers the system risk involved in saline alkali land treatment follows a robust optimization method and constructs an interval two stage data driven subrobust optimization itdro model which can optimize the distribution of groundwater and surface water for different crops and realize the combination of wells and canals through the joint dispatch of surface water and groundwater this paper takes the urad irrigation area as the research object and the obtained results provide water distribution objectives under situations of multiple sources of water multiple crops and different robust coefficients after the successful calibration and verification of the saltmod model the water distribution target is taken as the main input parameter and substituted into the simulation model based on the principle of water and salt balance the output includes soil salinity drainage salinity groundwater salinity gws groundwater table gwt depth and drainage the results show that the integrated itdro and saltmod model can control the groundwater level below the critical depth under the premise of satisfying crop irrigation reducing the groundwater level by approximately 0 75 m and the gws in the irrigation area by approximately 0 68 g l which can provide a reference for the prevention and control of soil salinization and

development has become a hot issue internationally and an enormous challenge for human society guo et al 2012 china is a large saline alkali country ranking third among the top 10 countries in terms of serious soil saline alkali problems chinese saline alkali land is distributed among 17 provinces including those in northeast china north china northwest china coastal areas and saline alkali wastelands and the total saline alkali area affecting cultivated land exceeds 500 million mu xiao 2011 the hetao area is rich in land resources and irrigated agriculture is one of most the important approaches to regional economic development however this area is located in an arid and semiarid region and sensitive to climate change with the warming of the climate and the intensification of economic activities soil salinization has increasingly restricted economic development and regional sustainable development has been seriously threatened yang 1994 the hetao plain is located inland and is the most important agricultural and ecologically fragile area in northern china the drainage of the urad irrigation area is not smooth resulting in primary and secondary salinization problems the area of saline alkali land is large and soil salinization is heavy which seriously affects the societal economic and environmental development of the hetao irrigation district yang 2012 the saline alkali land was turned into lucid waters and lush mountains and invaluable assets in line with the interests of people and fit the new development concept appropriately dealing with the relationship between ecological environmental protection and economic societal development wu and du 2019 through the joint optimized use of surface water and groundwater control and reduction in excessive surface water use and appropriate groundwater extraction the groundwater depth can be adjusted to an appropriate dynamic so that soil salinity dynamics can reach a balance within the year and for many years to come preventing salt accumulation and waterlogging the joint scheduling of surface water and groundwater not only satisfies crop irrigation but also controls the groundwater table gwt below the critical depth based on the optimal allocation and joint scheduling mode of multiple agricultural water sources surface water and groundwater a regional agricultural multiwater source joint dispatching scheme is proposed which can provide a reference for the prevention and control of soil salinization regional agricultural water and soil resources have uncertainties such as rainfall runoff planning period water supply and demand and fluctuations in the cost and benefit coefficients however in the prevention and control of soil salinization water and salt movements droughts and floods etc have intensified the complexity of such work shi 1983 which has led to traditional deterministic optimization methods such as linear programming nonlinear programming dynamic programming etc not being able to solve the problem mahmood and mohammad 2020 solving this problem requires the introduction of factorial interval analysis fuzzy number sets and probability density distribution to solve uncertainty problems in the prevention and control of soil salinization including interval programming fuzzy programming and stochastic programming li et al 2016 among uncertain mathematical programming technologies an interval two stage stochastic programming itsp model has a stronger advantage in terms of controlling soil salinization through the joint scheduling of surface water and groundwater yang 2004 li et al 2018 applied the interval linear multiobjective programming ilmp model to the hulan river irrigation area in northeastern china the model quantifies and couples the uncertainty caused by climate change and human activities and achieves the synergistic management of irrigated agriculture to increase efficiency increase production and conserve water fu et al 2014 combined two stage interval random programming with the water production function to solve the uncertainty problem in the water resource optimal allocation model of multiple sources multiple regions and multiple crops zhang lei and li chenyang 2014 2015 optimized the water resources of the sanjiang plain using an improved itsp model the above uncertain optimization models are very effective in dealing with uncertain factors but ignore the systemic risk problem in the treatment of saline alkali land after application in soil salinization control these models produce soil returning salt and a reduction in agricultural production the model results are not feasible the robust optimization method can effectively avoid risks in the planning process and weigh the relationship between variable random values and recourse costs in the system for example li et al 2010 applied a robust interval minimax regret analysis rima method to the uncertainty optimization of water resource allocation chen et al 2013 proposed a robust risk analysis method rram for uncertain water resource decision making combining interval parameter programming and robust optimization in a stochastic programming framework zhang et al 2018 combined interval parameter programming robust programming and mixed integer linear programming into a two stage stochastic programming framework and an inaccurate and robust two stage mixed integer linear programming irtmlp method was proposed for uncertain crop planting regional planning a review of the saltmod model used in soil salinization and waterlogging control is shown in table 1 the first four articles use the saltmod model alone and the last five papers combine the use of the saltmod model and that of the mathematical programming model the uncertainties in climate change research mainly include uncertainties regarding the causes of climate change the prediction of climate change and the impact of climate change mainly focusing on the below aspects 1 global warming has not changed significantly in terms of either the rate of change or the amount of change the earth has not warmed significantly in the past ten years however according to an intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report the temperature should have risen by 0 2 2 the ipcc models may overestimate climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and underestimate natural fluctuations which means that these models may have upward systematic bias in estimating such impacts 3 the logical reasoning behind global warming caused by the emission of greenhouse gases from human activities is not perfect there is no consensus on climate change science and there are still many unresolved problems 4 there is a tendency to ignore different voices in the ipcc report especially in the parts that are most likely to be read by decision makers tian et al 2021 wang et al 2018 found that due to the complexity and uncertainty of water supply and demand in agricultural irrigation planning to control for soil salinization the allocation of agricultural water resources is more varied and complex which may lead to high risk status after the treatment of saline alkali land such as salt returning to the soil and a reduction in agricultural production reduction existing studies have less considered the risk issues in the water supply and demand system and cannot guarantee the absolute feasibility of the optimal solution for the model liu et al 2020 the robust optimization method embodies the risk in the function effectively evaluates this risk avoids this risk in the planning process balances the cost and risk relationship of the system and effectively increases the feasibility of the model solution and stability of the system zhang et al 2020 the solution is obtained through robust optimization for all possible situations the constraint conditions are satisfied and the function value of the objective function in the worst case is optimized sun et al 2019 over the years robust optimization has been widely used in fields such as smart grids control theory portfolio management logistics engineering and machine learning but there has been a lack of such application in soil salinization control because of the above research status this paper introduces a robust optimization theory to itsp and establishes an interval two stage data driven subrobust optimization itdro model the saltmod model can simulate the impact of long term water management measures on groundwater depth and soil salinity in this study the saltmod model is used in conjunction with the itdro model to better simulate farmers impact on waterlogging soil salinity and water shortage as well as other responses the purpose of this study is to integrate itdro programming and saltmod models to realize the joint operation of surface water and groundwater through the combination of wells and canals alleviate surface land salinization and achieve sustainable agricultural development this study includes the following aspects 1 a data driven subrobust optimization method that combines the advantages of stochastic optimization and robust optimization is used for soil salinization control 2 soil salinization controls and systemic risk issues are considered 3 a comparison of the simulated and measured values 5 years before and after the implementation of well ditch combination technology is carried out 4 the proposed method is applied to the urad irrigation area north china to solve the soil salinization control problem and 5 sustainable water resource management measures in semiarid regions are suggested 2 methodology and models 2 1 itdro programming establishment in this study as shown in fig 1 interval two stage planning and data driven subrobust programming are coupled and the maximum net benefit of agricultural irrigation is the objective function water supply demand and crop water requirements are restrictions under the premise of ensuring the water resource carrying capacity of the irrigation area the prewater allocation target of the crop is determined based on the crop water requirements for a normal level year and it is used as the decision making variable of the first stage due to the initial water storage capacity of the irrigation area the irrigation amount from the yellow river the influence of water resource evaporation and other factors the water supply amount may be smaller than the water supply target which requires decision makers to adjust by reducing the water supply in the irrigation area or increasing the irrigation amount from the yellow river to replenish the water however reducing the amount of water supply can affect crop yields increasing the irrigation amount from the yellow river increases the cost of water which results in economic penalties to reduce the cost of water it is necessary to adjust the water distribution in the first stage and use the water shortage as the deciding factor in the second stage finally the best solution to the water distribution for different crops can be determined the itdro programming model is expressed as follows 1 m a

water received is significant it is a random variable therefore the water shortage under different water levels is processed according to the discrete function and the probability of incoming water quantity q in different horizontal years is assumed to be pk 0 p k 1 where k 1 2 3 indicates the water level of the water source in different years with k 1 indicating that the water quantity in the forecast year is the lowest that the flow level is low and that the water shortage is largest k 2 indicating that the water quantity becomes more in the forecast year that the flow level is medium and that the water shortage is small and k 3 indicating the highest amount of water that the flow level is high and that the water shortage is minimum 2 k 1 3 p k 1 i n f o r m u l a 1 i t e m i 1 m j 1 n

i s v a r i a b i l i t y α reflects the attitude of decision makers towards the economy and robustness of the system robustness means being strong and it is also the ability of the system to survive in abnormal and dangerous situations when it is applied in mathematical programming the purpose is to obtain such a solution for all possible situations the constraint conditions are satisfied and the value of the objective function in the worst case is optimized delage and ye 2010 when α 0 the model is an ordinary itsp model at that time the objective function considers only the minimum cost of the first and second stages indicating that decision makers consider the system economy more and ignore systemic risk issues when α 0 it indicates that decision makers pay more attention to the risk of cost start to consider the variability of cost and pursue economics of the soil salinization control system based on system security after introducing the objective function the model not only effectively reflects multiple uncertainties and complexities but also guarantees the stability and reliability of such understanding laguna 1998 t o m a k e d ij s ijk p k k 1 3 d ij s ijk i n t h e f

for step 1 is reformulated as follows 8a max f x u 8b s t h x u 0 8c g x u 0 8d m i n θ x z θ 1 n ε i 1 n z i 8e s t z i 0 8d z u t x θ finally the deterministic linear programming model of the robust counterpart formulation is as follows 9a min θ x y z y θ 1 n ε i 1 n z i 9b s t z i 0 9c j φ ω e q i ω a i z i θ y 9d i 1 n these are data driven uncertainty sets and robust counterpart formulations of the itdro programming solution they reformulate the problem using conditional value at risk introduce new auxiliary variables and assume that set μ ε is a box polyhedral uncertainty set finally the deterministic linear programming of the problem is constructed when dealing with robust optimization problems the traditional ant colony algorithm and particle swarm algorithm easily fall into local optimization and the convergence effect of the pareto solution is poor using nonlinear semidefinite programming for efficient solutions can strictly ensure the feasibility of the obtained robust solution the robust solution not only has good performance in the worst case but is also very close to the performance of the optimal solution from the perspective of long term average expected performance which is very important its solving efficiency depends on its parameter settings but under normal circumstances it has high computational efficiency and low memory requirements according to the characteristics of the model itself w ij has uncertainty and represents parameters in the interval it is difficult to judge the value of the system when the value is largest huang and loucks 2000 proposed a solution to this problem introducing the decision variable z ij z ij 0 1 and making w ij w ij δ w ij z ij among them δ w ij w ij w ij which is a certain value if the crop water requirement is met then w ij is close to its upper limit when z ij 1 and the economic benefits of the system increase conversely if the crop water requirements are not met then the system is subject to greater penalties similarly when w ij approaches its lower bound when z ij 0 the economics of the system decrease if the water target is not met then the risk of water shortage in the system is low and thus the consequences are minimal by introducing z ij decision variable optimal value z ijopt and pretarget water distribution w ij can be obtained by using w ij w ij δ w ij z ijopt when the value is a known condition the equation can determine wij when the net benefit of the irrigation system is at its maximum matlab was used to obtain f opt and s ijopt and finally determine the optimal water distribution target according to the above solution and the interactive algorithm proposed by xu and diwekar 2007 the above model is transformed into two deterministic submodels namely upper and lower bound submodels since the goal of these model is maximum net benefits the model corresponding to f is solved first as follows 10a m a x f i 1 m j 1 n c ij w ij δ w ij z ij i 1 m j 1 n d ij k 1 3 p k s

decision variables s ijopt and z ijopt are the solutions of the model and f opt is the maximum net benefit by bringing z ijopt into w ij w ij δ w ij z ijopt the optimal water diversion target can be calculated similarly z ijopt is brought to the lower limit of the model as follows 11a m a x f i 1 m j 1 n c ij w ij δ w ij z ij i 1 m j 1 n d ij k 1 3 p k s ijk α i 1 m j 1 n k 1 3 p k d ij s ijk p k

netherlands international institute for land reclamation and improvement ilri based on the principle of water salt balance oosterbaan and senna 1990 this model has been used mainly to simulate and predict displacement and drainage salinity groundwater depth the total salt content of soil water groundwater and drainage etc oosterbaan 2000 it can also simulate farmers responses to soil salinity waterlogging water scarcity etc and is suitable for different agricultural types such as irrigated or nonirrigated agriculture paddy fields or dry crops idris et al 2006 this model has been successfully applied to the plains of mashtul in egypt and the coastal plains of leziria grande in portugal the saltmod model is based on the principle of salt and water balance the main input parameters include meteorology soil crops irrigation drainage groundwater etc the main output data include gwt depth drainage salinity gws soil salinity and displacement according to local climatic conditions crop growth etc the saltmod model can be divided into 1 to 4 simulation seasons and the water salt balance in the vertical direction of the soil can be divided into 4 layers aquifer transition layer root layer and surface in each layer both water balance and salt balance are entered as seasonal data and all factors are assumed to be evenly distributed throughout the study area the abovementioned water salt balance equation can be expressed formulas follows 13 sb 1 ρ 1 w 1 ρ 2 w 2 ρ 3 w 3 f where sb 1 is the salt balance of irrigation area t ρ 1 is the total ion content in diversion and drainage w 1 t m3 ρ 2 is the total ion content in precipitation w 2 t m3 ρ 3 is the total ion content in the exchange between irrigation area and groundwater w 3 t m3 and f is the salt content in the application of chemical fertilizer in farmland t based on the balance of water and salt in the irrigation district to meet the quality requirement for agricultural irrigation water the minimum ecological water demand that must be guaranteed in the irrigation district in dry years that is the base flow to maintain the water salt balance in the irrigation district is calculated the base flow is used as the check condition of the canal section in the irrigation district in the saltmod model which provides a scientific basis for the comprehensive regulation planning of the irrigation district tian et al 2018 the water salt model also has some shortcomings for example it is not flexible in inputting irrigation water salinity data only one salinity value can be set and the salinity of irrigation water in each season cannot be distinguished therefore simulation studies on the alternate irrigation of fresh and brackish water are limited the groundwater environment needs to be considered the change in the groundwater level must be within the safe water level range moreover the groundwater level cannot be overexploited and soil salinization cannot occur therefore it is necessary to couple the water conversion process with the constructed model framework from the perspective of optimization and simulation coupling the coordinated development between economic effects and environmental effects should be balanced 3 study area and data 3 1 regional overview the inner mongolia hetao irrigation district is located in the western part of the inner mongolia autonomous region and is the largest self flow diversion irrigation area in china this irrigation area is located in an arid and semiarid zone the rainfall is sparse and the evaporation intensity is large in this area without irrigation from the yellow river there would be no agricultural development zeng and li 1990 the urad irrigation area is located at the eastern end of the hetao basin as shown in fig 3 it belongs to bayannaoer city east of baotou and west of wuyuan originally the south is opposite the hangjin banner and dalat banner of erdos city and the north is bordered by the urad middle banner niu et al 2016 the geographical position of this irrigation area is between 108 11 109 54 east longitude and 40 28 41 16 north latitude the total area is 7 476 square kilometres and the yellow river irrigation district is 2 500 square kilometres long term changes in temperature and precipitation from 1960 to 2009 in the hetao plain basin hpb are shown in fig 4 the overall terrain is slightly tilted from the southwest to the northeast the terrain is flat and wide the elevation varies little and there are some ups and downs in the area which form a depression having a certain relationship with the formation of soil saline alkali land in this area the low lying area of the plain has poor drainage the water level is elevated and the shallow groundwater has high salt content water and salt rise to the surface with the soil capillary water then the water evaporates and the salt remains at the surface in addition the formation of saline alkali land is supplemented by drought and waterlogging disasters peng et al 1992 long term salinization has resulted in barren land and long term stagnant food production moreover the lives of the masses have been miserable they eat red sorghum and wild vegetables drink bitter and salty water and live in earthen houses and cottages ji et al 2020 3 2 data collection and analysis three crops oil sunflower wheat and maize were selected as research objects according to the data from the 1985 2015 inner mongolia autonomous region statistics bureau inner mongolia statistical yearbook 2014 and bayannaoer city statistics bureau 2014 and data obtained from field research water levels are classified into three categories low incoming water level medium water level and high water level according to the historical statistics of rainfall and runoff in the urad irrigation area of hetao irrigation district it is concluded that the probability of the occurrence of medium flow is greater than that of high and low flow and the probability of occurrence of high and low flow is the same which conforms to the normal distribution therefore this paper assumes that the probability of the occurrence of these three incoming water levels in a given year is 0 2 0 6 and 0 2 lu 2010 according to the statistics table 2 lists the upper and lower limits of the available water for crop irrigation water sources under different water levels in the forecasted year in water resource planning if the water quantity is expected to reach the water demand then only water diversion costs are incurred if the water demand is not met then it results in a water shortage penalty table 3 combines the relevant references to give the net benefit coefficient and penalty coefficient value for different water resources and different crops in the urad irrigation area the data of the main crop acreage planted in the typical year 2014 are taken as known conditions it is also assumed that the planting structure of typical crops in the forecasted year is unchanged and that the optimal water supply target is determined table 4 gives the typical indicators of crop irrigation in the urad irrigation area for advanced decision making and the expected water supply to different crops from different water sources according to survey data provided by the local water bureau 4 results and analysis 4 1 optimized water distribution plan using matlab 7 and lingo 11 programming the robustness of the itdro model for multiwater source allocation in the urad irrigation area was solved the results of which are shown in table 5 the optimal water distribution target can be obtained by the formula w ijopt w ij δ w ij z ijopt that is when zij 0 w ijopt w ij the optimal water distribution target takes the lower limit and conversely when zij 1 w ijopt w ij the optimal water distribution target takes the upper limit huang and chang 2003 for wheat z11 z21 0 table 6 the optimal water distribution target is taken as the lower limits of 12 8 106 m3 and 19 4 106 m3 for corn z12 z22 1 table 6 the optimal water distribution target is taken as the upper limit of 2 4 107 m3 and 6 3 106 m3 similarly z23 0 5 for oil sunflower the optimal water distribution target of groundwater is between the upper and lower limits the target of which is 2 6 107 m3 4 2 optimal water distribution result analysis fig 5 shows the optimal water allocation targets for wheat maize and oil sunflower in the irrigation area the optimal water distribution target for surface water is 5 68 107 m3 and that for groundwater is 5 17 107 m3 the amounts of surface water and groundwater resources are 6 02 109 6 82 109 m3 and 4 57 109 5 37 109 m3 respectively therefore water distribution is sufficient and there is no water shortage in the case of a low flow rate the available groundwater in the irrigation area is 2 05 109 2 45 109 m3 at this time the amount of water that can be distributed almost reaches the upper limit and the shortage of the crop water supply is slight zeng and li 1990 the possible reasons for this are as follows 1 the development and utilization of water resources in the hetao irrigation district is unreasonable and the groundwater in the urad irrigation area has been seriously overexploited zeng et al 2014 and 2 the joint planning and utilization of surface water and groundwater in the hetao irrigation district is unreasonable 4 3 calibration and validation results of the saltmod model to evaluate saltmod model performance statistical measures can be used to quantify the difference in the observed and measured state variables i e gwt depths and gws in this study the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and correlation r 2 were used singh 2012 14a nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 14b rmse 1

observation p i is the predicted gwt gws of the ith observation and o is the mean of the observed variables i 1 to n the results of the saltmod model calibration and verification using measured gwt depth data are presented in fig 6 a and b respectively the simulated values reasonably match the observed data for all years approximately similar results were obtained with the gws data during the calibration and verification runs fig 7 a and b in the verification period we used those data not used in the calibration period to verify our results for gwt depth the nse values were 0 69 in calibration and 0 66 in verification and the coefficients of correlation r2 were 0 75 in calibration and 0 74 in verification for gws the nse values were 0 81 in calibration and 0 76 in verification and the coefficients of correlation r2 were 0 87 in calibration and 0 84 in verification r2 and nse values were both quite satisfactory during the calibration and verification periods as shown in table 7 4 4 salt control analysis the multiple water sources multiple crops and multiple water supply targets with different robust coefficients obtained by the itdro programming model are taken as the main input parameters and substituted into the saltmod model based on the principle of water and salt balance the output data include soil salinity gws and gwt depth from 2010 to 2014 surface water and groundwater joint scheduling was not implemented while from 2015 to 2019 the technology of well and canal combinations was implemented in the urad irrigation area by comparing observed values of gwt depth in the planting area of different crops with the gwt depth data output by the saltmod model it can be concluded that after the technology of wells and canals combination was implemented the groundwater level of different crops in the urad irrigation area was reduced by approximately 0 75 m which was below the critical depth this method effectively controlled for soil salinization prevented land desertification and promoted regional sustainable development by comparing the observed values of soil salinity and gws in different crop planting areas with the soil salinity and gws output by the saltmod model it can be concluded that after surface water and groundwater joint scheduling was implemented the soil salinity in the urad irrigation area tended to decrease by approximately 0 68 g l wheat maize and oil sunflower roots have larger growth space and wider distribution enhanced stress resistance and promoted the high quality and high yield of the three crops effectively promoting regional sustainable agricultural development the gwt depth soil salinity and gws in urad front banner from 2020 to 2025 were predicted by the saltmod model the gwt depth of urad front banner tended to decrease from 2 3 m to 2 8 m in the wheat planting area and from 1 2 m to 1 8 m in the maize and oil sunflower planting areas the soil salinity of urad front banner in the three crop planting areas tended to be in a state of shock but remained at approximately 0 15 and the gws of urad front banner tended to decrease from 16 ds m to 10 ds m in the wheat planting area and from 18 ds m to 8 ds m in the maize and oil sunflower planting areas 5 discussion 5 1 water distribution results the optimal water distribution target was obtained in the first stage of the model and the optimal water distribution was determined by o ij w ijopt s ijkopt the robust optimization method aimed to recapture net benefit expectations in the second phase and evaluate system risk tan 2011 table 5 shows the corresponding shortage of water resources and the optimal amount of water when α is taken at different values when α 0 this model is a normal itsp model which represents the decision maker s neutral attitude towards risk and does not consider cost variability table 6 shows the following results 1 for wheat the decision variable of surface water was 0 when α 0 under the low medium and high water levels the water shortage was 5 7 108 9 7 108 m3 3 5 108 5 0 108 m3 and 7 107 1 2 108 m3 respectively and therefore the optimal allocation of water was 4 4 108 8 6 108 m3 4 8 108 6 4 108 m3 and 5 0 108 9 6 108 m3 with a water content larger than the minimum water requirement the surface water of wheat could meet the water supply of rice for corn the decision variable of surface water was 1 and when α 0 the water shortage was less and the optimal water allocation was 2 5 108 6 0 108 m3 2 5 108 6 0 108 m3 and 2 5 108 m3 in the case of a sufficient water supply the system preferred to avoid penalty risk so the water allocation target upper limit was taken as the optimal water distribution target 2 as α increased the amount of water shortage increased for example at low horizontal flow when α 0 5 1 and 2 the groundwater shortage of wheat was 2 8 108 5 0 108 m3 3 3 108 4 0 108 m3 and 4 4 108 5 1 108 m3 and the optimal water distribution was 15 0 108 17 2 108 m3 13 2 108 16 7 108 m3 and 14 9 108 16 3 108 m3 respectively the surface water shortages of corn were 0 3 107 m3 0 4 107 m3 and 0 3 107 m3 and the optimal water distributions were 2 5 108 6 0 108 m3 2 2 108 5 0 108 m3 and 2 1 108 4 0 108 m3 at low flow levels the system had less water inflow and the optimal water distribution of the system was adjusted by reducing the water distribution that is the larger the robust coefficient was the stronger the robustness of the system peng et al 1992 the model increased the water shortage of crops and reduced the water distribution of crops thereby increasing the robustness of the system 3 when α gradually increased the water shortage of crops increased but when α 2 the water shortage showed almost no change for example when α 2 4 and 5 under a medium horizontal flow rate the surface water shortage of oil sunflower was 0 and the optimal water distribution was 1 4 m3 1 3 m3 and 1 3 m3 respectively the groundwater shortage of maize was 0 and the optimal water allocation was 1 8 108 3 5 108 m3 1 5 108 3 5 108 m3 and 1 4 108 3 5 108 m3 an increase in water shortage increased the robustness of the system but to ensure the minimum water requirement for the normal growth of crops the water shortage no longer increased and the system tended to be stable zeng et al 2017 figs 11 and 12 show the risk of system recourse value and net economic benefit at different α levels as α increased the risk of recourse value increased guo 2009 when α 0 it was considered an economy oriented ecp scenario in which decision makers emphasized economic development when α was between 0 and 5 it was considered sustainable development sud scenario in which decision makers desired to balance economic and environmental objectives when α 5 it was considered an environment oriented enp scenario in which decision makers emphasized environmental protection cost reduced economic returns in addition the net economic benefits of the system declined and the upper and lower limits of net economic benefits shrank when ω was between 0 and 5 the upper and lower limits of the net economic benefit of the system were 70 60 47 60 63 60 and 54 respectively these results show that the robustness of the system was improved and that the system was ultimately robust and reliable yu and rui 2007 if policy makers seek to maximize the net economic benefit then they face increased water scarcity and reduced system reliability problems therefore the itdro programming model can help decision makers comprehensively evaluate system economy and reliability yu et al 2010 policy makers must choose between two options high risk and high yield or robust but less net effective therefore our approach can help decision makers thoroughly understand the characteristics of configuration schemes for water resource optimization that can prevent the saline alkali land problem so they can make sound decisions 5 2 salt control results the gwt depth soil salinity and gws for different crop planting fields in the urad irrigation area from 2014 to 2016 which were output by the saltmod model were compared with observed values peng et al 1995 the model simulated the 2014 2016 wheat planting area annual gwt depth and compared it with the observed values in table 8 the gwt depth change process is shown in fig 8 a and the relative error of the simulation in 2014 was only approximately 15 the rest of the relative errors were within 10 and the simulation accuracy was high a comparison of the 2014 2016 observed values and simulated values for total salt in soil in the root layer of the maize planting area is shown in table 9 and fig 9 b the rmse of the total salt content in the maize planting area root layer was 0 02 0 05 from table 10 and fig 10 c a comparison of observed and simulated values for oil sunflower planting area gws in 2014 2016 minimum relative entropy mre for oil sunflower planting area gws was found to be between 12 and 16 the simulated values of the two groups reflected the dynamic process of salt change in the root layer and more accurately simulated the salt reduction process through the combination of wells and canals in 2015 2019 zeng et al 2015 6 conclusions in this study an uncertainty simulation optimization coupling model was established to coordinate resource utilization and environmental protection under various complexities and uncertainties and solve the risks inherent in preventing and controlling soil salinization system the itdro saltmod model can reflect the interaction of agricultural production and salinity control in a single framework and help decision makers formulate a regional comprehensive irrigation plan moreover this model can support agricultural irrigation and drainage under different robust coefficients and then through the formulation of relevant policies the groundwater burial depth of the urad irrigation area can be controlled below the critical depth while reducing gws this model can also be used to improve the net benefit of the soil salinization control system while ensuring the robustness of the regional socioeconomic system at the same time it can provide solutions for ecological environmental protection and ecological civilization construction in the hetao irrigation district and achieve sustainable agricultural development in this region the results show that a the introduction of robust optimization can address the shortcomings of the traditional itsp method through a robust coefficient to seek the maximum net benefit of the system and rational allocation of water resources to prevent and control soil salinization such optimization can avoid risks such as crop yield reduction after salt control taking the maize planting region in the urad irrigation area as an example the rmse of the total salt in the root zone is between 0 02 and 0 05 which proves the applicability of the model b through an itdro programming model a joint surface water groundwater dispatching scheme and an optimal decision making method combined with wells and canals have been implemented in the urat irrigation area since 2015 which have the advantages of adjusting groundwater depth and changing soil water and salt dynamics crop roots have more space to grow distribute more widely and strengthen stress resistance this approach can be popularized and applied in regions suitable for digging wells in the urad irrigation area c the saltmod model can better simulate the dynamic change in groundwater depth and soil root layer salinity for different crop planting regions in the urad irrigation area therefore the saltmod model can be used to predict the 2020 2025 gwt depth and upper limit of gws for different crop planting regions in the urad irrigation area this study provides a basis for decision makers to rationally control surface land soil salinity improve green and efficient water use in agriculture and obtain high quality high yield crops correspondingly specific recommendations to authorities can be summarized as follows first overcultivativation and overharvesting based on the existing three north shelter forest system construction project in the urad irrigation area should be avoided the crop planting structure should be adjusted the planting area of cash crops which adapt well to temperature are resistant to saline and alkali drought and short growing seasons such as sugar beet should be increased to enhance local social and economic benefits second when using uncertainty optimization technology to provide decision makers with soil salinization control programs risk control issues should be considered and methods such as robust coefficients conditional value at risk and disaster footprints zeng et al 2019 should be introduced to prevent salt return and crop yield reduction after salt control third the government s policy support and financial subsidies should continue to increase promote well ditch integration technology in regions suitable for digging wells in the urad irrigation area expand the implementation area of optimal dispatching plans for the combined use of surface water and groundwater improve the current situation of water shortages develop water saving industries promote agricultural eco environmental protection and achieve regional sustainable development credit
