4060,modelling the impact of climate change on streamflow for remote or data sparse regions is a challenge for hydrologists as large datasets are often needed to adequately characterise the processes that dominate the tibetan plateau which forms the headwaters of the brahmaputra and many other major rivers in the indo china region is not closely monitored due to its harsh environment this lack of monitoring is significant as regards its substantial snow resources of considerable importance given the influence these have on the supply of water to downstream communities this research uses a conceptual hydrologic model developed to simulate the impact of the changing climate in such large snow covered data sparse catchments to adequately understand the likely changes in future water availability in the highly populated brahmaputra basin and surrounding areas in the tibetan plateau a multivariate nested recursive bias correction mrnbc approach is used for correcting systematic biases present in the climate model simulations of temperature and precipitation jointly across multiple timescales preserving the dynamic relationships amongst the variables the results disclose that monthly snow cover fraction in the near future 2041 2060 and far future 2071 2090 will decrease significantly with respect to the historical period 1981 2000 while the annual streamflow is noted to be increasing for the basin water supply reliability exhibits a reduction partly as a result of the increased spill volume arising from greater snowmelt concentrated over the wet period and partly the increase in evaporation losses due to higher temperatures while the above results pertain to the brahmaputra basin similar changes are expected for the other major rivers that originate in the tibetan plateau keywords precipitation snow cover climate change bias correction streamflow 1 introduction any change in evapotranspiration precipitation infiltration or snow melt impacts the streamflow generated from a catchment and hence its use in water supply irrigation or flood control liu et al 2017 su et al 2020 rapid changes in the climate coupled with anthropogenic change due to land use change or population growth is impacting such land atmosphere processes and in turn streamflow immerzeel et al 2020 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the snowpack of the tibetan plateau tp has an important role in the water cycle for prominent asian basins including the brahmaputra yellow and yangtze bai et al 2016 cai et al 2017 pritchard 2017 these rivers serve as prominent sources of fresh water supply and satisfy agricultural energy and consumption needs for some of the most populated regions of the world cuo et al 2014 han et al 2019 ray et al 2015 understanding the likely changes to future streamflow remains critical to water planning and management energy planning as well as the environment given the impact such change could pose to the world over recent decades greenhouse gas emissions have accelerated climate change and increased global temperatures fischer et al 2018 furthermore the tp has been noted to experience rapid warming increase of average temperature at twice the global average temperature rate bai et al 2013 duan and xiao 2015 kuang and jiao 2016 which has depleted snow resources immerzeel et al 2020 wang et al 2016 and hence impacted the water balance despite the vulnerability of snow resources in the tp ground snow observations are not easily accessible in addition in situ data for temperature and precipitation as well as land surface and subsurface characteristics that allow specification of sound hydrologic models are poor due to sparse monitoring networks coupled with an inhospitable terrain the low density of ground based data introduces significant uncertainty in characterising spatial and temporal variability in both climatic and hydrological attributes musa et al 2015 nury et al 2019 while a number of studies have attempted to model streamflow in the region barnett et al 2005 botter et al 2007 cai et al 2017 cuo et al 2013 li et al 2019 li and gao 2015 martinec 1975 schaefli et al 2013 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 they require detailed parameterisation about the surface and subsurface to capture the underlying physics which introduces uncertainty as ground data is limited while an alternative is to use empirical rainfall runoff models for assessing future water availability under changing climate this again is not viable given both process change necessitating a nonstationary empirical model and the limited hydrologic record length available modarres and ouarda 2013 over the past decades degree day or temperature index models were used to overcome data challenges in catchments that include snowpack hock 2003 singh et al 2005 smith and marshall 2010 however such models again are not completely appropriate for climate change impact studies because they do not allow for changes in snow cover one of the first signs of warming such catchments exhibit mark and martyn 2014 a hydrologic model that can cater to the above limitations of data availability complex terrain and of snow cover change is needed global circulation models gcms are widely used for climate projection and serve as inputs for hydrologic simulations of the future jahandideh tehrani et al 2019 mukundan et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 however gcms suffer from both bias and uncertainty owing to limitations in atmospheric process representation spatio temporal resolution and the numerical schemes used eghdamirad et al 2016 nguyen et al 2019 terzago et al 2017 woldemeskel et al 2016 in addition outputs from regional climate models rcms are not readily transferable due to similar uncertainty and bias terzago et al 2017 willkofer et al 2018 rcm biases result from the differences in model parameterisations errors in reference datasets and biases in boundary conditions that are specified from the biased gcm simulations of the future christensen et al 2008 kim et al 2021 kotlarski et al 2014 rocheta et al 2017a rocheta et al 2014 to improve projections from climate models a number of bias correction techniques have been proposed recently such as quantile mapping local intensity scaling quantile scaling and linear scaling dosio and paruolo 2011 jakob themeßl et al 2011 schmidli et al 2006 teutschbein and seibert 2012 one of the flexible bias correction methods designed to better represent features such as drought is the nested bias correction approach nbc developed by johnson and sharma 2012 and used in various applications including gcm uncertainty assessment eghdamirad et al 2017 eghdamirad et al 2016 woldemeskel et al 2016 drought and flood investigations apurv et al 2015 asadi zarch et al 2017 johnson and sharma 2015 woldemeskel et al 2014 as the joint dependence between precipitation and evaporation simulations can exhibit bias which in turn biases the generated streamflow a multivariate nesting bias correction approach mrnbc was proposed by mehrotra and sharma 2015 such multivariate correction along with the improved representation of sustained drought anomalies can improve the simulation of catchment streamflow thereby enabling improved water resources assessments for future climates the present study has multiple objectives firstly a flexible conceptual hydrologic model is used for hydrologic simulation taking into consideration the limitations posed by data scarcity in remote regions then to overcome the weakness of both gcm and rcm simulations a multivariate bias correction technique is employed for correcting distributional and persistence biases across multiple timescales amongst climatic variables and comparisons made against the use of a univariate approach to assess the impact dependence bias has in the overall results finally climate change impacts on hydrologic variables of brahmaputra basin are assessed applying the flexible conceptual hydrologic model the conceptual hydrologic model explicitly models both snow and non snow storage and uses temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet information to simulate snow cover fraction snow water equivalent and streamflow importantly the model allows simulation of change in the snow cover fraction a critical factor for the markedly warmer conditions that will prevail in the future use of the corrected climate model simulations for the future as inputs into this conceptual hydrologic model enables assessment of change in both snow and streamflow attributes for the basins of interest while this study focuses on the brahmaputra basin the assessment reported includes the upper yangtze and yellow river basins which also originate from the tibetan plateau the assessment framework presented here has been created for application to regions having poor ground data coverage and a significant snow cover fraction that is depleting as a result of warming and thus has applicability to many other catchments across the world 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the upper brahmaputra basin is one of the largest populated basins originating from the tp having an elevation of almost 3100 m and surrounded by a large snowpack cai et al 2017 the basin occupies a drainage area of 201202 km2 with an approximate length of 1500 km falling within china the basin has complex topography and a diverse climate with a higher trend of temperature increase than the mean temperature trend for china you et al 2007 conducted a study over the upper brahmaputra basin using data from 1961 to 2005 and observed that the linear trend of warming in this basin is 0 28οc decade the tibetan plateau is the source area for many other rivers in addition to the brahmaputra while the focus of the present study is on the brahmaputra simulation results for the upper yellow and yangtze river basins are also presented the study area with elevations and basin boundaries including those for the yangtze and yellow rivers are depicted in fig 1 2 2 observed and climate modelled datasets daily observed temperature and precipitation datasets were extracted from aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration to wards evaluation of water resources yatagai et al 2012 for 1979 to 2005 a number of previous studies have successfully used aphrodite data for hydrologic assessments apurv et al 2015 burke and stott 2017 sidike et al 2016 observed satellite snow cover fraction modis datasets were obtained from nsidc https nsidc org data mod10cm for the period 2001 to 2010 daily observed snow water equivalent datasets from 1981 to 2010 were collected from the cansise canadian sea ice and snow evolution network

period 1981 1997 and tangnaihai yellow basin for the period 1981 2010 were used in this study the 90 m resolution srtm shuttle radar topographic mission digital elevation model dem data were collected from the website http srtm csi cgiar org for future projections daily temperature and precipitation datasets of four gcms from cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 and three regional climate models rcms from cordex coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment for the current and future climates were obtained this study considered rcp8 5 representative concentration pathway 8 5 scenario for assessing the future climate consistent with several other studies attempting to assess changes in future climate precipitation and flow hettiarachchi et al 2018 peters et al 2013 sillmann et al 2013 spatial resolutions of the observed gcm and rcm datasets are shown in table 1 for convenience all datasets were re gridded to a common resolution of 0 4 0 4 for all stations considering a conservative remapping approach jones 1999 using climate data operator cdo and time frames from 1981 to 2000 historical 2041 to 2060 near future and 2071 to 2090 far future respectively 3 methodology fig 2 presents a flowchart summarising the methodological framework adopted to simulate streamflow over the varying snow cover basin at a coarse monthly temporal resolution this conceptual hydrologic model was calibrated using model forcing data including observed temperature precipitation and pet as well as the observed streamflow then mrnbc was applied to correct systematic biases in modelled gcms and rcms temperature and precipitation for projection into the future finally snow cover fraction snow water equivalent and streamflow were simulated for current climate and the future period to investigate impacts of climate change on hydrologic processes 3 1 hydrologic model this study used a conceptual hydrologic model nury 2020 where a portion of the flow originates from precipitation and snow melt in the snow covered part of the basin whereas the remaining flow results solely from precipitation over the non snow area consequently total flow is the sum of runoff from snow covered and non snow covered areas taking account of evaporative and infiltration losses the model consists of a set of equations for snow storage and non snow storage and uses temperature precipitation and pet to estimate snow cover fraction snow water equivalent and streamflow snow cover fraction is expressed as an empirical function of snow water equivalent swe mm as follows 1 as t e swe t f 0 as t 100 where as t snow cover fraction in percentage at time t e and f coefficients with estimated values of 16 9 and 0 25 respectively it should be noted that the relationship in 1 to estimate the snow cover fraction is derived using modis snow cover estimates and is pre calibrated hence the associated parameters e f are not part of the hydrologic model parameter set detailed below it should also be noted that ground measurements of both swe and as are non existent and any uncertainty in the above relationship will impact the quality of flow simulations that the model generates the performance of modelled monthly snow cover fraction for calibration 2001 2006 and validation periods 2007 2010 are evaluated the modelled snow cover fractions agree considerably with the observed data with a correlation coefficient of 0 90 and nse of 0 82 in the calibration and 0 89 and 0 78 respectively in the validation period snow water equivalent was derived from temperature and precipitation next flow from snow melt and non snow storage were simulated using eqs 2 and 4 2 m t m a x 0 δ t t t 3 sw e t a s t s w e t 1 a s t 1 i t p t m t a s t i t 1 i f t t i t 0 i f t t 4 1 a

storage and m is a parameter representing non linearity following jothityangkoon and sivapalan 2003 the predicted range of k and m are adopted to fall in between 0 1 and 10 and 0 1 1 respectively finally the total flow from snow storage and non snow storage equals 7 q t 1 as t 1 k q t 1 m 1 as t p t as t 1 i t p t m t l t 1 as t 1 k 1 m the thornthwaite 1948 approach was employed to estimate

simulations with rsr 0 70 and nse 0 50 being deemed unsatisfactory calibrated parameters of the hydrologic model are presented in table 2 moreover performance metrics of streamflow using the proposed hydrologic model for the calibration 1981 1992 and validation periods 1993 2000 are shown in table 3 for all hydrologic stations statistical indicators such as correlation coefficients are higher than 0 80 with reasonable nse nash sutcliffe efficiency rsr and mse values as a result one can conclude that the performance of the hydrologic model is reasonable in this data sparse remote region 3 2 bias correction model to assess climate change impact in the proposed framework the mrnbc approach is used to correct systematic bias in gcm and rcm derived temperature and precipitation mrnbc uses a multivariate autoregressive model extended from the nbc framework johnson and sharma 2012 and applied at multiple timescales to correct mean standard deviation lag one autocorrelations lag one and lag zero cross correlations following the observed data across the variables of interest mehrotra and sharma 2015 the mrnbc is formulated on the basis of multivariate autoregressive model 1 mar1 which can be described by eqs 15 and 16 15 y t h c y t 1 h d ε t 16 y t g e y t 1 g f ε t where y represents the vector of modelled variables precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration c lag zero cross correlation coefficient matrix of the observation y t h d lag one cross correlation coefficient matrix for the observation y t h e lag zero cross correlation coefficient of the standardised climate model simulations y t g d lag one cross correlation coefficient of the standardised climate model simulations y t g ε t independent random variates with the zero mean and identity covariance matrix bias corrected data was obtained using the following model 17 y t m g c m y t m 1 g d m f m 1 y t m g d m f m 1 e m y t m 1 g where y t m 1 g corrected time series value from the preceding month m 1 in year t with other notations as described before finally the corrected time series y g is found from the series y g which is rescaled considering observed mean and standard deviation for detailed derivation of matrices c d e and f readers are referred to mehrotra and sharma 2015 following the monthly bias correction the series is aggregated and averaged to formulate seasonal time series and the corrections explained above are re applied now indexing over the four seasons considered finally this time series is aggregated to an annual time scale and the corrections again re applied this procedure ensures systematic biases in persistence and dependence are eliminated not just at monthly but also at longer time scales that are of relevance for water supply applications the final step involves incorporating the corrected series at all time scales to the daily simulations u i m n t g where i represents the day m the month s the season and t the corresponding year and u i m n t g the corresponding bias corrected value srikanthan and pegram 2009 18 u i m n t g y m n t g y m n t g s n t g s n t g a t g a t g u i m n t g here y m n t g s n t g a t g represent the monthly seasonal and annual bias corrected value respectively and y m n t g s n t g a t g represent the aggregated monthly seasonal and annual value the mrnbc model is run in three stages to correct biases firstly in the mean then the standard deviation and lastly the correlations this helps to preserve future climate change signals and ensure optimum results mehrotra et al 2018 for improved performance in bias correction simulations mrnbc is recursed three times to ensure the corrections are spread over all aggregated time scales of interest mehrotra and sharma 2012 it should be noted that while the bias correction is performed at a daily time scale the corrected values are aggregated to a monthly time scale to serve as inputs into the conceptual hydrologic model used 4 results 4 1 bias correction of climatic variables to correct biases of raw gcms and rcms modelled variables we used aphrodite temperature and precipitation datasets as observed data all bias correction results presented in this section are for the nuxia station in the upper brahmaputra basin for convenience all attributes are discussed using the average of gcm results as well as rcm results the mrnbc bias correction model was applied with time nesting at daily monthly seasonal as well as annual timescales and repeated three times using the recursive option to show how multivariate bias correction approach mrnbc preserves interdependencies of precipitation and temperature a univariate bias correction approach quantile mapping themeßl et al 2012 was also used quantile mapping method was applied to number of previous studies for removing bias in climatic variables ashfaq et al 2010 cannon et al 2015 dosio and paruolo 2011 enayati et al 2020 li et al 2010 panjwani et al 2021 average of annual precipitation sums for days during air temperature below or above 0 c in historical period 1981 2000 is presented in fig 3 generally the uncorrected climate model data overestimate the observed data in fig 3 a and b with higher variability however differences are also noticeable between bias correction techniques precipitation falling below air temperature of 0 c was underestimated fig 3a by quantile mapping while precipitation falling above air temperature of 0 c was overestimated this is due to the dependence bias that exists between precipitation and air temperature which a univariate bias correction cannot resolve the multivariate bias correction mrnbc provides better results in the both cases including lesser variability with respect to the observed data fig 4 shows the efficacy of bias correction through seasonal cycles of observed raw and bias corrected gcms as well as rcms derived temperature and precipitation raw temperature and precipitation show significant cold bias and wet bias respectively with respect to observed this is likely a result of different atmospheric physics and numerical schemes in climate models diverse climatic variations and orographic complexity of the study area also influence the outputs of the climate model in addition guo et al 2018 found significant cold bias and wet bias in the temperature and precipitation climatology compared to station observations in the tibetan plateau using climate models datasets however mrnbc leads to remarkable improvements in the raw gcms and rcms derived temperature and precipitation across the different months after correction the raw and observed snow cover fraction is presented in fig 5 the hydrologic model derives biased snow cover fraction when run using raw gcms and rcms derived climatic variables on the other hand performance of snow cover fraction simulation has been significantly improved when the model is run using bias corrected variables seasonal cycles of observed raw and bias corrected data derived streamflow are presented in fig 6 simulated streamflow from raw gcms and rcms derived climate model data includes noticeable bias with respect to observed and forcing data derived streamflow in contrast streamflow derived from bias corrected climatic input agrees with observed flow across the different months to a markedly improved extent following this one can expect that the mrnbc model corrected climatic inputs will improve the simulation of streamflow in the future time period assuming the systematic biases corrected remain dominant into the future to explain the performance of bias correction model in future monthly temperature precipitation and streamflow before and after bias correction was presented in fig 7 generally the temperature data before bias correction in fig 7a have wider variability due to cold bias of the climate models accordingly the uncorrected precipitation and streamflow data have higher variability because of wet bias of the climate models however bias corrected temperature precipitation and streamflow show better results generating lesser variability 4 2 change of temperature and precipitation into the future temperature and precipitation are the most important input variables for the hydrologic simulation of a catchment that includes snow resources how does temperature as well as precipitation change over the historical period and into the future in this basin is illustrated in fig 8 a significant increase in temperature in both near future and far future with respect to the historical period is noticeable in fig 8a and c which will lead to a higher evaporation rate and a lower snowfall in addition the increasing temperature will trigger snowmelt earlier in the future in this region again a decrease in the precipitation during the dry period from november to march in the next year in the future compared to the historical period is noticeable whereas an increase during the wet period april to october is visible with respect to the historical period this pattern of precipitation change has also been noted in a few previous studies focussing on tibet and other regions of the world chou et al 2013 su et al 2016 however annual precipitation both in the near future and far future is higher than the historical period which may be a result of higher local evaporation as well as the convergence of atmospheric flux from lower reaches of the catchment consistent with finds of other studies in the tibetan plateau cuo and zhang 2017 guo et al 2018 wijngaard et al 2017 4 3 snow cover fraction and streamflow in the future to investigate changes in snow cover fraction into the future monthly snow cover fraction in the historical period near future and far future is presented in fig 9 this attribute is obtained from the climate model derived swe using eq 1 the snow cover fraction is decreasing in both near future and far future with respect to the historical period a possible reason for this could be the increase in temperature which leads to more rainfall than snowfall along with greater rates of melt wang et al 2016 streamflow in the historical period and the future is shown in fig 10 a decrease in streamflow both in the near future as well as far future in the dry period november to march in the next year is detectable which will be the result of increasing temperature and the precipitation change discussed in the previous section this is consistent with fang et al 2019 who also found that flow in dry season is decreasing due to increasing temperature and evapotranspiration in the upper colorado basin however a significant increase in the streamflow is noticeable in the wet period april to september which is the result of the precipitation change in this period discussed in the fig 8 the decrease of streamflow in the dry period will impact water supply agriculture and hydropower for this region moreover annual precipitation at the nuxia station and surrounding basins are presented in table 4 annual precipitation of nuxia and other stations in the future is projected to be higher than historical period which consequently results in the higher annual streamflow 5 discussion considering the importance of the brahmaputra basin for fresh water supply to a vast downstream population and the impact climate change has on the catchments as well as the downstream population this study proposed a framework for climate change impact assessment taking account the limitations associated with conducting such a study we used a simple conceptual hydrologic model allowing minimal data requirement because the tibetan plateau is a gauge sparse region gridded climatic datasets and satellite snow products were used in this study as ground observed data are not available and restrictive data sharing policies exist which limit us from modelling at high resolutions however gridded climatic datasets include uncertainties arising from data interpolation approaches slater et al 2013 which must be factored in before arriving at any conclusions from the study in addition satellite snow products include uncertainties due to clouds limitation of sensor observations and the algorithms that produce the snow estimates from the observations basang et al 2017 li et al 2018 while these data challenges motivated us to formulate a simple conceptual model and a detailed physically based model is not possible to implement in such data scarce region a discussion is required to appreciate the limitations of the proposed framework for the simplifying assumptions some of these issues are discussed in the sub sections below 5 1 use of climate model derived temperature and precipitation increasing population growth rapid changes in climate altered land use and other anthropogenic factors increase the risk of change in hydrologic process which creates additional pressure on the water supply systems the only way of quantifying this change in the future is to use the outputs of climate models for different scenarios the climate models underestimate the observed temperature significantly in the winter in the tibetan plateau which is referred to as a cold bias in the existing literature su et al 2013 terzago et al 2014 on the contrary precipitation is overestimated in the tibetan plateau which is mentioned as a wet bias the existing literature guo et al 2018 terzago et al 2014 such biases might be a result of allowing comparatively smooth topography in the climate models rather than the real orographic complexity of tibet to overcome uncertainties and biases in the climate models a bias correction procedure was used however any bias correction makes an assumption of stationary bias cannon et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2012 li et al 2010 willkofer et al 2018 which implies that model biases in the future will follow the similar patterns as those in the current climate mehrotra et al 2018 this underlying assumption can affect the results in both the near future and far future although the use of multiple climate model simulations limits the risk of making significant and unnoticed errors in projections 5 2 climate model uncertainty and performance uncertainty of gcms results from errors in the model structure initial conditions and scenarios eghdamirad et al 2016 kim et al 2020 woldemeskel et al 2012 woldemeskel et al 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 in addition while rcms are used for downscaling gcms output in the catchment scale these models also show uncertainty due to errors in the input data discrepancies in the boundary condition and model parameterisations rocheta et al 2017b sánchez et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 in this study climate models exhibit uncertainty in the historical and future period before bias correction due to aforementioned reasons the mrnbc method leads to significant improvement of uncertainty and resulting biases which is presented in the figs 3 7 5 3 derivation of snow cover fraction we used an empirical relationship for the estimation of snow cover fraction from snow water equivalent snow water equivalent data from the climate model gcms and rcms includes uncertainties while bias correction of swe leads to improved snow cover fraction simulation a further refinement of the model will yield better snow cover fraction simulations note gcm and rcm derived swe was bias corrected separately because swe represents accumulated values which are different from temperature and precipitation simulation 5 4 use of dynamic snow cover fraction in the hydrologic model we used a dynamic snow cover fraction representation to describe the change of snow and surface water runoff in the future which represents a key difference to the earlier studies on the topic hock 2003 immerzeel et al 2010 kult et al 2014 mark and martyn 2014 siderius et al 2013 singh et al 2009 şorman et al 2019 these studies assume either complete snow cover or no change in snow cover with time although snowmelt runoff processes in frozen ground and precipitation runoff process in snow free conditions under warming climate are different harpold 2018 in addition snow covered areas with thicker snow have lesser permeability which consequently yield greater runoff than for snow free conditions zhao et al 2019 the proposed framework considers snow cover to change and snowmelt to occur or the snowpack expands due to new precipitation snow our proposed approach assists in the proper representation of snow cover alteration under a changing climate and its impact in simulation of future streamflow however given the coarse spatial and temporal resolution adopted as a result of the significant data limitations posed in the study the hydrologic model assumes evaporation and other losses are occurring across the entire catchment it should be noted that the nature of loss is not the same for snow covered ground as compared to non snow covered ground in the catchment with the latter having greater infiltration and the former having sublimation this assumption will have an impact on future hydrologic projections and needs to be addressed by further work including specifying possibly a loss function in the model that is dependent on snow as well as temperature 5 5 consideration of non linear storage routing to approximate the runoff process owing to the lack of data the hydrologic model in the proposed framework simplified the streamflow generation process considering snow and non snow storage for this complex catchment and the surrounding basins given a clear nonlinearity in the system because of the dynamic contribution of snowmelt and surface water runoff the model adopts a non linear storage routing formulation this formulation is specified at a monthly time step instead of its use in modelling flood extremes at a daily or sub daily time step the choice of nonlinear versus linear routing was made based both on the dynamic nature of the flow generation process which one would expect to be less consistent with a linear storage formulation as well as the assessment of model performance using linear and nonlinear formulations results not included but illustrated a clear differentiation in the two approaches the specification and calibration of the model using monthly data is another key limitation in representing the underlying physics and is a result of the lack of finer resolutions datasets it should be noted that while the modelled climate data here can be at finer temporal resolutions the bias correction is implemented at a daily time step the observed data which forms the basis for model specification is monthly future work with lower temporal resolution is needed for comprehensively understanding the runoff process and its change under a warming climate this is especially of importance for assessing changes in extremes as both storm extremes and flood extremes are expected to change into the future sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 5 6 evaluation of glacier melt simulation in addition to the model structure presented earlier an assessment of the impact glacial melt made on simulations was also performed the present study modelled glacier melt assuming a constant glacier area with time which is consistent with a number of previous studies in data sparse regions follum et al 2019 hock 2003 koppes et al 2015 singh and kumar 1996 singh et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 these studies applied a degree day approach for glacier melt induced runoff simulation the mass balance process using glacier area and melt is discussed in appendix a glacier area for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin is 3 9 0 11 and 0 95 respectively khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 glacier runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin is 12 0 7 and 7 respectively of total runoff which supports the results of zhang et al 2013 glacier runoff is 11 6 0 8 and 6 5 of total runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze respectively moreover glacier runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin in near future 2041 2060 is 16 2 8 and 10 as well as in far future 2071 2090 is 18 5 4 and 12 2 respectively of total runoff which might be due to the ongoing global warming and precipitation change in the study region owing to the lack of data on glacier dynamics and restrictive data sharing policies explicit glacial melt component cannot be verified using ground observations in addition snowmelt induced runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin equals 24 22 8 and 23 respectively of total runoff which supports the findings of zhang et al 2013 snowmelt induced runoff is 23 22 4 and 22 2 of total runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze respectively snowmelt induced runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin in near future 2041 2060 is 29 26 2 and 28 8 as well as in far future 2071 2090 is 33 28 4 and 31 2 respectively which could be due to the increasing warming and change of precipitation in this region 5 7 implications for reservoir storage application of the proposed framework in the context of reservoir storage estimation accounting for climate change impact can aid in water planning for the region turner and galelli 2016 to perform such an assessment use is made of a recently published framework nguyen et al 2020 where catchment storage is estimated by placing a hypothetical reservoir downstream of a catchment with a capacity or size that ensures 90 reliability in supply for a demand kept equal to 75 of the flow the behaviour diagram representing the change in storage over the historical period 1981 2000 near future 2041 2060 and far future 2071 2090 is shown in fig 11 as noted before the storage capacity of this hypothetical reservoir is one that results in 10 failure or 90 reliability for the observed record failures are noted to occur in 24 months and water spilled 48 times during the historical period reliability for meeting target demand in the near future and far future is lower compared to the historical period at nuxia which will be a result of the reduced precipitation and streamflow in the dry periods such decrease will have an impact on agriculture during the dry periods in addition the number of times water is spilled as well as the volume of spilled water is higher in the future compared to the historical period which will be a result of increasing precipitation and subsequently streamflow in the wet season while the above result is specific to the storage considered here it is indicative of the redistribution of water as a function of season a factors that requires consideration in order to maintain water and energy security to the significant populations that depend on the basin additionally while the above results pertain to the brahmaputra alone they are indicative of change across the entire tibetan plateau the home to some of the largest rivers in the world 6 conclusions adequately understanding the likely changes in snow resources and its impact on water resources systems in the future can allow society to plan and manage water resources to minimise the impacts of shortfalls or surpluses how snow resources may affect streamflow in the future due to climate change is a question of interest to many sectors and especially to communities in water stressed regions answering this question is difficult without assessing and correcting biases in climate model projections and projecting these corrected simulations of the future using a defensible modelling approach to ascertain change in water availability previous hydrologic change assessments in snow covered regions have focused on the future change in snow resources without explicitly considering biases in the climate modelled snowpack attributes and therefore in streamflow simulations in this research we have proposed a comprehensive framework to assess the change in streamflow owing to change in snow resources for the climate sensitive upper brahmaputra basin and surrounding areas the approach was specially formulated to consider poor data availability as well as the need for bias correction of projected snow climatology a multivariate bias correction approach mrnbc was applied for correcting systematic biases and uncertainty of the climate models mrnbc was also compared with a univariate bias correction approach quantile mapping to show interdependencies of precipitation and temperature before and after bias correction improved results for climate modelled temperature precipitation and snow water equivalent have been obtained after using the multivariate bias correction approach adopted then the framework is used for future projections to explore the impact of climate change in the snow resources and subsequently streamflow the results showed that monthly snow cover fraction will decline in both near and far future with respect to the historical period moreover the future annual streamflow will increase due to the increase in precipitation under a warming climate a decrease in precipitation in the dry seasons coupled with an increase at an annual scale creates complexity in water management for the region it is shown that typical water supply reservoirs will incur a greater frequency of spill in wet seasons as well as a reduced reliability of supply in spite of the overall increase in flow that is expected overall the proposed framework is flexible for use in a data sparse region and depends mostly on the precipitation and temperature information the outcome of this study will assist in proper understanding of the variability and changes in snow resources and streamflow in the upper brahmaputra basin where use of existing more complex hydrologic models is difficult due to the thin gauge network as well as restrictive data sharing policies additionally we emphases that while our study uses the brahmaputra as a case study for demonstrating the model development and climate change simulation that is presented the approach adopted is location in specific and would be of considerable use in other regions where snow cover is changing as a result of rising global temperatures 7 data availability statement datasets used in this study are available from the following open sources a observed

4060,modelling the impact of climate change on streamflow for remote or data sparse regions is a challenge for hydrologists as large datasets are often needed to adequately characterise the processes that dominate the tibetan plateau which forms the headwaters of the brahmaputra and many other major rivers in the indo china region is not closely monitored due to its harsh environment this lack of monitoring is significant as regards its substantial snow resources of considerable importance given the influence these have on the supply of water to downstream communities this research uses a conceptual hydrologic model developed to simulate the impact of the changing climate in such large snow covered data sparse catchments to adequately understand the likely changes in future water availability in the highly populated brahmaputra basin and surrounding areas in the tibetan plateau a multivariate nested recursive bias correction mrnbc approach is used for correcting systematic biases present in the climate model simulations of temperature and precipitation jointly across multiple timescales preserving the dynamic relationships amongst the variables the results disclose that monthly snow cover fraction in the near future 2041 2060 and far future 2071 2090 will decrease significantly with respect to the historical period 1981 2000 while the annual streamflow is noted to be increasing for the basin water supply reliability exhibits a reduction partly as a result of the increased spill volume arising from greater snowmelt concentrated over the wet period and partly the increase in evaporation losses due to higher temperatures while the above results pertain to the brahmaputra basin similar changes are expected for the other major rivers that originate in the tibetan plateau keywords precipitation snow cover climate change bias correction streamflow 1 introduction any change in evapotranspiration precipitation infiltration or snow melt impacts the streamflow generated from a catchment and hence its use in water supply irrigation or flood control liu et al 2017 su et al 2020 rapid changes in the climate coupled with anthropogenic change due to land use change or population growth is impacting such land atmosphere processes and in turn streamflow immerzeel et al 2020 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the snowpack of the tibetan plateau tp has an important role in the water cycle for prominent asian basins including the brahmaputra yellow and yangtze bai et al 2016 cai et al 2017 pritchard 2017 these rivers serve as prominent sources of fresh water supply and satisfy agricultural energy and consumption needs for some of the most populated regions of the world cuo et al 2014 han et al 2019 ray et al 2015 understanding the likely changes to future streamflow remains critical to water planning and management energy planning as well as the environment given the impact such change could pose to the world over recent decades greenhouse gas emissions have accelerated climate change and increased global temperatures fischer et al 2018 furthermore the tp has been noted to experience rapid warming increase of average temperature at twice the global average temperature rate bai et al 2013 duan and xiao 2015 kuang and jiao 2016 which has depleted snow resources immerzeel et al 2020 wang et al 2016 and hence impacted the water balance despite the vulnerability of snow resources in the tp ground snow observations are not easily accessible in addition in situ data for temperature and precipitation as well as land surface and subsurface characteristics that allow specification of sound hydrologic models are poor due to sparse monitoring networks coupled with an inhospitable terrain the low density of ground based data introduces significant uncertainty in characterising spatial and temporal variability in both climatic and hydrological attributes musa et al 2015 nury et al 2019 while a number of studies have attempted to model streamflow in the region barnett et al 2005 botter et al 2007 cai et al 2017 cuo et al 2013 li et al 2019 li and gao 2015 martinec 1975 schaefli et al 2013 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 they require detailed parameterisation about the surface and subsurface to capture the underlying physics which introduces uncertainty as ground data is limited while an alternative is to use empirical rainfall runoff models for assessing future water availability under changing climate this again is not viable given both process change necessitating a nonstationary empirical model and the limited hydrologic record length available modarres and ouarda 2013 over the past decades degree day or temperature index models were used to overcome data challenges in catchments that include snowpack hock 2003 singh et al 2005 smith and marshall 2010 however such models again are not completely appropriate for climate change impact studies because they do not allow for changes in snow cover one of the first signs of warming such catchments exhibit mark and martyn 2014 a hydrologic model that can cater to the above limitations of data availability complex terrain and of snow cover change is needed global circulation models gcms are widely used for climate projection and serve as inputs for hydrologic simulations of the future jahandideh tehrani et al 2019 mukundan et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 however gcms suffer from both bias and uncertainty owing to limitations in atmospheric process representation spatio temporal resolution and the numerical schemes used eghdamirad et al 2016 nguyen et al 2019 terzago et al 2017 woldemeskel et al 2016 in addition outputs from regional climate models rcms are not readily transferable due to similar uncertainty and bias terzago et al 2017 willkofer et al 2018 rcm biases result from the differences in model parameterisations errors in reference datasets and biases in boundary conditions that are specified from the biased gcm simulations of the future christensen et al 2008 kim et al 2021 kotlarski et al 2014 rocheta et al 2017a rocheta et al 2014 to improve projections from climate models a number of bias correction techniques have been proposed recently such as quantile mapping local intensity scaling quantile scaling and linear scaling dosio and paruolo 2011 jakob themeßl et al 2011 schmidli et al 2006 teutschbein and seibert 2012 one of the flexible bias correction methods designed to better represent features such as drought is the nested bias correction approach nbc developed by johnson and sharma 2012 and used in various applications including gcm uncertainty assessment eghdamirad et al 2017 eghdamirad et al 2016 woldemeskel et al 2016 drought and flood investigations apurv et al 2015 asadi zarch et al 2017 johnson and sharma 2015 woldemeskel et al 2014 as the joint dependence between precipitation and evaporation simulations can exhibit bias which in turn biases the generated streamflow a multivariate nesting bias correction approach mrnbc was proposed by mehrotra and sharma 2015 such multivariate correction along with the improved representation of sustained drought anomalies can improve the simulation of catchment streamflow thereby enabling improved water resources assessments for future climates the present study has multiple objectives firstly a flexible conceptual hydrologic model is used for hydrologic simulation taking into consideration the limitations posed by data scarcity in remote regions then to overcome the weakness of both gcm and rcm simulations a multivariate bias correction technique is employed for correcting distributional and persistence biases across multiple timescales amongst climatic variables and comparisons made against the use of a univariate approach to assess the impact dependence bias has in the overall results finally climate change impacts on hydrologic variables of brahmaputra basin are assessed applying the flexible conceptual hydrologic model the conceptual hydrologic model explicitly models both snow and non snow storage and uses temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet information to simulate snow cover fraction snow water equivalent and streamflow importantly the model allows simulation of change in the snow cover fraction a critical factor for the markedly warmer conditions that will prevail in the future use of the corrected climate model simulations for the future as inputs into this conceptual hydrologic model enables assessment of change in both snow and streamflow attributes for the basins of interest while this study focuses on the brahmaputra basin the assessment reported includes the upper yangtze and yellow river basins which also originate from the tibetan plateau the assessment framework presented here has been created for application to regions having poor ground data coverage and a significant snow cover fraction that is depleting as a result of warming and thus has applicability to many other catchments across the world 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area the upper brahmaputra basin is one of the largest populated basins originating from the tp having an elevation of almost 3100 m and surrounded by a large snowpack cai et al 2017 the basin occupies a drainage area of 201202 km2 with an approximate length of 1500 km falling within china the basin has complex topography and a diverse climate with a higher trend of temperature increase than the mean temperature trend for china you et al 2007 conducted a study over the upper brahmaputra basin using data from 1961 to 2005 and observed that the linear trend of warming in this basin is 0 28οc decade the tibetan plateau is the source area for many other rivers in addition to the brahmaputra while the focus of the present study is on the brahmaputra simulation results for the upper yellow and yangtze river basins are also presented the study area with elevations and basin boundaries including those for the yangtze and yellow rivers are depicted in fig 1 2 2 observed and climate modelled datasets daily observed temperature and precipitation datasets

sillmann et al 2013 spatial resolutions of the observed gcm and rcm datasets are shown in table 1 for convenience all datasets were re gridded to a common resolution of 0 4 0 4 for all stations considering a conservative remapping approach jones 1999 using climate data operator cdo and time frames from 1981 to 2000 historical 2041 to 2060 near future and 2071 to 2090 far future respectively 3 methodology fig 2 presents a flowchart summarising the methodological framework adopted to simulate streamflow over the varying snow cover basin at a coarse monthly temporal resolution this conceptual hydrologic model was calibrated using model forcing data including observed temperature precipitation and pet as well as the observed streamflow then mrnbc was applied to correct systematic biases in modelled gcms and rcms temperature and precipitation for projection into the future finally snow cover fraction snow water equivalent and streamflow were simulated for current climate and the future period to investigate impacts of climate change on hydrologic processes 3 1 hydrologic model this study used a conceptual hydrologic model nury 2020 where a portion of the flow originates from precipitation and snow melt in the snow covered part of the basin whereas the remaining flow results solely from precipitation over the non snow area consequently total flow is the sum of runoff from snow covered and non snow covered areas taking account of evaporative and infiltration losses the model consists of a set of equations for snow storage and non snow storage and uses temperature precipitation and pet to estimate snow cover fraction snow water equivalent and streamflow snow cover fraction is expressed as an empirical function of snow water equivalent swe mm as follows 1 as t e swe t f 0 as t 100 where as t snow cover fraction in percentage at time t e and f coefficients with estimated values of 16 9 and 0 25 respectively it should be noted that the relationship in 1 to estimate the snow cover fraction is derived using modis snow cover estimates and is pre calibrated hence the associated parameters e f are not part of the hydrologic model parameter set detailed below it should also be noted that ground measurements of both swe and as are non existent and any uncertainty in the above relationship will impact the quality of flow simulations that the model generates the performance of modelled monthly snow cover fraction for calibration 2001 2006 and validation periods 2007 2010 are evaluated the modelled snow cover fractions agree considerably with the observed data with a correlation coefficient of 0 90 and nse of 0 82 in the calibration and 0 89 and 0 78 respectively in the validation period snow water equivalent was derived from temperature and precipitation next flow from snow melt and non snow storage were simulated using eqs 2 and 4 2 m t m a x 0 δ t t t 3 sw e t a s t s w e t 1 a s t 1 i t p t m t a s t i t 1 i f t t i t 0 i f t t 4 1 a

storage and m is a parameter representing non linearity following jothityangkoon and sivapalan 2003 the predicted range of k and m are adopted to fall in between 0 1 and 10 and 0 1 1 respectively

simulations with rsr 0 70 and nse 0 50 being deemed unsatisfactory calibrated parameters of the hydrologic model are presented in table 2 moreover performance metrics of streamflow using the proposed hydrologic model for the calibration 1981 1992 and validation periods 1993 2000 are shown in table 3 for all hydrologic stations statistical indicators such as correlation coefficients are higher than 0 80 with reasonable nse nash sutcliffe efficiency rsr and mse values as a result one can conclude that the performance of the hydrologic model is reasonable in this data sparse remote region 3 2 bias correction model to assess climate change impact in the proposed framework the mrnbc approach is used to correct systematic bias in gcm and rcm derived temperature and precipitation mrnbc uses a multivariate autoregressive model extended from the nbc framework johnson and sharma 2012 and applied at multiple timescales to correct mean standard deviation lag one autocorrelations lag one and lag zero cross correlations following the observed data across the variables of interest mehrotra and sharma 2015 the mrnbc is formulated on the basis of multivariate autoregressive model 1 mar1 which can be described by eqs 15 and 16 15 y t h c y t 1 h d ε t 16 y t g e y t 1 g f ε t where y represents the vector of modelled variables precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration c lag zero cross correlation coefficient matrix of the observation y t h d lag one cross correlation coefficient matrix for the observation y t h e lag zero cross correlation coefficient of the standardised climate model simulations y t g d lag one cross correlation coefficient of the standardised climate model simulations y t g ε t independent random variates with the zero mean and identity covariance matrix bias corrected data was obtained using the following model 17 y t m g c m y t m 1 g d m f m 1 y t m g d m f m 1 e m y t m 1 g where y t m 1 g corrected time series value from the preceding month m 1 in year t with other notations as described before finally the corrected time series y g is found from the series y g which is rescaled considering observed mean and standard deviation for detailed derivation of matrices c d e and f readers are referred to mehrotra and sharma 2015 following the monthly bias correction the series is aggregated and averaged to formulate seasonal time series and the corrections explained above are re applied now indexing over the four seasons considered finally this time series is aggregated to an annual time scale and the corrections again re applied this procedure ensures systematic biases in persistence and dependence are eliminated not just at monthly but also at longer time scales that are of relevance for water supply applications the final step involves incorporating the corrected series at all time scales to the daily simulations u i m n t g where i represents the day m the month s the season and t the corresponding year and u i m n t g the corresponding bias corrected value srikanthan and pegram 2009 18 u i m n t g y m n t g y m n t g s n t g s n t g a t g a t g u i m n t g here y m n t g s n t g a t g represent the monthly seasonal and annual bias corrected value respectively and y m n t g s n t g a t g represent the aggregated monthly seasonal and annual value the mrnbc model is run in three stages to correct biases firstly in the mean then the standard deviation and lastly the correlations this helps to preserve future climate change signals and ensure optimum results mehrotra et al 2018 for improved performance in bias correction simulations mrnbc is recursed three times to ensure the corrections are spread over all aggregated time scales of interest mehrotra and sharma 2012 it should be noted that while the bias correction is performed at a daily time scale the corrected values are aggregated to a monthly time scale to serve as inputs into the conceptual hydrologic model used 4 results 4 1 bias correction of climatic variables to correct biases of raw gcms and rcms modelled variables we used aphrodite temperature and precipitation datasets as observed data all bias correction results presented in this section are for the nuxia station in the upper brahmaputra basin for convenience all attributes are discussed using the average of gcm results as well as rcm results the mrnbc bias correction model was applied with time nesting at daily monthly seasonal as well as annual timescales and repeated three times using the recursive option to show how multivariate bias correction approach mrnbc preserves interdependencies of precipitation and temperature a univariate bias correction approach quantile mapping themeßl et al 2012 was also used quantile mapping method was applied to number of previous studies for removing bias in climatic variables ashfaq et al 2010 cannon et al 2015 dosio and paruolo 2011 enayati et al 2020 li et al 2010 panjwani et al 2021 average of annual precipitation sums for days during air temperature below or above 0 c in historical period 1981 2000 is presented in fig 3 generally the uncorrected climate model data overestimate the observed data in fig 3 a and b with higher variability however differences are also noticeable between bias correction techniques precipitation falling below air temperature of 0 c was underestimated fig 3a by quantile mapping while precipitation falling above air temperature of 0 c was overestimated this is due to the dependence bias that exists between precipitation and air temperature which a univariate bias correction cannot resolve the multivariate bias correction mrnbc provides better results in the both cases including lesser variability with respect to the observed data fig 4 shows the efficacy of bias correction through seasonal cycles of observed raw and bias corrected gcms as well as rcms derived temperature and precipitation raw temperature and precipitation show significant cold bias and wet bias respectively with respect to observed this is likely a result of different atmospheric physics and numerical schemes in climate models diverse climatic variations and orographic complexity of the study area also influence the outputs of the climate model in addition guo et al 2018 found significant cold bias and wet bias in the temperature and precipitation climatology compared to station observations in the tibetan plateau using climate models datasets however mrnbc leads to remarkable improvements in the raw gcms and rcms derived temperature and precipitation across the different months after correction the raw and observed snow cover fraction is presented in fig 5 the hydrologic model derives biased snow cover fraction when run using raw gcms and rcms derived climatic variables on the other hand performance of snow cover fraction simulation has been significantly improved when the model is run using bias corrected variables seasonal cycles of observed raw and bias corrected data derived streamflow are presented in fig 6 simulated streamflow from raw gcms and rcms derived climate model data includes noticeable bias with respect to observed and forcing data derived streamflow in contrast streamflow derived from bias corrected climatic input agrees with observed flow across the different months to a markedly improved extent following this one can expect that the mrnbc model corrected climatic inputs will improve the simulation of streamflow in the future time period assuming the systematic biases corrected remain dominant into the future to explain the performance of bias correction model in future monthly temperature precipitation and streamflow before and after bias correction was presented in fig 7 generally the temperature data before bias correction in fig 7a have wider variability due to cold bias of the climate models accordingly the uncorrected precipitation and streamflow data have higher variability because of wet bias of the climate models however bias corrected temperature precipitation and streamflow show better results generating lesser variability 4 2 change of temperature and precipitation into the future temperature and precipitation are the most important input variables for the hydrologic simulation of a catchment that includes snow resources how does temperature as well as precipitation change over the historical period and into the future in this basin is illustrated in fig 8 a significant increase in temperature in both near future and far future with respect to the historical period is noticeable in fig 8a and c which will lead to a higher evaporation rate and a lower snowfall in addition the increasing temperature will trigger snowmelt earlier in the future in this region again a decrease in the precipitation during the dry period from november to march in the next year in the future compared to the historical period is noticeable whereas an increase during the wet period april to october is visible with respect to the historical period this pattern of precipitation change has also been noted in a few previous studies focussing on tibet and other regions of the world chou et al 2013 su et al 2016 however annual precipitation both in the near future and far future is higher than the historical period which may be a result of higher local evaporation as well as the convergence of atmospheric flux from lower reaches of the catchment consistent with finds of other studies in the tibetan plateau cuo and zhang 2017 guo et al 2018 wijngaard et al 2017 4 3 snow cover fraction and streamflow in the future to investigate changes in snow cover fraction into the future monthly snow cover fraction in the historical period near future and far future is presented in fig 9 this attribute is obtained from the climate model derived swe using eq 1 the snow cover fraction is decreasing in both near future and far future with respect to the historical period a possible reason for this could be the increase in temperature which leads to more rainfall than snowfall along with greater rates of melt wang et al 2016 streamflow in the historical period and the future is shown in fig 10 a decrease in streamflow both in the near future as well as far future in the dry period november to march in the next year is detectable which will be the result of increasing temperature and the precipitation change discussed in the previous section this is consistent with fang et al 2019 who also found that flow in dry season is decreasing due to increasing temperature and evapotranspiration in the upper colorado basin however a significant increase in the streamflow is noticeable in the wet period april to september which is the result of the precipitation change in this period discussed in the fig 8 the decrease of streamflow in the dry period will impact water supply agriculture and hydropower for this region moreover annual precipitation at the nuxia station and surrounding basins are presented in table 4 annual precipitation of nuxia and other stations in the future is projected to be higher than historical period which consequently results in the higher annual streamflow 5 discussion considering the importance of the brahmaputra basin for fresh water supply to a vast downstream population and the impact climate change has on the catchments as well as the downstream population this study proposed a framework for climate change impact assessment taking account the limitations associated with conducting such a study we used a simple conceptual hydrologic model allowing minimal data requirement because the tibetan plateau is a gauge sparse region gridded climatic datasets and satellite snow products were used in this study as ground observed data are not available and restrictive data sharing policies exist which limit us from modelling at high resolutions however gridded climatic datasets include uncertainties arising from data interpolation approaches slater et al 2013 which must be factored in before arriving at any conclusions from the study in addition satellite snow products include uncertainties due to clouds limitation of sensor observations and the algorithms that produce the snow estimates from the observations basang et al 2017 li et al 2018 while these data challenges motivated us to formulate a simple conceptual model and a detailed physically based model is not possible to implement in such data scarce region a discussion is required to appreciate the limitations of the proposed framework for the simplifying assumptions some of these issues are discussed in the sub sections below 5 1 use of climate model derived temperature and precipitation increasing population growth rapid changes in climate altered land use and other anthropogenic factors increase the risk of change in hydrologic process which creates additional pressure on the water supply systems the only way of quantifying this change in the future is to use the outputs of climate models for different scenarios the climate models underestimate the observed temperature significantly in the winter in the tibetan plateau which is referred to as a cold bias in the existing literature su et al 2013 terzago et al 2014 on the contrary precipitation is overestimated in the tibetan plateau which is mentioned as a wet bias the existing literature guo et al 2018 terzago et al 2014 such biases might be a result of allowing comparatively smooth topography in the climate models rather than the real orographic complexity of tibet to overcome uncertainties and biases in the climate models a bias correction procedure was used however any bias correction makes an assumption of stationary bias cannon et al 2015 johnson and sharma 2012 li et al 2010 willkofer et al 2018 which implies that model biases in the future will follow the similar patterns as those in the current climate mehrotra et al 2018 this underlying assumption can affect the results in both the near future and far future although the use of multiple climate model simulations limits the risk of making significant and unnoticed errors in projections 5 2 climate model uncertainty and performance uncertainty of gcms results from errors in the model structure initial conditions and scenarios eghdamirad et al 2016 kim et al 2020 woldemeskel et al 2012 woldemeskel et al 2014 woldemeskel et al 2016 in addition while rcms are used for downscaling gcms output in the catchment scale these models also show uncertainty due to errors in the input data discrepancies in the boundary condition and model parameterisations rocheta et al 2017b sánchez et al 2015 teutschbein and seibert 2012 in this study climate models exhibit uncertainty in the historical and future period before bias correction due to aforementioned reasons the mrnbc method leads to significant improvement of uncertainty and resulting biases which is presented in the figs 3 7 5 3 derivation of snow cover fraction we used an empirical relationship for the estimation of snow cover fraction from snow water equivalent snow water equivalent data from the climate model gcms and rcms includes uncertainties while bias correction of swe leads to improved snow cover fraction simulation a further refinement of the model will yield better snow cover fraction simulations note gcm and rcm derived swe was bias corrected separately because swe represents accumulated values which are different from temperature and precipitation simulation 5 4 use of dynamic snow cover fraction in the hydrologic model we used a dynamic snow cover fraction representation to describe the change of snow and surface water runoff in the future which represents a key difference to the earlier studies on the topic hock 2003 immerzeel et al 2010 kult et al 2014 mark and martyn 2014 siderius et al 2013 singh et al 2009 şorman et al 2019 these studies assume either complete snow cover or no change in snow cover with time although snowmelt runoff processes in frozen ground and precipitation runoff process in snow free conditions under warming climate are different harpold 2018 in addition snow covered areas with thicker snow have lesser permeability which consequently yield greater runoff than for snow free conditions zhao et al 2019 the proposed framework considers snow cover to change and snowmelt to occur or the snowpack expands due to new precipitation snow our proposed approach assists in the proper representation of snow cover alteration under a changing climate and its impact in simulation of future streamflow however given the coarse spatial and temporal resolution adopted as a result of the significant data limitations posed in the study the hydrologic model assumes evaporation and other losses are occurring across the entire catchment it should be noted that the nature of loss is not the same for snow covered ground as compared to non snow covered ground in the catchment with the latter having greater infiltration and the former having sublimation this assumption will have an impact on future hydrologic projections and needs to be addressed by further work including specifying possibly a loss function in the model that is dependent on snow as well as temperature 5 5 consideration of non linear storage routing to approximate the runoff process owing to the lack of data the hydrologic model in the proposed framework simplified the streamflow generation process considering snow and non snow storage for this complex catchment and the surrounding basins given a clear nonlinearity in the system because of the dynamic contribution of snowmelt and surface water runoff the model adopts a non linear storage routing formulation this formulation is specified at a monthly time step instead of its use in modelling flood extremes at a daily or sub daily time step the choice of nonlinear versus linear routing was made based both on the dynamic nature of the flow generation process which one would expect to be less consistent with a linear storage formulation as well as the assessment of model performance using linear and nonlinear formulations results not included but illustrated a clear differentiation in the two approaches the specification and calibration of the model using monthly data is another key limitation in representing the underlying physics and is a result of the lack of finer resolutions datasets it should be noted that while the modelled climate data here can be at finer temporal resolutions the bias correction is implemented at a daily time step the observed data which forms the basis for model specification is monthly future work with lower temporal resolution is needed for comprehensively understanding the runoff process and its change under a warming climate this is especially of importance for assessing changes in extremes as both storm extremes and flood extremes are expected to change into the future sharma et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 5 6 evaluation of glacier melt simulation in addition to the model structure presented earlier an assessment of the impact glacial melt made on simulations was also performed the present study modelled glacier melt assuming a constant glacier area with time which is consistent with a number of previous studies in data sparse regions follum et al 2019 hock 2003 koppes et al 2015 singh and kumar 1996 singh et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 these studies applied a degree day approach for glacier melt induced runoff simulation the mass balance process using glacier area and melt is discussed in appendix a glacier area for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin is 3 9 0 11 and 0 95 respectively khan et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 glacier runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin is 12 0 7 and 7 respectively of total runoff which supports the results of zhang et al 2013 glacier runoff is 11 6 0 8 and 6 5 of total runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze respectively moreover glacier runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin in near future 2041 2060 is 16 2 8 and 10 as well as in far future 2071 2090 is 18 5 4 and 12 2 respectively of total runoff which might be due to the ongoing global warming and precipitation change in the study region owing to the lack of data on glacier dynamics and restrictive data sharing policies explicit glacial melt component cannot be verified using ground observations in addition snowmelt induced runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin equals 24 22 8 and 23 respectively of total runoff which supports the findings of zhang et al 2013 snowmelt induced runoff is 23 22 4 and 22 2 of total runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze respectively snowmelt induced runoff for upper brahmaputra yellow and yangtze basin in near future 2041 2060 is 29 26 2 and 28 8 as well as in far future 2071 2090 is 33 28 4 and 31 2 respectively which could be due to the increasing warming and change of precipitation in this region 5 7 implications for reservoir storage application of the proposed framework in the context of reservoir storage estimation accounting for climate change impact can aid in water planning for the region turner and galelli 2016 to perform such an assessment use is made of a recently published framework nguyen et al 2020 where catchment storage is estimated by placing a hypothetical reservoir downstream of a catchment with a capacity or size that ensures 90 reliability in supply for a demand kept equal to 75 of the flow the behaviour diagram representing the change in storage over the historical period 1981 2000 near future 2041 2060 and far future 2071 2090 is shown in fig 11 as noted before the storage capacity of this hypothetical reservoir is one that results in 10 failure or 90 reliability for the observed record failures are noted to occur in 24 months and water spilled 48 times during the historical period reliability for meeting target demand in the near future and far future is lower compared to the historical period at nuxia which will be a result of the reduced precipitation and streamflow in the dry periods such decrease will have an impact on agriculture during the dry periods in addition the number of times water is spilled as well as the volume of spilled water is higher in the future compared to the historical period which will be a result of increasing precipitation and subsequently streamflow in the wet season while the above result is specific to the storage considered here it is indicative of the redistribution of water as a function of season a factors that requires consideration in order to maintain water and energy security to the significant populations that depend on the basin additionally while the above results pertain to the brahmaputra alone they are indicative of change across the entire tibetan plateau the home to some of the largest rivers in the world 6 conclusions adequately understanding the likely changes in snow resources and its impact on water resources systems in the future can allow society to plan and manage water resources to minimise the impacts of shortfalls or surpluses how snow resources may affect streamflow in the future due to climate change is a question of interest to many sectors and especially to communities in water stressed regions answering this question is difficult without assessing and correcting biases in climate model projections and projecting these corrected simulations of the future using a defensible modelling approach to ascertain change in water availability previous hydrologic change assessments in snow covered regions have focused on the future change in snow resources without explicitly considering biases in the climate modelled snowpack attributes and therefore in streamflow simulations in this research we have proposed a comprehensive framework to assess the change in streamflow owing to change in snow resources for the climate sensitive upper brahmaputra basin and surrounding areas the approach was specially formulated to consider poor data availability as well as the need for bias correction of projected snow climatology a multivariate bias correction approach mrnbc was applied for correcting systematic biases and uncertainty of the climate models mrnbc was also compared with a univariate bias correction approach quantile mapping to show interdependencies of precipitation and temperature before and after bias correction improved results for climate modelled temperature precipitation and snow water equivalent have been obtained after using the multivariate bias correction approach adopted then the framework is used for future projections to explore the impact of climate change in the snow resources and subsequently streamflow the results showed that monthly snow cover fraction will decline in both near and far future with respect to the historical period moreover the future annual streamflow will increase due to the increase in precipitation under a warming climate a decrease in precipitation in the dry seasons coupled with an increase at an annual scale creates complexity in water management for the region it is shown that typical water supply reservoirs will incur a greater frequency of spill in wet seasons as well as a reduced reliability of supply in spite of the overall increase in flow that is expected overall the proposed framework is flexible for use in a data sparse region and depends mostly on the precipitation and temperature information the outcome of this study will assist in proper understanding of the variability and changes in snow resources and streamflow in the upper brahmaputra basin where use of existing more complex hydrologic models is difficult due to the thin gauge network as well as restrictive data sharing policies additionally we emphases that while our study uses the brahmaputra as a case study for demonstrating the model development and climate change simulation that is presented the approach adopted is location in specific and would be of considerable use in other regions where snow cover is changing as a result of rising global temperatures 7 data availability statement datasets used in this study are available from the following open sources a observed

4061,bioretention systems have been widely constructed as important measures for the management of urban rainfall runoff processes however the designs of bioretention systems are often questioned due to their limited focus on specific hydrological effects in this study nine experimental columns were designed under saturated conditions and multiple hydrological performance indicators such as the outflow arrival time peak flow arrival time runoff reduction rate and peak flow reduction rate were quantified using artificial rainfall devices the analytic hierarchy process ahp method was then proposed to obtain the optimal bioretention system designs under different rainfall conditions results indicated that clay showed the best hydrological effect among the studied soil types while slag had the worst effect on controlling runoff in the filling layer additionally water permeable materials benefited the stable performance of bioretention systems if they were used in the filling layer rainfall conditions greatly impacted the hydrological effects of the bioretention systems these results provided clear guidance for the optimal design of bioretention systems especially considering different hydrological performance indicators and rainfall conditions keywords low impact development bioretention artificial rainfall runoff control sponge city 1 introduction rapid urbanization has

have focused on the hydrological effects of bioretention systems at both the plot scale liu et al 2014 li et al 2016 and catchment scale zhang and chui 2019 the related mechanisms of bioretention systems at these scales have been researched through controlled experiments and field monitoring macedo et al 2018 bioretention systems have been reported to be able to offer multiple hydrological effects to deal with stormwater runoff takaijudin et al 2016 for example bioretention systems are often used to attenuate peak flows and total flow amounts xia et al 2018 however many factors including the soil infiltration rate baek et al 2019 surface conditions takaijudin et al 2016 composition and depth of the medium vegetation types hunt et al 2012 and urbanization levels zhang et al 2020 influence bioretention systems and should thus be considered in their design rainfall intensity has also been reported to affect the hydrological effects of bioretention systems macedo et al 2019a some researchers have used artificial rainfall systems to analyze the hydrological effects of bioretention systems gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017a xia et al 2018 wang et al 2018b indicating that the hydrological effects of lids vary significantly with the rainfall return period optimally designing bioretention systems is extremely difficult first their current structural designs are limited to specific hydrological effects or scattered indicators liu and fassman beck 2017 stewart et al 2017 there is a need for the optimal design of bioretention system structures based on multiple hydrological criteria gao et al 2018 yang and chui 2018 second the optimal design of bioretention systems should incorporate the impacts of rainfall conditions thus the objectives of this paper are 1 to evaluate the hydrological effects of utilizing different soil and filling layers in a bioretention system 2 to quantify the performance of bioretention systems under different rainfall conditions and 3 to optimize the structure of bioretention systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in this study bioretention systems were constructed using specific cylindrical experimental columns consisting of nine polyvinyl chloride resin pvc columns each with a radius thickness and height of approximately 20 cm 6 mm and 1 m respectively a 10 cm aquifer layer 5 cm mulch layer 30 cm soil medium layer 40 cm filler layer and 15 cm gravel layer were set and separated from each other by geotextiles the designed experimental columns and related parameters are shown in fig 1 and table 1 three groups a b and c were set up with the same filling layer and different soil layers among the columns in each group in each of these experimental columns a mulch cover layer filled with vermiculite was used to alleviate the surface soil erosion under heavy rain and a 15 cm gravel layer was used at the bottom for drainage for the soil layer widely used materials including clay mixed soil and sandy soil were selected in this study the sandy soil represented a high sand grain content with small particle surface areas and large macropores between particles the mixed soil was a mixture of 50 sandy soil and 50 clay a specific permeability test was conducted by using the bottom outflow level of a 100 ml glass tube through the three soil types under the same rainfall conditions and sampling time the results showed that the soil permeability was quantified and ranked as follows sandy soil mixed soil clay soil winston et al 2016 based on local investigations as well as the availability of materials three materials were selected for the filling layer pastoral soil planting soil and slag based on our previous study mei et al 2018 the planting soil was loamy sand with a high sand content of 85 and a silt content of 15 its infiltration rate was 5 08 cm h the pastoral soil was sandy clay with a sand content of 61 a silt content of 37 and a clay content of 2 its infiltration rate was 0 37 cm h the slag had a larger particle size and porosity with an infiltration rate of 28 5 cm h the infiltration rate ranking was slag planting soil pastoral soil the gravel layer also called the drainage layer was placed on the bottom of each column with a particle size between 6 cm and 20 cm and used to drain water artificial rainfall devices were used to generate the required rainfall intensities which were calculated based on rainfall data collected in beijing city china according to the local standard of rainstorm runoff calculation for urban storm drainage system planning and design rainfall amounts of different return periods were calculated using eqs 1 3 1 q 1602 1 1 037 lg p t 11 593 0 681 where t represents the rainfall duration and p represents the rainfall return period the range of application was 5 min t 1440 min and p ranged from 2 years 100 years the designed flow was calculated as follows 2 q φ q a c 0 006 the total runoff in this study was calculated as follows 3 w q t where q represents the designed flow in l min w represents the total runoff in l q represents the rainfall intensity in l s hm2 φ represents the runoff coefficient which was 0 9 a c represents the catchment area in m2 p represents the rainfall return period in a and t represents the rainfall duration which was 60 min the basic rainfall input settings applied to the artificial rainfall equipment are shown in table 2 under the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods the rainfall intensity and duration were then fixed for each rainfall return period using automatic artificial rainfall devices the rainfall amounts were calculated based on the cross sectional area of the experimental column and the rainfall intensity while the discharge volume was calculated according to the actual hydrographs based on a local investigation the area ratio of catchment area to the bioretention system was quantified as 10 1 table 3 to avoid other influences each experimental column was saturated using the initial inflow before each experiment once the discharged flow appeared at the bottom of the column and no surface water could be seen in the aquifer layer the bottom valve was closed and the column was assumed to be partly saturated with the same initial conditions as those recorded before the rainfall experiments started according to previous studies the shapes of hydrographs are influenced by the rainfall duration gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017b thus the rainfall duration was set as 60 min with a fixed rainfall intensity samples were collected at the bottom of each bioretention system selected sampling intervals of 1 2 5 and 10 min were used to reduce the measurement error based on experimental tests conducted with group c table s1 and fig s1 that demonstrated that if the sampling interval was short and frequent the resulting monitored data would be closer to the actual outflows thus the sampling frequency depends on the change in the outflow rate meaning that in this study the monitoring frequency was high when the flow changed greatly the flow rate was calculated at each sampling interval 2 2 analysis methods the storm water management model swmm is a dynamic precipitation runoff simulation model used to simulate hydrologic and pollution processes in the model urban catchments receive rainfall and generate different hydrologic components perin et al 2020 thus the swmm model can be used as a blank group to provide comparisons without any fillers a hypothetical impervious area with settings similar to those applied in our experimental design was established to provide data on the baseline rainfall runoff process without lids default parameter values and the horton equation were used for the following infiltration simulations the simulation results indicated that the outflow reached a peak value quickly at the beginning of each simulation and then remained constant until the end of the simulated rainfall event fig 2 based on the experimental and simulated results four hydrological indicators were calculated to evaluate the performance of bioretention systems including the outflow arrival time ot peak flow arrival time pt runoff reduction rate rr and peak flow reduction rate pr to reduce the measurement error the ot was considered the start of the outflow time equal to 0 05 ml s or higher than 0 05 ml s the outflow volume and rr were then calculated using eq 4 and eq 5 according to previous studies jia et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 pt was recognized to correspond to the peak flow in addition pr was calculated by eq 6 and the blank peak flow was simulated using the swmm model 4 o u t f l o w v o l u m e 0 t r q t f t 5 r r 1 o u t f l o w v o l u m e i n f l o w v o l u m e 100 6

to time 0 runoff initiation and time tr the total sampling duration i e 60 min to integrate different hydrological performance indicators the analytic hierarchy process ahp was applied to optimize the bioretention systems the ahp technique was introduced by saaty 1971 for multiple criteria assessments the basic steps are 1 to establish a hierarchical structure model fig 3 2 to construct a matrix for comparison 3 to calculate the hierarchical order and the weight of each factor 4 to perform a consistency check on the matrix and 5 to calculate the overall judgment matrix in this study it was assumed that the rainfall return period affects the relative importance ranking of the indicators more than 20 relevant scholars were consulted to evaluate and compare these four hydrological indicators with the 1 9 scaling method table s2 most of these experts are academic researchers or engineers who have devoted themselves to sponge city practices in china based on the results of the judgment matrix the experts generally thought that 30 year rainfall and 100 year rainfall would produce similar results as both characterize heavy rains the weighting calculationswere performed based on the following matrices o1 and o2 the values provided by the experts are shown in the judgment matrix by judging the consistency between o1 and o2 the random consistency ratios were calculated as 0 0159 and 0 0325 respectively which were both lower than 0 1 thus the normalized weightings were set as follows o1 0 560 0 249 0 0955 0 0955 t and o2 0 110 0 574 0 045 0 271 t the overall performances

results and discussion 3 1 runoff reduction rate the results of four hydrological indicators obtained from the nine columns among the three groups are shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 represents the indicator values obtained for each experimental column fig 5 represents the mean value of each indicator for each filler under three rainfall return periods among the four indicators the runoff reduction rate was estimated to be in the range of 14 78 fig 4 which was lower than the values found in other studies such as the value of 61 found in wet seasons by macedo et al 2019a macedo et al 2019b and the range of 47 80 reported by jia et al 2015 connected with the initial saturation condition in bioretention systems the mean runoff reduction rates were 47 42 and 39 for the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively a smaller reduction in the total runoff was observed under high intensity rainfall events wang et al 2018a khan et al 2012 the hydrological performance of a bioretention system is affected by its soil type which is an important factor in the generation of surface runoff gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017a as shown in fig 5 a clay had the best effect on reducing total runoff in the 2 year and 100 year return periods with reductions estimated at 56 and 54 respectively these values were obviously higher than those of the other two soil types because clay has a high soil viscosity and low water permeability and traps most rainfall runoff in the soil when rain occurs li et al 2018b at the 30 year return period the effects of a1 and b1 were not considered due to their water retention statuses and the blockage of the filling layer with no outflow the total runoff reduction effects of the mixed soil under different columns were relatively stable at 50 where the reduction rates of columns b2 and b3 were similar at the 30 year return period figs 4 and 5 a in addition the performance of a bioretention system is affected by the materials in the filling layer the pastoral soil in the filling layer showed the best effect on runoff reduction with 56 and 59 reductions at the 2 year and 100 year return periods respectively fig 5 a for the 30 year rainfall event the planting soil had the best effect with a total runoff reduction rate of 54 however the slag showed poor runoff reduction performances under the 30 year and 100 year return periods owing to it having the highest permeability among the three materials the runoff reduction rates measured in group c showed a downward trend as the rainfall intensity increased with mean values of 46 33 and 17 at the three rainfall intensities fig 4 this result is related to the fact that more outflow occurs out of the bottom of the column under heavy rain conditions than under light rain conditions jiang et al 2017 however it should be noted that an increasing rainfall intensity might cause matrix blockages or even functional failures in bioretention systems 3 2 peak flow reduction rate the peak flow reduction rate was estimated to range from 9 to 91 fig 4 with a mean value of 57 these rates were lower than those reported in previous studies the rate reached 91 in a paper by shrestha et al 2018 and 79 5 93 6 in a publication by lucke and nichols 2015 the peak flow reduction rate was affected by the saturation state resulting in smaller values clay had the best effect on the peak flow reduction rate at both the 2 year and 100 year return periods with values of 74 and 64 respectively fig 5 b this result indicated that clay was more effective than sand or mixed soil for delaying the peak flow the mixed soil was the most stable soil in reducing the peak flow with reduction rates estimated at 56 55 and 55 at the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively fig 5 b these reduction rates were conducive to maintaining the performance stability of the devices for the filling layer pastoral soil had the best effect on the peak flow reduction rate with rates of 72 70 and 87 recorded at the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively this could be related to it having the lowest infiltration rate among the three materials followed by planting soil fig 5 b however the worst peak flow reduction effect was that of slag especially at the 100 year return period 17 according to the performances of the studied materials using the peak flow reduction rate as an indicator the use of soil types as filling layers was found to improve the peak flow reduction effect due to the hydraulic conductivity porosity initial moisture content and soil mixture height conditions gulbaz et al 2019 for peak flow control pastoral soil could be considered the optimal filling layer and clay could be considered the optimal soil layer 3 3 peak flow arrival time the peak flow arrival time also called the peak appearance time was estimated to be within the range of 13 134 min fig 4 in previous research outflow peaks were shown to be delayed by at least 13 min xia et al 2018 similar to the results reported our study for the soil layer the longest peak appearance times resulted from the use of clay with times of 81 and 76 min at the 2 year and 100 year return periods respectively followed by those of mixed soil fig 5 c the sandy soil in contrast resulted in the shortest peak appearance times estimated at 72 and 50 min at the 2 year and 100 year return periods respectively this result was related to the permeability ranking clay mixed soil sandy soil the mixed soil had the best delaying effect on the peak appearance time at 60 min at the 30 year return period for the filling layer the planting soil showed the best delaying effect on the peak appearance time with times of 78 and 101 min at the 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively fig 5 c pastoral soil had the worst delaying effect on the peak appearance time as shown in fig 5 c however at the 2 year return period the slag had the best delaying effect up to 96 min contrary to the clay s unfavored performance reflected in previous indicators this indicated that the relative performances of the fillers change with the target and rainfall intensities in group c the peak appearance time apparently decreased when the rainfall return period changed from 2 years to 30 years the values were stable at the 30 year and 100 year return periods as shown in fig 4 gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017b the peak appearance times of c1 c2 and c3 were estimated to be 45 61 and 53 min at the 30 year return period respectively which were similar to the 46 62 and 52 min recorded at the 100 year return period respectively fig 4 results show that the influences of rainfall with return periods of 30 years and 100 years on the column efficiency were consistent within group c both of these events are characterized by heavy rain and this result might relate to the high permeability of slag above all results showed that using planting soil as a filling layer and clay as a soil layer was beneficial for delaying the peak appearance time 3 4 outflow arrival time the outflow arrival time was estimated to be within the range of 0 54 min fig 4 different degrees of outflow arrival time were obtained for the 2 year return period but the outflow arrived at the beginning of the rainfall events in both the 30 year and 100 year return periods this result indicated that the outflow arrival time becomes shorter as the rainfall intensity increases fig 6 for the soil layer clay showed the best performance in delaying the outflow arrival time at 40 min at the 2 year return period fig 5 d due to its relatively low permeability winston et al 2016 the outflow arrival times of the mixed soil and the sandy soil were close at 28 and 30 min respectively this result indicated that the properties of silt and mixed soils may be similar to those of sandy soil for the filling layer the planting soil had the longest outflow arrival time estimated at 50 min followed by that of pastoral soil at 31 min fig 5 d however the slag had a poor delaying effect on the outflow arrival time which was only estimated as 16 min due to its relatively high permeability above all the soil layer containing clay and the filling layer containing planting soil may have significant delaying effects on the outflow arrival time 3 5 multiple hydrological effects according to the single indicator evaluation the lid performance clearly changed under different performance indicators and rainfall intensities which was not convenient for material selection thus this study introduced a multiple criteria assessment for the subsequent optimal design of the bioretention system the weights of four indicators including the runoff reduction rate peak flow reduction rate outflow arrival time and peak flow arrival time were quantified as 0 560 0 249 0 0955 and 0 0955 under the 2 year return period respectively and 0 110 0 574 0 045 and 0 271 respectively under both the 30 year and 100 year return periods these values were based on the results of expert consultations and the overall performances of the nine analyzed scenarios were calculated based on the linear accumulation model table s3 column a1 had the best performance in the 2 year return period and columns a1 and b1 had the best performances in the 100 year return periods scoring 0 870 and 0 955 respectively fig 7 these results indicated that the use of clay in the soil layer contributes to controlling runoff due to its low permeability winston et al 2016 for the filling layer planting soil had the best hydrological controlling effect with the highest score recorded at 0 87 for column b1 li et al 2018a the controlling effects of the slag layers in c1 c2 and c3 were estimated to be 0 156 0 366 and 0 168 respectively characterizing the worst performance with these lower scores owing to the high porosity and permeability of slag compared to groups a and b group c had lower scores with scores of 0 162 and 0 087 at the 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively column c2 showed the best hydrological effect with the best score under each rainfall intensity fig 7 mixed soil was used as the soil layer in c2 with a soil configuration of 50 60 sand and 40 50 topsoil which was determined from prior research to be suitable for local guidelines takaijudin et al 2019 in addition large fluctuations in scores could be observed in groups a and b which were filled by planting soil and pastoral soil respectively fig 7 while the rank of the scores remained unchanged between the three columns in group c the scores decreased as the rainfall intensity increased this result indicated that the hydrological performance of slag in the studied bioretention systems was relatively stable above all the lid performances changed when using the three materials in the filling layer indicating that water permeable materials would cause the lid performance to be more stable 4 conclusions in this study nine hypothetical bioretention cells were set up with different filler combinations then the ahp method was used to evaluate the comprehensive performances of the designed bioretention systems under different lid structures and rainfall intensities the results of this study showed that the performance of a bioretention system varies according to the selection of different lid structures and under different rainfall return periods results also showed that clay had the best runoff control effect in the soil layer while the use of pastoral and planting soils in the filling layer seemed the most sensitive to the rainfall conditions in contrast the use of water permeable materials in the filling layer results in a stable bioretention system performance these results provided clear evidence for the optimal design of bioretention systems and also highlighted the importance of incorporating rainfall conditions into the design of lids owing to the uncertainty of the hydrological control effect however the results of this study should be extended with caution in the future attention should be given to the following issues 1 the mechanism of the fillers under saturated conditions needs further exploration especially under heavy rain events 2 the precise ratio of the lid area to the drainage area should be obtained based on field investigations and 3 the optimization of lids at large scales should also be considered in the future credit authorship contribution statement nian yang conceptualization software writing original draft wen du data

4061,bioretention systems have been widely constructed as important measures for the management of urban rainfall runoff processes however the designs of bioretention systems are often questioned due to their limited focus on specific hydrological effects in this study nine experimental columns were designed under saturated conditions and multiple hydrological performance indicators such as the outflow arrival time peak flow arrival time runoff reduction rate and peak flow reduction rate were quantified using artificial rainfall devices the analytic hierarchy process ahp method was then proposed to obtain the optimal bioretention system designs under different rainfall conditions results indicated that clay showed the best hydrological effect among the studied soil types while slag had the worst effect on controlling runoff in the filling layer additionally water permeable materials benefited the stable performance of bioretention systems if they were used in the filling layer rainfall conditions greatly impacted the hydrological effects of the bioretention systems these results provided clear guidance for the optimal design of bioretention systems especially considering different hydrological performance indicators and rainfall conditions keywords low impact development bioretention artificial rainfall runoff control sponge city 1 introduction rapid urbanization has

have focused on the hydrological effects of bioretention systems at both the plot scale liu et al 2014 li et al 2016 and catchment scale zhang and chui 2019 the related mechanisms of bioretention systems at these scales have been researched through controlled experiments and field monitoring macedo et al 2018 bioretention systems have been reported to be able to offer multiple hydrological effects to deal with stormwater runoff takaijudin et al 2016 for example bioretention systems are often used to attenuate peak flows and total flow amounts xia et al 2018 however many factors including the soil infiltration rate baek et al 2019 surface conditions takaijudin et al 2016 composition and depth of the medium vegetation types hunt et al 2012 and urbanization levels zhang et al 2020 influence bioretention systems and should thus be considered in their design rainfall intensity has also been reported to affect the hydrological effects of bioretention systems macedo et al 2019a some researchers have used artificial rainfall systems to analyze the hydrological effects of bioretention systems gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017a xia et al 2018 wang et al 2018b indicating that the hydrological effects of lids vary significantly with the rainfall return period optimally designing bioretention systems is extremely difficult first their current structural designs are limited to specific hydrological effects or scattered indicators liu and fassman beck 2017 stewart et al 2017 there is a need for the optimal design of bioretention system structures based on multiple hydrological criteria gao et al 2018 yang and chui 2018 second the optimal design of bioretention systems should incorporate the impacts of rainfall conditions thus the objectives of this paper are 1 to evaluate the hydrological effects of utilizing different soil and filling layers in a bioretention system 2 to quantify the performance of bioretention systems under different rainfall conditions and 3 to optimize the structure of bioretention systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment design in this study bioretention systems were constructed using specific cylindrical experimental columns consisting of nine polyvinyl chloride resin pvc columns each with a radius thickness and height of approximately 20 cm 6 mm and 1 m respectively a 10 cm aquifer layer 5 cm mulch layer 30 cm soil medium layer 40 cm filler layer and 15 cm gravel layer were set and separated from each other by geotextiles the designed experimental columns and related parameters are shown in fig 1 and table 1 three groups a b and c were set up with the same filling layer and different soil layers among the columns in each group in each of these experimental columns a mulch cover layer filled with vermiculite was used to alleviate the surface soil erosion under heavy rain and a 15 cm gravel layer was used at the bottom for drainage for the soil layer widely used materials including clay mixed soil and sandy soil were selected in this study the sandy soil represented a high sand grain content with small particle surface areas and large macropores between particles the mixed soil was a mixture of 50 sandy soil and 50 clay a specific permeability test was conducted by using the bottom outflow level of a 100 ml glass tube through the three soil types under the same rainfall conditions and sampling time the results showed that the soil permeability was quantified and ranked as follows sandy soil mixed soil clay soil winston et al 2016 based on local investigations as well as the availability of materials three materials were selected for the filling layer pastoral soil planting soil and slag based on our previous study mei et al 2018 the planting soil was loamy sand with a high sand content of 85 and a silt content of 15 its infiltration rate was 5 08 cm h the pastoral soil was sandy clay with a sand content of 61 a silt content of 37 and a clay content of 2 its infiltration rate was 0 37 cm h the slag had a larger particle size and porosity with an infiltration rate of 28 5 cm h the infiltration rate ranking was slag planting soil pastoral soil the gravel layer also called the drainage layer was placed on the bottom of each column with a particle size between 6 cm and 20 cm and used to drain water artificial rainfall devices were used to generate the required rainfall intensities which were calculated based on rainfall data collected in beijing city china according to the local standard of rainstorm runoff calculation for urban storm drainage system planning and design rainfall amounts of different return periods were calculated using eqs 1 3 1 q 1602 1 1 037 lg p t 11 593 0 681 where t represents the rainfall duration and p represents the rainfall return period the range of application was 5 min t 1440 min and p ranged from 2 years 100 years the designed flow was calculated as follows 2 q φ q a c 0 006 the total runoff in this study was calculated as follows 3 w q t where q represents the designed flow in l min w represents the total runoff in l q represents the rainfall intensity in l s hm2 φ represents the runoff coefficient which was 0 9 a c represents the catchment area in m2 p represents the rainfall return period in a and t represents the rainfall duration which was 60 min the basic rainfall input settings applied to the artificial rainfall equipment are shown in table 2 under the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods the rainfall intensity and duration were then fixed for each rainfall return period using automatic artificial rainfall devices the rainfall amounts were calculated based on the cross sectional area of the experimental column and the rainfall intensity while the discharge volume was calculated according to the actual hydrographs based on a local investigation the area ratio of catchment area to the bioretention system was quantified as 10 1 table 3 to avoid other influences each experimental column was saturated using the initial inflow before each experiment once the discharged flow appeared at the bottom of the column and no surface water could be seen in the aquifer layer the bottom valve was closed and the column was assumed to be partly saturated with the same initial conditions as those recorded before the rainfall experiments started according to previous studies the shapes of hydrographs are influenced by the rainfall duration gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017b thus the rainfall duration was set as 60 min with a fixed rainfall intensity samples were collected at the bottom of each bioretention system selected sampling intervals of 1 2 5 and 10 min were used to reduce the measurement error based on experimental tests conducted with group c table s1 and fig s1 that demonstrated that if the sampling interval was short and frequent the resulting monitored data would be closer to the actual outflows thus the sampling frequency depends on the change in the outflow rate meaning that in this study the monitoring frequency was high when the flow changed greatly the flow rate was calculated at each sampling interval 2 2 analysis methods the storm water management model swmm is a dynamic precipitation runoff simulation model used to simulate hydrologic and pollution processes in the model urban catchments receive rainfall and generate different hydrologic components perin et al 2020 thus the swmm model can be used as a blank group to provide comparisons without any fillers a hypothetical impervious area with settings similar to those applied in our experimental design was established to provide data on the baseline rainfall runoff process without lids default parameter values and the horton equation were used for the following infiltration simulations the simulation results indicated that the outflow reached a peak value quickly at the beginning of each simulation and then remained constant until the end of the simulated rainfall event fig 2 based on the experimental and simulated results four hydrological indicators were calculated to evaluate the performance of bioretention systems including the outflow arrival time ot peak flow arrival time pt runoff reduction rate rr and peak flow reduction rate pr to reduce the measurement error the ot was considered the start of the outflow time equal to 0 05 ml s or higher than 0 05 ml s the outflow volume and rr were then calculated using eq 4 and eq 5 according to previous studies jia et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 pt was recognized to correspond to the peak flow in addition pr was calculated by eq 6 and the blank peak flow was simulated using the swmm model 4 o u t f l o w v o l u m e 0 t r q t f t 5 r r 1 o u t f l o w v o l u m e i n f l o w v o l u m e 100 6

to time 0 runoff initiation and time tr the total sampling duration i e 60 min to integrate different hydrological performance indicators the analytic hierarchy process ahp was applied to optimize the bioretention systems the ahp technique was introduced by saaty 1971 for multiple criteria assessments the basic steps are 1 to establish a hierarchical structure model fig 3 2 to construct a matrix for comparison 3 to calculate the hierarchical order and the weight of each factor 4 to perform a consistency check on the matrix and 5 to calculate the overall judgment matrix in this study it was assumed that the rainfall return period affects the relative importance ranking of the indicators more than 20 relevant scholars were consulted to evaluate and compare these four hydrological indicators with the 1 9 scaling method table s2 most of these experts are academic researchers or engineers who have devoted themselves to sponge city practices in china based on the results of the judgment matrix the experts generally thought that 30 year rainfall and 100 year rainfall would produce similar results as both characterize heavy rains the weighting calculationswere performed based on the following matrices o1 and o2 the values provided by the experts are shown in the judgment matrix by judging the consistency between o1 and o2 the random consistency ratios were calculated as 0 0159 and 0 0325 respectively which were both lower than 0 1 thus the normalized weightings were set as follows o1 0 560 0 249 0 0955 0 0955 t and o2 0 110 0 574 0 045 0 271 t the overall performances of the columns were then calculated based on the linear accumulation model eq 7 using the index normalized results and weights o1 1 3 5 1 3 1 3 1 5 1 3 1 5 3 1 1 5 1 3 1 1 o2 1 1 5 3 5 1 9 1 3 1 9 1 1

results and discussion 3 1 runoff reduction rate the results of four hydrological indicators obtained from the nine columns among the three groups are shown in figs 4 and 5 fig 4 represents the indicator values obtained for each experimental column fig 5 represents the mean value of each indicator for each filler under three rainfall return periods among the four indicators the runoff reduction rate was estimated to be in the range of 14 78 fig 4 which was lower than the values found in other studies such as the value of 61 found in wet seasons by macedo et al 2019a macedo et al 2019b and the range of 47 80 reported by jia et al 2015 connected with the initial saturation condition in bioretention systems the mean runoff reduction rates were 47 42 and 39 for the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively a smaller reduction in the total runoff was observed under high intensity rainfall events wang et al 2018a khan et al 2012 the hydrological performance of a bioretention system is affected by its soil type which is an important factor in the generation of surface runoff gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017a as shown in fig 5 a clay had the best effect on reducing total runoff in the 2 year and 100 year return periods with reductions estimated at 56 and 54 respectively these values were obviously higher than those of the other two soil types because clay has a high soil viscosity and low water permeability and traps most rainfall runoff in the soil when rain occurs li et al 2018b at the 30 year return period the effects of a1 and b1 were not considered due to their water retention statuses and the blockage of the filling layer with no outflow the total runoff reduction effects of the mixed soil under different columns were relatively stable at 50 where the reduction rates of columns b2 and b3 were similar at the 30 year return period figs 4 and 5 a in addition the performance of a bioretention system is affected by the materials in the filling layer the pastoral soil in the filling layer showed the best effect on runoff reduction with 56 and 59 reductions at the 2 year and 100 year return periods respectively fig 5 a for the 30 year rainfall event the planting soil had the best effect with a total runoff reduction rate of 54 however the slag showed poor runoff reduction performances under the 30 year and 100 year return periods owing to it having the highest permeability among the three materials the runoff reduction rates measured in group c showed a downward trend as the rainfall intensity increased with mean values of 46 33 and 17 at the three rainfall intensities fig 4 this result is related to the fact that more outflow occurs out of the bottom of the column under heavy rain conditions than under light rain conditions jiang et al 2017 however it should be noted that an increasing rainfall intensity might cause matrix blockages or even functional failures in bioretention systems 3 2 peak flow reduction rate the peak flow reduction rate was estimated to range from 9 to 91 fig 4 with a mean value of 57 these rates were lower than those reported in previous studies the rate reached 91 in a paper by shrestha et al 2018 and 79 5 93 6 in a publication by lucke and nichols 2015 the peak flow reduction rate was affected by the saturation state resulting in smaller values clay had the best effect on the peak flow reduction rate at both the 2 year and 100 year return periods with values of 74 and 64 respectively fig 5 b this result indicated that clay was more effective than sand or mixed soil for delaying the peak flow the mixed soil was the most stable soil in reducing the peak flow with reduction rates estimated at 56 55 and 55 at the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively fig 5 b these reduction rates were conducive to maintaining the performance stability of the devices for the filling layer pastoral soil had the best effect on the peak flow reduction rate with rates of 72 70 and 87 recorded at the 2 year 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively this could be related to it having the lowest infiltration rate among the three materials followed by planting soil fig 5 b however the worst peak flow reduction effect was that of slag especially at the 100 year return period 17 according to the performances of the studied materials using the peak flow reduction rate as an indicator the use of soil types as filling layers was found to improve the peak flow reduction effect due to the hydraulic conductivity porosity initial moisture content and soil mixture height conditions gulbaz et al 2019 for peak flow control pastoral soil could be considered the optimal filling layer and clay could be considered the optimal soil layer 3 3 peak flow arrival time the peak flow arrival time also called the peak appearance time was estimated to be within the range of 13 134 min fig 4 in previous research outflow peaks were shown to be delayed by at least 13 min xia et al 2018 similar to the results reported our study for the soil layer the longest peak appearance times resulted from the use of clay with times of 81 and 76 min at the 2 year and 100 year return periods respectively followed by those of mixed soil fig 5 c the sandy soil in contrast resulted in the shortest peak appearance times estimated at 72 and 50 min at the 2 year and 100 year return periods respectively this result was related to the permeability ranking clay mixed soil sandy soil the mixed soil had the best delaying effect on the peak appearance time at 60 min at the 30 year return period for the filling layer the planting soil showed the best delaying effect on the peak appearance time with times of 78 and 101 min at the 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively fig 5 c pastoral soil had the worst delaying effect on the peak appearance time as shown in fig 5 c however at the 2 year return period the slag had the best delaying effect up to 96 min contrary to the clay s unfavored performance reflected in previous indicators this indicated that the relative performances of the fillers change with the target and rainfall intensities in group c the peak appearance time apparently decreased when the rainfall return period changed from 2 years to 30 years the values were stable at the 30 year and 100 year return periods as shown in fig 4 gulbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017b the peak appearance times of c1 c2 and c3 were estimated to be 45 61 and 53 min at the 30 year return period respectively which were similar to the 46 62 and 52 min recorded at the 100 year return period respectively fig 4 results show that the influences of rainfall with return periods of 30 years and 100 years on the column efficiency were consistent within group c both of these events are characterized by heavy rain and this result might relate to the high permeability of slag above all results showed that using planting soil as a filling layer and clay as a soil layer was beneficial for delaying the peak appearance time 3 4 outflow arrival time the outflow arrival time was estimated to be within the range of 0 54 min fig 4 different degrees of outflow arrival time were obtained for the 2 year return period but the outflow arrived at the beginning of the rainfall events in both the 30 year and 100 year return periods this result indicated that the outflow arrival time becomes shorter as the rainfall intensity increases fig 6 for the soil layer clay showed the best performance in delaying the outflow arrival time at 40 min at the 2 year return period fig 5 d due to its relatively low permeability winston et al 2016 the outflow arrival times of the mixed soil and the sandy soil were close at 28 and 30 min respectively this result indicated that the properties of silt and mixed soils may be similar to those of sandy soil for the filling layer the planting soil had the longest outflow arrival time estimated at 50 min followed by that of pastoral soil at 31 min fig 5 d however the slag had a poor delaying effect on the outflow arrival time which was only estimated as 16 min due to its relatively high permeability above all the soil layer containing clay and the filling layer containing planting soil may have significant delaying effects on the outflow arrival time 3 5 multiple hydrological effects according to the single indicator evaluation the lid performance clearly changed under different performance indicators and rainfall intensities which was not convenient for material selection thus this study introduced a multiple criteria assessment for the subsequent optimal design of the bioretention system the weights of four indicators including the runoff reduction rate peak flow reduction rate outflow arrival time and peak flow arrival time were quantified as 0 560 0 249 0 0955 and 0 0955 under the 2 year return period respectively and 0 110 0 574 0 045 and 0 271 respectively under both the 30 year and 100 year return periods these values were based on the results of expert consultations and the overall performances of the nine analyzed scenarios were calculated based on the linear accumulation model table s3 column a1 had the best performance in the 2 year return period and columns a1 and b1 had the best performances in the 100 year return periods scoring 0 870 and 0 955 respectively fig 7 these results indicated that the use of clay in the soil layer contributes to controlling runoff due to its low permeability winston et al 2016 for the filling layer planting soil had the best hydrological controlling effect with the highest score recorded at 0 87 for column b1 li et al 2018a the controlling effects of the slag layers in c1 c2 and c3 were estimated to be 0 156 0 366 and 0 168 respectively characterizing the worst performance with these lower scores owing to the high porosity and permeability of slag compared to groups a and b group c had lower scores with scores of 0 162 and 0 087 at the 30 year and 100 year return periods respectively column c2 showed the best hydrological effect with the best score under each rainfall intensity fig 7 mixed soil was used as the soil layer in c2 with a soil configuration of 50 60 sand and 40 50 topsoil which was determined from prior research to be suitable for local guidelines takaijudin et al 2019 in addition large fluctuations in scores could be observed in groups a and b which were filled by planting soil and pastoral soil respectively fig 7 while the rank of the scores remained unchanged

of the hydrological control effect however the results of this study should be extended with caution in the future attention should be given to the following issues 1 the mechanism of the fillers under saturated conditions needs further exploration especially under heavy rain events 2 the precise ratio of the lid area to the drainage area should be obtained based on field investigations and 3 the optimization of lids at large scales should also be considered in the future credit authorship contribution statement nian yang conceptualization software writing original draft wen du data

4062,tungsten is a toxic trace element that poses a threat to the environment and human health especially in places where it occurs in high concentrations such as geothermal areas in the present study hydrochemical processes controlling tungsten concentrations in various types of geothermal waters and the effects of thiolation on tungsten geochemistry were investigated in the tengchong longling geothermal region china neutral to alkaline hot springs which are the majority of springs in tengchong longling and globally exhibited much higher tungsten concentrations than acidic hot springs within the neutral to alkaline springs total tungsten concentration correlated with reservoir temperatures and springs rich in sulphide exhibited higher total tungsten concentrations than those with low or no detectable sulphide the formation of thiotungstates apparently increased total tungsten solubility results from thermodynamic equilibrium modelling did not match measured data and the extent of thiolation was over and under predicted at low and high ph respectively cooccurring arsenic substantially inhibited the thiolation of tungsten at sulphide concentrations and s ii w as ratios of 5 mg l and 50 respectively above these limits however tungsten and arsenic had comparable tendencies of being thiolated the present study suggests that consideration of thiotungstates which is seldom done is necessary when studying tungsten hydrochemistry of sulphidic natural waters and current thermodynamic constants are not suitable for predictions in dynamic systems including hydrothermal

the synthesis of materials for various applications e g catalysts nanocomposites etc dong et al 2002 espino et al 2003 salavati niasari 2005 salavati niasari et al 2010 zinatloo ajabshir et al 2016 masjedi arani and salavati niasari 2017 salehabadi et al 2018 zinatloo ajabshir et al 2020 goudarzi et al 2021 zinatloo ajabshir et al 2021 in recent years thiospecies of some metalloids typically arsenic and antimony in sulphidic waters either natural waters or artificial solutions were reported as well and have received increasing attention ullrich et al 2013 planer friedrich et al 2020 the most commonly described thiospecies in natural waters are thioarsenates asvsno4 n 3 n 1 4 which have been detected in geothermal waters planer friedrich et al 2007 paddy pore waters wang et al 2020 and uncontaminated and pesticide contaminated groundwaters wallschläger and london 2008 planer friedrich et al 2018 similarly the thiolation of antimony in natural waters has also been documented planer friedrich and scheinost 2011 the formation and stability of thioantimonates sbvsno4 n 3 n 1 4 has been studied as well under various conditions in detail planer friedrich and scheinost 2011 planer friedrich and wilson 2012 similar to arsenic and antimony tungsten also has an affinity for sulphide although the thiolation of tungstate is likely to be very important for transport and the fate of aqueous tungsten there is little information available for quantitative detection of thiotungstates wsno4 n 2 n 1 4 in natural waters johannesson et al 2013 simulated thiotungstate speciation in their groundwater samples using the equilibrium constants for thiomolybdate species because reliable stability constants for the formation of four thiotungstates were not available at that time and the stability constants for thiotungstates should be similar to those for analogous thiomolybdates determined earlier subsequently most studies mohajerin et al 2014 mohajerin et al 2016 cui et al 2020 concerning the thiolation of tungstate in natural waters were made based on geochemical simulations using the equilibrium constants for the formation of thiotungstates to our knowledge measured thiotungstate concentrations in natural waters have been reported only by planer friedrich et al 2020 in recent years the toxicity of tungsten has received increased attention because of its potential role in the leukaemia cluster events in nevada usa in the early 2000s uscdc 2003 and the possibility that exposure to the elevated concentrations of tungsten may result in various pathological changes or diseases including rhabdomyosarcoma lung inflammation and dna damage in bone marrow kalinich et al 2005 roedel et al 2012 kelly et al 2013 george et al 2015 natural waters are one of the most important environmental media containing tungsten most natural waters have relatively low tungsten concentrations such as meteoric waters kist 1994 seawaters kunzendorf and glasby 1992 sohrin et al 1999 river waters van der sloot et al 1985 mohajerin et al 2014 mohajerin et al 2016 and non thermal groundwaters unrelated to tungsten bearing ores johannesson et al 2013 in contrast geothermal waters especially high temperature neutral to alkaline geothermal waters tend to be of higher tungsten concentrations hall et al 1988 koutsospyros et al 2006 arnórsson and óskarsson 2007 guo et al 2019a and thereby may pose a severe threat to the environment and human health mccleskey et al 2010 since these high temperature tungsten bearing geothermal waters typically are rich in sulphide guo et al 2019a planer friedrich et al 2020 the thiolation of tungstate may occur and influence total tungsten hydrogeochemistry tengchong longling a typical geothermal region located in the yunnan sichuan tibet yst geothermal province the sole high temperature geothermal province in mainland china is characterised by the occurrence of hot springs with various hydrochemical types and a wide range of tungsten concentrations some hot springs in tengchong longling have extremely high sulphide concentrations to a maximum of 13 6 mg l however to date there have been few systematic studies on tungsten in the tengchong longling hot springs little is known about the potential formation of thiotungstates in these hot springs and its effects on tungsten hydrochemical processes therein therefore the aims of this study were to a investigate tungsten speciation in representative tengchong longling hot springs b evaluate the effects of tungstate thiolation on tungsten hydrochemical processes c identify the geochemical conditions critical to the substantial formation of thiotungstates and d clarify the significance of thiotungstates in sulphidic geothermal waters this work represents the first study of thiotungstates in natural waters in china 2 regional setting and geology the tengchong longling geothermal region representative of those in the yst geothermal province in china belongs to the global mediterranean himalayas geothermal belt tong and zhang 1994 a subtropical monsoon climate prevails in tengchong longling with mean annual air temperature and annual rainfall of 14 8 c and 1470 mm respectively tong and zhang 1989 the topography of the region is high in the north and the east and low in the south and the west late cenozoic volcanic rocks including basalt andesite basalt andesite and dacite are widely distributed in the region the youngest volcano the heikong hill has an age of only 7 14 ka based on k ar dating nakai et al 1993 in addition to volcanic rocks granite migmatitic granite syenite granodiorite and quartz porphyry also outcrop in the region fig 1 dozens of geothermal areas featuring strong hydrothermal activities are situated in tengchong longling which are hydrogeologically semi independent of one another tong and zhang 1989 the reservoir host rocks of these hydrothermal systems are predominantly felsic rocks geothermal water recharge mainly occurs via the vertical seepage of meteoric water in northern and eastern mountainous areas with the highest elevation to 3780 m the seepage of rainfall occurring locally in each hydrothermal area should also be considered as a potential recharge source hot springs are the sole path of geothermal water discharge in most hydrothermal areas in general infiltrating groundwaters in the tengchong longling region flow from the north and the east to the south and the west tong and zhang 1989 however specific groundwater flow directions in each hydrothermal area are varied and difficult to identify because these hydrothermal areas have not been extensively explored and few boreholes have been drilled into the reservoirs to collect detailed hydrogeological data banglazhang ruidian xinhua langpu hubang and huangguaqing were selected as the hydrothermal areas in the tengchong longling region for the study fig 1 because the hot springs located there cover a wide range of ph values 2 2 9 7 and a large range of tungsten 0 16 265 9 μg l and sulphide 0 13 6 mg l concentrations all these hydrothermal systems are unexplored and their reservoir host rocks are speculated to be granite for ruidian xinhua and hubang or sandstone for banglazhang langpu and huangguaqing based on the local surface geology no boreholes have been drilled in these areas sandstone and granite have comparable tungsten contents 1 35 ppm for an international sandstone standard hu and gao 2008 and on average 1 4 ppm for upper crust composed primarily of granites wedepohl 1995 hu and gao 2008 and therefore the difference in reservoir lithology could have minimal impact on the variation of tungsten concentrations in the geothermal waters investigated in this study nevertheless it is worth noting that the above descriptions of the reservoir hostrocks are speculative in view of a lack of direct evidence a clear understanding of the reservoir geology requires an elaborate geological exploration in the future including effective geophysical investigations as well as boreholes drilled into the reservoirs banglazhang is the most geothermally active and is marked by the most intensive hydrothermal activities among the selected systems however although the geophysical and geological investigations made in the neighbouring regions of banglazhang indicate that the banglazhang system is likely to be located above the margin of a comparatively shallow seated magma chamber lou et al 2002 zhao 2008 the hydrochemical and o h and s isotopic evidence does not imply a mixing of magmatic fluid with the banglazhang geothermal waters that is a direct input of magmatic fluid to the banglazhang hydrothermal system guo et al 2017 the situation is similar for the other systems including ruidian xinhua and hubang tong and zhang 1989 thus the hydrogeochemistry of the geothermal waters in the selected hydrothermal systems including tungsten hydrogeochemistry is predominantly controlled by interactions between infiltrating waters and reservoir host rocks furthermore these hot springs generally discharge into local rivers which are used as drinking water sources such as the xiangbai river receiving the banglazhang hot spring waters and therefore tungsten and other harmful constituents in the springs represent a threat to local residents 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis hot spring samples 34 were collected from tengchong longling in march april 2019 the dry season the specific sampling sites are shown in fig 1 including the banglazhang nine springs sampled ruidian eight springs sampled xinhua six springs sampled langpu three springs sampled hubang three springs sampled and huangguaqing areas five springs sampled temperature ph eh and electrical conductivity of each hot spring were determined in situ with hand held meters calibrated prior to sampling table 1 high density polyethylene bottles for sampling were soaked in 5 hcl rinsed with deionized water three times in the lab and then rinsed with filtered hot spring water through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes immediately before sampling all samples except those for the analysis of alkalinity were filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes total alkalinity and sulphide were analysed on site using the gran titration and methylene blue methods using a hach colorimeter respectively for the analysis of major anions no chemical agents were added to the sample splits whereas reagent grade 14 m hno3 was added to the sample splits to bring ph to 1 prior to the determination of the concentrations of metal loid elements the analysis of total tungsten used unacidified sample splits to avoid potential precipitation of tungstite wo3 or tungstenite ws2 furthermore stoichiometric 30 h2o2 in addition to 14 m hno3 was used to pretreat one sample split collected at each spring for the analysis of mo sb and as converting all the molybdenum antimony and arsenic species to molybdate antimonate and arsenate respectively which prevented these elements from precipitating under acidic conditions in the laboratory the concentrations of na k ca mg si w mo v sb as li rb cs sr ba b al and fe were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and those of so4 2 cl f and br by ion chromatography ic to avoid clogging the nebulizer and sampling cone of the icp ms the hot spring samples were generally diluted five times with 2 nitric acid before analysis with the high concentration elements na k ca and si being further diluted five times the accuracy of the analyses was evaluated using a standard addition recovery test the recoveries of spiked standards ranged from 95 to 103 the limits of detection and the limits of quantification calculated as three times the standard deviation of the concentration of each constituent in the blank and by multiplying 10 times the standard deviation of the procedure blank concentration by the dilution factor respectively were sufficient for the measurements of the target constituents in the hot spring samples the hydrochemical analysis results are summarized in table 1 and table s1 sample splits for the analysis of tungsten and arsenic speciation were collected as promptly as possible filtered immediately flash frozen in dry ice on site and stored frozen at 20 c until analysis tungsten species tungstate monothiotungstate dithiotungstate trithiotungstate and tetrathiotungstate were determined using reverse phase ion pair chromatographic ics 3000 sp dionex separation followed by icp ms xseries2 thermo scientific analysis in the standard mode at the environmental geochemistry laboratory of university bayreuth germany tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and a 10 25 gradient elution of 2 propanol were used as the ion pair reagent and the eluent respectively thiolated tungstates were quantified via a tungstate calibration curve the lowest concentration that could be identified as an individual peak from the baseline during chromatographic separation was 0 003 μg l the concentrations of tungsten species in the banglazhang hot spring samples are presented in table 2 only tungstate was detected in samples from the other hydrothermal areas arsenic speciation was analysed at the environmental geochemistry laboratory of university bayreuth germany using aec icp ms a coupled system of anion exchange chromatography and icp ms specifically the arsenic species in the hot spring samples were separated via ion chromatography ionpac ag as16 using gradient elution of 20 100 mm naoh at 1 2 ml min 1 and then detected by icp ms arsenic and sulphur species were determined in oxygen mode arsenite and arsenate were quantified via their respective calibration standards whereas thioarsenates were quantified using the calibration of arsenate because of the lack of commercially available thioarsenate standards the arsenic speciation in all the hot spring samples is presented in table 3 3 2 lab experiments a series of lab experiments were conducted to judge if aqueous tungstate could precipitate upon acidification under either oxidizing or sulfidic conditions specifically tungstate bearing solutions and mixed tungstate sulfide solutions at a fixed s ii w molar ratio 40 with tungsten concentrations of 100 and 1000 μmol l were acidified using hcl to ph 5 4 3 2 and 1 the original tungstate bearing solutions and mixed tungstate sulfide solutions were prepared with na2wo4 2h2o and na2s 9h2o all the procedures were performed in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere to maintain anoxic conditions the tungsten concentrations in the acidified solutions were measured using icp ms 3 3 geothermometer measurements geothermometers have been proposed and widely applied to calculate reservoir temperature in recent past decades with the concentrations of relevant chemical constituents in a hot spring sample the corresponding reservoir temperature can be estimated based on temperature dependent subsurface water rock equilibria in this work the quartz geothermometer giggenbach et al 1994 was used to calculate reservoir temperatures which were then employed to evaluate their effects on the tungsten concentrations in the geothermal waters 3 4 geochemical modelling to evaluate the theoretical effects of ph and sulphide concentration on tungsten speciation simulations were made at various ph values and sulphide concentrations and a fixed total tungsten concentration of 100 μg l using phreeqc combined with the wateq4f database parkhurst and appelo 1999 this was updated in advance with thermodynamic data for thiotungstates from mohajerin et al 2014 for tungstates from smith and martell 2004 and for polytungstates from cruywagen and van der merwe 1987 smith and martell 2004 and rozantsev and sazonova 2005 table s2 an example of the phreeqc input files is presented in the supplementary data notably we set the modelling temperature to 25 c instead of reservoir or sampling temperatures because the enthalpy changes for the transformation reactions among various tungsten species are unavailable in the literature from which we acquired chemical equilibrium constants at standard state conditions without the enthalpy changes for the transformation reactions the chemical equilibrium constants at non standard state conditions that is at reservoir or sampling temperatures could not be calculated accordingly aqueous tungsten speciation at reservoir or sampling temperatures could not be simulated thus even if we had set reservoir or sampling temperatures as the modelling temperature the simulation results would have still been the same as those obtained at 25 c 4 results 4 1 general hydrochemistry the hot springs sampled in this study covered a wide range of ph values 2 2 9 7 and sulphide 0 13 6 mg l and tungsten 0 16 265 9 μg l concentrations table 1 the samples were divided into three hydrochemical types according to their ph and sulphide concentrations a neutral or alkaline waters with high sulphide concentrations b neutral or alkaline waters with low sulphide concentrations and c acid waters with low sulphide concentrations fig 2 type a samples were collected from banglazhang and had hco3 and na as the major anion and cation respectively fig s1 type b samples were collected from ruidian xinhua langpu and hubang and were characterised as na hco3 waters fig s1 in contrast type c samples were so4 rich waters with more dissolved alkaline earth metals than alkaline metals which were collected from huangguaqing fig s1 4 2 tungsten and thiotungstates type a and type b hot springs were two orders of magnitude richer in tungsten than type c hot springs fig 3 their tungsten concentration ranged from 220 to 266 μg l 25 9 to 154 μg l and 0 16 to 0 37 μg l respectively although tungstate was the sole species of tungsten in type b and type c hot springs thiotungstates were detected in all the nine type a hot springs in banglazhang with high sulphide concentrations ranging from 1 0 to 13 6 mg l exceeding 8 0 mg l in five of nine springs the highest proportion of thiotungstates in total tungsten was 51 sample ll03 fig s2 of the four thiotungstates trithiotungstate was predominant in most banglazhang springs average 57 and maximum 87 of all thiotungstates and detected in all banglazhang samples tetrathiotungstate was also detected in all banglazhang samples but was present at lower proportions than trithiotungstate average 40 and maximum 80 of all thiotungstates dithiotungstate was detected in six of nine banglazhang springs average 3 and maximum 10 of all thiotungstates whereas monothiotungstate was not detected in any sample likely because of its high instability driven by quick transformation from monothiotungstate to dithiotungstate mohajerin et al 2014 4 3 other constituents liable to be thiolated of the elements liable to be thiolated including vanadium arsenic antimony molybdenum and tungsten the concentrations of arsenic in the neutral to alkaline hot springs were comparable or much higher than those of tungsten whereas vanadium antimony and molybdenum were much more depleted compared to tungsten table 1 fig s3 within the acidic hot springs the concentrations of arsenic vanadium antimony and molybdenum were all comparable or much higher than those of tungsten table 1 fig s3 nevertheless the thiolation of tungstate and its potential competing constituents in the acidic hot springs do not need to be considered because their sulphide concentrations were all lower than the detection limit thus it is reasonable to speculate that arsenic rather than vanadium antimony or molybdenum in the hot springs could affect thiolation of tungstate substantially and therefore arsenic speciation in the samples was also analysed unlike thiotungstates thioarsenates were present in all springs sampled even in those with sulphide concentrations lower than the detection limit with the exception of th04 this implies that trace sulphide though undetected may still be present in these springs alternatively there was possibly zero valent sulphur bound in the hot spring sediments with which the aqueous arsenic reacted nevertheless type b and type c springs characterised by low sulphide concentrations generally had low proportions of thioarsenates in total arsenic as expected mostly 5 likewise type a springs with high sulphide concentrations also contained a high proportion of thioarsenates in total arsenic ranging from 33 to 64 the primary thiolated arsenic species in the hot springs could be monothioarsenate dithioarsenate or trithioarsenate whereas tetrathioarsenate never became predominant in any spring and was detected in only 10 samples table 3 5 discussion 5 1 geochemical factors controlling the concentrations of tungsten in hot springs the huangguaqing hydrothermal area features ubiquitous fumaroles and acidic hot springs with small flow rates these acidic springs are rich in sulphate and poor in chloride and alkaline metal ions hence they are the condensate of the geothermal steam separated from reservoir fluids via adiabatic cooling or typical steam heated shallow waters as observed elsewhere globally in geothermal belts including waiotapu new zealand giggenbach et al 1994 wairakei new zealand giggenbach and stewart 1982 rehai china guo et al 2014a krýsuvik and námafjall iceland kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 and yellowstone usa nordstrom et al 2009 the acidic hot springs in huangguaqing are depleted in tungsten because both the geothermal steam and the shallow waters heated by the steam are tungsten depleted one could argue that the acidity of steam heated waters formed via oxidation of h2s in geothermal steam is capable of enhancing the leaching of shallow subsurface rocks thereby increasing their tungsten concentrations indeed the huangguaqing acidic springs have very high iron and aluminium concentrations 4 9 44 6 mg l and 3 3 57 4 mg l respectively suggesting the occurrence of such enhanced leaching however under acidic conditions the tungsten leached from rocks tends to precipitate as either tungsten oxide or sulphide minerals gustafsson 2003 sun and bostick 2015 which was likely responsible for the very low tungsten concentrations of the huangguaqing springs to validate this hypothesis we undertook batch reactor experiments to determine whether aqueous tungstate could precipitate in acidification under either oxidizing or sulphidic conditions upon being acidified tungsten in both tungstate bearing solutions and mixed tungstate sulphide solutions with different initial tungsten concentrations did precipitate or form colloids as indicated by the decrease in tungsten concentration in the solution with decreasing ph fig 4 light yellow and white precipitates were visible fig s4 when the ph of the mixed tungstate sulphide solutions and the tungstate solutions decreased to 1 in contrast to the low tungsten acidic hot springs the neutral to alkaline hot springs exhibited significantly higher tungsten concentrations primarily because tungsten in these geothermal waters leached from the host rocks at various reservoir temperatures is stable under neutral to alkaline conditions an approximate positive correlation between tungsten concentration and reservoir temperature estimated using the quartz geothermometer r2 0 638 p 0 001 fig 5 a confirmed that reservoir temperature is the primary factor controlling the concentration of tungsten in neutral to alkaline springs the neutral to alkaline springs from banglazhang also exhibited higher tungsten concentrations than those from the other hydrothermal areas and the positive correlation between tungsten concentration and reservoir temperature would be improved if the banglazhang samples were removed from the analyses r2 0 860 p 0 001 fig 5 b taking into account that the most distinct hydrochemical difference between the banglazhang samples and the other samples is that the former are characterised by much higher sulphide concentrations and proportions of thiotungstates in total tungsten we speculated that the formation of thiotungstates would substantially enhance the accumulation of tungsten in a hot spring the geochemical mechanism for this is that the formation of thiotungstates decreased the concentrations of tungstates in geothermal waters equilibrated with tungstate bearing minerals in reservoir host rocks which in turn facilitated the further dissolution of these minerals and increased the total tungsten concentration the effects of tungstate thiolation on the formation of high tungsten geothermal waters were demonstrated by the plots of tungstate and tungstate plus various thiotungstate species versus ph sulphide concentration and s ii w molar ratio of the neutral to alkaline hot springs fig 6 specifically there was an approximately positive relationship between tungstate or total tungsten concentrations and ph of the samples fig 6 a indicating high ph promoted an increasing aqueous tungsten concentration this relation however is essentially a reflection of the effects of thiotungstate formation under highly sulphidic conditions because high sulphide can only be found at high ph because the pk1 of h2s hs was approximately 7 which was confirmed by the stronger correlations between tungsten species concentrations and sulphide concentrations fig 6 b or s ii w ratios fig 6 c indeed at low ph 8 sulphide concentrations 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratios 100 the total tungsten concentrations of samples were generally low without a contribution from thiotungstates whereas at higher ph sulphide concentrations and s ii w ratios the total tungsten concentrations were correspondingly higher because of larger contributions of thiotungstates 5 2 conditions critical to substantial formation of thiotungstates in hot springs as discussed above the occurrence of thiotungstates in hot springs is crucial to their tungsten geochemistry therefore a more detailed analysis was made to clarify the geochemical conditions critical to the formation of thiotungstates it seems that high ph and low eh facilitate tungstate thiolation fig s5 a and b however all of these high thiotungstates samples with high ph and low eh were collected from banglazhang some samples collected from other hydrothermal areas with low sulphide concentrations though with high ph and low eh exhibited low proportions of thiotungstates in total tungsten moreover not all the banglazhang samples have high proportions of thiotungstates and appreciable percentages of thiotungstates were detected only in six banglazhang samples all of which were characterised by very high sulphide concentrations 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratios 100 fig s5c and d thus tungsten in all the other samples with sulphide concentrations lower than 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratios 100 either from banglazhang or from other hydrothermal areas was not highly thiolated regardless of its ph and eh values ph affects tungsten speciation in sulphidic water to some degree mohajerin et al 2014 to compare the theoretical and practical effects of ph on the thiolation of tungstate we simulated the formation of thiotungstates at various ph values and s ii w molar ratios using phreeqc with updated thermodynamic data for tungstates thiotungstates and polytungstates the results fig 7 demonstrated that the optimal ph range for thiotungstate formation is approximately 5 6 at ph 3 or 8 the concentration of thiotungstates relative to total tungsten became negligible and polymeric and monomeric tungstates predominated at ph 3 and ph 8 respectively in contrast to these modelling results the field measurements of tungsten speciation in the banglazhang hot springs exhibited a significant difference fig 7 the ph of all banglazhang samples ranged from 8 0 to 9 7 that is much higher than 5 6 however samples with ph 8 9 such as ll00 ll02 and ll06 exhibited high proportions of thiotungstates ca 30 and samples ll03 and ll07 with ph values of 9 1 and 9 2 respectively were characterised by even higher proportions 51 and 35 respectively nevertheless the simulations were capable of approximating the effects of s ii w molar ratio on the thiolation of tungstate the simulated proportions of thiolated tungstates generally increased with increasing s ii w molar ratios thiotungstates accounted for 10 of total tungsten unless s ii w molar ratios exceeded 100 with an s ii w ratio of 500 the proportions of thiotungstates could exceed 30 thus for a dynamic hydrothermal system tungsten speciation in geothermal water can be affected by s ii w ratio or ratio of s ii to all s ii affine metal loid s much more strongly than by ph the large discrepancies with respect to the effects of ph between the measured and thermodynamically calculated tungsten speciation in the banglazhang samples are probably attributable to transformation kinetics among tungsten species or the inherent uncertainties in the thermodynamic stabilities of tungsten species in addition to sulphide concentration and s ii w ratio total arsenic concentration is also expected to strongly affect the formation of thiotungstates via competitive thiolation between arsenic and tungsten it is commonly regarded that the oxyanions of arsenic are more liable to be thiolated than those of other metal loid s whose thiolated species in natural waters were investigated in recent years including antimony molybdenum and tungsten for example the thiolation of antimony could be effectively inhibited by cooccurring arsenic because thioarsenates are kinetically more stable than thioantimonates planer friedrich and wilson 2012 in the hot spring samples collected from the yellowstone national park usa the proportion of thiomolybdate in total molybdenum was much lower than that of thioarsenate in total arsenic lohmayer et al 2015 compared to molybdenum tungsten exhibits a lower thiolation tendency because the formation constants for thiotungstates are approximately two orders of magnitude lower than those for thiomolybdates mohajerin et al 2014 and therefore thiotungstates would be theoretically more difficult to form in the presence of cooccurring arsenic the arsenic and tungsten species measured in the hot springs in this study demonstrate that although both thioarsenates and thiotungstates seldom occurred in association with very low sulphide concentrations 0 05 mg l cooccurring arsenic affected the formation of thiotungstates at sulphide concentrations exceeding 0 05 mg l and lower than 5 mg l figs s5 and s6 that is arsenic in the hot springs could be highly thiolated and this could effectively prevent tungstate from being thiolated at these moderate sulphide concentrations typical examples of this are th02 th03 th05 lp01 and hb02 with sulphide concentrations ranging from 0 09 to 0 69 mg l the proportion of thioarsenate to total arsenic ranged between 26 4 and 69 7 but thiotungstates were not detected figs s5 and s6 even banglazhang samples ll04 ll05 and ll08 with sulphide concentrations to 1 0 3 6 and 2 9 mg l respectively were characterised by relatively high proportions of thioarsenate 37 6 34 9 and 32 7 respectively but very low proportions of thiotungstate 0 5 0 6 and 1 9 respectively however in the sulphide rich 5 mg l geothermal waters the substantial amounts of thiotungstates could be formed despite the cooccurrence of arsenic due to the large excess of sulphide the banglazhang hot springs ll00 ll01 ll02 ll03 ll06 and ll07 having as w molar ratios between 0 7 and 1 2 table 2 were discharging geothermal waters with high proportions of both thioarsenates and thiotungstates fig s5e and f the intricate relations between the formation of thiotungstates or thioarsenates and the relative abundance of sulphide in contrast to total tungsten and total arsenic in the hot springs could be explained more easily when the proportions of thiotungstates relative to total tungsten and thioarsenates relative to total arsenic were plotted against the s ii w as molar ratios of the hot springs fig 8 little thiotungstates or thioarsenates were formed at low s ii w as molar ratios 2 at moderate s ii w as ratios ranging from 2 to 50 the substantial amounts of thioarsenates were formed but thiotungstates were not formed in contrast both thiotungstates and thioarsenates were formed at s ii w as ratios exceeding 50 this implies that the cooccurrence of arsenic largely inhibited the thiolation of tungstate at low to moderate sulphide concentrations but with a large excess of sulphide both tungsten and arsenic in the hot springs tended to be thiolated 5 3 environmental implications of formation of hot springs rich in tungsten and thiotungstates in addition to the tengchong longling geothermal region there are numerous hot springs in the rest of the yst geothermal province tong and zhang 1994 tong et al 2000 the insights obtained in this study contributed to a deeper understanding of the environmental and hydrological implications of tungsten and its speciation in the hot springs in the yst geothermal province where few studies focusing on geothermal tungsten and its environmental effects have been conducted first this study demonstrated that neutral to alkaline hot springs tend to have much higher tungsten concentrations than acidic hot springs due to their geochemical geneses in the yst geothermal province especially in tibet neutral to alkaline geothermal waters predominate over acidic geothermal waters guo et al 2014a guo et al 2014b which may result in the prevalence of tungsten rich hot springs in this region furthermore this study suggests that the substantial formation of thiotungstates under extreme sulphidic conditions facilitates the enrichment of tungsten in hot springs and sulphide rich hot springs are likely to be widely distributed in the yst geothermal province because many yst geothermal systems are heated by magmas guo et al 2014a guo et al 2019b which release magmatic h2s and so2 for example 9 out of 76 hot springs recorded in the monograph thermal springs in tibet by tong et al 2000 have sulphide concentrations exceeding 5 mg l there could be many more hot springs with 5 mg l sulphide in the yst geothermal province because the sulphide concentrations of many such springs have yet to be analysed hence thiotungstates may prevail in the sulphide rich yst hot springs further increasing their tungsten concentrations more importantly it is common in all hot springs in a hydrothermal area in the yst geothermal province to discharge into a river serving as the local drinking water source including the xiangbai river in the banglazhang hydrothermal area guo et al 2017 the zangbo river in the yangbajain hydrothermal area guo et al 2007 the luolang river in the yangyi hydrothermal area guo et al 2009 the changma river in the daggyai hydrothermal area liu et al 2019 and the zaotang river in the rehai hydrothermal area liu et al 2015 thus it is possible that tungsten related environmental problems occur somewhere in the yst geothermal province a comprehensive investigation of the distribution of geothermal tungsten and its speciation in the yst hydrothermal areas as well as the environmental effects of those tungsten rich hot springs is therefore necessary and urgent 6 conclusions the hot springs in the tengchong longling geothermal region feature various hydrochemical types and a wide range of tungsten concentrations of the neutral to alkaline hot springs those with very high sulphide concentrations and detectable thiotungstates have the highest total tungsten concentrations suggesting that the formation of thiotungstates in the geothermal waters could facilitate the further dissolution of tungsten bearing minerals in the host rocks hence the thiolation of tungstate in geothermal water has a significant effect on tungsten geochemical processes in hydrothermal systems sulphide concentration and s ii w ratio were the most important hydrochemical factors controlling the formation of thiotungstates for the hot springs in the study areas the thresholds of sulphide concentration 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratio 100 were apparent beyond which the dissolved tungstate could be highly thiolated in the dynamic hydrothermal systems investigated in this study ph did not affect the thiolation of tungstate as strongly as the geochemical modelling based on the thermodynamic data of various tungsten species studied the banglazhang samples with the highest proportions of thiotungstates of total tungsten exhibited ph values of 8 0 9 5 much higher than the theoretical optimal ph range 5 6 for thiotungstate formation furthermore cooccurring arsenic could affect the tungsten speciation in the hot springs provided that sulphide concentrations and s ii w molar ratios were lower than 5 mg l and 100 respectively with a large excess of sulphide that is s ii w as molar ratio 50 however thiolation of tungstate in geothermal water cannot be inhibited by the cooccurrence of arsenic six banglazhang samples with sulphide concentrations exceeding 5 mg l have the proportions of thiotungstates of total tungsten at the same order of magnitude as those of the proportions of thioarsenates of total arsenic taking into account that the total molar concentrations of tungsten and arsenic in these banglazhang samples were similar we speculated that these two constituents exhibit comparable tendencies for being thiolated under the hydrogeochemical conditions in the banglazhang hydrothermal system credit authorship contribution statement qinghai guo conceptualization methodology investigation writing original

4062,tungsten is a toxic trace element that poses a threat to the environment and human health especially in places where it occurs in high concentrations such as geothermal areas in the present study hydrochemical processes controlling tungsten concentrations in various types of geothermal waters and the effects of thiolation on tungsten geochemistry were investigated in the tengchong longling geothermal region china neutral to alkaline hot springs which are the majority of springs in tengchong longling and globally exhibited much higher tungsten concentrations than acidic hot springs within the neutral to alkaline springs total tungsten concentration correlated with reservoir temperatures and springs rich in sulphide exhibited higher total tungsten concentrations than those with low or no detectable sulphide the formation of thiotungstates apparently increased total tungsten solubility results from thermodynamic equilibrium modelling did not match measured data and the extent of thiolation was over and under predicted at low and high ph respectively cooccurring arsenic substantially inhibited the thiolation of tungsten at sulphide concentrations and s ii w as ratios of 5 mg l and 50 respectively above these limits however tungsten and arsenic had comparable tendencies of being thiolated the present study suggests that consideration of thiotungstates which is seldom done is necessary when studying tungsten hydrochemistry of sulphidic natural waters and current thermodynamic constants are not suitable for predictions in dynamic systems including hydrothermal

arsenic and antimony in sulphidic waters either natural waters or artificial solutions were reported as well and have received increasing attention ullrich et al 2013 planer friedrich et al 2020 the most commonly described thiospecies in natural waters are thioarsenates asvsno4 n 3 n 1 4 which have been detected in geothermal waters planer friedrich et al 2007 paddy pore waters wang et al 2020

in their groundwater samples using the equilibrium constants for thiomolybdate species because reliable stability constants for the formation of four thiotungstates were not available at that time and the stability constants for thiotungstates should be similar to those for analogous thiomolybdates determined earlier subsequently most studies mohajerin et al 2014 mohajerin et al 2016 cui et al 2020 concerning the thiolation of tungstate in natural waters were made based on geochemical simulations using the equilibrium constants for the formation of thiotungstates to our knowledge measured thiotungstate concentrations in natural waters have been reported only by planer friedrich et al 2020 in recent years the toxicity of tungsten has received increased attention because of its potential role in the leukaemia cluster events in nevada usa in the early 2000s uscdc 2003 and the possibility that exposure to the elevated concentrations of tungsten may result in various pathological changes or diseases including rhabdomyosarcoma lung inflammation and dna damage in bone marrow kalinich et al 2005 roedel et al 2012 kelly et al 2013 george et al 2015 natural waters are one of the most important environmental media containing tungsten most natural waters have relatively low tungsten concentrations such as meteoric waters kist 1994 seawaters kunzendorf and glasby 1992 sohrin et al 1999 river waters van der sloot et al 1985 mohajerin et al 2014 mohajerin et al 2016 and non thermal groundwaters unrelated to tungsten bearing ores johannesson et al 2013 in contrast geothermal waters especially high temperature neutral to alkaline geothermal waters tend to be of higher tungsten concentrations hall et al 1988 koutsospyros et al 2006 arnórsson and óskarsson 2007 guo et al 2019a and thereby may pose a severe threat to the environment and human health mccleskey et al 2010 since these high temperature tungsten bearing geothermal waters typically are rich in sulphide guo et al 2019a planer friedrich et al 2020 the thiolation of tungstate may occur and influence total tungsten hydrogeochemistry tengchong longling a typical geothermal region located in the yunnan sichuan tibet yst geothermal province the sole high temperature geothermal province in mainland china is characterised by the occurrence of hot springs with various hydrochemical types and a wide range of tungsten concentrations some hot springs in tengchong longling have extremely high sulphide concentrations to a maximum of 13 6 mg l however to date there have been few systematic studies on tungsten in the tengchong longling hot springs little is known about the potential formation of thiotungstates in these hot springs and its effects on tungsten hydrochemical processes therein therefore the aims of this study were to a investigate tungsten speciation in representative tengchong longling hot springs b evaluate the effects of tungstate thiolation on tungsten hydrochemical processes c identify the geochemical conditions critical to the substantial formation of thiotungstates and d clarify the significance of thiotungstates in sulphidic geothermal waters this work represents the first study of thiotungstates in natural waters in china 2 regional setting and geology the tengchong longling geothermal region representative of those in the yst geothermal province in china belongs to the global mediterranean himalayas geothermal belt tong and zhang 1994 a subtropical monsoon climate prevails in tengchong longling with mean annual air temperature and annual rainfall of 14 8 c and 1470 mm respectively tong and zhang 1989 the topography of the region is high in the north and the east and low in the south and the west late cenozoic volcanic rocks including basalt andesite basalt andesite and dacite are widely distributed in the region the youngest volcano the heikong hill has an age of only 7 14 ka based on k ar dating nakai et al 1993 in addition to volcanic rocks granite migmatitic granite syenite granodiorite and quartz porphyry also outcrop in the region fig 1 dozens of geothermal areas featuring strong hydrothermal activities are situated in tengchong longling which are hydrogeologically semi independent of one another tong and zhang 1989 the reservoir host rocks of these hydrothermal systems are predominantly felsic rocks geothermal water recharge mainly occurs via the vertical seepage of meteoric water in northern and eastern mountainous areas with the highest elevation to 3780 m the seepage of rainfall occurring locally in each hydrothermal area should also be considered as a potential recharge source hot springs are the sole path of geothermal water discharge in most hydrothermal areas in general infiltrating groundwaters in the tengchong longling region flow from the north and the east to the south and the west tong and zhang 1989 however specific groundwater flow directions in each hydrothermal area are varied and difficult to identify because these hydrothermal areas have not been extensively explored and few boreholes have been drilled into the reservoirs to collect detailed hydrogeological data banglazhang ruidian xinhua langpu hubang and huangguaqing were selected as the hydrothermal areas in the tengchong longling region for the study fig 1 because the hot springs located there cover a wide range of ph values 2 2 9 7 and a large range of tungsten 0 16 265 9 μg l and sulphide 0 13 6 mg l concentrations all these hydrothermal systems are unexplored and their reservoir host rocks are speculated to be granite for ruidian xinhua and hubang or sandstone for banglazhang langpu and huangguaqing based on the local surface geology no boreholes have been drilled in these areas sandstone and granite have comparable tungsten contents 1 35 ppm for an international sandstone standard hu and gao 2008 and on average 1 4 ppm for upper crust composed primarily of granites wedepohl 1995 hu and gao 2008 and therefore the difference in reservoir lithology could have minimal impact on the variation of tungsten concentrations in the geothermal waters investigated in this study nevertheless it is worth noting that the above descriptions of the reservoir hostrocks are speculative in view of a lack of direct evidence a clear understanding of the reservoir geology requires an elaborate geological exploration in the future including effective geophysical investigations as well as boreholes drilled into the reservoirs banglazhang is the most geothermally active and is marked by the most intensive hydrothermal activities among the selected systems however although the geophysical and geological investigations made in the neighbouring regions of banglazhang indicate that the banglazhang system is likely to be located above the margin of a comparatively shallow seated magma chamber lou et al 2002 zhao 2008 the hydrochemical and o h and s isotopic evidence does not imply a mixing of magmatic fluid with the banglazhang geothermal waters that is a direct input of magmatic fluid to the banglazhang hydrothermal system guo et al 2017 the situation is similar for the other systems including ruidian xinhua and hubang tong and zhang 1989 thus the hydrogeochemistry of the geothermal waters in the selected hydrothermal systems including tungsten hydrogeochemistry is predominantly controlled by interactions between infiltrating waters and reservoir host rocks furthermore these hot springs generally discharge into local rivers which are used as drinking water sources such as the xiangbai river receiving the banglazhang hot spring waters and therefore tungsten and other harmful constituents in the springs represent a threat to local residents 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis hot spring samples 34 were collected from tengchong longling in march april 2019 the dry season the specific sampling sites are shown in fig 1 including the banglazhang nine springs sampled ruidian eight springs sampled xinhua six springs sampled langpu three springs sampled hubang three springs sampled and huangguaqing areas five springs sampled temperature ph eh and electrical conductivity of each hot spring were determined in situ with hand held meters calibrated prior to sampling table 1 high density polyethylene bottles for sampling were soaked in 5 hcl rinsed with deionized water three times in the lab and then rinsed with filtered hot spring water through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes immediately before sampling all samples except those for the analysis of alkalinity were filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membranes total alkalinity and sulphide were analysed on site using the gran titration and methylene blue methods using a hach colorimeter respectively for the analysis of major anions no chemical agents were added to the sample splits whereas reagent grade 14 m hno3 was added to the sample splits to bring ph to 1 prior to the determination of the concentrations of metal loid elements the analysis of total tungsten used unacidified sample splits to avoid potential precipitation of tungstite wo3 or tungstenite ws2 furthermore stoichiometric 30 h2o2 in addition to 14 m hno3 was used to pretreat one sample split collected at each spring for the analysis of mo sb and as converting all the molybdenum antimony and arsenic species to molybdate antimonate and arsenate respectively which prevented these elements from precipitating under acidic conditions in the laboratory the concentrations of na k ca mg si w mo v sb as li rb cs sr ba b al and fe were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms and those of so4 2 cl f and br by ion chromatography ic to avoid clogging the nebulizer and sampling cone of the icp ms the hot spring samples were generally diluted five times with 2 nitric acid before analysis with the high concentration elements na k ca and si being further diluted five times the accuracy of the analyses was evaluated using a standard addition recovery test the recoveries of spiked standards ranged from 95 to 103 the limits of detection and the limits of quantification calculated as three times the standard deviation of the concentration of each constituent in the blank and by multiplying 10 times the standard deviation of the procedure blank concentration by the dilution factor respectively were sufficient for the measurements of the target constituents in the hot spring samples the hydrochemical analysis results are summarized in table 1 and table s1 sample splits for the analysis of tungsten and arsenic speciation were collected as promptly as possible filtered immediately flash frozen in dry ice on site and stored frozen at 20 c until analysis tungsten species tungstate monothiotungstate dithiotungstate trithiotungstate and tetrathiotungstate were determined using reverse phase ion pair chromatographic ics 3000 sp dionex separation followed by icp ms xseries2 thermo scientific analysis in the standard mode at the environmental geochemistry laboratory of university bayreuth germany tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and a 10 25 gradient elution of 2 propanol were used as the ion pair reagent and the eluent respectively thiolated tungstates were quantified via a tungstate calibration curve the lowest concentration that could be identified as an individual peak from the baseline during chromatographic separation was 0 003 μg l the concentrations of tungsten species in the banglazhang hot spring samples are presented in table 2 only tungstate was detected in samples from the other hydrothermal areas arsenic speciation was analysed at the environmental geochemistry laboratory of university bayreuth germany using aec icp ms a coupled system of anion exchange chromatography and icp ms specifically the arsenic species in the hot spring samples were separated via ion chromatography ionpac ag as16 using gradient elution of 20 100 mm naoh at 1 2 ml min 1 and then detected by icp ms arsenic and sulphur species were determined in oxygen mode arsenite and arsenate were quantified via their respective calibration standards whereas thioarsenates were quantified using the calibration of arsenate because of the lack of commercially available thioarsenate standards the arsenic speciation in all the hot spring samples is presented in table 3 3 2 lab experiments a series of lab experiments were conducted to judge if aqueous tungstate could precipitate upon acidification under either oxidizing or sulfidic conditions specifically tungstate bearing solutions and mixed tungstate sulfide solutions at a fixed s ii w molar ratio 40 with tungsten concentrations of 100 and 1000 μmol l were acidified using hcl to ph 5 4 3 2 and 1 the original tungstate bearing solutions and mixed tungstate sulfide solutions were prepared with na2wo4 2h2o and na2s 9h2o all the procedures were performed in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere to maintain anoxic conditions the tungsten concentrations in the acidified solutions were measured using icp ms 3 3 geothermometer measurements geothermometers have been proposed and widely applied to calculate reservoir temperature in recent past decades with the concentrations of relevant chemical constituents in a hot spring sample the corresponding reservoir temperature can be estimated based on temperature dependent subsurface water rock equilibria in this work the quartz geothermometer giggenbach et al 1994 was used to calculate reservoir temperatures which were then employed to evaluate their effects on the tungsten concentrations in the geothermal waters 3 4 geochemical modelling to evaluate the theoretical effects of ph and sulphide concentration on tungsten speciation simulations were made at various ph values and sulphide concentrations and a fixed total tungsten concentration of 100 μg l using phreeqc combined with the wateq4f database parkhurst and appelo 1999 this was updated in advance with thermodynamic data for thiotungstates from mohajerin et al 2014 for tungstates from smith and martell 2004 and for polytungstates from cruywagen and van der merwe 1987 smith and martell 2004 and rozantsev and sazonova 2005 table s2 an example of the phreeqc input files is presented in the supplementary data notably we set the modelling temperature to 25 c instead of reservoir or sampling temperatures because the enthalpy changes for the transformation reactions among various tungsten species are unavailable in the literature from which we acquired chemical equilibrium constants at standard state conditions without the enthalpy changes for the transformation reactions the chemical equilibrium constants at non standard state conditions that is at reservoir or sampling temperatures could not be calculated accordingly aqueous tungsten speciation at reservoir or sampling temperatures could not be simulated thus even if we had set reservoir or sampling temperatures as the modelling temperature the simulation results would have still been the same as those obtained at 25 c 4 results 4 1 general hydrochemistry the hot springs sampled in this study covered a wide range of ph values 2 2 9 7 and sulphide 0 13 6 mg l and tungsten 0 16 265 9 μg l concentrations table 1 the samples were divided into three hydrochemical types according to their ph and sulphide concentrations a neutral or alkaline waters with high sulphide concentrations b neutral or alkaline waters with low sulphide concentrations and c acid waters with low sulphide concentrations fig 2 type a samples were collected from banglazhang and had hco3 and na as the major anion and cation respectively fig s1 type b samples were collected from ruidian xinhua langpu and hubang and were characterised as na hco3 waters fig s1 in contrast type c samples were so4 rich waters with more dissolved alkaline earth metals than alkaline metals which were collected from huangguaqing fig s1 4 2 tungsten and thiotungstates type a and type b hot springs were two orders of magnitude richer in tungsten than type c hot springs fig 3 their tungsten concentration ranged from 220 to 266 μg l 25 9 to 154 μg l and 0 16 to 0 37 μg l respectively although tungstate was the sole species of tungsten in type b and type c hot springs thiotungstates were detected in all the nine type a hot springs in banglazhang with high sulphide concentrations ranging from 1 0 to 13 6 mg l exceeding 8 0 mg l in five of nine springs the highest proportion of thiotungstates in total tungsten was 51 sample ll03 fig s2 of the four thiotungstates trithiotungstate was predominant in most banglazhang springs average 57 and maximum 87 of all thiotungstates and detected in all banglazhang samples tetrathiotungstate was also detected in all banglazhang samples but was present at lower proportions than trithiotungstate average 40 and maximum 80 of all thiotungstates dithiotungstate was detected in six of nine banglazhang springs average 3 and maximum 10 of all thiotungstates whereas monothiotungstate was not detected in any sample likely because of its high instability driven by quick transformation from monothiotungstate to dithiotungstate mohajerin et al 2014 4 3 other constituents liable to be thiolated of the elements liable to be thiolated including vanadium arsenic antimony molybdenum and tungsten the concentrations of arsenic in the neutral to alkaline hot springs were comparable or much higher than those of tungsten whereas vanadium antimony and molybdenum were much more depleted compared to tungsten table 1 fig s3 within the acidic hot springs the concentrations of arsenic vanadium antimony and molybdenum were all comparable or much higher than those of tungsten table 1 fig s3 nevertheless the thiolation of tungstate and its potential competing constituents in the acidic hot springs do not need to be considered because their sulphide concentrations were all lower than the detection limit thus it is reasonable to speculate that arsenic rather than vanadium antimony or molybdenum in the hot springs could affect thiolation of tungstate substantially and therefore arsenic speciation in the samples was also analysed unlike thiotungstates thioarsenates were present in all springs sampled even in those with sulphide concentrations lower than the detection limit with the exception of th04 this implies that trace sulphide though undetected may still be present in these springs alternatively there was possibly zero valent sulphur bound in the hot spring sediments with which the aqueous arsenic reacted nevertheless type b and type c springs characterised by low sulphide concentrations generally had low proportions of thioarsenates in total arsenic as expected mostly 5 likewise type a springs with high sulphide concentrations also contained a high proportion of thioarsenates in total arsenic ranging from 33 to 64 the primary thiolated arsenic species in the hot springs could be monothioarsenate dithioarsenate or trithioarsenate whereas tetrathioarsenate never became predominant in any spring and was detected in only 10 samples table 3 5 discussion 5 1 geochemical factors controlling the concentrations of tungsten in hot springs the huangguaqing hydrothermal area features ubiquitous fumaroles and acidic hot springs with small flow rates these acidic springs are rich in sulphate and poor in chloride and alkaline metal ions hence they are the condensate of the geothermal steam separated from reservoir fluids via adiabatic cooling or typical steam heated shallow waters as observed elsewhere globally in geothermal belts including waiotapu new zealand giggenbach et al 1994 wairakei new zealand giggenbach and stewart 1982 rehai china guo et al 2014a krýsuvik and námafjall iceland kaasalainen and stefansson 2012 and yellowstone usa nordstrom et al 2009 the acidic hot springs in huangguaqing are depleted in tungsten because both the geothermal steam and the shallow waters heated by the steam are tungsten depleted one could argue that the acidity of steam heated waters formed via oxidation of h2s in geothermal steam is capable of enhancing the leaching of shallow subsurface rocks thereby increasing their tungsten concentrations indeed the huangguaqing acidic springs have very high iron and aluminium concentrations 4 9 44 6 mg l and 3 3 57 4 mg l respectively suggesting the occurrence of such enhanced leaching however under acidic conditions the tungsten leached from rocks tends to precipitate as either tungsten oxide or sulphide minerals gustafsson 2003 sun and bostick 2015 which was likely responsible for the very low tungsten concentrations of the huangguaqing springs to validate this hypothesis we undertook batch reactor experiments to determine whether aqueous tungstate could precipitate in acidification under either oxidizing or sulphidic conditions upon being acidified tungsten in both tungstate bearing solutions and mixed tungstate sulphide solutions with different initial tungsten concentrations did precipitate or form colloids as indicated by the decrease in tungsten concentration in the solution with decreasing ph fig 4 light yellow and white precipitates were visible fig s4 when the ph of the mixed tungstate sulphide solutions and the tungstate solutions decreased to 1 in contrast to the low tungsten acidic hot springs the neutral to alkaline hot springs exhibited significantly higher tungsten concentrations primarily because tungsten in these geothermal waters leached from the host rocks at various reservoir temperatures is stable under neutral to alkaline conditions an approximate positive correlation between tungsten concentration and reservoir temperature estimated using the quartz geothermometer r2 0 638 p 0 001 fig 5 a confirmed that reservoir temperature is the primary factor controlling the concentration of tungsten in neutral to alkaline springs the neutral to alkaline springs from banglazhang also exhibited higher tungsten concentrations than those from the other hydrothermal areas and the positive correlation between tungsten concentration and reservoir temperature would be improved if the banglazhang samples were removed from the analyses r2 0 860 p 0 001 fig 5 b taking into account that the most distinct hydrochemical difference between the banglazhang samples and the other samples is that the former are characterised by much higher sulphide concentrations and proportions of thiotungstates in total tungsten we speculated that the formation of thiotungstates would substantially enhance the accumulation of tungsten in a hot spring the geochemical mechanism for this is that the formation of thiotungstates decreased the concentrations of tungstates in geothermal waters equilibrated with tungstate bearing minerals in reservoir host rocks which in turn facilitated the further dissolution of these minerals and increased the total tungsten concentration the effects of tungstate thiolation on the formation of high tungsten geothermal waters were demonstrated by the plots of tungstate and tungstate plus various thiotungstate species versus ph sulphide concentration and s ii w molar ratio of the neutral to alkaline hot springs fig 6 specifically there was an approximately positive relationship between tungstate or total tungsten concentrations and ph of the samples fig 6 a indicating high ph promoted an increasing aqueous tungsten concentration this relation however is essentially a reflection of the effects of thiotungstate formation under highly sulphidic conditions because high sulphide can only be found at high ph because the pk1 of h2s hs was approximately 7 which was confirmed by the stronger correlations between tungsten species concentrations and sulphide concentrations fig 6 b or s ii w ratios fig 6 c indeed at low ph 8 sulphide concentrations 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratios 100 the total tungsten concentrations of samples were generally low without a contribution from thiotungstates whereas at higher ph sulphide concentrations and s ii w ratios the total tungsten concentrations were correspondingly higher because of larger contributions of thiotungstates 5 2 conditions critical to substantial formation of thiotungstates in hot springs as discussed above the occurrence of thiotungstates in hot springs is crucial to their tungsten geochemistry therefore a more detailed analysis was made to clarify the geochemical conditions critical to the formation of thiotungstates it seems that high ph and low eh facilitate tungstate thiolation fig s5 a and b however all of these high thiotungstates samples with high ph and low eh were collected from banglazhang some samples collected from other hydrothermal areas with low sulphide concentrations though with high ph and low eh exhibited low proportions of thiotungstates in total tungsten moreover not all the banglazhang samples have high proportions of thiotungstates and appreciable percentages of thiotungstates were detected only in six banglazhang samples all of which were characterised by very high sulphide concentrations 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratios 100 fig s5c and d thus tungsten in all the other samples with sulphide concentrations lower than 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratios 100 either from banglazhang or from other hydrothermal areas was not highly thiolated regardless of its ph and eh values ph affects tungsten speciation in sulphidic water to some degree mohajerin et al 2014 to compare the theoretical and practical effects of ph on the thiolation of tungstate we simulated the formation of thiotungstates at various ph values and s ii w molar ratios using phreeqc with updated thermodynamic data for tungstates thiotungstates and polytungstates the results fig 7 demonstrated that the optimal ph range for thiotungstate formation is approximately 5 6 at ph 3 or 8 the concentration of thiotungstates relative to total tungsten became negligible and polymeric and monomeric tungstates predominated at ph 3 and ph 8 respectively in contrast to these modelling results the field measurements of tungsten speciation in the banglazhang hot springs exhibited a significant difference fig 7 the ph of all banglazhang samples ranged from 8 0 to 9 7 that is much higher than 5 6 however samples with ph 8 9 such as ll00 ll02 and ll06 exhibited high proportions of thiotungstates ca 30 and samples ll03 and ll07 with ph values of 9 1 and 9 2 respectively were characterised by even higher proportions 51 and 35 respectively nevertheless the simulations were capable of approximating the effects of s ii w molar ratio on the thiolation of tungstate the simulated proportions of thiolated tungstates generally increased with increasing s ii w molar ratios thiotungstates accounted for 10 of total tungsten unless s ii w molar ratios exceeded 100 with an s ii w ratio of 500 the proportions of thiotungstates could exceed 30 thus for a dynamic hydrothermal system tungsten speciation in geothermal water can be affected by s ii w ratio or ratio of s ii to all s ii affine metal loid s much more strongly than by ph the large discrepancies with respect to the effects of ph between the measured and thermodynamically calculated tungsten speciation in the banglazhang samples are probably attributable to transformation kinetics among tungsten species or the inherent uncertainties in the thermodynamic stabilities of tungsten species in addition to sulphide concentration and s ii w ratio total arsenic concentration is also expected to strongly affect the formation of thiotungstates via competitive thiolation between arsenic and tungsten it is commonly regarded that the oxyanions of arsenic are more liable to be thiolated than those of other metal loid s whose thiolated species in natural waters were investigated in recent years including antimony molybdenum and tungsten for example the thiolation of antimony could be effectively inhibited by cooccurring arsenic because thioarsenates are kinetically more stable than thioantimonates planer friedrich and wilson 2012 in the hot spring samples collected from the yellowstone national park usa the proportion of thiomolybdate in total molybdenum was much lower than that of thioarsenate in total arsenic lohmayer et al 2015 compared to molybdenum tungsten exhibits a lower thiolation tendency because the formation constants for thiotungstates are approximately two orders of magnitude lower than those for thiomolybdates mohajerin et al 2014 and therefore thiotungstates would be theoretically more difficult to form in the presence of cooccurring arsenic the arsenic and tungsten species measured in the hot springs in this study demonstrate that although both thioarsenates and thiotungstates seldom occurred in association with very low sulphide concentrations 0 05 mg l cooccurring arsenic affected the formation of thiotungstates at sulphide concentrations exceeding 0 05 mg l and lower than 5 mg l figs s5 and s6 that is arsenic in the hot springs could be highly thiolated and this could effectively prevent tungstate from being thiolated at these moderate sulphide concentrations typical examples of this are th02 th03 th05 lp01 and hb02 with sulphide concentrations ranging from 0 09 to 0 69 mg l the proportion of thioarsenate to total arsenic ranged between 26 4 and 69 7 but thiotungstates were not detected figs s5 and s6 even banglazhang samples ll04 ll05 and ll08 with sulphide concentrations to 1 0 3 6 and 2 9 mg l respectively were characterised by relatively high proportions of thioarsenate 37 6 34 9 and 32 7 respectively but very low proportions of thiotungstate 0 5 0 6 and 1 9 respectively however in the sulphide rich 5 mg l geothermal waters the substantial amounts of thiotungstates could be formed despite the cooccurrence of arsenic due to the large excess of sulphide the banglazhang hot springs ll00 ll01 ll02 ll03 ll06 and ll07 having as w molar ratios between 0 7 and 1 2 table 2 were discharging geothermal waters with high proportions of both thioarsenates and thiotungstates fig s5e and f the intricate relations between the formation of thiotungstates or thioarsenates and the relative abundance of sulphide in contrast to total tungsten and total arsenic in the hot springs could be explained more easily when the proportions of thiotungstates relative to total tungsten and thioarsenates relative to total arsenic were plotted against the s ii w as molar ratios of the hot springs fig 8 little thiotungstates or thioarsenates were formed at low s ii w as molar ratios 2 at moderate s ii w as ratios ranging from 2 to 50 the substantial amounts of thioarsenates were formed but thiotungstates were not formed in contrast both thiotungstates and thioarsenates were formed at s ii w as ratios exceeding 50 this implies that the cooccurrence of arsenic largely inhibited the thiolation of tungstate at low to moderate sulphide concentrations but with a large excess of sulphide both tungsten and arsenic in the hot springs tended to be thiolated 5 3 environmental implications of formation of hot springs rich in tungsten and thiotungstates in addition to the tengchong longling geothermal region there are numerous hot springs in the rest of the yst geothermal province tong and zhang 1994 tong et al 2000 the insights obtained in this study contributed to a deeper understanding of the environmental and hydrological implications of tungsten and its speciation in the hot springs in the yst geothermal province where few studies focusing on geothermal tungsten and its environmental effects have been conducted first this study demonstrated that neutral to alkaline hot springs tend to have much higher tungsten concentrations than acidic hot springs due to their geochemical geneses in the yst geothermal province especially in tibet neutral to alkaline geothermal waters predominate over acidic geothermal waters guo et al 2014a guo et al 2014b which may result in the prevalence of tungsten rich hot springs in this region furthermore this study suggests that the substantial formation of thiotungstates under extreme sulphidic conditions facilitates the enrichment of tungsten in hot springs and sulphide rich hot springs are likely to be widely distributed in the yst geothermal province because many yst geothermal systems are heated by magmas guo et al 2014a guo et al 2019b which release magmatic h2s and so2 for example 9 out of 76 hot springs recorded in the monograph thermal springs in tibet by tong et al 2000 have sulphide concentrations exceeding 5 mg l there could be many more hot springs with 5 mg l sulphide in the yst geothermal province because the sulphide concentrations of many such springs have yet to be analysed hence thiotungstates may prevail in the sulphide rich yst hot springs further increasing their tungsten concentrations more importantly it is common in all hot springs in a hydrothermal area in the yst geothermal province to discharge into a river serving as the local drinking water source including the xiangbai river in the banglazhang hydrothermal area guo et al 2017 the zangbo river in the yangbajain hydrothermal area guo et al 2007 the luolang river in the yangyi hydrothermal area guo et al 2009 the changma river in the daggyai hydrothermal area liu et al 2019 and the zaotang river in the rehai hydrothermal area liu et al 2015 thus it is possible that tungsten related environmental problems occur somewhere in the yst geothermal province a comprehensive investigation of the distribution of geothermal tungsten and its speciation in the yst hydrothermal areas as well as the environmental effects of those tungsten rich hot springs is therefore necessary and urgent 6 conclusions the hot springs in the tengchong longling geothermal region feature various hydrochemical types and a wide range of tungsten concentrations of the neutral to alkaline hot springs those with very high sulphide concentrations and detectable thiotungstates have the highest total tungsten concentrations suggesting that the formation of thiotungstates in the geothermal waters could facilitate the further dissolution of tungsten bearing minerals in the host rocks hence the thiolation of tungstate in geothermal water has a significant effect on tungsten geochemical processes in hydrothermal systems sulphide concentration and s ii w ratio were the most important hydrochemical factors controlling the formation of thiotungstates for the hot springs in the study areas the thresholds of sulphide concentration 5 mg l and s ii w molar ratio 100 were apparent beyond which the dissolved tungstate could be highly thiolated in the dynamic hydrothermal systems investigated in this study ph did not affect the thiolation of tungstate as strongly as the geochemical modelling based on the thermodynamic data of various tungsten species studied the banglazhang samples with the highest proportions of thiotungstates of total tungsten exhibited ph values of 8 0 9 5 much higher than the theoretical optimal ph range 5 6 for thiotungstate formation furthermore cooccurring arsenic could affect the tungsten speciation in the hot springs provided that sulphide concentrations and s ii w molar ratios were lower than 5 mg l and 100 respectively with a large excess of sulphide that is s ii w as molar ratio 50 however thiolation of tungstate in geothermal water cannot be inhibited by the cooccurrence of arsenic six banglazhang samples with sulphide concentrations exceeding 5 mg l have the proportions of thiotungstates of total tungsten at the same order of magnitude as those of the proportions of thioarsenates of total arsenic taking into account that the total molar concentrations of tungsten and arsenic in these banglazhang samples were similar we speculated that these two constituents exhibit comparable tendencies for being thiolated under the hydrogeochemical conditions in the banglazhang hydrothermal system credit authorship contribution statement qinghai guo conceptualization methodology investigation writing original

4063,rainfall runoff models are generally calibrated by using continuous stream discharge data however most catchments around the globe remain ungauged due to the difficulty in installing gauges in river channels with complex morphology and due to the high costs of installation and maintenance recently new calibration methods that use water level data instead of gauged discharge to calibrate rainfall runoff models have been proposed with emerging low cost local water level monitoring technologies or with satellite altimetry these water level based calibration methods have the potential to significantly extend runoff prediction capability however rainfall runoff models calibrated from using water level information alone may lead to biased discharge even when water level variations are accurately reproduced it has been shown that this bias problem can be significantly alleviated when just a few discharge measurements especially of high flows are available and incorporated into the model calibration however it is rare to have discharge measurement data when catchments are ungauged in this study we incorporate discharge estimates derived from regionalization into a water level based calibration using an inverse rating curve irc method specifically discharge indices such as the 95th percentile of daily discharge q95 and the mean daily discharge qmean are estimated from catchment and climate characteristics based on regionalized relationships these estimated discharge indices are then used to constrain the irc calibration we evaluate both constrained and unconstrained irc methods over 130 study catchments where observed discharge time series are available but used only for validation in this study modelled discharge time series from the constrained irc methods have median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 61 0 63 compared with 0 54 from the unconstrained irc method improvement is seen in around 75 of the catchments with more than 0 2 increase in nse values in 25 of the catchments improvement in the modelled discharges from using regionalized discharge indices is comparable to using observed discharge indices using regionalized qmean yields greater improvement than using regionalized q95 the constrained irc methods tend to perform better in wetter catchments than in drier ones this method can significantly extend rainfall runoff model calibration in a wider range of catchments including real ungauged catchments keywords rainfall runoff model calibration ungauged catchments water level based calibration regionalized discharge index 1 introduction in rainfall runoff modelling accurate discharge time series is essential for calibrating model parameters beven 2011 commonly continuous discharge data are derived from observed water level data via established rating curves in each monitoring station mcmillan et al 2012 schmidt 2003 however most catchments are ungauged or sparsely gauged due to inaccessibility of remote areas and high cost of installing monitoring equipment alsdorf et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 even in catchments with continuous water level measurements the accuracy of discharge time series can be affected by various factors such as observation error mcmillan et al 2012 and inaccurate rating curves fenton 2015 fenton and keller 2001 mcmahon and peel 2019 mcmillan et al 2010 therefore a new calibration method that does not rely on continuous discharge data is highly valuable for rainfall runoff modelling instead of using discharge water level time series can provide an alternative and cost effective way to calibrate rainfall runoff models jian et al 2017 and seibert and vis 2016 demonstrated the potentials of two water level based calibration approaches spearman rank based src jian et al 2017 seibert and vis 2016 and inverse rating curve based method irc jian et al 2017 these methods are based on a straightforward approach that does not need to establish rating curves and is not vulnerable to the biases of rating curves also an increasing number of satellite altimeters could provide larger coverage of water level measurements especially in ungauged catchments alsdorf et al 2007 biancamaria et al 2016 fu et al 1994 lambin et al 2010 markert et al 2019 ménard et al 2003 verron et al 2015 recently a new source of citizen based water level measurements is developing e g crowdhydrology crowdwater which trains citizens to measure water level class observations and then could extend the coverage of the water level data etter et al 2020 strobl et al 2019 these data sources enable the application of water level based calibration in more locations these water level based calibration methods may encounter large bias in the estimated discharge time series since accurate discharge information is missing however they can be improved significantly in their capability of reproducing flow dynamics timing fluctuations and trend and prediction accuracy by incorporating a small number of discharge indices such as the 95th percentile of discharge q95 the 75th percentile of discharge q75 and the median of discharge q50 jian et al 2017 demonstrated that incorporating the high flow data q95 resulted in the most significant improvement the improvement is made by constraining the bias in discharge prediction caused by the absence of reference discharge for a given observed water level dynamics in practice however these discharge indices are rarely available in ungauged catchments limiting the application of the bias constrained water level based calibrations currently there exist various methods of regionalization to derive discharge indices without the actual discharge observations such as spatial interpolation zhang et al 2014 multiple linear regression mlr and log transformed multiple linear regression zhang et al 2014 and hydrological similarity based approach westerberg et al 2016 among them mlr is widely adopted due to its simplicity and effectiveness lima et al 2015 yadav et al 2007 for example joshi et al 2013 estimated low flow indices in three rivers in eastern canada using bayesian learning and multiple linear regression zhang et al 2018 estimated 13 runoff indices including low flow mean flows and high flow data in 605 australian catchments via linear regression and regression ensemble all these applications indicate that direct data driven method can be used as a practical tool in estimating discharge indices in this work we examine the efficacy of the water level based calibration scheme constrained by regionalized discharge indices two discharge indices the 95th percentile of daily discharge q95 and the mean daily discharge qmean are derived using mlr with a set of fourteen easily accessible predictors that represent climatic geologic topographic and land cover properties details in section 3 2 our novel approach is applied to a large number of catchments 130 catchments with hydrological reference stations of the australian bureau of meteorology to evaluate its performance and robustness in addition catchment properties that influence the calibration performance are also explored this method can significantly enhance our capability to calibrate rainfall runoff models in the ungauged catchments 2 study catchments and datasets in this study hydrological reference stations hrs of the bureau of meteorology of australia http www bom gov au water hrs about shtml are selected as study catchments they are unregulated catchments that are not affected by human activities and discharge data in these catchments are quality checked zhang et al 2016 the catchment locations are spread widely covering major climate zones in australia peel et al 2007 additional quality assurance is taken based on the quality of rating curves of the study catchments to ensure appropriate discharge and water level relationships for example catchments with divergent rating curves are excluded a total of 145 catchments are selected in the first instance furthermore fifteen catchments that are mainly located in the central desert part are removed from the candidate list due to their poor performances in conventional rainfall runoff modelling see section 3 3a finally 130 catchments are chosen as the study catchments fig 1 twenty two hydroclimatic and catchment characteristics table 1 are calculated for each catchment and are used to investigate the underlying relationship between modelling performances and catchment properties 3 methods 3 1 rainfall runoff model a conceptual daily rainfall runoff model gr4j perrin et al 2003 is employed in this work gr4j is one of the operational streamflow forecast models used by the bureau of meteorology of australia the model outperforms other commonly used hydrological models in the study catchments in capturing the flow behavior pagano et al 2010 besides gr4j is a simple and effective model that involves only four parameters representing store capacity x1 groundwater exchange coefficient x2 and routing processes x3 x4 and this simplicity reduces the possibility of overfitting in model calibration pagano et al 2010 3 2 regionalization of constraints rainfall runoff model calibration solely based on water level data may yield biased streamflow predictions when the calibration is not constrained by discharge information such as mean discharge seibert and vis 2016 and high flow data jian et al 2017 the bias can be significantly alleviated by involving a small number of discharge indices jian et al 2017 but the discharge indices are rarely available when catchments are ungauged to enable the application of the water level based model calibration method without relying on observed discharge we use discharge indices regionalized via multiple linear regression mlr adapted from zhang et al 2018 two regionalized discharge indices are employed in this work the 95th percentile of daily discharge q95 and the mean daily discharge qmean q95 is chosen based on its utility in constraining the water level based model calibration reported in previous study jian et al 2017 it is also supported by the study of van meerveld et al 2017 that high flow data might be the most informative in water level based calibration qmean is chosen for its general representativeness of discharge and its constraining effects on water level based calibration seibert and vis 2016 fourteen variables including climatic properties geologic topographic and land cover properties that can be easily obtained for ungauged catchments are used as candidate predictors in mlr see table 1 datasets for a total of 192 catchments are used in deriving and assessing the regionalized relationships the number of catchments is larger than the 130 catchments used in the main study focused on water based calibration so that the regionalized relationships are robust across a wide variety of catchments and not spuriously optimized just for the 130 catchments the bayesian information criterion bic burnham and anderson 2004 is used in predictor selection the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is calculated for each of the regionalized indices by comparing with the corresponding observed values 3 3 calibration schemes in this study four calibration schemes see table 2 that use different combinations of streamflow data discharge vs water level and constraining variables none observed discharge indices or regionalized discharge indices are conducted for model calibration daily timeseries datasets from 1980 01 01 to 1995 12 31 16 years are applied average daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet for each catchment are applied as input timeseries while mean daily discharge and mean daily water level are used as response data for control scheme and other schemes respectively models are calibrated by shuffled complex

scheme is also applied as a preliminary test to evaluate the performance of each study catchment evaluation method in section 3 4 fifteen of the 145 candidate catchments have nse values less than 0 5 these values are considered too low to be used as upper benchmarks for evaluating other schemes for this reason these catchments are excluded from the rest of this study b inverse rating curve based scheme irc method scheme 2 jian et al 2017 investigated the efficacy of two new calibration methods based on water level data i the rank correlation based method that uses the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the modeled discharge and observed water level as the objective function and ii the inverse rating curve based method irc the rank correlation based method has been shown to be effective in calibrating a streamflow model over test catchments in the us seibert and vis 2016 however the irc method outperforms the rank correlation based method in the drier study catchments of australia particularly with the help of discharge constraints jian et al 2017 this is likely to be associated with some distinctive characteristics between the us and australian test catchments used in the studies see detailed discussion in section 5 2c as a result only the irc method is used in this study irc method fig 2b augments the original rainfall runoff model to include a three parameter inversed power function eq 3 that converts the modelled discharge to modelled water level 3 h model q model a 1 1 a 2 h 0 where hmodel is the modelled water level timeseries qmodel is modelled discharge from rainfall runoff model h0 is a parameter to adjust the datum of water level data a1 and a2 are parameters that define the power function which represents the rating curve the parameter ranges used in calibration are a1 10 10 to 0 01 a2 1 5 to 2 5 h0 100 to 2000 with a unit of mm the output water level data from the augmented model are then compared with the observed water

regionalized discharge indices c irc with observed constraints scheme 3 in this scheme we constraint irc based calibration using discharge indices that are derived from observed time series of discharge this scheme assumes an ideal case where we have access to accurate estimates of discharge indices derived from rating curves in practice rating curve based discharge can be prone to large estimation errors when a sufficient number of high flow measurements is not included in the curve fitting process coxon et al 2015 hamilton and moore 2012 mcmahon and peel 2019 in this study however we assume the rating curves are completely accurate the bias between modelled qmean or q95 and observed qmean or q95 is calculated as an additional term of the objective function for calibration eq 5

3 this time period is selected to avoid the influence of the millennium drought from 1997 to 2009 in australia csiro 2012 van dijk et al 2013 rainfall runoff models can perform poorly for the millennium drought period when changes in catchment processes are not captured by the models fowler et al 2018 to avoid compounding the problem of intrinsically poor rainfall runoff models with the investigation here only an earlier period prior to the millennium drought is used in this study the first year is set up as a warm up period in the calibration and the other years are divided into 3 parts equally calibrations are conducted on 10 year data and the remaining 5 years are used for validation the modelled discharge data for the three validation periods are combined to a continuous timeseries and the performance is evaluated by nse between the modelled and observed discharge timeseries eq 9 9 r eff 1 q model q obs q obs q obs in addition the correlation between the performance and catchment properties are evaluated by the spearman rank correlation coefficient because of the non linear relationships 4 results 4 1 regionalization of discharge indices through regionalization

for regionalized qmean qmeanreg and 0 77 for regionalized q95 q95reg indicating that the regionalized qmean is more accurate than the regionalized q95 among the predictors rainfall and temperature show significant positive association with qmeanreg and q95reg to investigate the relationship between regionalization accuracy and catchment properties fractional absolute errors of regionalized indices are used 12 q 95 obs q 95 reg q 95 obs or 13 qmean obs qmean reg qmea n obs the spearman rank correlation coefficients between the fractional absolute errors and the values of twenty two variables are listed in table 3 variables that describe catchment wetness such as mean annual rainfall dryness index runoff ratio baseflow index mean ndvi woody cover percentage and discharge indices such as mean daily discharge q25 q50 q75 and q95 show some correlation with the regionalization accuracy generally in wetter catchments higher rainfall and discharge larger ndvi and woody cover smaller dryness index regionalization error is smaller that indicates both qmean and q95 could have more accurate regionalized results in wetter catchments and this trend is clearer for q95 also the estimation error of q95reg exhibits a moderate level of correlation with the coefficient of variation in annual discharge cvaq indicating that q95reg may be more accurate in a catchment where flows are more stable between different years 4 2 performance of water level based calibration schemes overall validation performances of schemes 1 4 are compared in fig 4 the schemes are presented in increasing order of reliance on discharge information to the right with the constraint by qmeanreg and q95reg scheme 4 improved significantly over scheme 2 with the median nse value increased from 0 54 to 0 61 0 63 further improvement is seen with scheme 3 that uses observed discharge indices with median nse values of 0 67 0 68 scheme 1 represents the conventional calibration based on continuous stream discharge data it shows the best performance with a median nse value of 0 73 regarding the range of nse across the catchments both schemes 3 and 4 result in nse values within similar ranges interquartile range iqr 0 23 and 0 20 respectively which is much narrower than the range from scheme 2 iqr 0 37 despite the improvements nse values from schemes 3 and 4 can still be low in some of the catchments much below the high benchmarks of scheme 1 which has the narrowest range of nse values iqr 0 17 in order to study different aspects of the calibration performance we also recalibrated the schemes 1 4 using kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as the objective function and compared their performances by kge the kge based evaluation showed similar comparative performances between the schemes 1 4 see supplementary material besides to test the parameter uncertainty we carried out the independent calibration trials following the method used in seibert and vis 2016 for each catchment we repeated 100 independent runs of model calibrations using different random seeds for the sce algorithm then we applied the 100 sets of calibrated parameters in cross validation and compared the median nse value of the 100 runs with that from the original calibration the median nse values from the independent calibration trials were very close to those from the original calibration runs indicating robustness of the results of our proposed schemes 4 3 water level based calibration with regionalized discharge indices scheme 4 considering the unique utility of irc scheme over the catchment with scarce or no discharge observations scheme 4 irc with regionalized discharge indices represents the most practical method to improve scheme 2 which is the original irc for ungauged catchments in this section performance of scheme 4 against scheme 2 and factors that potentially influence their relative performances are presented fig 5 compares improvement of scheme 4 in nse over scheme 2 for three different regionalized constraints q95reg qmeanreg and q95reg qmeanreg incorporating regionalized discharge indices in irc calibration resulted in improved streamflow prediction for approximately 75 of the study catchments improvement in nse is greater than 0 06 for nearly 50 of the study catchments and 0 2 for 25 of them overall improvement made by the three discharge indices tested was in a similar range but use of q95reg qmeanreg resulted in the greatest improvement followed by qmeanreg and then q95reg the comparative improvements achieved by using qmeanreg or q95reg as a constraint is different from the result of jian et al 2017 who reported superior skill of q95 as a constraint to improve irc scheme the reason for these contrasting results will be discussed later in section 5 4 some influential factors of the performances of scheme 4 are tested a influence of the accuracy of discharge based scheme 1 calibration table 4 summarizes correlation between catchment by catchment performance of scheme 4 and schemes 1 3 in corresponding catchments the nse values of scheme 4 exhibit strong positive correlation with the nse values of schemes 1 and 2 performance of scheme 4 is also highly correlated with the performance of scheme 3 and this relationship is slightly stronger than its correlation with schemes 1 and 2 b influence of the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices is assumed to be associated with the performance of scheme 4 accurate regionalized discharge indices would likely result in better calibration performance of scheme 4 if all the other conditions remain the same in order to examine this hypothesis correlation between the accuracy of regionalization and calibration performance was analyzed the spearman rank correlation coefficients between the fractional absolute error of regionalized indices eqs 12 and 13 and the nse values of scheme 4 are 0 58 for q95reg and 0 41 for qmeanreg the p values for both correlations are close to 0 indicating significant spearman rank correlations when qmeanreg and q95reg are used together as a combined constraint the influence of regionalization error decreased slightly spearman rank correlation coefficients are 0 49 for q95reg and 0 37 to qmeanreg p values 0 01 c influence of catchment properties the performance of scheme 4 is also associated with some catchment properties their relationships also represented by spearmen rank correlation coefficients are shown in table 5 among the twenty two variables analyzed variables that represent catchment wetness such as q50 q75 dryness index and mean ndvi exhibit the highest spearman rank correlation larger than 0 45 with the calibration performance indicating that scheme 4 is more effective in wetter catchments it is difficult to determine a fixed threshold of dryness value to distinguish the good and poor results however our analysis results showed that when the dryness index for a catchment exceeds 2 scheme 4 would not provide effective performance and is not recommended for the catchment similar tendency in correlation between the calibration performance and catchment wetness is also observed for scheme 1 however the correlation between scheme 2 and catchment wetness is weaker than that for other schemes see table 5 4 4 observed vs regionalized constraints although both observed and regionalized constraints can improve irc based calibration particularly for the catchments of low nse values observed discharge indices outperform regionalized indices by 0 05 on average nse fig 4 fig 6 compares nse values of individual catchments for scheme 4 top row or scheme 3 bottom row with irc based calibration scheme 2 the scatter plots show the largest improvement for the catchments with low nse scatters on the upper left portion of the plots for the catchments where irc based calibration scheme 2 results in nse greater than 0 5 constraining irc with a discharge index leads to a marginal improvement or similar calibration performance for the catchments where scheme 2 results in nse less than 0 3 the improvement from discharge indices both scheme 3 and 4 excluding outliers see further below are significant in some catchments however the irc calibration constrained with regionalized indices scheme 4 results in deterioration in calibration performance compared to the unconstrained irc scheme 2 as shown in fig 6a 6c the catchments that resulted in reduced nse in scheme 4 by more than 0 1 are enclosed by yellow box labeled as outliers in order to examine the common features of the outlier catchments in comparison with the rest we conducted a two sample test for 22 catchment properties and the estimation errors of regionalized indices results of the two sample test in p values are summarized in table 6 for q95reg outlier catchments are distributed in relatively dry regions but this trend is not clear for qmeanreg the differences between q95reg and qmeanreg will be discussed in section 5 4 4 5 q95 vs qmean when comparing the constraining effects of q95 and qmean qmeanreg has slightly stronger power to reduce the degradation by irc scheme in more catchments than q95reg fig 7 a while for the observed discharge indices q95 performs better fig 4 when q95reg and qmeanreg are used together the improvements are slightly better than using only q95reg fig 7b or qmeanreg fig 7c the relationship between catchment properties and the performance difference between q95 and qmean is tested by spearman rank correlation coefficients the results show that for scheme 3 there is not a clear dependency on catchment properties src coefficients 0 15 to 0 15 but for scheme 4 q95reg performs better than qmeanreg when there is a higher annual rainfall src coefficient is 0 38 although this correlation is not very high it indicates a trend that q95reg tends to perform better than qmeanreg in wetter catchment 5 discussions 5 1 performance of water level based calibration schemes comparison of evaluation results in fig 4 indicates that the overall improvement of median nse and reduced iqr for schemes 3 4 over scheme 2 is largely contributed by the pronounced improvements over catchments where scheme 2 calibration struggles reduced iqr of schemes 3 4 also indicates improved robustness of irc calibration when observed or regionalized discharge indices are introduced as a constraint in order to examine whether the water level based calibration would provide similar parameter sets to the discharge based calibration when their calibration performances are comparable we compared gr4j parameters 4 model parameters denoted by x1 x2 x3 and x4 calibrated by scheme 1 discharge based calibration and scheme 4 irc with regionalized qmean and q95 as constraints for the catchments where both scheme 1 and scheme 4 resulted in satisfactory calibration i e nse greater than 0 6 72 catchments three gr4j parameters that control the production store x1 routing store x2 and response unit hydrograph x4 showed similar magnitudes for scheme 1 and scheme 4 regardless of their calibration performance nse this indicates that calibrating a rainfall runoff model with water level data instead of measured flow could also capture the model features as traditional methods however the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 did not show systematic association between scheme 1 and scheme 4 this seems to be related to the relatively weak sensitivity weak identifiability of x2 to catchment rainfall runoff relationship as reported in zeng et al 2019 the estimated rating curve parameters a1 a2 and h0 from schemes 2 3 and 4 are also compared to the parameters from the observed rating curves fig 8 the correlations between the calibrated and original rating parameters are not as good as in jian et al 2017 particularly parameter a2 shows very poor correlation indicating weak sensitivity of the rating curve to a2 overall degradation of the correlation for a1 and h0 is likely due to the fact that jian et al 2017 used 11 study catchments that showed good performance in both discharge rating and the control calibration conventional discharge based calibration in this work we extended the method to 130 catchments to examine the performance of our proposed calibration schemes under various environmental and input output error conditions still in figure 8 a1 and h0 show some correlations which means that discharge rating is sensitive to both parameters on the other hand calibrated a2 shows poor correlation with parameter fit to the water level vs discharge within the range of 1 5 2 5 the poor correlation of calibrated and original a2 values are consistent for schemes 2 3 and 4 besides the sensitivity of the water level based calibration methods to the hydrological model structure is examined we applied our method to other commonly used rainfall runoff models in australia such as simhyd and awbm scheme 2 is used as an example in the 130 study catchments simhyd and awbm show collectively similar results to gr4j even though the performances do not match for individual sites which indicates the application of the water level based calibration method is not restricted by a certain type of rainfall runoff model 5 2 influential factors to the performances of scheme 4 the performances of scheme 4 are affected by hydrological modeling performance accuracy of regionalization and catchment properties a influence of the accuracy of discharge based scheme 1 calibration results in tables 4 indicate that factors influencing the discharge based calibration adversely also influence in a similar manner to the irc calibration whether with or without the constraint by discharge indices in general test catchments with relatively high nse values for scheme 4 coincide with the catchments where both schemes 1 and 2 exhibit better performance b influence of the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices the negative correlations between nse values and accuracy of regionalized discharge indices 0 58 for q95reg and 0 41 for qmeanreg indicate that poorer calibration performance of scheme 4 may in part be caused by the regionalization error which is more significant for q95reg consequently accuracy of the water level based calibration constrained by q95reg may have been impacted more by the accuracy of regionalization this has important implications on the comparative efficacy of q95reg and qmeanreg in constraining the water level based calibration although high flow data was reported to be more effective in anchoring the estimated data jian et al 2017 van meerveld et al 2017 seibert and vis 2016 the q95reg values used in this study are less accurate than qmeanreg see section 4 1 this may be responsible for the slightly better accuracy from the qmeanreg constrained cases than q95reg constrained ones in this work when qmeanreg and q95reg are used together the effects of regionalization accuracy decreased which indicates that the combined effects of both qmeanreg and q95reg are more reliable a likely explanation is that the two indices have independent information and some of their errors are cancelled when used in combination c influence of catchment properties table 5 shows that scheme 4 is more effective in wetter catchments it is primarily related to the performance of scheme 1 pagano et al 2010 reported that the gr4j model tends to perform well in rainfall runoff calibration for wet catchments as the performance of scheme 4 is highly correlated with scheme 1 this partly explains why scheme 4 has better results in wetter catchments besides the tendency to have better scheme 4 results in wetter catchments is also related to the accuracy of regionalization in general the accuracy of q95reg and qmeanreg improves with the catchment wetness see section 4 1 consequently regionalized discharge indices become more effective in constraining the irc method in wetter catchments table 5 also shows that the correlation between scheme 2 and catchment wetness is weaker than that for other schemes according to seibert and vis 2016 the unconstrained water level based calibration yields better results in wetter us catchments dryness index smaller than 0 7 but the uncertainty in drier catchments are larger as shown in table 1 the iqr of dryness index of australian catchments ranges in 1 0 1 7 which is wider and higher than the iqr of dryness index in the us catchments from 0 7 to 1 0 examined in seibert and vis 2016 in addition most australian cathments are near the dry end of the dryness range resulting in overall weaker performance when irc based calibration is used without constraints scheme 2 this may be responsible for the relatively lower correlation between scheme 2 and catchment wetness 5 3 observed vs regionalized constraints generally observed discharge indices outperform regionalized indices especially in the outlier catchments fig 6 for both q95reg and qmeanreg the outlier performances are significantly related to the accuracy of the constraints which means the poor results are mainly due to the inaccurate regionalized data also outliers are mainly found in dry catchments as discussed before section 4 1 the regionalization accuracy is lower in drier catchments which is consistent with the conclusion 5 4 q95 vs qmean q95 has better performance than qmean in scheme 3 observed discharge indices while for scheme 4 regionalized discharge indices q95reg shows stronger constraining effects it is because in scheme 3 both observed discharge indices have comparable accuracy the constraining effects of them are predominantly based on the feature of the indices as discussed in jian et al 2017 high flow data has a stronger power to fix the modelled flow events so observed q95 should provide better results than observed qmean however for scheme 4 besides the efficacy of high flow data performances are also affected by the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices section 5 2b since q95reg is not as accurate as qmeanreg the latter would show better performance in scheme 4 referring to catchment properties q95reg tends to perform better than qmeanreg in wetter catchment this is because both q95reg and qmeanreg are more accurate in wetter catchments than in drier catchments and the constraining effects from q95reg are stronger than qmeanreg thus accurate q95reg has stronger power to improve performance it is consistent to the results in table 5 and table 6 the performance of scheme 4 with q95reg has stronger positive correlation with catchment wetness than with qmeanreg 6 conclusion the inverse rating curve based method irc enables water level based calibration of rainfall runoff models in ungauged catchments although the irc method provides calibration efficacy weaker than the conventional discharge based calibration the efficacy improves when a small number of discharge indices derived from observations are integrated as constraints in real ungauged catchments however observed constraints are not available we showed that discharge indices derived from a method of regionalization can be used in place of the observed discharge indices our analysis showed that irc scheme with the regionalized discharge indices improved calibration performance of irc only scheme for 75 of the study catchments in australia overall modelled discharge time series from the constrained irc methods have median nse values of 0 61 0 63 compared with 0 54 from the unconstrained irc method the irc with regionalized constraints method tends to show better results in wetter catchments because of better rainfall runoff modelling results and higher regionalization accuracy in wetter catchments a roughly practical suggestion is that this method could perform well when dryness index is smaller than 2 when comparing the effects of q95 and qmean observed q95 has stronger power to constrain models than observed qmean but regionalized q95 may encounter larger regionalization error than regionalized qmean leading to poorer overall performance it is generally preferable to use qmeanreg because of the high accuracy of regionalization this is especially true for dry catchments for wet catchments q95reg could be accurate and may give effective constraining results this method enables rainfall runoff model calibration in a wider range of catchments including the ungauged catchments in addition the water level based calibration can also utilize various types of water level observations such as the photographs of stream channels collected by citizen participants credit authorship contribution statement jie

4063,rainfall runoff models are generally calibrated by using continuous stream discharge data however most catchments around the globe remain ungauged due to the difficulty in installing gauges in river channels with complex morphology and due to the high costs of installation and maintenance recently new calibration methods that use water level data instead of gauged discharge to calibrate rainfall runoff models have been proposed with emerging low cost local water level monitoring technologies or with satellite altimetry these water level based calibration methods have the potential to significantly extend runoff prediction capability however rainfall runoff models calibrated from using water level information alone may lead to biased discharge even when water level variations are accurately reproduced it has been shown that this bias problem can be significantly alleviated when just a few discharge measurements especially of high flows are available and incorporated into the model calibration however it is rare to have discharge measurement data when catchments are ungauged in this study we incorporate discharge estimates derived from regionalization into a water level based calibration using an inverse rating curve irc method specifically discharge indices such as the 95th percentile of daily discharge q95 and the mean daily discharge qmean are estimated from catchment and climate characteristics based on regionalized relationships these estimated discharge indices are then used to constrain the irc calibration we evaluate both constrained and unconstrained irc methods over 130 study catchments where observed discharge time series are available but used only for validation in this study modelled discharge time series from the constrained irc methods have median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 61 0 63 compared with 0 54 from the unconstrained irc method improvement is seen in around 75 of the catchments with more than 0 2 increase in nse values in 25 of the catchments improvement in the modelled discharges from using regionalized discharge indices is comparable to using observed discharge indices using regionalized qmean yields greater improvement than using regionalized q95 the constrained irc methods tend to perform better in wetter catchments than in drier ones this method can significantly extend rainfall runoff model calibration in a wider range of catchments including real ungauged catchments keywords rainfall runoff model calibration ungauged catchments water level based calibration regionalized discharge index 1 introduction in rainfall runoff modelling accurate discharge time series is essential for calibrating model parameters beven 2011 commonly continuous discharge data are derived from observed water level data via established rating curves in each monitoring station mcmillan et al 2012 schmidt 2003 however most catchments are ungauged or sparsely gauged due to inaccessibility of remote areas and high cost of installing monitoring equipment alsdorf et al 2003 hrachowitz et al 2013 sivapalan et al 2003 even in catchments with continuous water level measurements the accuracy of discharge time series can be affected by various factors such as observation error mcmillan et al 2012 and inaccurate rating curves fenton 2015 fenton and keller 2001 mcmahon and peel 2019 mcmillan et al 2010 therefore a new calibration method that does not rely on continuous discharge data is highly valuable for rainfall runoff modelling instead of using discharge water level time series can provide an alternative and cost effective way to calibrate rainfall runoff models jian et al 2017 and seibert and vis 2016 demonstrated the potentials of two water level based calibration approaches spearman rank based src jian et al 2017 seibert and vis 2016 and inverse rating curve based method irc jian et al 2017 these methods are based on a straightforward approach that does not need to establish rating curves and is not vulnerable to the biases of rating curves also an increasing number of satellite altimeters could provide larger coverage of water level measurements especially in ungauged catchments alsdorf et al 2007 biancamaria et al 2016 fu et al 1994 lambin et al 2010 markert et al 2019 ménard et al 2003 verron et al 2015 recently a new source of citizen based water level measurements is developing e g crowdhydrology crowdwater which trains citizens to measure water level class observations and then could extend the coverage of the water level data etter et al 2020 strobl et al 2019 these data sources enable the application of water level based calibration in more locations these water level based calibration methods may encounter large bias in the estimated discharge time series since accurate discharge information is missing however they can be improved significantly in their capability of reproducing flow dynamics timing fluctuations and trend and prediction accuracy by incorporating a small number of discharge indices such as the 95th percentile of discharge q95 the 75th percentile of discharge q75 and the median of discharge q50 jian et al 2017 demonstrated that incorporating the high flow data q95 resulted in the most significant improvement the improvement is made by constraining the bias in discharge prediction caused by the absence of reference discharge for a given observed water level dynamics in practice however these discharge indices are rarely available in ungauged catchments limiting the application of the bias constrained water level based calibrations currently there exist various methods of regionalization to derive discharge indices without the actual discharge observations such as spatial interpolation zhang et al 2014 multiple linear regression mlr and log transformed multiple linear regression zhang et al 2014 and hydrological similarity based approach westerberg et al 2016 among them mlr is widely adopted due to its simplicity and effectiveness lima et al 2015 yadav et al 2007 for example joshi et al 2013 estimated low flow indices in three rivers in eastern canada using bayesian learning and multiple linear regression zhang et al 2018 estimated 13 runoff indices including low flow mean flows and high flow data in 605 australian catchments via linear regression and regression ensemble all these applications indicate that direct data driven method can be used as a practical tool in estimating discharge indices in this work we examine the efficacy of the water level based calibration scheme constrained by regionalized discharge indices two discharge indices the 95th percentile of daily discharge q95 and the mean daily discharge qmean are derived using mlr with a set of fourteen easily accessible predictors that represent climatic geologic topographic and land cover properties details in section 3 2 our novel approach is applied to a large number of catchments 130 catchments with hydrological reference stations of the australian bureau of meteorology to evaluate its performance and robustness in addition catchment properties that influence the calibration performance are also explored this method can significantly enhance our capability to calibrate rainfall runoff models in the ungauged catchments 2 study catchments and datasets in this study hydrological reference stations hrs of the bureau of meteorology of australia http www bom gov au water hrs about shtml are selected as study catchments they are unregulated catchments that are not affected by human activities and discharge data in these catchments are quality checked zhang et al 2016 the catchment locations are spread widely covering major climate zones in australia peel et al 2007 additional quality assurance is taken based on the quality of rating curves of the study catchments to ensure appropriate discharge and water level relationships for example catchments with divergent rating curves are excluded a total of 145 catchments are selected in the first instance furthermore fifteen catchments that are mainly located in the central desert part are removed from the candidate list due to their poor performances in conventional rainfall runoff modelling see section 3 3a finally 130 catchments are chosen as the study catchments fig 1 twenty two hydroclimatic and catchment characteristics table 1 are calculated for each catchment and are used to investigate the underlying relationship between modelling performances and catchment properties 3 methods 3 1 rainfall runoff model a conceptual daily rainfall runoff model gr4j perrin et al 2003 is employed in this work gr4j is one of the operational streamflow forecast models used by the bureau of meteorology of australia the model outperforms other commonly used hydrological models in the study catchments in capturing the flow behavior pagano et al 2010 besides gr4j is a simple and effective model that involves only four parameters representing store capacity x1 groundwater exchange coefficient x2 and routing processes x3 x4 and this simplicity reduces the possibility of overfitting in model calibration pagano et al 2010 3 2 regionalization of constraints rainfall runoff model calibration solely based on water level data may yield biased streamflow predictions when the calibration is not constrained by discharge information such as mean discharge seibert and vis 2016 and high flow data jian et al 2017 the bias can be significantly alleviated by involving a small number of discharge indices jian et al 2017 but the discharge indices are rarely available when catchments are ungauged to enable the application of the water level based model calibration method without relying on observed discharge we use discharge indices regionalized via multiple linear regression mlr adapted from zhang et al 2018 two regionalized discharge indices are employed in this work the 95th percentile of daily discharge q95 and the mean daily discharge qmean q95 is chosen based on its utility in constraining the water level based model calibration reported in previous study jian et al 2017 it is also supported by the study of van meerveld et al 2017 that high flow data might be the most informative in water level based calibration qmean is chosen for its general representativeness of discharge and its constraining effects on water level based calibration seibert and vis 2016 fourteen variables including climatic properties geologic topographic and land cover properties that can be easily obtained for ungauged catchments are used as candidate predictors in mlr see table 1 datasets for a total of 192 catchments are used in deriving and assessing the regionalized relationships the number of catchments is larger than the 130 catchments used in the main study focused on water based calibration so that the regionalized relationships are robust across a wide variety of catchments and not spuriously optimized just for the 130 catchments the bayesian information criterion bic burnham and anderson 2004 is used in predictor selection the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is calculated for each of the regionalized indices by comparing with the corresponding observed values 3 3 calibration schemes in this study four calibration schemes see table 2 that use different combinations of streamflow data discharge vs water level and constraining variables none observed discharge indices or regionalized discharge indices are conducted for model calibration daily timeseries datasets from 1980 01 01 to 1995 12 31 16 years are applied average daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration pet for each catchment are applied as input timeseries while mean daily discharge and mean daily water level are used as response data for control scheme and other schemes respectively models are calibrated by shuffled complex

scheme is also applied as a preliminary test to evaluate the performance of each study catchment evaluation method in section 3 4 fifteen of the 145 candidate catchments have nse values less than 0 5 these values are considered too low to be used as upper benchmarks for evaluating other schemes for this reason these catchments are excluded from the rest of this study b inverse rating curve based scheme irc method scheme 2 jian et al 2017 investigated the efficacy of two new calibration methods based on water level data i the rank correlation based method that uses the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the modeled discharge and observed water level as the objective function and ii the inverse rating curve based method irc the rank correlation based method has been shown to be effective in calibrating a streamflow model over test catchments in the us seibert and vis 2016 however the irc method outperforms the rank correlation based method in the drier study catchments of australia particularly with the help of discharge constraints jian et al 2017 this is likely to be associated with some distinctive characteristics between the us and australian test catchments used in the studies see detailed discussion in section 5 2c as a result only the irc method is used in this study irc method fig 2b augments the original rainfall runoff model to include a three parameter inversed power function eq 3 that converts the modelled discharge to modelled water level 3 h model q model a 1 1 a 2 h 0 where hmodel is the modelled water level timeseries qmodel is modelled discharge from rainfall runoff model h0 is a parameter to adjust the datum of water level data a1 and a2 are parameters that define the power function which represents the rating curve the parameter ranges used in calibration are a1 10 10 to 0 01 a2 1 5 to 2 5 h0 100 to 2000 with a unit of mm the output water level data from the augmented model are then compared with the observed water

regionalized discharge indices c irc with observed constraints scheme 3 in this scheme we constraint irc based calibration using discharge indices that are derived from observed time series of discharge this scheme assumes an ideal case where we have access to accurate estimates of discharge indices derived from rating curves in practice rating curve based discharge can be prone to large estimation errors when a sufficient number of high flow measurements is not included in the curve fitting process coxon et al 2015 hamilton and moore 2012 mcmahon and peel 2019 in this study however we assume the rating curves are completely accurate the bias between modelled qmean or q95 and observed qmean or q95 is calculated as an additional term of the objective function for calibration eq 5

3 this time period is selected to avoid the influence of the millennium drought from 1997 to 2009 in australia csiro 2012 van dijk et al 2013 rainfall runoff models can perform poorly for the millennium drought period when changes in catchment processes are not captured by the models fowler et al 2018 to avoid compounding the problem of intrinsically poor rainfall runoff models with the investigation here only an earlier period prior to the millennium drought is used in this study the first year is set up as a warm up period in the calibration and the other years are divided into 3 parts equally calibrations are conducted on 10 year data and the remaining 5 years are used for validation the modelled discharge data for the three validation periods are combined to a continuous timeseries and the performance is evaluated by nse between the modelled and observed discharge timeseries eq 9 9 r eff 1 q model q obs q obs q obs in addition the correlation between the performance and catchment properties are evaluated by the spearman rank correlation coefficient because of the non linear relationships 4 results 4 1 regionalization of discharge indices through regionalization

for regionalized qmean qmeanreg and 0 77 for regionalized q95 q95reg indicating that the regionalized qmean is more accurate than the regionalized q95 among the predictors rainfall and temperature show significant positive association with qmeanreg and q95reg to investigate the relationship between regionalization accuracy and catchment properties fractional absolute errors of regionalized indices are used 12 q 95 obs q 95 reg q 95 obs or 13 qmean obs qmean reg qmea n obs the spearman rank correlation coefficients between the fractional absolute errors and the values of twenty two variables are listed in table 3 variables that describe catchment wetness such as mean annual rainfall dryness index runoff ratio baseflow index mean ndvi woody cover percentage and discharge indices such as mean daily discharge q25 q50 q75 and q95 show some correlation with the regionalization accuracy generally in wetter catchments higher rainfall and discharge larger ndvi and woody cover smaller dryness index regionalization error is smaller that indicates both qmean and q95 could have more accurate regionalized results in wetter catchments and this trend is clearer for q95 also the estimation error of q95reg exhibits a moderate level of correlation with the coefficient of variation in annual discharge cvaq indicating that q95reg may be more accurate in a catchment where flows are more stable between different years 4 2 performance of water level based calibration schemes overall validation performances of schemes 1 4 are compared in fig 4 the schemes are presented in increasing order of reliance on discharge information to the right with the constraint by qmeanreg and q95reg scheme 4 improved significantly over scheme 2 with the median nse value increased from 0 54 to 0 61 0 63 further improvement is seen with scheme 3 that uses observed discharge indices with median nse values of 0 67 0 68 scheme 1 represents the conventional calibration based on continuous stream discharge data it shows the best performance with a median nse value of 0 73 regarding the range of nse across the catchments both schemes 3 and 4 result in nse values within similar ranges interquartile range iqr 0 23 and 0 20 respectively which is much narrower than the range from scheme 2 iqr 0 37 despite the improvements nse values from schemes 3 and 4 can still be low in some of the catchments much below the high benchmarks of scheme 1 which has the narrowest range of nse values iqr 0 17 in order to study different aspects of the calibration performance we also recalibrated the schemes 1 4 using kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 as the objective function and compared their performances by kge the kge based evaluation showed similar comparative performances between the schemes 1 4 see supplementary material besides to test the parameter uncertainty we carried out the independent calibration trials following the method used in seibert and vis 2016 for each catchment we repeated 100 independent runs of model calibrations using different random seeds for the sce algorithm then we applied the 100 sets of calibrated parameters in cross validation and compared the median nse value of the 100 runs with that from the original calibration the median nse values from the independent calibration trials were very close to those from the original calibration runs indicating robustness of the results of our proposed schemes 4 3 water level based calibration with regionalized discharge indices scheme 4 considering the unique utility of irc scheme over the catchment with scarce or no discharge observations scheme 4 irc with regionalized discharge indices represents the most practical method to improve scheme 2 which is the original irc for ungauged catchments in this section performance of scheme 4 against scheme 2 and factors that potentially influence their relative performances are presented fig 5 compares improvement of scheme 4 in nse over scheme 2 for three different regionalized constraints q95reg qmeanreg and q95reg qmeanreg incorporating regionalized discharge indices in irc calibration resulted in improved streamflow prediction for approximately 75 of the study catchments improvement in nse is greater than 0 06 for nearly 50 of the study catchments and 0 2 for 25 of them overall improvement made by the three discharge indices tested was in a similar range but use of q95reg qmeanreg resulted in the greatest improvement followed by qmeanreg and then q95reg the comparative improvements achieved by using qmeanreg or q95reg as a constraint is different from the result of jian et al 2017 who reported superior skill of q95 as a constraint to improve irc scheme the reason for these contrasting results will be discussed later in section 5 4 some influential factors of the performances of scheme 4 are tested a influence of the accuracy of discharge based scheme 1 calibration table 4 summarizes correlation between catchment by catchment performance of scheme 4 and schemes 1 3 in corresponding catchments the nse values of scheme 4 exhibit strong positive correlation with the nse values of schemes 1 and 2 performance of scheme 4 is also highly correlated with the performance of scheme 3 and this relationship is slightly stronger than its correlation with schemes 1 and 2 b influence of the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices is assumed to be associated with the performance of scheme 4 accurate regionalized discharge indices would likely result in better calibration performance of scheme 4 if all the other conditions remain the same in order to examine this hypothesis correlation between the accuracy of regionalization and calibration performance was analyzed the spearman rank correlation coefficients between the fractional absolute error of regionalized indices eqs 12 and 13 and the nse values of scheme 4 are 0 58 for q95reg and 0 41 for qmeanreg the p values for both correlations are close to 0 indicating significant spearman rank correlations when qmeanreg and q95reg are used together as a combined constraint the influence of regionalization error decreased slightly spearman rank correlation coefficients are 0 49 for q95reg and 0 37 to qmeanreg p values 0 01 c influence of catchment properties the performance of scheme 4 is also associated with some catchment properties their relationships also represented by spearmen rank correlation coefficients are shown in table 5 among the twenty two variables analyzed variables that represent catchment wetness such as q50 q75 dryness index and mean ndvi exhibit the highest spearman rank correlation larger than 0 45 with the calibration performance indicating that scheme 4 is more effective in wetter catchments it is difficult to determine a fixed threshold of dryness value to distinguish the good and poor results however our analysis results showed that when the dryness index for a catchment exceeds 2 scheme 4 would not provide effective performance and is not recommended for the catchment similar tendency in correlation between the calibration performance and catchment wetness is also observed for scheme 1 however the correlation between scheme 2 and catchment wetness is weaker than that for other schemes see table 5 4 4 observed vs regionalized constraints although both observed and regionalized constraints can improve irc based calibration particularly for the catchments of low nse values observed discharge indices outperform regionalized indices by 0 05 on average nse fig 4 fig 6 compares nse values of individual catchments for scheme 4 top row or scheme 3 bottom row with irc based calibration scheme 2 the scatter plots show the largest improvement for the catchments with low nse scatters on the upper left portion of the plots for the catchments where irc based calibration scheme 2 results in nse greater than 0 5 constraining irc with a discharge index leads to a marginal improvement or similar calibration performance for the catchments where scheme 2 results in nse less than 0 3 the improvement from discharge indices both scheme 3 and 4 excluding outliers see further below are significant in some catchments however the irc calibration constrained with regionalized indices scheme 4 results in deterioration in calibration performance compared to the unconstrained irc scheme 2 as shown in fig 6a 6c the catchments that resulted in reduced nse in scheme 4 by more than 0 1 are enclosed by yellow box labeled as outliers in order to examine the common features of the outlier catchments in comparison with the rest we conducted a two sample test for 22 catchment properties and the estimation errors of regionalized indices results of the two sample test in p values are summarized in table 6 for q95reg outlier catchments are distributed in relatively dry regions but this trend is not clear for qmeanreg the differences between q95reg and qmeanreg will be discussed in section 5 4 4 5 q95 vs qmean when comparing the constraining effects of q95 and qmean qmeanreg has slightly stronger power to reduce the degradation by irc scheme in more catchments than q95reg fig 7 a while for the observed discharge indices q95 performs better fig 4 when q95reg and qmeanreg are used together the improvements are slightly better than using only q95reg fig 7b or qmeanreg fig 7c the relationship between catchment properties and the performance difference between q95 and qmean is tested by spearman rank correlation coefficients the results show that for scheme 3 there is not a clear dependency on catchment properties src coefficients 0 15 to 0 15 but for scheme 4 q95reg performs better than qmeanreg when there is a higher annual rainfall src coefficient is 0 38 although this correlation is not very high it indicates a trend that q95reg tends to perform better than qmeanreg in wetter catchment 5 discussions 5 1 performance of water level based calibration schemes comparison of evaluation results in fig 4 indicates that the overall improvement of median nse and reduced iqr for schemes 3 4 over scheme 2 is largely contributed by the pronounced improvements over catchments where scheme 2 calibration struggles reduced iqr of schemes 3 4 also indicates improved robustness of irc calibration when observed or regionalized discharge indices are introduced as a constraint in order to examine whether the water level based calibration would provide similar parameter sets to the discharge based calibration when their calibration performances are comparable we compared gr4j parameters 4 model parameters denoted by x1 x2 x3 and x4 calibrated by scheme 1 discharge based calibration and scheme 4 irc with regionalized qmean and q95 as constraints for the catchments where both scheme 1 and scheme 4 resulted in satisfactory calibration i e nse greater than 0 6 72 catchments three gr4j parameters that control the production store x1 routing store x2 and response unit hydrograph x4 showed similar magnitudes for scheme 1 and scheme 4 regardless of their calibration performance nse this indicates that calibrating a rainfall runoff model with water level data instead of measured flow could also capture the model features as traditional methods however the groundwater exchange coefficient x2 did not show systematic association between scheme 1 and scheme 4 this seems to be related to the relatively weak sensitivity weak identifiability of x2 to catchment rainfall runoff relationship as reported in zeng et al 2019 the estimated rating curve parameters a1 a2 and h0 from schemes 2 3 and 4 are also compared to the parameters from the observed rating curves fig 8 the correlations between the calibrated and original rating parameters are not as good as in jian et al 2017 particularly parameter a2 shows very poor correlation indicating weak sensitivity of the rating curve to a2 overall degradation of the correlation for a1 and h0 is likely due to the fact that jian et al 2017 used 11 study catchments that showed good performance in both discharge rating and the control calibration conventional discharge based calibration in this work we extended the method to 130 catchments to examine the performance of our proposed calibration schemes under various environmental and input output error conditions still in figure 8 a1 and h0 show some correlations which means that discharge rating is sensitive to both parameters on the other hand calibrated a2 shows poor correlation with parameter fit to the water level vs discharge within the range of 1 5 2 5 the poor correlation of calibrated and original a2 values are consistent for schemes 2 3 and 4 besides the sensitivity of the water level based calibration methods to the hydrological model structure is examined we applied our method to other commonly used rainfall runoff models in australia such as simhyd and awbm scheme 2 is used as an example in the 130 study catchments simhyd and awbm show collectively similar results to gr4j even though the performances do not match for individual sites which indicates the application of the water level based calibration method is not restricted by a certain type of rainfall runoff model 5 2 influential factors to the performances of scheme 4 the performances of scheme 4 are affected by hydrological modeling performance accuracy of regionalization and catchment properties a influence of the accuracy of discharge based scheme 1 calibration results in tables 4 indicate that factors influencing the discharge based calibration adversely also influence in a similar manner to the irc calibration whether with or without the constraint by discharge indices in general test catchments with relatively high nse values for scheme 4 coincide with the catchments where both schemes 1 and 2 exhibit better performance b influence of the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices the negative correlations between nse values and accuracy of regionalized discharge indices 0 58 for q95reg and 0 41 for qmeanreg indicate that poorer calibration performance of scheme 4 may in part be caused by the regionalization error which is more significant for q95reg consequently accuracy of the water level based calibration constrained by q95reg may have been impacted more by the accuracy of regionalization this has important implications on the comparative efficacy of q95reg and qmeanreg in constraining the water level based calibration although high flow data was reported to be more effective in anchoring the estimated data jian et al 2017 van meerveld et al 2017 seibert and vis 2016 the q95reg values used in this study are less accurate than qmeanreg see section 4 1 this may be responsible for the slightly better accuracy from the qmeanreg constrained cases than q95reg constrained ones in this work when qmeanreg and q95reg are used together the effects of regionalization accuracy decreased which indicates that the combined effects of both qmeanreg and q95reg are more reliable a likely explanation is that the two indices have independent information and some of their errors are cancelled when used in combination c influence of catchment properties table 5 shows that scheme 4 is more effective in wetter catchments it is primarily related to the performance of scheme 1 pagano et al 2010 reported that the gr4j model tends to perform well in rainfall runoff calibration for wet catchments as the performance of scheme 4 is highly correlated with scheme 1 this partly explains why scheme 4 has better results in wetter catchments besides the tendency to have better scheme 4 results in wetter catchments is also related to the accuracy of regionalization in general the accuracy of q95reg and qmeanreg improves with the catchment wetness see section 4 1 consequently regionalized discharge indices become more effective in constraining the irc method in wetter catchments table 5 also shows that the correlation between scheme 2 and catchment wetness is weaker than that for other schemes according to seibert and vis 2016 the unconstrained water level based calibration yields better results in wetter us catchments dryness index smaller than 0 7 but the uncertainty in drier catchments are larger as shown in table 1 the iqr of dryness index of australian catchments ranges in 1 0 1 7 which is wider and higher than the iqr of dryness index in the us catchments from 0 7 to 1 0 examined in seibert and vis 2016 in addition most australian cathments are near the dry end of the dryness range resulting in overall weaker performance when irc based calibration is used without constraints scheme 2 this may be responsible for the relatively lower correlation between scheme 2 and catchment wetness 5 3 observed vs regionalized constraints generally observed discharge indices outperform regionalized indices especially in the outlier catchments fig 6 for both q95reg and qmeanreg the outlier performances are significantly related to the accuracy of the constraints which means the poor results are mainly due to the inaccurate regionalized data also outliers are mainly found in dry catchments as discussed before section 4 1 the regionalization accuracy is lower in drier catchments which is consistent with the conclusion 5 4 q95 vs qmean q95 has better performance than qmean in scheme 3 observed discharge indices while for scheme 4 regionalized discharge indices q95reg shows stronger constraining effects it is because in scheme 3 both observed discharge indices have comparable accuracy the constraining effects of them are predominantly based on the feature of the indices as discussed in jian et al 2017 high flow data has a stronger power to fix the modelled flow events so observed q95 should provide better results than observed qmean however for scheme 4 besides the efficacy of high flow data performances are also affected by the accuracy of regionalized discharge indices section 5 2b since q95reg is not as accurate as qmeanreg the latter would show better performance in scheme 4 referring to catchment properties q95reg tends to perform better than qmeanreg in wetter catchment this is because both q95reg and qmeanreg are more accurate in wetter catchments than in drier catchments and the constraining effects from q95reg are stronger than qmeanreg thus accurate q95reg has stronger power to improve performance it is consistent to the results in table 5 and table 6 the performance of scheme 4 with q95reg has stronger positive correlation with catchment wetness than with qmeanreg 6 conclusion the inverse rating curve based method irc enables water level based calibration of rainfall runoff models in ungauged catchments although the irc method provides calibration efficacy weaker than the conventional discharge based calibration the efficacy improves when a small number of discharge indices derived from observations are integrated as constraints in real ungauged catchments however observed constraints are not available we showed that discharge indices derived from a method of regionalization can be used in place of the observed discharge indices our analysis showed that irc scheme with the regionalized discharge indices improved calibration performance of irc only scheme for 75 of the study catchments in australia overall modelled discharge time series from the constrained irc methods have median nse values of 0 61 0 63 compared with 0 54 from the unconstrained irc method the irc with regionalized constraints method tends to show better results in wetter catchments because of better rainfall runoff modelling results and higher regionalization accuracy in wetter catchments a roughly practical suggestion is that this method could perform well when dryness index is smaller than 2 when comparing the effects of q95 and qmean observed q95 has stronger power to constrain models than observed qmean but regionalized q95 may encounter larger regionalization error than regionalized qmean leading to poorer overall performance it is generally preferable to use qmeanreg because of the high accuracy of regionalization this is especially true for dry catchments for wet catchments q95reg could be accurate and may give effective constraining results this method enables rainfall runoff model calibration in a wider range of catchments including the ungauged catchments in addition the water level based calibration can also utilize various types of water level observations such as the photographs of stream channels collected by citizen participants credit authorship contribution statement jie

4064,here we consider a new more general mathematical formulation of the nonlocal exner law widely used in morphodynamics and sediment transport models in some recent literature the role of nonlocal effects in the sediment flux was analyzed by using a fractional calculus approach based on the application of caputo fractional derivatives in this paper we apply fractional derivatives of a function with respect to another function in order to have a more general and realistic picture of nonlocal effects in sediment transport models we then discuss the meaning of this approach considering a logarithmic profile emerging from the generalized formulation of the nonlocal steady exner law we finally suggest that this can be the way to overcome the theoretical shortcomings of the fractional exner equation based on the application of classical caputo derivatives keywords exner law sediment transport fractional derivative of a function with respect to another function nomenclature d b sediment depositional rate e b sediment entrainment λ p porosity of bed sediment h x t elevation profile q x t sediment flux ν real order of the space fractional derivative β 1 1 directional measure that provides a weighting between purely upstream and downstream nonlocality 1 introduction in the recent literature the role of nonlocal effects in sediment transport models has been widely investigated from both micro physical point of view by means of a continuous time random walk ctrw approach and considering the corresponding macroscopic integro differential governing equations falcini et al 2013 foufoula georgiou et al 2010 ganti et al 2009 in this context nonlocality means that the sediment flux at a given point is influenced by the landscape properties in a region away from the point of interest a relevant mathematical tool to describe nonlocal effects in sediment transport models is the fractional calculus ancey 2010 schumer et al 2009 voller and paola 2010 indeed heuristically by means of a fractional calculus approach it is possible to take into account the heterogeneous length scales on the fluvial surface voller et al 2012 moreover fractional advection diffusion equation have a clear physical meaning as the governing equation of the random motion of sediment particles schumer et al 2009 2017 here we refer in particular to the physical discussion about the nonlocal formulation of the steady exner law based on the application of the classical caputo derivative ganti et al 2010 pelosi et al 2014 voller and paola 2010 the key feature in this model is to understand how nonlocal effects influence the real fluvial slope profiles with the correct parametrization of nonlocality in erosional and depositional processes the nonlocality direction has a key role and it is directly related to a parameter β see below in this paper we suggest a different mathematical formulation of the nonlocal steady exner law based on fractional derivatives with respect to another function almeida et al 2018 in our view this can be useful in order to overcome the limitations of those approaches that are based on classical caputo derivatives we will briefly discuss the heuristic meaning of this new approach and the consequence on the mathematical model finding the explicit expression of the fluvial profile we obtain in this case the nonlocality direction can be included by using a correct parametrization of the kernel 2 the basic steady exner equation local and nonlocal formulation the basic mathematical model for the fluvial sediment flux is based on the local balance between erosion and deposition of sediment essentially in fluvial profile systems there is an erosional uplifting region contiguous to a subsiding depositional region the key quantity in classical sediment transport model is given by the elevation profile h x t felix exner exner 1920 firstly developed the mathematical model for sediment mass balance in the context of the studies of river morphology we refer for example to ganti et al 2010 paola 2000 paola and voller 2005 parker et al 2000 for the discussion on the meaning and applications of the exner equation and for its generalization in particular following ganti et al 2010 parker et al 2000 the exner equation can be written as follow 2 1 1 λ p h t d b x t e b x t where d b denotes the volume rate per unit area of deposition of bed load particles e b the volume rate per unit area of entrainment of bed particles λ p the porosity of bed sediment essentially the balance between deposition and entrainment is proportional to the divergence of the sediment flux q x t see for example paola and voller 2005 this means that eq 2 1 can be written in the one dimensional case as 2 2 1 λ p h t q x in the steady local formulation of the so called exner equation the relation between sediment flux q x and the fluvial slope h x in the local steady formulation is given by see paola 2000 p 140 2 3 q x dh dx i e the sediment flux in a first order approximation is directly proportional to the fluvial slope we assume that the erosional and depositional regions equally divide the domain and we take by suitable scaling for simplicity 0 x 1 in the erosional domain with uplift we have that voller et al 2012 2 4 dq dx 1 0 x 1 2 q 0 0 h 1 2 0 while in the contiguous depositional region with subsidence we have 2 5 dq dx 1 1 2 x 1 q 1 0 h 1 2 0 by using 2 3 and by integrating 2 4 and 2 5 we can obtain analitycally the steady fluvial profile h x 1 2 2 x 2 2 in the erosional region h x 1 x 2 1 2 2 2 in the depositional region there is a wide literature about the applications of fractional derivatives in water flow models and solute transport through porous media see e g mehdinejadiani et al 2013b schumer et al 2009 in particular benson et al 2000 derived the space fractional advection dispersion equation to simulate transport in porous media this equation has been widely studied in the recent literature we refer for instance to ghazal and behrouz 2018 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 mehdinejadiani et al 2013a moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 the applications of fractional calculus in hydrology have been deeply studied by su in a series of papers we refer in particular to the recent monograph su 2020 that is a relevant reference in this field of research in the field of geomorphology schumer et al 2009 described essential nonlocal features of sediment transport in hillslope and fluvial systems by developing a fractional advection dispersion equation with a non integer order derivative on time or space terms in their model nonlocality describes transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance in this frame fractional derivative in space would arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system their results are consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems voller and paola voller et al 2012 explored nonclassical or non fickian anomalous sediment transport in braided networks which are known to have fractal planform geometry they solved a fractional diffusion equation for a steady state aggrading fluvial profile capturing effects of power law statistics in the underlying dynamics in voller et al 2012 a nonlocal formulation of the steady exner law has been considered based on the application of the caputo fractional derivatives the physical assumption in the generalized nonlocal exner law discussed in voller et al 2012 is that the sediment flux should be treated as a power law weighted sum of slopes across a region by means of this approach it is possible to take into account the heterogeneous length scales on the fluvial surface the nonlocal exner law suggested in voller et al 2012 is based on the following relation between sediment flux and slope 2 6 q x 1 β 2 d ν h dx ν 1 β 2 d ν h d x ν ν 0 1 involving left and right caputo fractional derivatives of order ν 0 1 see kilbas et al 2006 for definition and main properties of caputo fractional derivatives the parameter β appearing in exner 1920 is a directional measure that provides a weighting between purely upstream and downstream nonlocality indeed for β 1 we have a purely upstream nonlocal contribution while for β 1 purely downstream we recall that according to the analysis developed in voller et al 2012 the evolution for the erosional region is well defined by considering β 1 upstream nonlocal contribution while in the depositional region the downstream contribution is the most relevant i e β 1 this means that in the general formulation 2 6 a different weight β should be considered in the nonlocal balance law following this approach we have that h x 1 2 1 ν x 1 ν γ 2 ν in the erosional region β 1 h x 1 x ν 1 1 2 1 ν γ 2 ν in the depositional region β 1 we note that this formulation of the exner law assumes a power law weight is assumed and the role of the nonlocality is described by means of the parameter ν 0 1 in the next section we suggest a different mathematical formulation based on the application of the fractional derivatives with respect to another function our main idea is to have a more general mathematical approach without restrictions to power law memory kernel in the formulation of the non local exner law 3 the generalized nonlocal exner law here we consider a more general formulation of the nonlocal exner law 3 1 q x 1 β 2 d x ν ψ c h x 1 β 2 d ν ψ c h x ν 0 1 where the caputo type derivatives are fractional derivatives w r t another function see appendix a 3 2 d x ν ψ c g x 1 γ 1 ν 0 x ψ x ψ x ν d dx g x dx and 3 3 d ν ψ c g t 1 γ 1 ν x 1 ψ x ψ x ν d dx g x dx where ψ is a suitable given well behaved function related to the space dependence of the geological parameters in the exner law in recent papers colombaro et al 2018 liu et al 2020 it was shown the utility of this mathematical approach in rheology and in particular in rock physics the heuristic idea is that by means of these more general operators we have a convolution of the classical derivative with a family of well behaved functions without restrictions to the power law case differently from the classical definition of the caputo derivative in general a nonlocal formulation of the exner law is based on the convolution of a given memory kernel with the local fluvial slope with our formulation we can simply obtain different depositional and erosional profiles depending by the concrete form of the function ψ appearing in the kernel and describing the role of the nonlocality in the physical process we observe that the fractional operator in 3 1 is the counter part of integer order differential operator 1 ψ d dx this implies that our approach allows for including variable coefficient in the governing model equation here we follow the main considerations in voller et al 2012 about the role of β for a meaningful description of the evolution of erosional and deposition regions thus by direct calculations see the appendix a and kilbas et al 2006 for details we have that the erosional and depositional profiles depending by the function ψ are given by h x ψ x 1 2 1 ν ψ x 1 ν γ 2 ν in the erosional region β 1 h x ψ x 1 ψ x ν 1 ψ x 1 ψ x 1 2 1 ν γ 2 ν in the depositional region β 1 we have a wide class of profiles and the physics of the nonlocal process is contained in the concrete form of the function ψ moreover we note that the sediment balances in 2 4 and 2 5 are now given by 3 4 1 ψ dq dx 1 0 x 1 2 and 3 5 1 ψ dq dx 1 1 2 x 1 where ψ d ψ dx represents a space dependant diffusive coefficient that expands the exner equation in the fractional approach when ν 1 and ψ const we recover indeed the classical local solutions an interesting case that we briefly consider is for example ψ x ln 1 x modelling a slower power law nonlocal effect h x ln 3 2 1 ν ln 1 x 1 ν γ 2 ν in the erosional region β 1 h x ln 4 3 1 ν ln 2 ln 1 x ν 1 γ 2 ν in the depositional region β 1 mathematically speaking this approach is strictly related to the hadamard fractional derivative and have been used also in viscoelasticity in long et al 2018 for example in a diffusive process this approach can be useful for models of ultraslow diffusions see the recent survey liang et al 2019 in fig 1 we show the nonlocal erosional and depositional profiles obtained by using a logarithmic kernel for different values of the parameter ν it is evident the role played by the logarithmic nonlocal effect as slow smoothed change in the profile with respect to the local profile predicted by the exner equation in fig 2 we put together in continuity the evolution predicted by the nonlocal model with logarithmic kernel in the erosional domain 0 x 1 2 and in the depositional domain 1 2 x 1 for ν 0 6 in order to underline the different behaviour in the different domains 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we considered the role played by fractional derivatives w r t another function in the nonlocal formulation of the exner law as an interesting generalization of the approach developed in voller et al 2012 we considered the limit cases β 1 and β 1 corresponding to nonlocality that is fully biased upstream or downstream respectively in the general case 1 β 1 we are not able to obtain the explicit form of the fluvial profile this can be numerically investigated in a future study according to voller et al 2012 the predictions for fluvial profiles with non extreme values of β will be enveloped by the solutions at the extremes a confirmation on this point can be obtained by numerical simulations in view of the general form of the model eq 3 1 it is clear that for any β 1 we have a balance between purely upstream and downstream nonlocality it is well known that fractional models in morphodynamics has a clear interpretation in relation to ctrws however the rigorous analysis of different mathematical models for sediment transport is still open and need to be experimentally validated in order to understand the different underlying physics for instance in falcini et al 2013 and pelosi and parker 2014 the combination of nonlinearity and nonlocality have been considered in this context our mathematical model can be interpreted in the unsteady case by means of scaled brownian motion see e g liang et al 2019 in sediment transport and in the particular logarithmic case in terms of ultraslow anomalous processes these different generalizations of the exner law should be object of future experimental research we have some outcomes from this mathematical approach first of all we can search a suitable choice of ψ that can give a direct connection between the erosional and depositional regions without a different choice of β secondly we have a mathematical tool to take into account space variability of diffusivity coefficients here we considered the steady nonlocal exner law a future object of our study can be the role played by ψ fractional derivative for the unsteady nonlocal exner law in order to take into account the space dependence of diffusivity and nonlocal effects together with our approach the complete unsteady exner equation is given by 4 1 h t q x x 1 β 2 d x ν ψ c h x 1 β 2 d ν ψ c h x here is more clear that the application of the ψ x derivative is a way to embed in the nonlocal operator the space dependence of the diffusivity coefficient that appears in the classical diffusion equation in our view this approach should be further analyzed but this is beyond the aims of the paper that is strictly related to the evolution profile in a steady approximation credit authorship contribution statement f falcini conceptualization

european marine observation and data network physics and by cnr in the frame of the italian flag project ritmare and the italian marine strategy framework directive programmes appendix a caputo type fractional derivative of a function with respect to another function fractional derivatives of a function with respect to another function is an old topic already considered in the classical monograph by kilbas et al 2006 section 2 5 recently almeida and coauthors in almeida et al 2017 2018 introduced the caputo type definition and discussed some interesting properties the utility of these generalized fractional operators in the applications is represented by the fact that they are essentially obtained by a deterministic time change and permits us to take into account both variable coefficients and memory or nonlocal effects moreover this class of operators include as special cases classical fractional derivatives for example fractional derivatives in the sense of hadamard or erdélyi kober here we recall the basic definitions and properties for the reader s convenience let ν 0 ψ t an increasing suitable function such that ψ t 0 in a t the fractional integral of a function g t with respect to another function ψ t is given by a 1 i a ν ψ g t 1 γ ν a t ψ τ ψ t ψ τ ν 1 g τ d τ observe that for ψ t t β we recover the definition of erdélyi kober fractional integral recently applied for example in connection with the generalized grey brownian motion pagnini 2012 for simplicity hereafter we will consider a 0 as usual and suitable functions ψ such that ψ 0 0 all the results can be simply generalized the corresponding caputo type evolution operator see almeida et al 2017 for 0 ν 1 is given by a 2 d t ν ψ c g t 1 γ 1 ν 0 t ψ t ψ τ ν d d τ g τ d τ a 3 i 0 1 ν ψ 1 ψ t d dt g t observe that in the literature these operators are also named ψ fractional derivatives for the general case ν r we refer to almeida et al 2017 in this paper we are interested to the case 0 ν 1 interpolating as a limit case the ordinary first order derivative while the higher order cases can be treated in a similar way we have used the symbol d t ν ψ c in order to underline the generic integro differential nature of the time evolution operator depending on the choice of the function ψ t and the real order ν a relevant property of the operator a 3 is that if g t ψ t β 1 with β 1 then see lemma 1 of almeida et al 2017 a 4 d t ν ψ c g t γ β γ β ν ψ t β ν 1 indeed by direct calculation we have that d t ν ψ c ψ β 1 t β 1 γ 1 ν 0 t ψ t ψ τ ν ψ τ ψ τ β 2 d τ and taking y ψ τ ψ t we have

eigenfunction of the operator d t ν ψ c when ν 0 1 and ψ is a well behaved function such that ψ 0 0 this means that a 6 d t ν ψ c e ν λ ψ t ν λ e ν λ ψ t ν for any λ r see lemma 2 in almeida et al 2017 indeed by direct calculation using a 4 we have that d t ν ψ c e ν λ ψ t ν d t ν ψ c k 0 λ k ψ t ν k γ ν k 1 k 0 λ k ψ t ν k ν γ ν k 1 ν λ e ν λ ψ t ν as claimed we now give some details about the mathematical relation between h x and ψ in our model let us consider the case β 1 for β 1 the calculations are similar we recall that in our generalized model with space dependent diffusivity the sediment balance in the erosional domain is given by a 7 1 ψ dq dx 1 0 x 1 2 we observe that in our model q x d x ν ψ c h x by taking a 8 h x ψ x 1 2 1 ν ψ x 1 ν γ 2 ν we have by using a 4 that q x ψ

its generalization in particular following ganti et al 2010 parker et al 2000 the exner equation can be written as follow 2 1 1 λ p h t d b x t e b x t where d b denotes the volume rate per unit area of deposition of bed load particles e b the volume rate per unit area of entrainment of bed particles λ p the porosity of bed sediment essentially the balance between deposition and entrainment is proportional to the divergence of the sediment flux q x t see for example paola and voller 2005 this means that eq 2 1 can be written in the one dimensional case as 2 2 1 λ p h t q x in the steady local formulation of the so called exner equation the relation between sediment flux q x and the fluvial slope h x in the local steady formulation is given by see paola 2000 p 140 2 3 q x dh dx i e the sediment flux in a first order approximation is directly proportional to the fluvial slope we assume that the erosional and depositional regions equally divide the domain and we take by suitable scaling for simplicity 0 x 1 in the erosional domain with uplift we have that voller et al 2012 2 4 dq dx 1 0 x 1 2 q 0 0 h 1 2 0 while in the contiguous depositional region with subsidence we have 2

depositional region there is a wide literature about the applications of fractional derivatives in water flow models and solute transport through porous media see e g mehdinejadiani et al 2013b schumer et al 2009 in particular benson et al 2000 derived the space fractional advection dispersion equation to simulate transport in porous media this equation has been widely studied in the recent literature we refer for instance to ghazal and behrouz 2018 mehdinejadiani and fathi 2020 mehdinejadiani et al 2013a moradi and mehdinejadiani 2020 the applications of fractional calculus in hydrology have been deeply studied by su in a series of papers we refer in particular to the recent monograph su 2020 that is a relevant reference in this field of research in the field of geomorphology schumer et al 2009 described essential nonlocal features of sediment transport in hillslope and fluvial systems by developing a fractional advection dispersion equation with a non integer order derivative on time or space terms in their model nonlocality describes transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance in this frame fractional derivative in space would arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system their results are consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems voller and paola voller et al 2012 explored nonclassical or non fickian anomalous sediment transport in braided networks which are known to have fractal planform geometry they solved a fractional diffusion equation for a steady state aggrading fluvial profile capturing effects of power law statistics in the underlying dynamics in voller et al 2012 a nonlocal formulation of the steady exner law has been considered based on the application of the caputo fractional derivatives the physical assumption in the generalized nonlocal exner law discussed in voller et al 2012 is that the sediment flux should be treated as a power law weighted sum of slopes across a region by means of this approach it is possible to take into account the heterogeneous length scales on the fluvial surface the nonlocal exner law suggested in voller et al 2012 is based on the following relation between sediment flux and slope 2 6 q x 1 β 2 d ν h dx ν 1 β 2 d ν h d x ν ν 0 1 involving left and right caputo fractional derivatives of order ν 0 1 see kilbas et al 2006 for definition and main properties of caputo fractional derivatives the parameter β appearing in exner 1920 is a directional measure that provides a weighting between purely upstream and downstream nonlocality indeed for β 1 we have a purely upstream nonlocal contribution while for β 1 purely downstream we recall that according to the analysis developed in voller et al 2012 the evolution for the erosional region is well defined by considering β 1 upstream nonlocal contribution while in the depositional region the downstream contribution is the most relevant i e β 1 this means that in the general formulation 2 6 a different weight β should be considered in the nonlocal balance law following this approach we have that h x 1 2 1 ν x 1 ν γ 2 ν in the erosional region β 1 h x 1 x ν 1 1 2 1 ν γ 2 ν in the depositional region β 1 we note that this formulation of the exner law assumes a power law weight is assumed and the role of the nonlocality is described by means of the parameter ν 0 1 in the next section we suggest a different mathematical formulation based on the application of the fractional derivatives with respect to another function our main idea is to have a more general mathematical approach without restrictions to power law memory kernel in the formulation of the non local exner law 3 the generalized nonlocal exner law here we consider a more general formulation of the nonlocal exner law 3 1 q x 1 β 2 d x ν ψ c h x 1 β 2 d ν ψ c h x ν 0 1 where the caputo type derivatives are fractional derivatives w r t another function see appendix a 3 2 d x ν ψ c g x 1 γ 1 ν 0 x ψ x ψ x ν d dx g x dx and 3 3 d ν ψ c g t 1 γ 1 ν x 1 ψ x ψ x ν d dx g x dx where ψ is a suitable given well behaved function related to the space dependence of the geological parameters in the exner law in recent papers colombaro et al 2018 liu et al 2020 it was shown the utility of this mathematical approach in rheology and in particular in rock physics the heuristic idea is that by means of these more general operators we have a convolution of the classical derivative with a family of well behaved functions without restrictions to the power law case differently from the classical definition of the caputo derivative in general a nonlocal formulation of the exner law is based on the convolution of a given memory kernel with the local fluvial slope with our formulation we can simply obtain different depositional and erosional profiles depending by the concrete form of the function ψ appearing in the kernel and describing the role of the nonlocality in the physical process we observe that the fractional operator in 3 1 is the counter part of integer order differential operator 1 ψ d dx this implies that our approach allows for including variable coefficient in the governing model equation here we follow the main considerations in voller et al 2012 about the role of β for a meaningful description of the evolution of erosional and deposition regions thus by direct calculations see the appendix a and kilbas et al 2006 for details we have that the erosional and depositional profiles depending by the function ψ are given by h x ψ x 1 2 1 ν ψ x 1 ν γ 2 ν in the erosional region β 1 h x ψ x 1 ψ x ν 1 ψ x 1 ψ x 1 2 1 ν γ 2 ν in the depositional region β 1 we have a wide class of profiles and the physics of the nonlocal process is contained in the concrete form of the function ψ moreover we note that the sediment balances in 2 4 and 2 5 are now given by 3 4 1 ψ dq dx 1 0 x 1 2 and 3 5 1 ψ dq dx 1 1 2 x 1 where ψ d ψ dx represents a space dependant diffusive coefficient that expands the exner equation in the fractional approach when ν 1 and ψ const we recover indeed the classical local solutions an interesting case that we briefly consider is for example ψ x ln 1 x modelling a slower power law nonlocal effect h x ln 3 2 1 ν ln 1 x 1 ν γ 2 ν in the erosional region β 1 h x ln 4 3 1 ν ln 2 ln 1 x ν 1 γ 2 ν in the depositional region β 1 mathematically speaking this approach is strictly related to the hadamard fractional derivative and have been used also in viscoelasticity in long et al 2018 for example in a diffusive process this approach can be useful for models of ultraslow diffusions see the recent survey liang et al 2019 in fig 1 we show the nonlocal erosional and depositional profiles obtained by using a logarithmic kernel for different values of the parameter ν it is evident the role played by the logarithmic nonlocal effect as slow smoothed change in the profile with respect to the local profile predicted by the exner equation in fig 2 we put together in continuity the evolution predicted by the nonlocal model with logarithmic kernel in the erosional domain 0 x 1 2 and in the depositional domain 1 2 x 1 for ν 0 6 in order to underline the different behaviour in the different domains 4 discussion and conclusions in this paper we considered the role played by fractional derivatives w r t another function in the nonlocal formulation of the exner law as an interesting generalization of the approach developed in voller et al 2012 we considered the limit cases β 1 and β 1 corresponding to nonlocality that is fully biased upstream or downstream respectively in the general case 1 β 1 we are not able to obtain the explicit form of the fluvial profile this can be numerically investigated in a future study according to voller et al 2012 the predictions for fluvial profiles with non extreme values of β will be enveloped by the solutions at the extremes a confirmation on this point can be obtained by numerical simulations in view of the general form of the model eq 3 1 it is clear that for any β 1 we have a balance between purely upstream and downstream nonlocality it is well known that fractional models in morphodynamics has a clear interpretation in relation to ctrws however the rigorous analysis of different mathematical models for sediment transport is still open and need to be experimentally validated in order to understand the different underlying physics for instance in falcini et al 2013 and pelosi and parker 2014 the combination of nonlinearity and nonlocality have been considered in this context our mathematical model can be interpreted in the unsteady case by means of scaled brownian motion see e g liang et al 2019 in sediment transport and in the particular logarithmic case in terms of ultraslow anomalous processes these different generalizations of the exner law should be object of future experimental research we have some outcomes from this mathematical approach first of all we can search a suitable choice of ψ that can give a direct connection between the erosional and depositional regions without a different choice of β secondly we have a mathematical tool to take into account space variability of diffusivity coefficients here we considered the steady nonlocal exner law a future object of our study can be the role played by ψ fractional derivative for the unsteady nonlocal exner law in order to take into account the space dependence of diffusivity and nonlocal effects together with our approach the complete unsteady exner equation is given by 4 1 h t q x x 1 β 2 d x ν ψ c h x 1 β 2 d ν ψ c h x here is more clear that the application of the ψ x derivative is a way to embed in the nonlocal operator the space dependence of the diffusivity coefficient that appears in the classical diffusion equation in our view this approach should be further analyzed but this is beyond the aims of the paper that is strictly related to the evolution profile in a steady approximation credit authorship contribution statement f falcini conceptualization

fractional derivative of a function with respect to another function fractional derivatives of a function with respect to another function is an old topic already considered in the classical monograph by kilbas et al 2006 section 2 5 recently almeida and coauthors in almeida et al 2017 2018 introduced the caputo type definition and discussed some interesting properties the utility of these generalized fractional operators in the applications is represented by the fact that they are essentially obtained by a deterministic time change and permits us to take into account both variable coefficients and memory or nonlocal effects moreover this class of operators include as special cases classical fractional derivatives for example fractional derivatives in the sense of hadamard or erdélyi kober here we recall the basic definitions and properties for the reader s convenience let ν 0 ψ t an increasing suitable function such that ψ t 0 in a t the fractional integral of a function g t with respect to another function ψ t is given by a 1 i a ν ψ g t 1 γ ν a t ψ τ ψ t ψ τ ν 1 g τ d τ observe that for ψ t t β we recover the definition of erdélyi kober fractional integral recently applied for example in connection with the generalized grey brownian motion pagnini 2012 for simplicity hereafter we will consider a 0 as usual and suitable functions ψ such that ψ 0 0 all the results can be simply generalized the corresponding caputo type evolution operator see almeida et al 2017 for 0 ν 1 is given by a 2 d t ν ψ c g t 1 γ 1 ν 0 t ψ t ψ τ ν d d τ g τ d τ a 3 i 0 1 ν ψ 1 ψ t d dt g t observe that in the literature these operators are also named ψ fractional derivatives for the general case ν r we refer to almeida et al 2017 in this paper we are interested to the case 0 ν 1 interpolating as a limit case the ordinary first order derivative while the higher order cases can be treated in a similar way we have used the symbol d t ν ψ c in order to underline the generic integro differential nature of the time evolution operator depending on the choice of the function ψ t and the real order ν a relevant property of the operator a 3 is that if g t ψ t β 1 with β 1 then see lemma 1 of almeida et al 2017 a 4 d t ν ψ c g t γ β γ β ν ψ t β ν 1 indeed by direct calculation we have that d t ν ψ c ψ β 1 t β 1 γ 1 ν 0 t ψ t ψ τ ν ψ τ ψ τ β 2 d τ and taking y ψ τ ψ t we have that d t ν ψ c ψ β 1 t β 1 ψ β 1 ν t γ 1 ν 0 1 1 y ν y β 2 dy γ β ψ β 1 ν t γ β 1 γ 1 ν γ 1 ν γ β 1 γ β ν γ β γ β ν ψ t β ν 1 therefore the composite mittag leffler function a 5 g t e ν λ ψ t ν is an eigenfunction of the operator d t ν ψ c when ν 0 1 and ψ is a well behaved function such that ψ 0 0 this means that a 6 d t ν ψ c e ν λ ψ t ν λ e ν λ ψ t ν for any λ r see lemma 2 in almeida et al 2017 indeed by direct calculation using a 4 we have that d t ν ψ c e ν λ ψ t ν d t ν ψ c k 0 λ k ψ t ν k γ ν k 1 k 0 λ k ψ t ν k ν γ ν k 1 ν λ e ν λ ψ t ν as claimed we now give some details about the mathematical relation between h x and ψ in our model let us consider the case β 1 for β 1 the calculations are similar we recall that in our generalized model with space dependent diffusivity the sediment balance in the erosional domain is given by a 7 1 ψ dq dx 1 0 x 1 2 we observe that in our model q x d x ν ψ c h x by taking a 8 h x ψ x 1 2 1 ν ψ x 1 ν γ 2 ν we have by using a 4 that q x ψ x 1 ψ dq dx 1 as claimed and satisfy the given boundary condition
