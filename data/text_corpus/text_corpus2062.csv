10310,detailed knowledge of soil moisture θ is crucial for implementing appropriate soil and crop management decisions and assuring crop productivity and soil functioning θ measurement is challenging in the stony soils of traditional olive orchards where the operationality of common sensors is often compromised and fine scale variability of soil properties is complex as a result of the presence and specific architecture of the tree root system and canopy in such environments non invasive electromagnetic induction emi sensors constitute an alternative for measuring θ here we evaluate this alternative by exploring relationships between θ and apparent electrical conductivity eca and contribute to improved understanding of spatio temporal θ variability in the proximity of olive trees continuously measured θ in a trench on one side of an olive tree was complemented with 47 eca surveys conducted periodically at the opposite side of the tree during a period of 15 months θ was measured in the trench at five distances from the trunk 0 6 3 8 m and at five depths 0 1 0 8 m eca was measured at the same distances from the trunk we observed similar temporal patterns of θ and eca in response to precipitation and evaporation at the site the proportionality between spatial means of θ and eca and the similarity in the relationships between spatial mean and standard deviation for each variable revealed concurrent spatio temporal patterns dependence on distance to the trunk was different for θ and eca with an apparent erratic response for the former and a positive relationship for the latter the slope of the linear θ eca models showed power law decay with distance to the trunk as a result of the varying soil and tree properties around the tree these results pave the way for implementing coupled static mobile eca monitoring systems and θ estimation in olive orchards from the plot to the field and farm scales graphical abstract ga1 keywords spatio temporal variability

landscape especially in countries such as spain which accounts for about 40 of the world production of olive oil ioc 2019 and represents approximately 30 of the world olive acreage this is especially significant in regions like andalusia where olive growing is the single most important land use olive monoculture in some areas of andalusia and other mediterranean areas is increasing the risk of suffering environmental problems such as accelerated erosion gómez et al 2014 and non point source pollution of surface waters by agrochemicals due to inadequate soil management on sloping land associated with decade long olive cultivation hermosin et al 2013 appropriate soil and water conservation strategies and management are needed to guarantee the sustainability of these systems soil moisture θ is a critical variable that exerts an important control on mass transport and energy exchange at the soil surface and therefore on plant status and development vereecken et al 2014 initial soil moisture status is determinant in the process of infiltration and the potential for runoff generation and solute and sediment transport wei et al 2007 the amount of water that plants can extract from the soil matrix and transpire to produce biomass is highly dependent on soil moisture distribution and availability soil moisture spatio temporal dynamics are not only strongly linked with the root development and distribution garré et al 2011 but also with the shape and characteristics of the tree canopy that modifies and concentrates rainfall in the vicinity of the tree trunk through interception and stem flow respectively liang et al 2007 several methods are available to study soil moisture dynamics at the point to field scales vereecken et al 2014 soil sampling neutron attenuation and electromagnetic methods such as tdr or fdr have been used widely to measure and provide point data at a possible range of temporal resolutions these methods involve soil disturbance either to obtain the samples or to install the sensors and generally have a small measurement support this is especially limiting in the highly heterogeneous and stony soils of many olive groves in andalusia however the main advantage of some of these methods is their high temporal resolution and the near real time availability of information non invasive geophysical methods such as ground penetrating radar gpr electromagnetic induction emi and electrical resistivity tomography ert offer potential to overcome this limited spatial support binley et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 and can return information with a spatial resolution down to a few meters even for large fields some of these geophysical methods have been used intensively for soil moisture characterization in the root zone al hagrey 2007 garré et al 2011 minet et al 2012 while gpr and ert have proven good performance for soil moisture mapping and allow detailed measurements of soil moisture profiles their use has some limitations one such limitation is the attenuation of the gpr signal under wet conditions or in heavy clay soils drawbacks of ert that prevent its widespread applicability huang et al 2016 are the insertion of electrodes in stony or very dry soils the high soil electrode contact resistance the alteration of the soil surface the extensive electrical cabling and the complex post processing to overcome such limitations multifrequency or multicoil emi sensors could be an alternative to characterize soil moisture patterns according to different depths of exploration electromagnetic induction sensors provide soil apparent electrical conductivity eca measurements apparent because it is measured in a volume of soil composed of the soil matrix and voids electrical conductivity relates with the soil s ionic component s ability to conduct electrical current corwin and scudiero 2020 such measurements are depth weighted average values of eca all soil properties and components that present some degree of polarization or ionization or play a role in generating pathways for electromagnetic field induction and propagation show an effect on eca among them soluble ions e g salts nutrients rhoades et al 1976 water content martínez et al 2010 2012 clay amount and type reyes et al 2018 soil organic matter martinez et al 2009 soil structure soil bulk density etc have been traditionally studied with this type of sensor rhoades et al 1976 corwin and lesch 2005 doolittle and brevik 2014 emi sensors have been used previously to measure soil moisture at the field scale e g martínez et al 2012 2010 calamita et al 2017 moghadas and badorreck 2019 in unsaturated soils the soil eca depends on the volumetric moisture content θ the ion concentration in the soil solution and the presence of charged solid particles e g clay content and organic matter friedman 2005 in non saline and homogeneous soils most of the variations observed in the eca patterns can be generally attributed to differences in θ martínez et al 2012 2010 used time lapse eca surveys to characterize θ in a vertisol in sw spain under a sunflower pea wheat rotation these authors found a low correlation between eca and θ for individual surveys because of the small data ranges of measured θ nevertheless the proportion of variability in θ for a single survey date explained by the eca increased when time lapse eca surveys where used jointly in an experimental catchment in southern italy with varying geological and morphological features calamita et al 2015 observed also small correlations between θ and eca which they attributed to the complex terrain and the forest cover of their study area they found higher correlations in wooded areas than in shrubs and grass areas they explained the better performance in wooded areas by the similar depth of exploration of both the emi and soil moisture sensors and the higher spatial and temporal soil moisture variability compared to the grass and shrubs area robinson et al 2012 obtained higher correlations between eca and θ by subtracting eca from the driest month from all the other emi surveys as a proxy to remove the contribution of the soil matrix electrical conductivity ecs to eca brevik et al 2006 found correlations of 0 5 0 9 between eca as measured with the em38 emi sensor and gravimetric soil moisture along a transect in a fine loam soil as highlighted by calamita et al 2015 few studies exploring the relation between θ and eca with single frequency emi sensors have been conducted in forested areas or in tree orchards the root zone and particularly the distribution of tree and grass root biomass has been explored extensively with ert and other geophysical methods al hagrey 2007 amato et al 2008 2010 celano et al 2011 garré et al 2011 rossi et al 2011 ain lhout et al 2016 the relation between eca and soil moisture in the heterogeneous area beneath an olive tree where thicker and thinner resistive roots distribute differently interacting with a densely distributed and shallow system of fine roots from the cover crop has not been explored to our knowledge with non destructive methods such as emi this relation needs to be understood to characterize eca θ relationships under tree canopies and thus provide more accurate θ estimates at the field and farm scales considering this small scale variability the objectives of this work were to evaluate i the spatio temporal variability of θ and eca underneath an olive tree and ii the mutual dependence of those patterns of variability and iii the relation between θ and eca with the distance from the tree trunk 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in a 1 ha olive grove picual cv managed under organic farming for more than 40 years repullo et al 2012 the site is located at the ifapa alameda del obispo research center in cordoba spain utm coordinates xy 341 642 m 4 192 085 m zone 30 n 117 m a m s l fig 1 within 250 m of the guadalquivir river climate of the area can be classified as subtropical mediterranean climate csa according to the köppen classification with mean annual precipitation of 586 mm over the period 1989 2020 and average temperature of 18 2 c summers are very dry with practically no rainfall events of more than 1 mm between june and august and with high average daily temperatures of 36 9 c in july precipitation is concentrated in the period from november to february due to the atlantic coastal influence with average temperatures near 12 c with the lowest minimum average daily temperature in january 3 6 c the trees are planted on an 8 8 m grid average height and diameter of the asymmetric tree canopy was 4 1 and 5 3 m respectively although characterized by a strong asymmetry fig 2c one tree was selected from the central region of the field for intensive monitoring fig 1b the surrounding area of the tree was kept with a spontaneous grass cover that was allowed to grow without limitation and remained as a mulch layer after dieback in spring fig 2c the soil is a typic xerofluvent soil survey staff 2014 with a minimum depth of at least 3 m and includes several layers of gravel and big boulders without an ordered pattern because of anthropic influence in the outskirts of the city since roman times the soil textural class is loam and average organic matter content was 2 in the top 0 2 m and 1 in the 0 3 0 5 m depth soil ph and the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water solution in the topsoil was 8 7 and 0 1dsm 1 respectively repullo et al 2012 2 2 soil moisture monitoring system we installed 25 cs616 soil θ sensors campbel sci logan ut eeuu in the wall of a 4 m long and 1 5 m deep excavated trench on the nw facing side of the tree the sensor rod length was 0 3 m sensors were installed at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 m and at five distances away from the tree trunk starting at 0 6 m with increments of 0 8 m up to a maximum distance of 3 8 m fig 2a the soil θ sensors were connected to a datalogger model cr1000 campbel sci logan ut eeuu and programmed to record θ at 5 minute time intervals factory calibration which gives 2 5 accuracy in θ as stated in the manufacturer s manual was used in order to prevent significant effects of the environmental conditions on the water fluxes in the soil along the trench and to allow easy access to the sensors in case of malfunctioning we built an artificial isolating wall made of fiberglass and polypropylene soil moisture monitoring started on april 10 2014 day 1 and finished on july 27 2015 day 474 depth weighted averages of θ for the 0 0 9 m soil profile were calculated by weighting with the corresponding layer thickness for each soil sensor layer boundaries corresponded with the central point in between two observation depths i e 0 15 0 9 for the sensors at 0 1 and 0 2 m and 0 2 0 9 for the remainder meteorological data and reference evapotranspiration eto were provided by an automatic weather station located at 600 m from the experimental plot ria 2020 2 3 dualem 21 data collection soil eca measurements were performed with a dualem 21 dualem inc milton ontario canada emi sensor the sensor operates at a fixed frequency of 9 khz and has one emitter coil and two pairs of receiver coils that form two coil pairs with horizontal coplanar geometry hcp and two pairs with perpendicular geometry prp the distance between the emitter and the center of each of the two perpendicular receiver coils is 1 1 and 2 1 m which corresponds to theoretical depths of exploration of 0 5 and 1 0 m respectively similarly the distances between the emitter and the two horizontal receiver coils are 1 0 and 2 0 m respectively yielding theoretical exploration depths of 1 5 and 3 0 m respectively depth z response of emi sensor is dependent on operation frequency coil separation s and relative orientation theoretical depth response for the hcp and prp coil orientations can be obtained from mcneill 1980 eqs 1 and 2 show the relative responses of the hcp and prp orientations as a function of depth and coil separation s for the dualem 21s sensor 1 r h c p z 1 4 z s 2 1 0 5 2 r prp z 2 z s 2 4 z s 2 1 0 5 we computed the correlation between the different emi signals and the integrated soil moisture of the top 0 9 m for the different distances to the tree trunk under evaluation we found consistently higher correlations between soil moisture and the prp2 signal coils separated by 2 m with perpendicular relative orientation with an effective depth of exploration near 1 m although the depth response of the prp2 sensor is not linear its depth of exploration is very similar to the monitoring depth of the bench of soil moisture sensors in addition strong larger than 0 85 and significant p 0 001 correlations existed between the four emi signals and the prp arrays are known to be more stable than the hcp arrays huang et al 2017 for these reasons we decided to use only the prp2 signal for this study eca measurements were performed on 47 days during the soil moisture monitoring period april 10 2014 to july 27 2015 the sensor was turned on and left on the ground for 30 min before each survey to allow time lapse measurements at exactly the same positions a polyethylene framework was installed on the se facing side of the tree opposite to the trench on which the dualem 21 could be positioned at fixed distances from the trunk with its main axis normal to the direction of the transect fig 2a and c choosing opposite sides of the tree for eca and θ monitoring was decided to avoid emi signal interferences from soil moisture sensors and cables the measurements were taken at 22 locations between 0 4 and 4 6 m away from the trunk and with 0 20 m increments the sensor was operated at 0 10 m above the soil surface in order to evaluate measurement drift during the short measurement period on each day we triplicated the survey on december 12 2014 and found an average standard error among repeated measurements of 0 8msm 1 due to the short time interval during which the eca measurements were performed on each day no temperature effects were expected for individual surveys although all surveys started at 8 a m substantial variations in air and soil temperature occurred throughout the entire measurement period therefore a temperature correction eq 3 was performed considering soil temperature measured at a depth of 0 25 m and using the equation proposed by corwin and lesch 2005 3 e c a t e c a 0 447 1 403 e t 26 815 2 4 data transformation and temporal stability analysis data quality control was performed by checking that θ and eca lay within reasonable threshold values for this site 0 07 0 42 m3 m 3 for θ and 5 30 msm 1 for eca also consistency with preceding values and antecedent eto and p was checked we performed a temporal stability analysis of θ and eca vachaud et al 1985 this methodology allows for a spatio temporal analysis of data and has been widely used in environmental applications at different scales to identify locations within a study area that have values consistently lower higher or near the spatial mean as expressed by the mean of their relative difference rd mrd eq 2 the stability in time of these locations can then be quantified by the standard deviation of the mean relative difference sdrd eq 3 mrds represent the systematic bias of a variable at a specific location with respect to the average of all the locations while the sdrd quantifies the variability of the representativeness of each location a thoughtful review on the topic can be found in vanderlinden et al 2012 the mrd and sdrd are defined as follows 4 m r d i 1 t j 1 t r d i j 1 t j 1 t x i j x j x j 5 s d r d i 1 t 1 j 1 t r d i j m r d i 2 where j 1 t is the number of surveys i 1 n the number of measurement locations and x j the spatial mean of x i j for survey j 3 results and discussion 3 1 θ and eca temporal patterns temporal patterns of θ and eca were similar and a consequence of variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration intensity throughout the study period with high θ and eca values during the fall winter and spring and low values during summer fig 3a and b the strong correspondence in the drying and wetting patterns of both variables is noteworthy especially having in mind that the data were collected on opposite sides of the tree the maximum distance between the θ and eca measurement locations furthest away from the tree trunk was 7 20 m and using technologies that explore soil volumes differing in several orders of magnitude minimum θ and eca were observed on day 148 september 4 2014 by the end of the summer period which is typical of mediterranean areas and corresponds to extreme drought conditions after long periods without rainfall and high temperatures daily maximum temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 c maximum θ and eca values were observed during the fall of 2014 day 219 november 14 2014 after a succession of rainfall events from day 180 onwards october 7 2014 the response of θ and eca to rainfall can be clearly observed in fig 3a and b on days 161 september 18 2014 187 october 14 2014 209 november 4 2014 and 216 november 11 2014 sharp increases in θ were observed on those days and correspondingly eca increments were recorded at the opposite side of the tree measured eca ranged from 7 1 to 22 8msm 1 during the experiment table 1 these are typical values for less conductive soils kachanoski and de jong 1988 sheets and hendrickx 1995 temporal variability in terms of the coefficient of variation cv was slightly larger for eca than for θ except for the measurement position at 1 4 m from the trunk this was also observed by calamita et al 2015 revealing the effect of other soil properties than θ e g dissolved ions in the soil solution porosity etc on the temporal variability of eca in this experiment where no salts are added to the soil through irrigation or fertilization soil pore space physical attributes changes in soil bulk density or relevance of resistive structures such as roots appear to be the main drivers of this difference during days 1 30 april 10 2014 may 9 2014 spring and 270 370 january 5 2015 to april 15 2015 winter early spring both θ and eca exhibited a sharp decrease followed by a smoother decrease days 370 473 we hypothesize that transpiration of the grass cover contributes particularly to this decrease during the late winter and early spring period when a bloom in grass development occurs demanding large amounts of water soil water management in this period is vital as the cover crop begins to compete with the water use by the main crop and it is usually terminated chemically or mechanically and left on the soil surface as a mulch alonso ayuso et al 2014 since the focus of this study was on θ and eca dynamics rather than on cover crop management the spontaneous grass cover was allowed to complete its vegetative cycle during the subsequent period starting roughly on day 370 and corresponding with spring and early summer rainfall became scarce and eto increased significantly this triggers the dieback of the grass cover which is left on the soil surface as a protective mulch considering only data collected on a single survey date five θ eca data pairs for each survey correlations found between θ and eca ranged from 0 65 day 169 september 26 2014 to 0 58 day 379 april 24 2015 their minimum absolute value was 0 06 and it corresponded with day 148 september 5 2014 under very dry conditions while the correlations of θ and eca were very variable none of them were statistically significant p 0 05 possible reasons for the absence of statistical significance in these correlations can be the small number of data pairs five effects small scale spatial variability or sampling errors it is noteworthy though that the correlations found for days 169 and 379 had opposite signs 0 65 and 0 58 even though the average θ was similar on both days 0 19 and 0 20 m3 m 3 respectively this difference could be associated with different hydrological situations on day 169 topsoil θ was larger than in the subsoil wetting situation while on day 379 the subsoil was wetter than the topsoil drying situation this highlights the importance of considering transient soil conditions when relating θ and eca and this factor might change in relevance depending on the emi depth response and exploration depths limitations of the θ eca relation may come also from the differential depth sensitivity of the emi sensor configurations where soils with different θ profiles and the same profile average θ can yield different depth integrated eca values also strongly heterogeneous profiles in terms of soil properties as those observed at this site can contribute to this effect 3 2 θ and eca spatial patterns the same general temporal drying wetting patterns were observed in θ and eca along the transect both under the canopy 0 2 2 m from the trunk bluish lines in fig 3a and b and into the alley 2 2 3 8 m from the trunk green and yellow lines in fig 3a and b the highest median θ values were found near the trunk 0 6 m and in the alley 3 8 m as shown in table 1 and fig 4a the concentration of intercepted rainfall by the canopy and its conversion to stemflow might be a possible explanation for the higher 75 quantile top of the box and extreme values near the trunk espejo pérez et al 2016 observed different results in the sandy soil of a field in sw spain where higher θ was found in the alleys than under the olive tree canopies nevertheless they found an opposite behavior in stony areas within the same field with higher θ under the canopies which agrees with our results in a field with relevant stony features median eca values steadily increased with distance from the trunk fig 4b revealing a less conductive medium in the vicinity of the trunk as compared to the alley this could be a consequence of the resistive nature of the structural tree roots near the trunk as shown by amato et al 2008 and rossi et al 2011 and the increasing soil bulk density with distance to the trunk fig s1 positive correlation between eca and soil bulk density has been previously reported e g johnson et al 2001 who refer in their study to a decrease in soil bulk density and eca because of plant root activity this hypothesis is also consistent with the rhoades et al 1989 three phase model for dry and intermediate states the involved assumption of homogeneity of the solid phase conductivity is more realistic in the alleys where presumably fewer roots are found basically the soil profile s solid phase is mostly composed of sand silt and clay than under the canopy where the soil profile s solid phase is a heterogeneous mixture of roots and soil components ain lhout et al 2016 measured detailed electrical resistivity profiles in the surroundings of argan trees which resemble olive trees in terms of root architecture and used these to monitor θ in the root zone they observed strong similarities in θ on both sides of symmetric trees and slight differences in θ for asymmetric trees the asymmetric shape of our tree might be an additional source of variability that should be considered when relating θ and eca patterns measured at opposite sides of the tree trunk also the large and increasing variability of eca with distance to the trunk is noteworthy fig 4b and represents the wide range of governing soil hydrological conditions on the different surveys dates particularly farthest away from the tree trunk spatial means of eca and θ were linearly related showing the strong relation between the spatially averaged values of both variables at opposite sides of the tree trunk fig 5a also the spatial standard deviation and mean of eca showed a linear tendency fig 5c which corresponds roughly with the drying branch of the commonly known convex shape that this relationship exhibits for soil moisture and which is generally observed at larger scales famiglietti et al 2008 martínez et al 2014 teuling et al 2006 this response was less evident for θ although for θ 0 16 m3 m 3 a relatively linear tendency could be observed fig 5b the lack of correspondence observed in fig 5b for dry soil conditions θ 0 16 m3 m 3 in this study has also been reported in other studies and was mostly found for subsoil measurements rosenbaum et al 2012 in our study most of these data points correspond with transient conditions such as after rainfall events occurring during dry periods e g days 42 and 48 in may 2014 71 and 78 in june 2014 141 and 148 in late august beginning of september under such circumstances there is larger soil moisture variability due to heterogeneous moistening of the soil profile with a relatively wetter and dryer topsoil after the rainfall and after long dry periods respectively as compared to the subsoil also differences in the received amount of rainfall between the canopy projection area the canopy dripping zone and the alleys can be associated with larger spatial variability the absence of the wet branch of the commonly convex shape found between these two variables in large scale studies e g famiglietti et al 2008 in fig 5b and c reflects unsaturated profile conditions during the study period and might be a result of the coarse soil texture and the deep soil profile at the experimental site the linear relationship between the spatial mean and the standard deviation of eca and θ has also been observed for θ during the extended monitoring period 2013 2019 data not shown and can be useful for up and downscaling applications 3 3 θ and eca temporal stability analysis means and standard deviations of relative differences were generally smaller for eca than for θ fig 6a and b reflecting more temporally stable and less spatially variable patterns for eca than for θ at the spatial scale of this study and considering the flat topography of the plot temporal stability and spatial variability patterns of eca and θ depend mostly on local controls such as soil properties and vegetation vereecken et al 2014 instead of non local controls such as rainfall variability and the specific topographic futures of the site compared to the surroundings runoff and subsurface flow contributing area the ranked mrd eca showed a clear increasing pattern with the distance to the trunk which can be related with the tendency of increasing soil bulk density and decreasing importance of the root system and canopy coverage with distance to the trunk ranked mrd θ showed a less continuous pattern without any apparent dependence on soil bulk density root system or canopy coverage martinez et al 2013 observed similar discontinuous ranked mrd θ in a simulation experiment when soils with a strong spatial variability in their hydraulic properties were studied such fine scale variability could be observed during the installation of sensors as can be seen in fig s2 big boulders and gravel layers are mixed across the soil profile the picture taken after a rainy period shows darker moistened soil next to the tree trunk about 0 6 m away from the tree trunk and a bright colored area dry in the central part of the trench about 1 5 m away from the trunk below the wet surface this may explain at least partially the observed mrd θ pattern θ at 0 6 m from the trunk is on average wetter than at 1 4 m while such small scale variability may occur on both sides of the tree the larger spatial support of the eca measurements as compared to the θ measurements makes the former less sensitive to fine scale variability 3 4 spatial dependence of the relation θ eca a significant correlation 0 76 p 0 001 was obtained between θ and eca when pooling together all the data measured during the entire monitoring period and at the five distances from the trunk also spatial standard deviations of θ and eca correlated significantly fig s3 taking θ eca data pairs obtained at the same distance along the entire monitoring period we could find a significant linear relation for all the distances under consideration table 2 the slope of those linear models between θ and eca presented a power law decay pattern dependent on the distance to the trunk near the tree trunk the slope was steeper than further away from the trunk this feature may be reflecting the differential abundance of roots around a tree and the observed pattern of soil bulk density this behavior with respect to proximity to the tree should be considered when characterizing soil moisture dynamics from eca data at the plot to farm scales 4 conclusions this work compares spatial and temporal patterns of θ and eca in the area of influence of an individual olive tree the patterns showed remarkable similarities especially with respect to the temporal evolution and the average spatial response of both variables in time yet both variables showed a contrasting behavior with respect to proximity of the tree trunk which is attributable to fine scale soil variability root system distribution and soil bulk density differences such small scale variability is especially relevant when soil moisture monitoring is conducted using sensors with small support volumes in this kind of situations sensors with larger support volumes such as emi sensors can provide more accurate information of the soil s moisture state in terms of spatial temporal patterns both variables presented the same feature of increasing variability with increasing spatial mean typical of dry states observed in medium to large scale soil moisture variability studies the observed linear relationship between the spatial means of both variables is relevant for up and downscaling applications of soil moisture at the plot to field scales 101 105 m2 direct comparison between θ and eca at specific survey dates yielded variable results with correlations in the range 0 65 0 58 surveys conducted under similar profile 0 0 9 m depth soil moisture conditions showed different correlations which are explained by different transient moisture distributions across the soil profile pooling together time lapse data and treating separately observations taken at different distances from the tree trunk not only improved correlations between θ and eca but also revealed the clear pattern of decreasing proportionality between both variables as a function of distance to the trunk although this work has a local scope in terms of the extent of the field site and replication of the experimental approach the same behavior was found in a nearby tree also agreement is found with the gradually varying environmental conditions that can be expected in the vicinity of olive trees due to the decreasing abundance of roots and increasing soil bulk density at increasing distances to the trunk this study opens a venue for the implementation of monitoring systems for the accurate evaluation of soil moisture in the contrasting environment below and between olive trees combining both technologies that take into account local and significant heterogeneity imposed by tree roots canopy features and soil compaction by machinery such information is a required step to provide more accurate maps at a range of scales from plot to

root development and distribution garré et al 2011 but also with the shape and characteristics of the tree canopy that modifies and concentrates rainfall in the vicinity of the tree trunk through interception and stem flow respectively liang et al 2007 several methods are available to study soil moisture dynamics at the point to field scales vereecken et al 2014 soil sampling neutron attenuation and electromagnetic methods such as tdr or fdr have been used widely to measure and provide point data at a possible range of temporal resolutions these methods involve soil disturbance either to obtain the samples or to install the sensors and generally have a small measurement support this is especially limiting in the highly heterogeneous and stony soils of many olive groves in andalusia however the main advantage of some of these methods is their high temporal resolution and the near real time availability of information non invasive geophysical methods such as ground penetrating radar gpr electromagnetic induction emi and electrical resistivity tomography ert offer potential to overcome this limited spatial support binley et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 and can return information with a spatial resolution down to a few meters even for large fields some of these geophysical methods have been used intensively for soil moisture characterization in the root zone al hagrey 2007 garré et al 2011 minet et al 2012 while gpr and ert have proven good performance for soil moisture mapping and allow detailed measurements of soil moisture profiles their use has some limitations one such limitation is the attenuation of the gpr signal under wet conditions or in heavy clay soils drawbacks of ert that prevent its widespread applicability huang et al 2016 are the insertion of electrodes in stony or very dry soils the high soil electrode contact resistance the alteration of the soil surface the extensive electrical cabling and the complex post processing to overcome such limitations multifrequency or multicoil emi sensors could be an alternative to characterize soil moisture patterns according to different depths of exploration electromagnetic induction sensors provide soil apparent electrical conductivity eca measurements apparent because it is measured in a volume of soil composed of the soil matrix and voids electrical conductivity relates with the soil s ionic component s ability to conduct electrical current corwin and scudiero 2020 such measurements are depth weighted average values of eca all soil properties and components that present some degree of polarization or ionization or play a role in generating pathways for electromagnetic field induction and propagation show an effect on eca among them soluble ions e g salts nutrients rhoades et al 1976 water content martínez et al 2010 2012 clay amount and type reyes et al 2018 soil organic matter martinez et al 2009 soil structure soil bulk density etc have been traditionally studied with this type of sensor rhoades et al 1976 corwin and lesch 2005 doolittle and brevik 2014 emi sensors have been used previously to measure soil moisture at the field scale e g martínez et al 2012 2010 calamita et al 2017 moghadas and badorreck 2019 in unsaturated soils the soil eca depends on the volumetric moisture content θ the ion concentration in the soil solution and the presence of charged solid particles e g clay content and organic matter friedman 2005 in non saline and homogeneous soils most of the variations observed in the eca patterns can be generally attributed to differences in θ martínez et al 2012 2010 used time lapse eca surveys to characterize θ in a vertisol in sw spain under a sunflower pea wheat rotation these authors found a low correlation between eca and θ for individual surveys because of the small data ranges of measured θ nevertheless the proportion of variability in θ for a single survey date explained by the eca increased when time lapse eca surveys where used jointly in an experimental catchment in southern italy with varying geological and morphological features calamita et al 2015 observed also small correlations between θ and eca which they attributed to the complex terrain and the forest cover of their study area they found higher correlations in wooded areas than in shrubs and grass areas they explained the better performance in wooded areas by the similar depth of exploration of both the emi and soil moisture sensors and the higher spatial and temporal soil moisture variability compared to the grass and shrubs area robinson et al 2012 obtained higher correlations between eca and θ by subtracting eca from the driest month from all the other emi surveys as a proxy to remove the contribution of the soil matrix electrical conductivity ecs to eca brevik et al 2006 found correlations of 0 5 0 9 between eca as measured with the em38 emi sensor and gravimetric soil moisture along a transect in a fine loam soil as highlighted by calamita et al 2015 few studies exploring the relation between θ and eca with single frequency emi sensors have been conducted in forested areas or in tree orchards the root zone and particularly the distribution of tree and grass root biomass has been explored extensively with ert and other geophysical methods al hagrey 2007 amato et al 2008 2010 celano et al 2011 garré et al 2011 rossi et al 2011 ain lhout et al 2016 the relation between eca and soil moisture in the heterogeneous area beneath an olive tree where thicker and thinner resistive roots distribute differently interacting with a densely distributed and shallow system of fine roots from the cover crop has not been explored to our knowledge with non destructive methods such as emi this relation needs to be understood to characterize eca θ relationships under tree canopies and thus provide more accurate θ estimates at the field and farm scales considering this small scale variability the objectives of this work were to evaluate i the spatio temporal variability of θ and eca underneath an olive tree and ii the mutual dependence of those patterns of variability and iii the relation between θ and eca with the distance from the tree trunk 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in a 1 ha olive grove picual cv managed under organic farming for more than 40 years repullo et al

climate of the area can be classified as subtropical mediterranean climate csa according to the köppen classification with mean annual precipitation of 586 mm over the period 1989 2020 and average temperature of 18 2 c summers are very dry with practically no rainfall events of more than 1 mm between june and august and with high average daily temperatures of 36 9 c in july precipitation is

trees are planted on an 8 8 m grid average height and diameter of the asymmetric tree canopy was 4 1 and 5 3 m respectively although characterized by a strong asymmetry fig 2c one tree was selected from the central region of the field for intensive monitoring fig 1b the surrounding area of the tree was kept with a spontaneous grass cover that was allowed to grow without limitation and remained as a mulch layer after dieback in spring fig 2c the soil is a typic xerofluvent soil survey staff 2014 with a minimum depth of at least 3 m and includes several layers of gravel and big boulders without an ordered pattern because of anthropic influence in the outskirts of the city since roman times the soil textural class is loam and average organic matter content was 2 in the top 0 2 m and 1 in the 0 3 0 5 m depth soil ph and the electrical conductivity of the 1 5 soil water solution in the topsoil was 8 7 and 0 1dsm 1 respectively repullo et al 2012 2 2 soil moisture monitoring system we installed 25 cs616 soil θ sensors campbel sci logan ut eeuu in the wall of a 4 m long and 1 5 m deep excavated trench on the nw facing side of the tree the sensor rod length was 0 3 m sensors were installed at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 m and at five distances away from the tree trunk starting at 0 6 m with increments of 0 8 m up to a maximum distance of 3 8 m fig 2a the soil θ sensors were connected to a datalogger model cr1000 campbel sci logan ut eeuu and programmed to record θ at 5 minute time intervals factory calibration which gives 2 5 accuracy in θ as stated in the manufacturer s manual was used in order to prevent significant effects of the environmental conditions on the water fluxes in the soil along the trench and to allow easy access to the sensors in case of malfunctioning we built an artificial isolating wall made of fiberglass and polypropylene soil moisture monitoring started on april 10 2014 day 1 and finished on july 27 2015 day 474 depth weighted averages of θ for the 0 0 9 m soil profile were calculated by weighting with the corresponding layer thickness for each soil sensor layer boundaries corresponded with the central point in between two observation depths i e 0 15 0 9 for the sensors at 0 1 and 0 2 m and 0 2 0 9 for the remainder meteorological data and reference evapotranspiration eto were provided by an automatic weather station located at 600 m from the experimental plot ria 2020 2 3 dualem 21 data collection soil eca measurements were performed with a dualem 21 dualem inc milton ontario canada emi sensor the sensor operates at a fixed frequency of 9 khz and has one emitter coil and two pairs of receiver coils that form two coil pairs with horizontal coplanar geometry hcp and two pairs with perpendicular geometry prp the distance between the emitter and the center of each of the two perpendicular receiver coils is 1 1 and 2 1 m which corresponds to theoretical depths of exploration of 0 5 and 1 0 m respectively similarly the distances between the emitter and the two horizontal receiver coils are 1 0 and 2 0 m respectively yielding theoretical exploration depths of 1 5 and 3 0 m respectively depth z response of emi sensor is dependent on operation frequency coil separation s and relative orientation theoretical depth response for the hcp and prp coil orientations can be obtained from mcneill 1980 eqs 1 and 2 show the relative responses of the hcp and prp orientations as a function of depth and coil separation s for the dualem 21s sensor 1 r h c p z 1 4 z s 2 1 0 5 2 r prp z 2 z s 2 4 z s 2 1 0 5 we computed the correlation between the different emi signals and the integrated soil moisture of the top 0 9 m for the different distances to the tree trunk under evaluation we found consistently higher correlations between soil moisture and the prp2 signal coils separated by 2 m with perpendicular relative orientation with an effective depth of exploration near 1 m although the depth response of the prp2 sensor is not linear its depth of exploration is very similar to the monitoring depth of the bench of soil moisture sensors in addition strong larger than 0 85 and significant p 0 001 correlations existed between the four emi signals and the prp arrays are known to be more stable than the hcp arrays huang et al 2017 for these reasons we decided to use only the prp2 signal for this study eca measurements were performed on 47 days during the soil moisture monitoring period april 10 2014 to july 27 2015 the sensor was turned on and left on the ground for 30 min before each survey to allow time lapse measurements at exactly the same positions a polyethylene framework was installed on the se facing side of the tree opposite to the trench on which the dualem 21 could be positioned at fixed distances from the trunk with its main axis normal to the direction of the transect fig 2a and c choosing opposite sides of the tree for eca and θ monitoring was decided to avoid emi signal interferences from soil moisture sensors and cables the measurements were taken at 22 locations between 0 4 and 4 6 m away from the trunk and with 0 20 m increments the sensor was operated at 0 10 m above the soil surface in order to evaluate measurement drift during the short measurement period on each day we triplicated the survey on december 12 2014 and found an average standard error among repeated measurements of 0 8msm 1 due to the short time interval during which the eca measurements were performed on each day no temperature effects were expected for individual surveys although all surveys started at 8 a m substantial variations in air and soil temperature occurred throughout the entire measurement period therefore a temperature correction eq 3 was performed considering soil temperature measured at a depth of 0 25 m and using the equation proposed by corwin and lesch 2005 3 e c a t e c a 0 447 1 403 e t 26 815 2 4 data transformation and temporal stability analysis data quality control was performed by checking that θ and eca lay within reasonable threshold values for this site 0 07 0 42 m3 m 3 for θ and 5 30 msm 1 for eca also consistency with preceding values and antecedent eto and p was checked we performed a temporal stability analysis of θ and eca vachaud et al 1985 this methodology allows for a spatio temporal analysis of data and has been widely used in environmental applications at different scales to identify locations within a study area that have values consistently lower higher or near the spatial mean as expressed by the mean of their relative difference rd mrd eq 2 the stability in time of these locations can then be quantified by the standard deviation of the mean relative difference sdrd eq 3 mrds represent the systematic bias of a variable at a specific location with respect to the average of all the locations while the sdrd quantifies the variability of the representativeness of each location a thoughtful review on the topic can be found in vanderlinden et al 2012 the mrd and sdrd are defined as follows 4 m r d i 1 t j 1 t r d i j 1 t j 1 t x i j x j x j 5 s d r d i 1 t 1 j 1 t r d i j m r d i 2 where j 1 t is the number of surveys i 1 n the number of measurement locations and x j the spatial mean of x i j for survey j 3 results and discussion 3 1 θ and eca temporal patterns temporal patterns of θ and eca were similar and a consequence of variations in rainfall and evapotranspiration intensity throughout the study period with high θ and eca values during the fall winter and spring and low values during summer fig 3a and b the strong correspondence in the drying and wetting patterns of both variables is noteworthy especially having in mind that the data were collected on opposite sides of the tree the maximum distance between the θ and eca measurement locations furthest away from the tree trunk was 7 20 m and using technologies that explore soil volumes differing in several orders of magnitude minimum θ and eca were observed on day 148 september 4 2014 by the end of the summer period which is typical of mediterranean areas and corresponds to extreme drought conditions after long periods without rainfall and high temperatures daily maximum temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 c maximum θ and eca values were observed during the fall of 2014 day 219 november 14 2014 after a succession of rainfall events from day 180 onwards october 7 2014 the response of θ and eca to rainfall can be clearly observed in fig 3a and b on days 161 september 18 2014 187 october 14 2014 209 november 4 2014 and 216 november 11 2014 sharp increases in θ were observed on those days and correspondingly eca increments were recorded at the opposite side of the tree measured eca ranged from 7 1 to 22 8msm 1 during the experiment table 1 these are typical values for less conductive soils kachanoski and de jong 1988 sheets and hendrickx 1995 temporal variability in terms of the coefficient of variation cv was slightly larger for eca than for θ except for the measurement position at 1 4 m from the trunk this was also observed by calamita et al 2015 revealing the effect of other soil properties than θ e g dissolved ions in the soil solution porosity etc on the temporal variability of eca in this experiment where no salts are added to the soil through irrigation or fertilization soil pore space physical attributes changes in soil bulk density or relevance of resistive structures such as roots appear to be the main drivers of this difference during days 1 30 april 10 2014 may 9 2014 spring and 270 370 january 5 2015 to april 15 2015 winter early spring both θ and eca exhibited a sharp decrease followed by a smoother decrease days 370 473 we hypothesize that transpiration of the grass cover contributes particularly to this decrease during the late winter and early spring period when a bloom in grass development occurs demanding large amounts of water soil water management in this period is vital as the cover crop begins to compete with the water use by the main crop and it is usually terminated chemically or mechanically and left on the soil surface as a mulch alonso ayuso et al 2014 since the focus of this study was on θ and eca dynamics rather than on cover crop management the spontaneous grass cover was allowed to complete its vegetative cycle during the subsequent period starting roughly on day 370 and corresponding with spring and early summer rainfall became scarce and eto increased significantly this triggers the dieback of the grass cover which is left on the soil surface as a protective mulch considering only data collected on a single survey date five θ eca data pairs for each survey correlations found between θ and eca ranged from 0 65 day 169 september 26 2014 to 0 58 day 379 april 24 2015 their minimum absolute value was 0 06 and it corresponded with day 148 september 5 2014 under very dry conditions while the correlations of θ and eca were very variable none of them were statistically significant p 0 05 possible reasons for the absence of statistical significance in these correlations can be the small number of data pairs five effects small scale spatial variability or sampling errors it is noteworthy though that the correlations found for days 169 and 379 had opposite signs 0 65 and 0 58 even though the average θ was similar on both days 0 19 and 0 20 m3 m 3 respectively this difference could be associated with different hydrological situations on day 169 topsoil θ was larger than in the subsoil wetting situation while on day 379 the subsoil was wetter than the topsoil drying situation this highlights the importance of considering transient soil conditions when relating θ and eca and this factor might change in relevance depending on the emi depth response and exploration depths limitations of the θ eca relation may come also from the differential depth sensitivity of the emi sensor configurations where soils with different θ profiles and the same profile average θ can yield different depth integrated eca values also strongly heterogeneous profiles in terms of soil properties as those observed at this site can contribute to this effect 3 2 θ and eca spatial patterns the same general temporal drying wetting patterns were observed in θ and eca along the transect both under the canopy 0 2 2 m from the trunk bluish lines in fig 3a and b and into the alley 2 2 3 8 m from the trunk green and yellow lines in fig 3a and b the highest median θ values were found near the trunk 0 6 m and in the alley 3 8 m as shown in table 1 and fig 4a the concentration of intercepted rainfall by the canopy and its conversion to stemflow might be a possible explanation for the higher 75 quantile top of the box and extreme values near the trunk espejo pérez et al 2016 observed different results in the sandy soil of a field in sw spain where higher θ was found in the alleys than under the olive tree canopies nevertheless they found an opposite behavior in stony areas within the same field with higher θ under the canopies which agrees with our results in a field with relevant stony features median eca values steadily increased with distance from the trunk fig 4b revealing a less conductive medium in the vicinity of the trunk as compared to the alley this could be a consequence of the resistive nature of the structural tree roots near the trunk as shown by amato et al 2008 and rossi et al 2011 and the increasing soil bulk density with distance to the trunk fig s1 positive correlation between eca and soil bulk density has been previously reported e g johnson et al 2001 who refer in their study to a decrease in soil bulk density and eca because of plant root activity this hypothesis is also consistent with the rhoades et al 1989 three phase model for dry and intermediate states the involved assumption of homogeneity of the solid phase conductivity is more realistic in the alleys where presumably fewer roots are found basically the soil profile s solid phase is mostly composed of sand silt and clay than under the canopy where the soil profile s solid phase is a heterogeneous mixture of roots and soil components ain lhout et al 2016 measured detailed electrical resistivity profiles in the surroundings of argan trees which resemble olive trees in terms of root architecture and used these to monitor θ in the root zone they observed strong similarities in θ on both sides of symmetric trees and slight differences in θ for asymmetric trees the asymmetric shape of our tree might be an additional source of variability that should be considered when relating θ and eca patterns measured at opposite sides of the tree trunk also the large and increasing variability of eca with distance to the trunk is noteworthy fig 4b and represents the wide range of governing soil hydrological conditions on the different surveys dates particularly farthest away from the tree trunk spatial means of eca and θ were linearly related showing the strong relation between the spatially averaged values of both variables at opposite sides of the tree trunk fig 5a also the spatial standard deviation and mean of eca showed a linear tendency fig 5c which corresponds roughly with the drying branch of the commonly known convex shape that this relationship exhibits for soil moisture and which is generally observed at larger scales famiglietti et al 2008 martínez et al 2014 teuling et al 2006 this response was less evident for θ although for θ 0 16 m3 m 3 a relatively linear tendency could be observed fig 5b the lack of correspondence observed in fig 5b for dry soil conditions θ 0 16 m3 m 3 in this study has also been reported in other studies and was mostly found for subsoil measurements rosenbaum et al 2012 in our study most of these data points correspond with transient conditions such as after rainfall events occurring during dry periods e g days 42 and 48 in may 2014 71 and 78 in june 2014 141 and 148 in late august beginning of september under such circumstances there is larger soil moisture variability due to heterogeneous moistening of the soil profile with a relatively wetter and dryer topsoil after the rainfall and after long dry periods respectively as compared to the subsoil also differences in the received amount of rainfall between the canopy projection area the canopy dripping zone and the alleys can be associated with larger spatial variability the absence of the wet branch of the commonly convex shape found between these two variables in large scale studies e g famiglietti et al 2008 in fig 5b and c reflects unsaturated profile conditions during the study period and might be a result of the coarse soil texture and the deep soil profile at the experimental site the linear relationship between the spatial mean and the standard deviation of eca and θ has also been observed for θ during the extended monitoring period 2013 2019 data not shown and can be useful for up and downscaling applications 3 3 θ and eca temporal stability analysis means and standard deviations of relative differences were generally smaller for eca than for θ fig 6a and b reflecting more temporally stable and less spatially variable patterns for eca than for θ at the spatial scale of this study and considering the flat topography of the plot temporal stability and spatial variability patterns of eca and θ depend mostly on local controls such as soil properties and vegetation vereecken et al 2014 instead of non local controls such as rainfall variability and the specific topographic futures of the site compared to the surroundings runoff and subsurface flow contributing area the ranked mrd eca showed a clear increasing pattern with the distance to the trunk which can be related with the tendency of increasing soil bulk density and decreasing importance of the root system and canopy coverage with distance to the trunk ranked mrd θ showed a less continuous pattern without any apparent dependence on soil bulk density root system or canopy coverage martinez et al 2013 observed similar discontinuous ranked mrd θ in a simulation experiment when soils with a strong spatial variability in their hydraulic properties were studied such fine scale variability could be observed during the installation of sensors as can be seen in fig s2 big boulders and gravel layers are mixed across the soil profile the picture taken after a rainy period shows darker moistened soil next to the tree trunk about 0 6 m away from the tree trunk and a bright colored area dry in the central part of the trench about 1 5 m away from the trunk below the wet surface this may explain at least partially the observed mrd θ pattern θ at 0 6 m from the trunk is on average wetter than at 1 4 m while such small scale variability may occur on both sides of the tree the larger spatial support of the eca measurements as compared to the θ measurements makes the former less sensitive to fine scale variability 3 4 spatial dependence of the relation θ eca a significant correlation 0 76 p 0 001 was obtained between θ and eca when pooling together all the data measured during the entire monitoring period and at the five distances from the trunk also spatial standard deviations of θ and eca correlated significantly fig s3 taking θ eca data pairs obtained at the same distance along the entire monitoring period we could find a significant linear relation for all the distances under consideration table 2 the slope of those linear models between θ and eca presented a power law decay pattern dependent on the distance to the trunk near the tree trunk the slope was steeper than further away from the trunk this feature may be reflecting the differential abundance of roots around a tree and the observed pattern of soil bulk density this behavior with respect to proximity to the tree should be considered when characterizing soil moisture dynamics from eca data at the plot to farm scales 4 conclusions this work compares spatial and temporal patterns of θ and eca in the area of influence of an individual olive tree the patterns showed remarkable similarities especially with respect to the temporal evolution and the average spatial response of both variables in time yet both variables showed a contrasting behavior with respect to proximity of the tree trunk which is attributable to fine scale soil variability root system distribution and soil bulk density differences such small scale variability is especially relevant when soil moisture monitoring is conducted using sensors with small support volumes in this kind of situations sensors with larger support volumes such as emi sensors can provide more accurate information of the soil s moisture state in terms of spatial temporal patterns both variables presented the same feature of increasing variability with increasing spatial mean typical of dry states observed in medium to large scale soil moisture variability studies the observed linear relationship between the spatial means of both variables is relevant for up and downscaling applications of soil moisture at the plot to field scales 101 105 m2 direct comparison between θ and eca at specific survey dates yielded variable results with correlations in the range 0 65 0 58 surveys conducted under similar profile 0 0 9 m depth soil moisture conditions showed different correlations which are explained by different transient moisture distributions across the soil profile pooling together time lapse data and treating separately observations taken at different distances from the tree trunk not only improved correlations between θ and eca but also revealed the clear pattern of decreasing proportionality between both variables as a function of distance to the trunk although this work has a local scope in terms of the extent of the field site and replication of the experimental approach the same behavior was found in a nearby tree also agreement is found with the gradually varying environmental conditions that can be expected in the vicinity of olive trees due to the decreasing abundance of roots and increasing soil bulk density at increasing distances to the trunk this study opens a venue for the implementation of monitoring systems for the accurate evaluation of soil moisture in the contrasting environment below and between olive trees combining both technologies that take into account local and significant heterogeneity imposed by tree roots canopy features and soil compaction by machinery such information is a required step to provide more accurate maps at a range of scales from plot to

10311,uneven seasonal rainfall results in insufficient water supply and low yelds of camellia oleifera growing in mountainous and hilly areas without irrigation conditions to assess the effectiveness of mulching on the yield and quality of three cultivars of c oleifera hengdongdatao huashuo and xianglin 210 and its influence of preserving soil moisture a field experiment was conducted in 2016 in changning hunan mulching materials of ecological pad t1 straw t2 straw and ecological pad t3 gravel t4 sawdust t5 and camellia shell t6 were tested and compared with un mulched ck the mulch material with the strongest cooling effect in high temperature weather was t2 the possible reason is that the surface roughness of the mulching material is good for reflecting light t3 was the most effective at maintaining soil moisture the reason is that straw and ecological pad increased the thickness of the cover layer and their small pore size thus the evaporation rate decreased it can appropriately stable the temperature in high temperature weather and can better maintain the soil moisture to provide adequate water for growth t1showed soil moisture by 14 93 14 98 14 89 for three cultivars respectively all treatments increased yield compared to ck t1 showed the highest yield and was higher than ck by 58 61 and 124 for hengdongdatao huashuo and xianglin 210 respectively mulching with t1 40 23 and 39 63 resulted in the highest oil content ratio in hengdongdatao and huashuo and mulching with t4 36 93 resulted in highest oil content ratio in xianglin 210 treatment of the xianglin 210 cultivar with t1 was re tested in 2017 in all months analyzed related indicators measured were significantly different compared with ck this research suggests that mulching organic material to c oleifera hilly area is an effective measure to solve seasonal drought and increase yield when there are no irrigation conditions present keywords fatty acid oil content seed yield seasonal drought mulching material 1 introduction edible oil is a crucial product for everyone all around the world as people pay more attention to nutrition they are willing to choose healthier options for consumption therefore woody oil plants olive oil tea oil camellia oil etc containing high levels of unsaturated fatty acids that are beneficial to the human body are gaining popularity zhu et al 2019 camellia oleifera abel fig 1 is one of four mainly woody oil plants in the world zhang et al 2007 it is widely grown in hunan jiangxi and guangxi in southern china the oil extracted from seeds of c oleifera is a natural and valuable edible oil unique to china it has the function of protecting the liver from ccl4 antioxidant damage lee et al 2007 the planting area is about 433 ha and produces more than 2 62 million tons of c oleifera oil national bureau of statistics 2019 by 2018 compared with olive oil c oleifera oil has higher oleic acid content sahari et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 however seasonal drought seriously threatens the yield and quality of c oleifera harvests previous studies indicated that fruit volume expands rapidly from july to august and it stops increasing after august although c oleifera is drought resistant it is susceptible to soil moisture during fruit growth and oil accumulation y j zhou et al 2013 supplying the same volume of water in different phenological stages will affect the fruit size the thickness of the peel and the accumulation of oil moriana et al 2003 d andria et al 2004 lavee et al 2007 the annual average rainfall in the yangtze river basin the main producing area of c oleifera is about 1400 mm although it has sufficient rainfall the rainfall is mostly concentrated during the rainy season march to june generally accounting for 60 70 of the annual precipitation there is little rainfall from july to october generally accounting for only about 20 of total annual rainfall therefore from july to october c oleifera is most prone to drought this time of the year r h wang et al 2014 b b wang et al 2014 c f zhou et al 2013 mulching measures are widely used in agricultural products such as wheat jun et al 2018 cotton dong et al 2009 corn sanders et al 2018 maize fan et al 2017 soybean kashif et al 2019 vegetables vázquez et al 2006 and yams olasantan 1999 mulching measures can efficiently regulate soil temperature by reducing

plastic mulching performed best in the north in maize producing regions and the huanghuaihai maize region of china it was not good for crop growth in south china when plastic mulching the bottom of the plant and due to film has a very high temperature thus straw mulching performed better in the southern hilly maize producing region of china gao et al 2019 organic mulch is an important agronomic measure which has proven effective for soil and water conservation worldwide li et al 2020 due to a large amount of agricultural crop waste generated after harvest farmers typically remove such waste through incineration this produces a large number of greenhouse gases which pollute the environment therefore modern researchers are committed to applying biodegradable mulches to the crop itself for example researches are investigating mulching the bottom of the plant with ordinary organic waste such as straw weeds and pine needles lópez urrea et al 2020 using pruning waste as an organic mulching on a drip irrigated vineyard evapotranspiration and indicate organic mulch reduced vineyard water use 37 less than plastic mulch organic mulch could mitigate water shortages in increasing aridity scenarios debashis et al 2010 research indicated substantial improvement in water and n use efficiency and crop growth in wheat under surface mulching and the organic mulches especially rice husk performed better than synthetic mulches straw can not only recycle crop waste but also adjust soil conditions improve crop yield and avoid environmental problems caused by incineration farzi and gholami 2018 kader et al 2019 reasonable and adequate water management is vital in maintaining yield and decreasing the input of water organic mulching at the bottom of a tree is a measure used to reduce water evaporation mulching has additional advantages as follows 1 can effectively reduce the number of weeds that compete with the crop 2 increase the types of soil microorganisms to a certain extent 3 adjust soil temperature and humidity mcmillen 2013 tu and toan 2017 about one third of the earth s soil is counted as dry land fao 1989 therefore mulching is irreplaceable to improve soil conditions of crops in areas with drought and irrigation issues c oleifera grows mainly in low mountainous and hilly areas without irrigation conditions although the rainfall is sufficient for c oleifera seasonally there is uneven rainfall which leads to soil drought and affects crop yield y j zhou et al 2013 hence this study aimed to investigate the effects of seven mulching treatments ecological pad chen et al 2013 straw ecological pad and straw gravel mulch sawdust camellia shell and control no mulch on soil temperature moisture fruit yield fruit quality seed composition and oil percentage in the three cultivars of c oleifera hengdongdatao huashuo and xianglin 210 we hope to find an effective solution to solve uneven seasonal rainfall leading to drought affecting the yield of c oleifera this study was conducted over two years in the first year 2016 the seven mulches were tested on three cultivars and in the second year 2017 the most promising mulch and cultivar was further investigated the research aims to answer whether different mulch materials affect yield and oil quality of three cultivars in c oleifera and if so how is it affected and in what ways at the same time this research provides a possible solution for uneven seasonal rainfall leading to drought affecting the yield of c oleifera 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental area the study was conducted on a

gravel at 1 5 kg per tree t4 6 mulching with sawdust at 0 8 kg per tree t5 7 mulching with camellia shell at 1 kg per tree t6 the six mulching materials sfig 2 were spread under the tree in a 1 m2 circle centered around the tree trunk thirty trees were mulched with each treatment and twelve trees were randomly selected for measurements from each treatment group in total 630 trees were treated and 252 trees were analyzed all trees were not subject to any tending management after being mulched until the fruit was harvested and the related experimental indexes were measured 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis starting on july 28 soil temperature dynamics were measured continuously were recorded every 15 min for 7 days at a depth of 5 cm below the surface using soil temperature and humidity system hobo node usa the longest root of c oleifera can reach 3 m however the 0 20 cm layer s soil moisture content has the largest fluctuation range in summer and autumn zuo et al 2018 and has a small fluctuation range in the 30 100 cm soil layer r h wang et al 2014 therefore moisture was measured every 5 days from july 27 to august 13 by taking a sample of about 20 g of soil from 0 to 25 cm below the surface vertical depths with the diagonal method soil was collected with a sampling ring and moisture was determined after cooling to room temperature weighing and drying over about 5

mulch on soil temperature continuous soil temperature measurements at a depth of 5 cm showed that the dynamic changes among the three cultivars had the same trend fig 3 night temperatures were similar in all treatments while the daytime temperature rose to a different extent dependent on treatment fig 3 the order of treatments for maximum daily temperature was ck t4 t5 t6 t1 t3 t2 table 2 the highest daily soil temperature was above 44 and recorded on july 30 2016 in ck treatment table 2 among all cultivars t2 resulted had the largest temperature decrease compared with ck the maximum daily soil temperature of all treatments except for t4 showed a significant decrease compared to ck there were no differences between sunny days and cloudy days different mulching materials had the same result compared with ck 3 2 response of different organic mulch on soil moisture soil moisture under the different mulching s was influenced strongly by the composition of the mulch material employed in trials fig 4 the lowest value was attained under t2 and the highest under t3 conditions in all cases the soil moisture measured in un mulched soil was always lower than that measured across all mulch materials and followed a similar pattern to them in comparison to ck the average soil moisture for one month during the growing season was increased by 11 0 2 0 18 0 5 0 8 0 and 6 0 for t1 t2 t3

the oil content ratio of seed kernel was significantly higher compared to ck in all treatments except t2 and t6 there were significant differences in oil content of t1 compared to t2 and t6 and t2 compared to t4 the highest oil content ratio was from t4 treatment and was 21 higher than ck 3 5 2 the response of the quality of selected cultivar of ecological pad mulched in 2017 follow up study the results of the study clearly show that the ecological pad cover can better retain moisture in soil compared to the control effectively reduce the maximum daily temperature and increase the yield per area and oil content table 6 the average water potential of soil with ecological pad coverage had 26 28 22 and 17 higher water potential than soil of ck during the four periods of oil synthesis of c oleifera respectively the oil ratio was higher in the fg group compared to ck for all months and at time of harvest and the oil ratio 50 57 was 17 higher than the ck group the yield per area of the crown was higher in the fg group compared to ck for all months and at time of harvest the fg group had a yield per crown area of 1 79 kg m2 which was 57 higher compared to ck soluble sugar starch and protein showed a trend of increasing from july to september and then decreasing from september to october in both treatment groups the only deviation on this trend was in august to september where the protein in ck increased and the content in fg decreased the fatty acid content of mulched and un mulched c oleifera is mainly oleic acid accounting for the largest proportion followed by palmitic acid linoleic acid stearic acid and a trace of linolenic acid and cis dodecenoic acid fig 5 erucic acid which is harmful to the human body was not detected in all samples the average relative mass fraction of oleic acid in the four periods for the fg group was 78 7 74 39 77 98 and 81 02 respectively and in the four periods for ck was 77 49 71 94 76 89 and 77 92 respectively with statistical significance in all periods linoleic acid content was significantly higher in the fg group compared to ck in august and lower than ck group in september and october linolenic acid content in fg group was significantly higher than ck in july and august and lower than ck in september and october the fg group had a significantly higher ratio of palmitic acid compared to the ck group in august through october palmitoleic stearic and cis 11 eicosenoate acid show fewer clear trends throughout the growth periods compared with the control group the change of fatty acid content was the most obvious in august under ecological pad mulching treatment august is the period of high speed transformation of oil synthesis the oil ratio in ck increased by 455 and in the mulched group increased by 617 more than ck by 162 from july to august 4 discussion it has been widely reported that soil temperature and humidity are affected after mulching different covering materials determine the specific performance of the temperature change yang et al 2006 in this study with the exception of t4 treatment all other mulching treatments have significantly different soil temperatures compared with ck fig 3 which is consistent with previous research conclusions cook et al 2006 yang et al 2006 mulch can increase or decrease the soil temperature depending on the type of material used because it changes the soil surface s radiation and energy balance mulch that reduces evaporation and covers the soil surface from solar radiation usually has a cooling effect on the soil ham et al 1993 organic mulch such as ecological pad and straw camellia shell and sawdust can effectively reduce soil temperature in high temperature weather the research has shown that heat conduction between mulch and the soil surface affect the moderate soil temperature capability of the mulch ham et al 1993 which may be one of the reasons why the organic mulch has a cooling effect fourie and freitag 2010 researchers concluded that the soil temperature was too high in hot weather after gravel mulching nachtergaele et al 1998 a possible reason was the covering effectively transmits short wave radiation while preventing long wave radiation from escaping ham et al 1993 this could explain the soil heating effect of the gravel in this research the outcomes demonstrated that the soil water potential was higher than ck after mulching fig 4 which is consistent with the conclusion of earlier research mundy and agnew 2002 yang et al 2006 the results showed that the soil moisture content was higher under various organic mulching treatments the mulch on the surface of the soil can effectively maintain soil moisture reduce evaporation and improve water use efficiency mohammad et al 2017 t1 and t3 had the highest soil moistures measured during this period and both t3 and t1 treatments included ecological pads straw mulch served as physical barriers to prevent rainwater from running off or evaporating thus increasing soil water infiltration and storage chen et al 2015 sawdust and camellia shell also significantly improved soil moisture consistent with an earlier german study huber et al 2003 previous research indicated that gravel mulch had been reported to increase evaporation from soil nachtergaele et al 1998 therefore it is consistent with this study s results that the gravel was at lower soil moisture simultaneously it has been shown that mulching treatment increases crop yields by affecting soil heat transfer and water flow liang et al 2017 mulch that blocked vertical evaporation causes increase soil moisture forcing the water under the mulch to move horizontally effectively reducing the evaporation of water chen et al 2015 wang et al 2013 saglam et al 2017 and soil water consumption by the roots kader et al 2017 this may be the reason for increased soil water under organic mulching treatments different mulches possibly result in differences in soil temperature moisture content and the quality and quality of light transmitted reflected or absorbed these differences in turn may have affected plant growth development fruit quality and carbohydrate metabolism in strawberry shiow et al 1998 different mulching materials have different degrees of evaporation of soil moisture porous materials slow down the transmission of vapor to the atmosphere such as camellia shell straw and straw and ecological pad but they do not completely prevent soil evaporation which is consistent with the previous research conclusion yuan et al 2009 tree water status mainly influenced fruit size fruit pigmentation and phenolic concentration in the oil benelli et al 2015 the improvement of other qualities is not very obvious which is basically consistent with the conclusion of this research after treatment measures of different mulches the yield per unit area of the three varieties only after ecological mat mulching is significant compared with ck organic mulch is decomposed by microorganisms to add nutrients to the soil and sequester carbon ghosh et al 2006 studies also show that mulches made of different organic materials can replace mechanical or chemical techniques to control weeds and create more favorable conditions for root development and plant growth camposeo and vivaldi 2011 other mulching materials may be due to the combined effects of different material characteristics on soil moisture and temperature fruit quality improvement is not significant market yield from woody oil trees are generally considered the most important trait for oil so total yield per area yield per canopy area kg m2 seed kernel oil content was selected as the target parameter to evaluate the tree productivity in response to mulch in the first portion of this study ecological pads t1 had the second highest soil moisture maintaining capacity of all treatments and resulted in the third lowest maximum daily temperature during late july of 2016 when assessing the total yield per area using different mulching techniques t1 had the highest yield per unit area in all cultivars table 4 one possible reason for this observation is that ecological pad s provided the most optimal soil moisture and temperature conditions for c oleifera chakraborty et al 2008 in 2017 soluble sugar and starch were measured monthly during the period of oil synthesis they showed a trend of increasing first july to september and then decreasing september to october table 6 which is in line with previous research results wang 2018 an explanation for this observation is that plants accumulate sugar during the early season when water is more abundant and growth conditions are favorable plants then have carbon stores to use during prolonged droughts that may occur later in the season the protein content showed a profile that depended on treatment with ecological pads in the control group protein content showed a tendency to increase first july to september and then decrease under water shortage september to october while under ecological pads the protein content increased from july to august and then decreased from august to october water deficit leads to an increase in protein content and a decrease in oil content ratio oil content and protein have a negative correlation this is consistent with previous research conclusions anna et al 2015 this reasoning is supported in this study by the trend in protein content and observed oil yield the content of the fatty acid components in the control group was significantly lower than that in the treatment group due to a lack of water oleic acid which is the main component of c oleifera oil was reduced by 15 in the control group compared to that of the ecological pad covered group previous studies have shown that drought within a reasonable range can increase oil content but extreme water shortages will decrease oil content ratio hamrouni et al 2001 the water potential of the ck treatment indicated that the soil was in a state of severe water shortage in this study therefore the total oil content ratio of ck was significantly lower than that of mulched treatments the total oil content ratio depends on the content of fatty acids such as oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid palmitic acid etc which affect the quality of oil gecgel et al 2007 carvalho et al 2006 sabzalian et al 2008 however the proportion of fatty acids such as oleic acid depends largely on the environmental conditions at the time of seed maturity for example samanci and özkaynak 2003 research on safflower shows that seasonal weather changes especially soil temperature and humidity affect oleic acid and linoleic acid ensiye and khorshid 2010 also shows that oleic acid and linoleic acid decreases due to a lack of water correspondingly the change in oleic acid and linoleic acid due to the absence of water is reliant on which phase of development the plant is in when the water stress happens ali et al 2009 fatty acid synthesis inducing signals might be destroyed due to sharp stress responses that impair cell metabolism for instance analysts detailed that other woody oil plants reduced total oil content due to a lack of water kar et al 2007 likewise there was a decrease in oil content in low erucic acid rapeseed because of the absence of water which might be caused by insufficient photosynthesis caused by lack of water and poor assimilation transferability zahedi et al 2009 future research will investigate factors such as soil organic matter and soil microbial activity which may influence the growth and metabolism of c oleifera under drought stress in addition the expression of genes affected by the environment and the effect of different water content on the physiological metabolism of c oleifera will also be considered 5 conclusions c oleifera is a moderately drought tolerant tree species but it needs sufficient water supply during fruit growth and oil conversion mulching soil underneath trees can reduce soil water evaporation reduce soil temperature and increase soil water content to promote the growth of c oleifera fruit our results suggest ecological pad is a superior mulching material to improve soil temperature and moisture and maximize oil yield repeated measurements in the second year of this research found that ecological pad mulched and control group fruit showed significant differences in various indicators to give insight into the plant metabolism there are many other advantages of using ecological pads for example 1 to suppress weeds 2 they can be reused many times to reduce costs 3 and to more easily recover tree litter a new type of organic waste utilization method therefore low cost and saving of labor of the ecological pad made of organic materials such as palm fiber and other crop waste can be used to solve the problem of drought caused by uneven seasonal rainfall declaration of competing interest the

10311,uneven seasonal rainfall results in insufficient water supply and low yelds of camellia oleifera growing in mountainous and hilly areas without irrigation conditions to assess the effectiveness of mulching on the yield and quality of three cultivars of c oleifera hengdongdatao huashuo and xianglin 210 and its influence of preserving soil moisture a field experiment was conducted in 2016 in changning hunan mulching materials of ecological pad t1 straw t2 straw and ecological pad t3 gravel t4 sawdust t5 and camellia shell t6 were tested and compared with un mulched ck the mulch material with the strongest cooling effect in high temperature weather was t2 the possible reason is that the surface roughness of the mulching material is good for reflecting light t3 was the most effective at maintaining soil moisture the reason is that straw and ecological pad increased the thickness of the cover layer and their small pore size thus the evaporation rate decreased it can appropriately stable the temperature in high temperature weather and can better maintain the soil moisture to provide adequate water for growth t1showed soil moisture by 14 93 14 98 14 89 for three cultivars respectively all treatments increased yield compared to ck t1 showed the highest yield and was higher than ck by 58 61 and 124 for hengdongdatao huashuo and xianglin 210 respectively mulching with t1 40 23 and 39 63 resulted in the highest oil content ratio in hengdongdatao and huashuo and mulching with t4 36 93 resulted in highest oil content ratio in xianglin 210 treatment of the xianglin 210 cultivar with t1 was re tested in 2017 in all months analyzed related indicators measured were significantly different compared with ck this research suggests that mulching organic material to c oleifera hilly area is an effective measure to solve seasonal drought and increase yield when there are no irrigation conditions present keywords fatty acid oil content seed yield seasonal drought mulching material 1 introduction edible oil is a crucial product for everyone all around the world as people pay more attention to nutrition they are willing to choose healthier options for consumption therefore woody oil plants olive oil tea oil camellia oil etc containing high levels of unsaturated fatty acids that are beneficial to the human body are gaining popularity zhu et al 2019 camellia oleifera abel fig 1 is one of four mainly woody oil plants in the world zhang et al 2007 it is widely grown in hunan jiangxi and guangxi in southern china the oil extracted from seeds of c oleifera is a natural and valuable edible oil unique to china it has the function of protecting the liver from ccl4 antioxidant damage lee et al 2007 the planting area is about 433 ha and produces more than 2 62 million tons of c oleifera oil national bureau of statistics 2019 by 2018 compared with olive oil c oleifera oil has higher oleic acid content sahari et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 however seasonal drought seriously threatens the yield and quality of c oleifera harvests previous studies indicated that fruit volume expands rapidly from july to august and it stops increasing after august although c oleifera is drought resistant it is susceptible to soil moisture during fruit growth and oil accumulation y j zhou et al 2013 supplying the same volume of water in different phenological stages will affect the fruit size the thickness of the peel and the accumulation of oil moriana et al 2003 d andria et al 2004 lavee et al 2007 the annual average rainfall in the yangtze river basin the main producing area of c oleifera is about 1400 mm although it has sufficient rainfall the rainfall is mostly concentrated during the rainy season march to june generally accounting for 60 70 of the annual precipitation there is little rainfall from july to october generally accounting for only about 20 of total annual rainfall therefore from july to october c oleifera is most prone to drought this time of the year r h wang et al 2014 b b wang et al 2014 c f zhou et al 2013 mulching measures are widely used in agricultural products such as wheat jun et al 2018 cotton dong et al 2009 corn sanders et al 2018 maize fan et al 2017 soybean kashif et al 2019 vegetables vázquez et al 2006 and yams olasantan 1999 mulching measures can efficiently regulate soil temperature by reducing soil temperature in hot weather maintaining soil temperature during the cold season and improving the physical properties of the soil sharma et al 1990 fabrizzi et al 2005 mahajan et al 2007 hillel 1980 zhang et al 2009 bennett et al 1966 elmer 2000 salau et al 1992 olasantan 1999 in the past the main mulching materials used by researchers were plastic films stones and high fiber materials plastic mulching performed best in the north in maize producing regions and the huanghuaihai maize region of china it was not good for crop growth in south china when plastic mulching the bottom of the plant and due to film has a very high temperature thus straw mulching performed better in the southern hilly maize producing region of china gao et al 2019 organic mulch is an important agronomic measure which has proven effective for soil and water conservation worldwide li et al 2020 due to a large amount of agricultural crop waste generated after harvest farmers typically remove such waste through incineration this produces a large number of greenhouse gases which pollute the environment therefore modern researchers are committed to applying biodegradable mulches to the crop itself for example researches are investigating mulching the bottom of the plant with ordinary organic waste such as straw weeds and pine needles lópez urrea et al 2020 using pruning waste as an organic mulching on a drip irrigated vineyard evapotranspiration and indicate organic mulch reduced vineyard water use 37 less than plastic mulch organic mulch could mitigate water shortages in increasing aridity scenarios debashis et al 2010 research indicated substantial improvement in water and n use efficiency and crop growth in wheat under surface mulching and the organic mulches especially rice husk performed better than synthetic mulches straw can not only recycle crop waste but also adjust soil conditions improve crop yield and avoid environmental problems caused by incineration farzi and gholami 2018 kader et al 2019 reasonable and adequate water management is vital in maintaining yield and decreasing the input of water organic mulching at the bottom of a tree is a measure used to reduce water evaporation mulching has additional advantages as follows 1 can effectively reduce the number of weeds that compete with the crop 2 increase the types of soil microorganisms to a certain extent 3 adjust soil temperature and humidity mcmillen 2013 tu and toan 2017 about one third of the earth s soil is counted as dry land fao 1989 therefore mulching is irreplaceable to improve soil conditions of crops in areas with drought and irrigation issues c oleifera grows mainly in low mountainous and hilly areas without irrigation conditions although the rainfall is sufficient for c oleifera seasonally there is uneven rainfall which leads to soil drought and affects crop yield y j zhou et al 2013 hence this study aimed to investigate the effects of seven mulching treatments

gravel at 1 5 kg per tree t4 6 mulching with sawdust at 0 8 kg per tree t5 7 mulching with camellia shell at 1 kg per tree t6 the six mulching materials sfig 2 were spread under the tree in a 1 m2 circle centered around the tree trunk thirty trees were mulched with each treatment and twelve trees were randomly selected for measurements from each treatment group in total 630 trees were treated and 252 trees were analyzed all trees were not subject to any tending management after being mulched until the fruit was harvested and the related experimental indexes were measured 2 3 1 soil sampling and analysis starting on july 28 soil temperature dynamics were measured continuously were recorded every 15 min for 7 days at a depth of 5 cm below the surface using soil temperature and humidity system hobo node usa the longest root of c oleifera can reach 3 m however the 0 20 cm layer s soil moisture content has the largest fluctuation range in summer and autumn zuo et al 2018 and has a small fluctuation range in the 30 100 cm soil layer r h wang et al 2014 therefore moisture was measured every 5 days from july 27 to august 13 by taking a sample of about 20 g of soil from 0 to 25 cm below the surface vertical depths with the diagonal method soil was collected with a sampling ring and moisture was determined after cooling to room temperature weighing and drying over about 5

highest daily soil temperature was above 44 and recorded on july 30 2016 in ck treatment table 2 among all cultivars t2 resulted had the largest temperature decrease compared with ck the maximum daily soil temperature of all treatments except for t4 showed a significant decrease compared to ck there were no differences between sunny days and cloudy days different mulching materials had the same result compared with ck 3 2 response of different organic mulch on soil moisture soil moisture under the different mulching s was influenced strongly by the composition of the mulch material employed in trials fig 4 the lowest value was attained under t2 and the highest under t3 conditions in all cases the soil moisture measured in un mulched soil was always lower than that measured across all mulch materials and followed a similar pattern to them in comparison to ck the average soil moisture for one month during the growing season was increased by 11 0 2 0 18 0 5 0 8 0 and 6 0 for t1 t2 t3

were significantly different from t2 in hengdongdatao with t1 there was a significantly higher yield per unit area in all cultivars in huashuo t1 yield per unit area 1 11 kg m2 increased by 61 compared to ck 0 69 kg m2 in hengdongdatao yield per area of t1 0 68 kg m2 and t2 0 65 kg m2 was 58 and 51 higher than ck 0 43 kg m2 respectively in xianglin 210 t1 1 12 kg m2 t2 0 96 kg m2 t4 0 96 kg

the oil content ratio of seed kernel was significantly higher compared to ck in all treatments except t2 and t6 there were significant differences in oil content of t1 compared to t2 and t6 and t2 compared to t4 the highest oil content ratio was from t4 treatment and was 21 higher than ck 3 5 2 the response of the quality of selected cultivar of ecological pad mulched in 2017 follow up study the results of the study clearly show that the ecological pad cover can better retain moisture in soil compared to the control effectively reduce the maximum daily temperature and increase the yield per area and oil content table 6 the average water potential of soil with ecological pad coverage had 26 28 22 and 17 higher water potential than soil of ck during the four periods of oil synthesis of c oleifera respectively the oil ratio was higher in the fg group compared to ck for all months and at time of harvest and the oil ratio 50 57 was 17 higher than the ck group the yield per area of the crown was higher in the fg group compared to ck for all months and at time of harvest the fg group had a yield per crown area of 1 79 kg m2 which was 57 higher compared to ck soluble sugar starch and protein showed a trend of increasing from july to september and then decreasing from september to october in both treatment groups the only deviation on this trend was in august to september where the protein in ck increased and the content in fg decreased the fatty acid content of mulched and un mulched c oleifera is mainly oleic acid accounting for the largest proportion followed by palmitic acid linoleic acid stearic acid and a trace of linolenic acid and cis dodecenoic acid fig 5 erucic acid which is harmful to the human body was not detected in all samples the average relative mass fraction of oleic acid in the four periods for the fg group was 78 7 74 39 77 98 and 81 02 respectively and in the four periods for ck was 77 49 71 94 76 89 and 77 92 respectively with statistical significance in all periods linoleic acid content was significantly higher in the fg group compared to ck in august and lower than ck group in september and october linolenic acid content in fg group was significantly higher than ck in july and august and lower than ck in september and october the fg group had a significantly higher ratio of palmitic acid compared to the ck group in august through october palmitoleic stearic and cis 11 eicosenoate acid show fewer clear trends throughout the growth periods compared with the control group the change of fatty acid content was the most obvious in august under ecological pad mulching treatment august is the period of high speed transformation of oil synthesis the oil ratio in ck increased by 455 and in the mulched group increased by 617 more than ck by 162 from july to august 4 discussion it has been widely reported that soil temperature and humidity are affected after mulching different covering materials determine the specific performance of the temperature change yang et al 2006 in this study with the exception of t4 treatment all other mulching treatments have significantly different soil temperatures compared with ck fig 3 which is consistent with previous research conclusions cook et al 2006 yang et al 2006 mulch can increase or decrease the soil temperature depending on the type of material used because it changes the soil surface s radiation and energy balance mulch that reduces evaporation and covers the soil surface from solar radiation usually has a cooling effect on the soil ham et al 1993 organic mulch such as ecological pad and straw camellia shell and sawdust can effectively reduce soil temperature in high temperature weather the research has shown that heat conduction between mulch and the soil surface affect the moderate soil temperature capability of the mulch ham et al 1993 which may be one of the reasons why the organic mulch has a cooling effect fourie and freitag 2010 researchers concluded that the soil temperature was too high in hot weather after gravel mulching nachtergaele et al 1998 a possible reason was the covering effectively transmits short wave radiation while preventing long wave radiation from escaping ham et al 1993 this could explain the soil heating effect of the gravel in this research the outcomes demonstrated that the soil water potential was higher than ck after mulching fig 4 which is consistent with the conclusion of earlier research mundy and agnew 2002 yang et al 2006 the results showed that the soil moisture content was higher under various organic mulching treatments the mulch on the surface of the soil can effectively maintain soil moisture reduce evaporation and improve water use efficiency mohammad et al 2017 t1 and t3 had the highest soil moistures measured during this period and both t3 and t1 treatments included ecological pads straw mulch served as physical barriers to prevent rainwater from running off or evaporating thus increasing soil water infiltration and storage chen et al 2015 sawdust and camellia shell also significantly improved soil moisture consistent with an earlier german study huber et al 2003 previous research indicated that gravel mulch had been reported to increase evaporation from soil nachtergaele et al 1998 therefore it is consistent with this study s results that the gravel was at lower soil moisture simultaneously it has been shown that mulching treatment increases crop yields by affecting soil heat transfer and water flow liang et al 2017 mulch that blocked vertical evaporation causes increase soil moisture forcing the water under the mulch to move horizontally effectively reducing the evaporation of water chen et al 2015 wang et al 2013 saglam et al 2017 and soil water consumption by the roots kader et al 2017 this may be the reason for increased soil water under organic mulching treatments different mulches possibly result in differences in soil temperature moisture content and the quality and quality of light transmitted reflected or absorbed these differences in turn may have affected plant growth development fruit quality and carbohydrate metabolism in strawberry shiow et al 1998 different mulching materials have different degrees of evaporation of soil moisture porous materials slow down the transmission of vapor to the atmosphere such as camellia shell straw and straw and ecological pad but they do not completely prevent soil evaporation which is consistent with the previous research conclusion yuan et al 2009 tree water status mainly influenced fruit size fruit pigmentation and phenolic concentration in the oil benelli et al 2015 the improvement of other qualities is not very obvious which is basically consistent with the conclusion of this research after treatment measures of different mulches the yield per unit area of the three varieties only after ecological mat mulching is significant compared with ck organic mulch is decomposed by microorganisms to add nutrients to the soil and sequester carbon ghosh et al 2006 studies also show that mulches made of different organic materials can replace mechanical or chemical techniques to control weeds and create more favorable conditions for root development and plant growth camposeo and vivaldi 2011 other mulching materials may be due to the combined effects of different material characteristics on soil moisture and temperature fruit quality improvement is not significant market yield from woody oil trees are generally considered the most important trait for oil so total yield per area yield per canopy area kg m2 seed kernel oil content was selected as the target parameter to evaluate the tree productivity in response to mulch in the first portion of this study ecological pads t1 had the second highest soil moisture maintaining capacity of all treatments and resulted in the third lowest maximum daily temperature during late july of 2016 when assessing the total yield per area using different mulching techniques t1 had the highest yield per unit area in all cultivars table 4 one possible reason for this observation is that ecological pad s provided the most optimal soil moisture and temperature conditions for c oleifera chakraborty et al 2008 in 2017 soluble sugar and starch were measured monthly during the period of oil synthesis they showed a trend of increasing first july to september and then decreasing september to october table 6 which is in line with previous research results wang 2018 an explanation for this observation is that plants accumulate sugar during the early season when water is more abundant and growth conditions are favorable plants then have carbon stores to use during prolonged droughts that may occur later in the season the protein content showed a profile that depended on treatment with ecological pads in the control group protein content showed a tendency to increase first july to september and then decrease under water shortage september to october while under ecological pads the protein content increased from july to august and then decreased from august to october water deficit leads to an increase in protein content and a decrease in oil content ratio oil content and protein have a negative correlation this is consistent with previous research conclusions anna et al 2015 this reasoning is supported in this study by the trend in protein content and observed oil yield the content of the fatty acid components in the control group was significantly lower than that in the treatment group due to a lack of water oleic acid which is the main component of c oleifera oil was reduced by 15 in the control group compared to that of the ecological pad covered group previous studies have shown that drought within a reasonable range can increase oil content but extreme water shortages will decrease oil content ratio hamrouni et al 2001 the water potential of the ck treatment indicated that the soil was in a state of severe water shortage in this study therefore the total oil content ratio of ck was significantly lower than that of mulched treatments the total oil content ratio depends on the content of fatty acids such as oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid palmitic acid etc which affect the quality of oil gecgel et al 2007 carvalho et al 2006 sabzalian et al 2008 however the proportion of fatty acids such as oleic acid depends largely on the environmental conditions at the time of seed maturity for example samanci and özkaynak 2003 research on safflower shows that seasonal weather changes especially soil temperature and humidity affect oleic acid and linoleic acid ensiye and khorshid 2010 also shows that oleic acid and linoleic acid decreases due to a lack of water correspondingly the change in oleic acid and linoleic acid due to the absence of water is reliant on which phase of development the plant is in when the water stress happens ali et al 2009 fatty acid synthesis inducing signals might be destroyed due to sharp stress responses that impair cell metabolism for instance analysts detailed that other woody oil plants reduced total oil content due to a lack of water kar et al 2007 likewise there was a decrease in oil content in low erucic acid rapeseed because of the absence of water which might be caused by insufficient photosynthesis caused by lack of water and poor assimilation transferability zahedi et al 2009 future research will investigate factors such as soil organic matter and soil microbial activity which may influence the growth and metabolism of c oleifera under drought stress in addition the expression of genes affected by the environment and the effect of different water content on the physiological metabolism of c oleifera will also be considered 5 conclusions c oleifera is a moderately drought tolerant tree species but it needs sufficient water supply during fruit growth and oil conversion mulching soil underneath trees can reduce soil water evaporation reduce soil temperature and increase soil water content to promote the growth of c oleifera fruit our results suggest ecological pad is a superior mulching material to improve soil temperature and moisture and maximize oil yield repeated measurements in the second year of this research found that ecological pad mulched and control group fruit showed significant differences in various indicators to give insight into the plant metabolism there are many other advantages of using ecological pads for example 1 to suppress weeds 2 they can be reused many times to reduce costs 3 and to more easily recover tree litter a new type of organic waste utilization method therefore low cost and saving of labor of the ecological pad made of organic materials such as palm fiber and other crop waste can be used to solve the problem of drought caused by uneven seasonal rainfall declaration of competing interest the

10312,an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming approach chenglong zhang ping guo zailin huo center for agricultural water research in china college of water resources

china agricultural university tsinghuadong street no 17 beijing 100083 china center for agricultura l water research in china college of water resources and civil engineering china agricultural university beijing 100083 china corresponding author handling editor dr z xiying an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming indfccp approach is formulated to effectively allocate irrigation water among competing water users the indfccp approach is formulated by combining inexact quadratic programming iqp and double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp within a general optimization framework this approach has the following features 1 it s able to handle interval and fuzzy uncertainties and nonlinearity existing in the objective functions 2 it s capable of addressing these fuzzy constraints and fuzzy variables where different confidence levels and satisfaction degree levels should be satisfied 3 each fuzzy chance constraint can be further analyzed with the maximum and minimum reliability scenarios which makes it possible to reflect variations of system conditions 4 interval quadratic crop water production functions iqcwpfs are employed in place of deterministic ones to quantitatively describe the mathematical relationships between crop yields and actual crop evapotranspiration or irrigation water applied then to demonstrate its applicability and feasibility the indfccp approach is applied in the yingke irrigation district yid northwest china for allocating irrigation water to three crops in three subareas under uncertainty finally more flexible decision solutions regarding optimal irrigation water allocation have been generated and analyzed under different predetermined confidence levels showing several advantages of the indfccp approach with respect to the deterministic one under the same confidence level system benefits under the minimum reliability scenario e g 499 6 909 7 106 yuan α 0 5 are higher than that under the maximum reliability scenario e g 498 7 908 9 106 yuan α 0 5 from above outcomes the indfccp approach provides more appropriate results and reliable scientific bases needed for better managing irrigation water in irrigated agricultural areas keywords decision making irrigation water allocation double sided fuzziness inexact quadratic programming optimization 1 introduction agricultural sector in china plays a decisive role in safeguarding national security and supporting sustainable development of socio economy wang et al 2019 irrigation is an effective compensation measure for mitigating water shortages and guaranteeing crop growth under arid and semiarid environments as a result agricultural development highly relies on irrigation activities elliott et al 2014 despite the shortage of water resources in the arid oasis agricultural region of northwest china flooding irrigation is commonly applied as the main irrigation pattern due to lower cost which usually exceeds the actual crop water demands resulting in over irrigation and low water use efficiency under these circumstances it is desirable that scientific strategies of irrigation water management for optimally allocate irrigation water should be made to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and reduce water resources waste and finally boost sustainable agricultural development moreover in terms of irrigation water resources planning and management problems uncertain factors may be ubiquitous rather than exceptional in agricultural system i e e water use volume crop parameters and decision making preferences of managers zarghami and hajykazemian 2013 liu et al 2014 pingale et al 2014 cai et al 2016 fu et al 2018 li et al 2019 therefore it s meaningful and practical to study on optimization model of irrigation water management in an uncertain environment due to limited water and water scarcity in arid areas the available water cannot sufficiently meet the water demands for the total irrigated area the principle of determining irrigation water amount should not be the maximum crop yields based on the crop water production functions cwpfs but lie in achieving the maximum agricultural returns resulting from the overall irrigated area tong and guo 2013 cwpfs as its name suggests are quantitative mathematical equations that empirically estimates crop yields at different crop growth stages much research on cwpfs including linear and nonlinear forms between obtained crop yield and the total amount of irrigation water have been undertaken stewart et al 1977 zhang and oweis 1999 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 geerts and raes 2009 wichelns 2014 the nonlinear cwpfs with logistic shape are generally acceptable than linear ones when applying more irrigation water than required geerts and raes 2009 in practice lower operating and management level and non water efficient irrigation pattern make excessive water be used in localized areas causing over irrigation and reduction of crop yield in addition due to the error of observation and calculation for field experimental data the fitted deterministic cwpfs may have limitations to fully reflect actual conditions li et al 2016 therefore interval based cwpfs are introduced and employed as the basic optimization framework thereby resulting in a nonlinear objective function in optimization model for irrigation water management for example tong and guo 2013 initially estimated interval quadratic cwpfs and developed an inexact quadratic programming for optimal crop water allocation however it can only deal with interval uncertainty characterized as extreme conditions with upper and lower limits moreover it doesn t tackle the violation of system constraints huang et al 1993 and it is difficult for manager to make effective decision when the range of interval is relatively large zhang and achari 2010 in contrast fuzzy numbers can gradually adjust the range of choice based on different levels of ambiguity according to the human induced judgements of decision makers in practice the water use volume cannot be accurately determined in the case of water resources management problems which may be vaguely expressed as fuzzy linguistic terms like approximately 200 106 m3 or 220 106 m3 clearly fuzzy mathematical programming fmp method is capable of addressing such a fuzzy problem by defuzzification into its crisp deterministic one among these fmp methods fuzzy chance constrained programming namely fccp was developed to solve violation of constraints by incorporating predetermined confidence levels liu and iwamura 1998 based on the fccp fuzzy constraints can be presented as deterministic ones corresponding to different confidence levels and satisfaction degree levels of constraints rong and lahdelma 2008 in additional fccp has advantages in 1 allowing to involve fuzzy variables into an optimization model where possibilistic distributions are easily defined than probabilistic distributions 2 generating a series of stable solutions at several confidence levels and the related allowable violation risk levels while the constraints are not required to be totally satisfied and 3 having a lower computational requirement and a higher computational efficiency therefore fccp methods have been widely employed in many real world case studies rong and lahdelma 2008 cao et al 2009 xu et al 2010 zhou 2015 chen et al 2017 cai et al 2018 however the above mentioned fccp method can merely address fuzzy uncertainty existing in the right hand side of constraints liu and iwamura 1998 generally both right hand and left hand sides of constraints are likely related to fuzzy uncertainties e g variables and parameters a double sided fccp method can be employed to improve upon applicability of the conventional fccp the basic concept of dfccp method is to generate results of satisfying constraints at different confidence levels for example xu and qin 2010 proposed an inexact double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming model for agricultural effluent control liu et al 2016 developed a fuzzy fractional chance constrained programming model for air quality management under uncertainty cheng et al 2017 proposed an interval double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming model for water resources management moreover previous studies integrating double sided fccp method into optimization model of irrigation water allocation have been undertaken for instance zhang et al 2018 zhang and guo 2018 developed fuzzy linear fractional programming and interval fuzzy chance constrained programming with double sided fuzziness for optimal allocation of irrigation water respectively nevertheless the above two studies focused on the linear shape cwpfs which cannot reflect nonlinear relationships between crop yield and applied irrigation water or rainfall geerts and raes 2009 therefore in response to above concerns an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming indfccp approach is formulated for optimal allocation of irrigation water resources it incorporates double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming method and inexact quadratic programming within an optimization framework formulating an enhanced optimization model of irrigation water allocation uncertainties of intervals and double sided fuzziness in the model and nonlinearity in the objective function can be handled simultaneously then a case study on irrigation water resources allocation in the yingke irrigation district yid in the heihe river basin northwest china will be provided for demonstrating its applicability interval quadratic cwpfs are estimated by interval regression analysis method using field experimental data which can overcome the limitation of linear ones two reliability scenarios including the maximum reliability scenario and minimum reliability scenario are derived from the dfccp method a range of optimal solutions under several confidence levels are generated through solving the indfccp approach which is useful for supporting irrigation water management these results are expected to give insight into interactions among objective function values confidence levels and their arisen constraints violation risks 2 methodology this section entails four subsections on the formulation of the methodology 1 interval quadratic cwpfs 2 double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming and 3 interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming approach 4 solving process 2 1 interval quadratic cwpfs interval quadratic cwpfs in the whole growth period are estimated using interval regression analysis method tanaka and lee 1998 for different study crops i e y a e t 2 b e t c where y is crop yield data and e t is actual et a b and c are empirical coefficients the plus sign denotes the upper bound of interval parameters and minus sign is the lower bounds of interval values on one hand compared with linear cwpfs the quadratic ones with a logistic shape enable to express an additional effect on the crop yield when crops are over irrigated by much more irrigation water or rainfall on the other hand such interval form cwpfs are capable of better reflecting more uncertain information in the practical situations which are superior to deterministic cwpfs tong and guo 2013 therefore by collecting actual evapotranspiration data and associated yield data obtained from field experiment interval quadratic cwpfs can be estimated based on interval regression analysis method see appendix a 2 2 inexact quadratic programming inexact quadratic programming iqp method is introduced to address the interval uncertainty and nonlinearity due to the interval quadratic cwpfs obtained from section 2 1 the following is a general iqp framework 1a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 1b j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 j 1 2 n where a i j b i c j d j and x j are interval parameters or variables however such an iqp framework is incapable of tackling fuzzy possibilistic information and accompanying problems of fuzzy decision making 2 3 double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming similar to stochastic chance constrained programming liu and iwamura 1998 developed fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp method thereby extending ccp method to fuzzy environment several confidence levels representing satisfaction degree that the constraints should be satisfied are predefined because this fccp method can only handle single sided fuzziness existing in the right hand side of constraints which is thus named as single sided fuzzy constrained programming ssfccp xu et al 2010 in fact fuzzy uncertainty may exist in both left hand and right hand sides of the constraints which makes it desirable to improve upon the compatibility of ssfccp method therefore in this section a double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp method can be written 2a max f a x subject to 2b p o s b c b x c α 2c d x e 2d x 0 where x is a real number decision variable a d e are real number input parameters b and c are fuzzy sets and eq 2b is fuzzy chance constraints according to fiedler et al 2006 eq 2b can be hold by separating it into the minimum reliability scenario and the maximum reliability scenario corresponding to each given confidence level α mathematically these confidence levels represent a subset of elements pertaining to a fuzzy set at their corresponding membership degree of α showing that it can specifically quantify satisfaction degree of fuzzy chance constraints and corresponding risk levels liu et al 2014 for the minimum reliability scenario eq 2b is hold if and only if 2e b l α x c r α for the maximum reliability scenario eq 2b is hold if and only if 2f b r 1 α x c l 1 α where b l α is the minimum value among the potential values at confidence level α i e b l α inf b b μ 1 α c r α is the maximum value among the potential values at α cut level i e c r α sup c c μ 1 α b r 1 α and c l 1 α can be similarly interpreted μ 1 is the inverse function of μ consequently eq 2b can be readily transformed into eqs 2e and 2f double sided fuzzy chance constraints can thus be solved including two crisp equivalents however this dfccp method can hardly tackle nonlinear objective function 2 4 interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming finally an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming indfccp approach is formulated by integrating interval quadratic cwpfs and iqp into dfccp modeling framework for supporting irrigation water resources allocation and management under uncertainty the indfccp can be formulated 3a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 3b p o s a i j b i j 1 n a i j x j b α i 1 2 m 3c x j 0 j 1 2 n fig 1 graphically shows the framework of the indfccp approach therefore two scenarios of objective function values and decision variables will be obtained implying that the obtained decision making alternatives are very likely to be affected by these uncertain modeling inputs dai and li 2013 below is the solving process step 1 identify system uncertain factors and collect their interval boundaries and fuzzy distributions information step 2 build the indfccp framework step 3 convert fuzzy chance constraints into two deterministic crisp equivalents ones under different confidence levels and decompose two scenarios with interval forms step 4 for each interval model whether cost coefficients c j and d j have the same or different sign should be firstly clear choose the corresponding method based on interactive and derivative algorithms method chen and huang 2001 step 5 rewrite the interval based model as the upper f and the lower f submodels as the objective function is to maximize agricultural returns the upper bound submodel is solved based on algorithms of inexact quadratic programming seen in zhang et al 2018b thus optimal solutions can be generated f o p t x j o p t step 6 introduce these solutions obtained from step 6 into the lower bound submodel and thus optimal results are generated f o p t x j o p t step 7 integrate results based on the above steps and thus determine their interval solutions f o p t f o p t f o p t and x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t step 8 give different confidence levels and repeat above solving steps and finally generate all the interval solutions under the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios 3 study system 3 1 problem statement the study area yingke irrigation district yid is the third largest agricultural irrigation area in the heihe river basin 100 17 100 34 e 38 50 38 58 n see fig 2 the east west span of the yid is 17 4 km the north south distance is 14 2 km covering a total area of 192 2 km2 the study area is relatively flat and its altitude ranges from 1456 m to 1600 m the topographic trend is that the altitude gradually decreases from southwest to northeast moreover the study area has a typical continental temperate arid and semi arid climate annual average precipitation is 125 mm but annual evaporation from open water surface ranges approximately from 1400 mm to 2900 mm annual reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 1200 mm which is calculated based on fa0 56 recommended penman monteith formula maize and spring wheat accounts for 83 of the total planting area which are mainly planted crops in the yid the main economic crops are vegetables and fruits accounting for about 15 of the total planting area selection of cabbage as economic crops because it has the highest percentage of vegetables in the study area depending on the actual situation the growth stage for spring wheat runs from 1 april to 20 july and for maize from 20 april to 22 september cabbage is planted twice during the crop season from 20 march to 20 june and from 30 may to 30 august jiang 2017 during crop growth periods crop water demands are large while the precipitation is relatively small which makes it highly desirable to irrigate them in these months to satisfy their crop water requirements agricultural irrigation activities rely mainly on surface water while they are supplemented by groundwater irrigation in some areas i e usually occurs in the downstream areas controlled by canal systems and the common irrigation pattern is flood irrigation the main and branch canals and nearly 70 of the ditches in the irrigation area have been lined and there is still water loss occur due to canal seepages moreover irrigation water in the yid accounts for 10 of the total agricultural water in the midstream of the heihe river basin in recent years to alleviate ecological environment of the lower reaches of the heihe river basin more surface water from mainstream of the heihe river are required to divert to the downstream as a result these scheduled irrigation areas in the midstream area are expected to reduce the total water consumption based on the planning report ofthe heihe river basin management consequently the water diversion for agricultural irrigation is reduced leading to water shortage problems furthermore the reduction of surface water diversion conversely forces the groundwater over exploitation and the groundwater level in the irrigation area generally declines slowly consequently optimally allocate irrigation water based on an optimization model is helpful to the improvement of irrigation management and decision making in the yid in practice uncertainties arising from agricultural systems may have a direct effect on the final irrigation scheme such as interval quadratic cwpfs variations of water demand and water use and human induced preferences in decision making therefore to develop an optimization model taking interval quadratic cwpfs as the basic optimization framework and considering uncertainties is a potential method for supporting irrigation water resources management 3 2 formulation of optimization model generally there are four difficulties that should be overcome in optimization irrigation water resources allocation for the yid 1 how to address interval and double sided fuzziness in the optimization model 2 how to solve nonlinearity in the objective function and nonlinear problems efficiently 3 how to manage irrigation water effectively to obtain the maximum agricultural returns and 4 how to generate optimal solutions at predefined confidence levels in response to above concerns an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming approach will be formulated for practical application the indfccp approach is formulated 3 2 1 objective function 4a max f j 1 4 a j n b j c p j a j s w j g w j p e d p 2 b j s w j g w j p e d p c j j 1 4 a j c a j c t j s w j η s g w j η g where f is objective function that represents agricultural returns that after the deduction of revenue of crop productions from the operating and fixed cost including irrigation water use 106 yuan a j is planting area for crop j ha n b j is crop price yuan kg c p j is agricultural production costs which is a summative term including operating cost fixed cost and labor cost such as seed fertilizer pesticides machinery harvesting marketing drying and unexpected costs yuan kg zhang et al 2018a in this case irrigation water cost is separated from c p j as allocated irrigation water is decision variable while other production costs are constants s w j and g w j denote allocated surface water and groundwater representing water supplied to the field and crops for irrigation m3 ha p e is effective precipitation m3 ha d p denotes deep percolation of the yid m3 ha in this part assumptions are presented that change of soil water content is zero in the whole crop growth season groundwater recharge i e capillary rise in the study area is a negligible amount and surface runoff is neglected thus e t j s w j g w j p e d p a j b j and c j denote values of the estimated interval quadratic cwpfs respectively c a j represents cost of irrigation water use yuan m3 and c t j is cost of water conveyance to field yuan m3 η s and η g are comprehensive coefficients representing surface water and groundwater water use efficiency η s 0 52 and η g 0 60 η g η s because groundwater is delivered from wells into fields via less canals than surface water leading to less water loss 3 2 2 constraints 1 the surface water uses constraints 4b p o s j 1 4 1 δ s a j s w j q s η s f β s α i i 2 the groundwater water uses constraints 4c p o s j 1 4 1 δ g a j g

chance constraints indicating that they are satisfied at given confidence level α i these predefined confidence levels can quantify satisfaction degree of fuzzy chance constraints and corresponding risk levels both δ s and q s are considered as fuzzy sets in double sided constraints where δ s is water loss ratio during surface water conveyance into field and q s is surface water use volume that represents the delivered water from the mainstream of the heihe river during crop growth season δ g can be similarly interpreted and q g is groundwater use volume that represents the amount water withdrawal from the pimping wells during crop growth period in this study both δ s and δ g are empirically estimated as follows δ s 0 20 0 25 0 30 δ g 0 10 0 15 0 20 η s f and η g f are surface water and groundwater application efficiency in the field η f s η f g 0 80 0 90 in fact agricultural irrigation accounts for a major portion of the total surface water and groundwater use volume than other purposes such as municipal and industrial water use the portion of both surface water β s f and groundwater β g f utilized for agricultural irrigation are β s β g 0 85 0 95 i r min j and i r max j are irrigation water requirements for crop j m3 ha 3 3 data collection and preparation table 1 shows the interval quadratic cwpfs and deterministic ones for each study crop for comparison based on section 2 1 and appendix a interval quadratic cwpfs for these four types of crops can be estimated using interval regression analysis method these data evapotranspiration and crop yield are obtained from field experiments in 2012 and 2013 jiang et al 2015 therefore weight coefficients k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 are chosen to determine the regression results including a b and c in this case interval quadratic cwpfs are estimated with more consideration of central tendency in the process of regression the surface water and groundwater use volume as the input parameters of optimization model are calculated by interval estimation based on the collected data from historical use for interval estimation the t distribution is employed to calculate interval values with unknown variance of sample moreover 90 confidence level was constructed for each interval parameter the upper and the lower limits in interval estimation the lower and upper limits of interval are considered as the minimum and maximum possible values of fuzzy numbers respectively while middle value of the fuzzy parameters is the same as mean value of the sample therefore based on the statistical data from 2002 to 2017 the surface water use volume is calculated q s 95 297 101 943 108 589 106 m3 and q g 37 388 43 020 48 653 106 m3 table 2 presents crop planting area crop prices and other data which are collected from the survey statistics see zhang et al 2018b all the related parameters are expressed as interval values from the collected data by means of interval estimation as the price of grains and vegetables fluctuate every day during crop growth seasons taking daily price as sample to calculate their upper and lower limits of interval agricultural production costs are determined based on the field research and verbal questioning of local farmers then it could roughly be converted to agricultural production costs per unit area or per unit of crop yield fao 56 penman monteith method is employed to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 then irrigation water requirements actual evapotranspiration is calculated for the determination of the limits of crop water requirements in the optimization model see eq 4d which are based on e t c k c e t o where et c is the actual evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient obtained from field experiments the meteorological data is collected from zhangye national meteorological station no 52562 located in ganzhou district during 1967 2015 based on these samples taking 90 confidence level as standard to estimate the upper limit and lower limit of irrigation water requirements thus this study adopts the lower limit to express the i r min j and the upper limit to represents the i r max j in arid area with low precipitation select the usda soil conservation method p e p t 125 0 2 p t 125 p t 250 mm p t is the total measured data during the growing season to calculate effective precipitation smith 1991 in terms of deep percolation it is not measured data but is presented as a ratio between deep percolation amount and total irrigation water supply i e sum of effective precipitation surface water and groundwater such a ratio i e 0 192 0 217 is obtained from the study of jiang 2017 4 results analysis and discussion because the indfccp approach is formulated by integrating techniques of iqp and dfccp method thus it has the advantages arising from the above two methods therefore it is particularly critical for managers to determine the confidence level eleven scenarios by confidence levels are considered in this study that is α 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 through solving the indfccp approach by transforming into the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios twenty two sets of feasible solutions can be generated and most of them are intervals therefore optimal solutions at each confidence level are analyzed and examined in the following details including optimal system benefits and optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation 4 1 optimal system benefits fig 3a b show that gradual changes of confidence levels will notably yield different objective function values under the maximum and minimum reliability scenarios clearly results present an approximately proportional decline trend as the increases of confidence levels this can be explained by the theoretical basis of indfccp method generally a higher confidence level represents a higher satisfaction degree of constraints which naturally lead to a smaller decision space e g less water use volume for solving model and thus result in a decreased system benefit moreover it is obvious that different optimal results may be yielded at the same confidence level namely under the minimum reliability scenario optimal system benefits of both the upper and lower bounds are higher than that under the maximum reliability scenario for instance optimal system benefits are 500 1 910 2 106 yuan α 0 499 6 909 7 106 yuan α 0 5 and 499 1 909 3 106 yuan α 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario meanwhile the results are 499 0 909 2 106 yuan α 0 498 7 908 9 106 yuan α 0 5 and 498 2 908 4 106 yuan α 1 0 under the maximum reliability scenario respectively by comparing the outcomes between the above two scenarios solutions seem likely to be conservative but reliable under the maximum reliability scenario the significance of the above results in the practical application is to reduce the amount of total irrigation water under the maximum reliability scenario which is conducive to maintain environmental and ecological quality this also implies that a lower system benefit occurs concurrently with a lower system failure risk level therefore the above results show tradeoffs among system benefits reliability of satisfaction degree of constraints and system failure risk levels in an interactive way 4 2 optimal solutions this study aims to generate and identify optimal solution of irrigation water e g allocated surface water and groundwater resources allocation to different crops i e multiple competing users in the study area to pursue the maximum agricultural returns thus optimal solutions of the decision variables under a variety of confidence levels can be generated taking confidence levels α 0 0 5 and 1 0 to examine the variations of allocated water figs 4a and b 5a and b 6a and b present optimal solutions at α 0 0 5 and 1 0 under both reliability scenarios respectively from fig 4a the allocated surface water for seed maize spring wheat and economic crops are deterministic values and other results are interval values from fig 4b the allocated surface water for spring wheat and economic crops are fixed values it can also be seen that field maize is mainly irrigated by surface water while other three crops are mainly irrigated by groundwater for example under the minimum reliability scenario optimal water allocation is 4409 2 4912 7 m3 ha 324 2 1015 2 m3 ha surface water groundwater for filed maize 2158 6 m3 ha 4093 1 4418 7 m3 ha for seed maize 688 7 m3 ha 1795 1 2387 8 m3 ha for spring wheat and 554 5 m3 ha 2969 0 m3 ha for economic crops moreover the allocated surface water for field maize is larger than that of the maximum reliability scenario compared with the minimum reliability scenario conversely the results of groundwater are contrary to that of surface water the solutions indicate that the allocated surface water are increased from α 0 to α 0 5 under these two reliability scenarios except seed maize however when α is raised from 0 5 to 1 0 the allocated surface water for seed maize is increased for example optimal solutions for seed maize at α 0 5 are 0 6187 3 6577 3 m3 ha under the minimum reliability scenario and 1261 2 1434 3 m3 ha 4990 6 5143 0 m3 ha under the maximum reliability scenario respectively this can be further explained by the planting area of seed maize namely although optimal irrigation water allocation does not change proportionately in the light of confidence level the total irrigation surface water and groundwater amount shows such an approximately proportional changing trend fig 7 shows the upper bound of total irrigation water amount from α 0 to α 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario obviously the amount of total surface water is increased but the amount of total groundwater is decreased indicating that the two water sources are relatively complemented compared with the results at α 0 the amount of total surface water upper bound increases by nearly 24 at α 1 0 conversely the amount of total groundwater upper bound decreases from 37 8 106 m3 to 32 0 106 m3 when α 0 1 0 understandably with the increase of confidence level manager and study systems will become more conservative in this case the groundwater use volume will be reduced and thus more surface water will be irrigated furthermore fig 8 illustrates the comparison of total surface water and groundwater between the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios similar to the results in fig 7 the amount of total surface water rises steadily while the amount of total groundwater experiences a steady decline with an increased confidence level under these two scenarios especially it is clear that the amount of total surface water under the minimum reliability scenario is lower than that under the maximum reliability scenario the average difference between these two scenarios are 5 58 106 m3 among all the confidence levels conversely the amount of total groundwater shows an opposite trend therefore planning under the minimum reliability scenario generally shows a positive attitude on water use volume but with a lower reliability level planning under the maximum reliability scenario has a closely link with a more dependable policy on water use volume thereby leading to higher reliability level and lower system failure risk level 4 3 discussion the indfccp approach is formulated by the combination of the iqp dfccp and interval quadratic cwpfs methods within a general irrigation water management modeling framework thus the results can readily reflect the characteristics of the above techniques firstly the cwpfs in the entire growth period have been extended from linear shape to interval quadratic ones there are many studies on irrigation water planning and management purposes based on cwpfs for example guo et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhang and guo 2017 proposed several inexact optimization models for irrigation water resources management based on linear expressions of cwpfs li et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 developed interval based inexact irrigation water allocation models arisen from interval linear cwpfs generally these studies have a specific assumption that the study area is a low yield area with insufficient irrigation water concurrently with hardly advanced management level li et al 2016 in fact due to lower management level and traditional flood irrigation method excessive irrigation water will be used and over irrigation even waterlogging problems will be produced in some areas which will have effects on crop yields however linear cwpfs is not realistic in the case of over irrigation to determine the optimal irrigation water applied e t j o p t corresponding the maximum possible yield for each crop becomes critical for irrigation water management and quadratic shape cwpfs are suitable for such conditions in this study the related optimal solutions indicate that total irrigation water applied to field maize and spring wheat i e s w j o p t g w j o p t p e d p are less than e t j o p t corresponding to their maximum yields optimal irrigation water allocation of the economic crops shows that it can closely realize the theoretical maximum possible yield s w j o p t g w j o p t p e d p e t j o p t therefore using interval quadratic cwpfs is superior to cwpfs with linear and interval linear shape furthermore the advantages of the interval quadratic cwpfs are highlighted by employing deterministic quadratic cwpfs to the same study for comparison the formulation of this model is realized by replacing these interval variables or parameters as deterministic ones which are derived from taking their mean values of the upper and lower bounds table 3 presents the solutions resulting from deterministic cwpfs at α 0 0 5 and 1 0 under the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios fig 9 reflects the system benefits resulting from the deterministic cwpfs it can be seen that the deterministic system benefits fall within the interval solutions from the indfccp approach implying that this is a special case from the deterministic cwpfs for example system benefits under the minimum reliability scenario are 696 2 106 yuan α 0 1 696 0 106 yuan α 0 3 695 8 106 yuan α 0 5 695 6 106 yuan α 0 7 695 4 106 yuan α 0 9 respectively in contrast interval quadratic cwpfs present more information linked with system uncertainties and complexities in the practical applications therefore solutions from the indfccp approach can provide more flexible choices within interval fluctuations and thus better support effective decision making plans additionally when confidence level is fixed at α 1 0 without considering fuzziness in the double sided constraints the indfccp approach can be rewritten as a general iqp model see fig 6a and b in this case optimal solutions will be restricted as a single interval solution when all the constraints are satisfied α 1 0 results can be bound by the strict conditions without any allowable constraint violation risk level this conservative decision making plan may lead to moderate economic benefits however the indfccp approach can handle double sided fuzziness and introduce the confidence levels to quantitatively express the manager s preferences on the tradeoffs among system benefits confidence levels and system failure risk degrees moreover double sided fuzzy chance constraints are divided into the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios which can generate more cost effective solutions than that of a general iqp modeling framework therefore the indfccp approach can thus facilitate to identify cost effective solutions of irrigation water allocation under complexity and uncertainty 5 conclusions an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming indfccp approach is formulated for supporting optimal irrigation water allocation under complexity and uncertainty in this study an extension regarding the form of cwpfs from linear interval linear to interval quadratic has been done to present more valuable information associated with system uncertainties and complexities in practical conditions it can deal with discrete intervals and fuzzy uncertainties allowable constraints violation risks levels are introduced using the concept of confidence levels where each confidence level includes the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios clearly it can be realized a higher system benefits at a lower confidence level under the minimum reliability scenario it is obvious that interval solutions can provide flexible decision space and alternatives within the lower and upper bounds based on managers preferences which implies that the decision making alternatives are likely to be affected by these uncertain modeling inputs system benefits under the minimum reliability scenario range from 499 1 909 3 106 yuan at α 1 0 to 500 1 910 2 106 yuan at α 0 similarly system benefits under the maximum reliability scenario range from 498 2 908 4 106 yuan at α 1 0 to 499 1 909 3 106 yuan at α 0 therefore optimal irrigation water resources management strategies are linked to confidence levels and reliability scenarios which is also related to constraints violations and system failure risk degrees this is an attempt to demonstrate the developed optimization model for effective irrigation water allocation by a case study of the yid in the heihe river basin northwest china in an arid area the formulation of the indfccp approach and its results make it highly possible be applicable to other similar management issues under uncertainty without loss of generality although this study shows several advantages in tackling irrigation water allocation there are still some limitations that require to be improved for example only some parameters are presented as fuzzy numbers full or more fuzzy parameters and their arithmetic operations should be considered to enhance existing fuzzy programming methods in addition because the irrigation district measures hundreds of km2 the spatial variability of those water balance components should be involved into distributed agro hydrological model using observation experiments at regional scale in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

within a general optimization framework this approach has the following features 1 it s able to handle interval and fuzzy uncertainties and nonlinearity existing in the objective functions 2 it s

managing irrigation water in irrigated agricultural areas keywords decision making irrigation water allocation double sided fuzziness inexact quadratic programming optimization 1 introduction agricultural sector in china plays a decisive role in safeguarding national security and supporting sustainable development of socio economy wang et al 2019 irrigation is an effective compensation measure for mitigating water shortages and guaranteeing crop growth under arid and semiarid environments as a result agricultural development highly relies on irrigation activities elliott et al 2014 despite the shortage of water resources in the arid oasis agricultural region of northwest china flooding irrigation is commonly applied as the main irrigation pattern due to lower cost which usually exceeds the actual crop water demands resulting in over irrigation and low water use efficiency under these circumstances it is desirable that scientific strategies of irrigation water management for optimally allocate irrigation water should be made to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and reduce water resources waste and finally boost sustainable agricultural development moreover in terms of irrigation water resources planning and management problems uncertain factors may be ubiquitous rather than exceptional in agricultural system i e e water use volume crop parameters and decision making preferences of managers zarghami and hajykazemian 2013 liu et al 2014 pingale et al 2014 cai et al 2016 fu et al 2018 li et al 2019 therefore it s meaningful and practical to study on optimization model of irrigation water management in an uncertain environment due to limited water and water scarcity in arid areas the available water cannot sufficiently meet the water demands for the total irrigated area the principle of determining irrigation water amount should not be the maximum crop yields based on the crop water production functions cwpfs but lie in achieving the maximum agricultural returns resulting from the overall irrigated area tong and guo 2013 cwpfs as its name suggests are quantitative mathematical equations that empirically estimates crop yields at different crop growth stages much research on cwpfs including linear and nonlinear forms between obtained crop yield and the total amount of irrigation water have been undertaken stewart et al 1977 zhang and oweis 1999 brumbelow and georgakakos 2007 geerts and raes 2009 wichelns 2014 the nonlinear cwpfs with logistic shape are generally acceptable than linear ones when applying more irrigation water than required geerts and raes 2009 in practice lower operating and management level and non water efficient irrigation pattern make excessive water be used in localized areas causing over irrigation and reduction of crop yield in addition due to the error of observation and calculation for field experimental data the fitted deterministic cwpfs may have limitations to fully reflect actual conditions li et al 2016 therefore interval based cwpfs are introduced and employed as the basic optimization framework thereby resulting in a nonlinear objective function in optimization model for irrigation water management for example tong and guo 2013 initially estimated interval quadratic cwpfs and developed an inexact quadratic programming for optimal crop water allocation however it can only deal with interval uncertainty characterized as extreme conditions with upper and lower limits moreover it doesn t tackle the violation of system constraints huang et al 1993 and it is difficult for manager to make effective decision when the range of interval is relatively large zhang and achari 2010 in contrast fuzzy numbers can gradually adjust the range of choice based on different levels of ambiguity according to the human induced judgements of decision makers in practice the water use volume cannot be accurately determined in the case of water resources management problems which may be vaguely expressed as fuzzy linguistic terms like approximately 200 106 m3 or 220 106 m3 clearly fuzzy mathematical programming fmp method is capable of addressing such a fuzzy problem by defuzzification into its crisp deterministic one among these fmp methods fuzzy chance constrained programming namely fccp was developed to solve violation of constraints by incorporating predetermined confidence levels liu and iwamura 1998 based on the fccp fuzzy constraints can be presented as deterministic ones corresponding to different confidence levels and satisfaction degree levels of constraints rong and lahdelma 2008 in additional fccp has advantages in 1 allowing to involve fuzzy variables into an optimization model where possibilistic distributions are easily defined than probabilistic distributions 2 generating a series of stable solutions at several confidence levels and the related allowable violation risk levels while the constraints are not required to be totally satisfied and 3 having a lower computational requirement and a higher computational efficiency therefore fccp methods have been widely employed in many real world case studies rong and lahdelma 2008 cao et al 2009 xu et al 2010 zhou 2015 chen et al 2017 cai et al 2018 however the above mentioned fccp method can merely address fuzzy uncertainty existing in the right hand side of constraints liu and iwamura 1998 generally both right hand and left hand sides of constraints are likely related to fuzzy uncertainties e g variables and parameters a double sided fccp method can be employed to improve upon applicability of the conventional fccp the basic concept of dfccp method is to generate results of satisfying constraints at different confidence levels for example xu and qin 2010 proposed an inexact double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming model for agricultural effluent control liu et al 2016 developed a fuzzy fractional chance constrained programming model for air quality management under uncertainty cheng et al 2017 proposed an interval double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming model for water resources management moreover previous studies integrating double sided fccp method into optimization model of irrigation water allocation have been undertaken for instance zhang et al 2018 zhang and guo 2018 developed fuzzy linear fractional programming and interval fuzzy chance constrained programming with double sided fuzziness for optimal allocation of irrigation water respectively nevertheless the above two studies focused on the linear shape cwpfs which cannot reflect nonlinear relationships between crop yield and applied irrigation water or rainfall geerts and raes 2009 therefore in response to above concerns an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming indfccp approach is formulated for optimal allocation of irrigation water resources it incorporates double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming method and inexact quadratic programming within an optimization framework formulating an enhanced optimization model of irrigation water allocation uncertainties of intervals and double sided fuzziness in the model and nonlinearity in the objective function can be handled simultaneously then a case study on irrigation water resources allocation in the yingke irrigation district yid in the heihe river basin northwest china will be provided for demonstrating its applicability interval quadratic cwpfs are estimated by interval regression analysis method using field experimental data which can overcome the limitation of linear ones two reliability scenarios including the maximum reliability scenario and minimum reliability scenario are derived from the dfccp method a range of optimal solutions under several confidence levels are generated through solving the indfccp approach which is useful for supporting irrigation water management these results are expected to give insight into interactions among objective function values confidence levels and their arisen constraints violation risks 2 methodology this section entails four subsections on the formulation of the methodology 1 interval quadratic cwpfs 2 double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming and 3 interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming approach 4 solving process 2 1 interval quadratic cwpfs interval quadratic cwpfs in the whole growth period are estimated using interval regression analysis method tanaka and lee 1998 for different study crops i e y a e t 2 b e t c where y is crop yield data and e t is actual et a b and c are empirical coefficients the plus sign denotes the upper bound of interval parameters and minus sign is the lower bounds of interval values on one hand compared with linear cwpfs the quadratic ones with a logistic shape enable to express an additional effect on the crop yield when crops are over irrigated by much more irrigation water or rainfall on the other hand such interval form cwpfs are capable of better reflecting more uncertain information in the practical situations which are superior to deterministic cwpfs tong and guo 2013 therefore by collecting actual evapotranspiration data and associated yield data obtained from field experiment interval quadratic cwpfs can be estimated based on interval regression analysis method see appendix a 2 2 inexact quadratic programming inexact quadratic programming iqp method is introduced to address the interval uncertainty and nonlinearity due to the interval quadratic cwpfs obtained from section 2 1 the following is a general iqp framework 1a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 1b j 1 n a i j x j b i i 1 2 m 1c x j 0 j 1 2 n where a i j b i c j d j and x j are interval parameters or variables however such an iqp framework is incapable of tackling fuzzy possibilistic information and accompanying problems of fuzzy decision making 2 3 double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming similar to stochastic chance constrained programming liu and iwamura 1998 developed fuzzy chance constrained programming fccp method thereby extending ccp method to fuzzy environment several confidence levels representing satisfaction degree that the constraints should be satisfied are predefined because this fccp method can only handle single sided fuzziness existing in the right hand side of constraints which is thus named as single sided fuzzy constrained programming ssfccp xu et al 2010 in fact fuzzy uncertainty may exist in both left hand and right hand sides of the constraints which makes it desirable to improve upon the compatibility of ssfccp method therefore in this section a double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming dfccp method can be written 2a max f a x subject to 2b p o s b c b x c α 2c d x e 2d x 0 where x is a real number decision variable a d e are real number input parameters b and c are fuzzy sets and eq 2b is fuzzy chance constraints according to fiedler et al 2006 eq 2b can be hold by separating it into the minimum reliability scenario and the maximum reliability scenario corresponding to each given confidence level α mathematically these confidence levels represent a subset of elements pertaining to a fuzzy set at their corresponding membership degree of α showing that it can specifically quantify satisfaction degree of fuzzy chance constraints and corresponding risk levels liu et al 2014 for the minimum reliability scenario eq 2b is hold if and only if 2e b l α x c r α for the maximum reliability scenario eq 2b is hold if and only if 2f b r 1 α x c l 1 α where b l α is the minimum value among the potential values at confidence level α i e b l α inf b b μ 1 α c r α is the maximum value among the potential values at α cut level i e c r α sup c c μ 1 α b r 1 α and c l 1 α can be similarly interpreted μ 1 is the inverse function of μ consequently eq 2b can be readily transformed into eqs 2e and 2f double sided fuzzy chance constraints can thus be solved including two crisp equivalents however this dfccp method can hardly tackle nonlinear objective function 2 4 interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming finally an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming indfccp approach is formulated by integrating interval quadratic cwpfs and iqp into dfccp modeling framework for supporting irrigation water resources allocation and management under uncertainty the indfccp can be formulated 3a max f j 1 n c j x j d j x j 2 subject to 3b p o s a i j b i j 1 n a i j x j b α i 1 2 m 3c x j 0 j 1 2 n fig 1 graphically shows the framework of the indfccp approach therefore two scenarios of objective function values and decision variables will be obtained implying that the obtained decision making alternatives are very likely to be affected by these uncertain modeling inputs dai and li 2013 below is the solving process step 1 identify system uncertain factors and collect their interval boundaries and fuzzy distributions information step 2 build the indfccp framework step 3 convert fuzzy chance constraints into two deterministic crisp equivalents ones under different confidence levels and decompose two scenarios with interval forms step 4 for each interval model whether cost coefficients c j and d j have the same or different sign should be firstly clear choose the corresponding method based on interactive and derivative algorithms method chen and huang 2001 step 5 rewrite the interval based model as the upper f and the lower f submodels as the objective function is to maximize agricultural returns the upper bound submodel is solved based on algorithms of inexact quadratic programming seen in zhang et al 2018b thus optimal solutions can be generated f o p t x j o p t step 6 introduce these solutions obtained from step 6 into the lower bound submodel and thus optimal results are generated f o p t x j o p t step 7 integrate results based on the above steps and thus determine their interval solutions f o p t f o p t f o p t and x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t step 8 give different confidence levels and repeat above solving steps and finally generate all the interval solutions under the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios 3 study system 3 1 problem statement the study area yingke irrigation district yid is the third largest agricultural irrigation area in the heihe river basin 100 17 100 34 e 38 50 38 58 n see fig 2 the east west span of the yid is 17 4 km the north south distance is 14 2 km covering a total area of 192 2 km2 the study area is relatively flat and its altitude ranges from 1456 m to 1600 m the topographic trend is that the altitude gradually decreases from southwest to northeast moreover the study area has a typical continental temperate arid and semi arid climate annual average precipitation is 125 mm but annual evaporation from open water surface ranges approximately from 1400 mm to 2900 mm annual reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 1200 mm which is calculated based on fa0 56 recommended penman monteith formula maize and spring wheat accounts for 83 of the total planting area which are mainly planted crops in the yid the main economic crops are vegetables and fruits accounting for about 15 of the total planting area selection of cabbage as economic crops because it has the highest percentage of vegetables in the study area depending on the actual situation the growth stage for spring wheat runs from 1 april to 20 july and for maize from 20 april to 22 september cabbage is planted twice during the crop season from 20 march to 20 june and from 30 may to 30 august jiang 2017 during crop growth periods crop water demands are large while the precipitation is relatively small which makes it highly desirable to irrigate them in these months to satisfy their crop water requirements agricultural irrigation activities rely mainly on surface water while they are supplemented by groundwater irrigation in some areas i e usually occurs in the downstream areas controlled by canal systems and the common irrigation pattern is flood irrigation the main and branch canals and nearly 70 of the ditches in the irrigation area have been lined and there is still water loss occur due to canal seepages moreover irrigation water in the yid accounts for 10 of the total agricultural water in the midstream of the heihe river basin in recent years to alleviate ecological environment of the lower reaches of the heihe river basin more surface water from mainstream of the heihe river are required to divert to the downstream as a result these scheduled irrigation areas in the midstream area are expected to reduce the total water consumption based on the planning report ofthe heihe river basin management consequently the water diversion for agricultural irrigation is reduced leading to water shortage problems furthermore the reduction of surface water diversion conversely forces the groundwater over exploitation and the groundwater level in the irrigation area generally declines slowly consequently optimally allocate irrigation water based on an optimization model is helpful to the improvement of irrigation management and decision making in the yid in practice uncertainties arising from agricultural systems may have a direct effect on the final irrigation scheme such as interval quadratic cwpfs variations of water demand and water use and human induced preferences in decision making therefore to develop an optimization model taking interval quadratic cwpfs as the basic optimization framework and considering uncertainties is a potential method for supporting irrigation water resources management 3 2 formulation of optimization model generally there are four difficulties that should be overcome in optimization irrigation water resources allocation for the yid 1 how to address interval and double sided fuzziness in the optimization model 2 how to solve nonlinearity in the objective function and nonlinear problems efficiently 3 how to manage irrigation water effectively to obtain the maximum agricultural returns and 4 how to generate optimal solutions at predefined confidence levels in response to above concerns an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming approach will be formulated for practical application the indfccp approach is formulated 3 2 1 objective function 4a max f j 1 4 a j n b j c p j a j s w j g w j p e d p 2 b j s w j g w j p e d p c j j 1 4 a j c a j c t j s w j η s g w j η g where f is objective function that represents agricultural returns that after the deduction of revenue of crop productions from the operating and fixed cost including irrigation water use 106 yuan a j is planting area for crop j ha n b j is crop price yuan kg c p j is agricultural production costs which is a summative term including operating cost fixed cost and labor cost such as seed fertilizer pesticides machinery harvesting marketing drying and unexpected costs yuan kg zhang et al 2018a in this case irrigation water cost is separated from c p j as allocated irrigation water is decision variable while other production costs are constants s w j and g w j denote allocated surface water and groundwater representing water supplied to the field and crops for irrigation m3 ha p e is effective precipitation m3 ha d p denotes deep percolation of the yid m3 ha in this part assumptions are presented that change of soil water content is zero in the whole crop growth season groundwater recharge i e capillary rise in the study area is a negligible amount and surface runoff is neglected thus e t j s w j g w j p e d p a j b j and c j denote values of the estimated interval quadratic cwpfs respectively c a j represents cost of irrigation water use yuan m3 and c t j is cost of water conveyance to field yuan m3 η s and η g are comprehensive coefficients representing surface water and groundwater water use efficiency η s 0 52 and η g 0 60 η g η s because groundwater is delivered from wells into fields via less canals than surface water leading to less water loss 3 2 2 constraints 1 the surface water uses constraints 4b p o s j 1 4 1 δ s a j s w j q s η s f β s α i i 2 the groundwater water uses constraints 4c p o s j 1 4 1 δ g a j g

chance constraints indicating that they are satisfied at given confidence level α i these predefined confidence levels can quantify satisfaction degree of fuzzy chance constraints and corresponding risk levels both δ s and q s are considered as fuzzy sets in double sided constraints where δ s is water loss ratio during surface water conveyance into field and q s is surface water use volume that represents the delivered water from the mainstream of the heihe river during crop growth season δ g can be similarly interpreted and q g is groundwater use volume that represents the amount water withdrawal from the pimping wells during crop growth period in this study both δ s and δ g are empirically estimated as follows δ s 0 20 0 25 0 30 δ g 0 10 0 15 0 20 η s f and η g f are surface water and groundwater application efficiency in the field η f s η f g 0 80 0 90 in fact agricultural irrigation accounts for a major portion of the total surface water and groundwater use volume than other purposes such as municipal and industrial water use the portion of both surface water β s f and groundwater β g f utilized for agricultural irrigation are β s β g 0 85 0 95 i r min j and i r max j are irrigation water requirements for crop j m3 ha 3 3 data collection and preparation table 1 shows the interval quadratic cwpfs and deterministic ones for each study crop for comparison based on section 2 1 and appendix a interval quadratic cwpfs for these four types of crops can be estimated using interval regression analysis method these data evapotranspiration and crop yield are obtained from field experiments in 2012 and 2013 jiang et al 2015 therefore weight coefficients k 1 1 and k 2 0 0001 are chosen to determine the regression results including a b and c in this case interval quadratic cwpfs are estimated with more consideration of central tendency in the process of regression the surface water and groundwater use volume as the input parameters of optimization model are calculated by interval estimation based on the collected data from historical use for interval estimation the t distribution is employed to calculate interval values with unknown variance of sample moreover 90 confidence level was constructed for each interval parameter the upper and the lower limits in interval estimation the lower and upper limits of interval are considered as the minimum and maximum possible values of fuzzy numbers respectively while middle value of the fuzzy parameters is the same as mean value of the sample therefore based on the statistical data from 2002 to 2017 the surface water use volume is calculated q s 95 297 101 943 108 589 106 m3 and q g 37 388 43 020 48 653 106 m3 table 2 presents crop planting area crop prices and other data which are collected from the survey statistics see zhang et al 2018b all the related parameters are expressed as interval values from the collected data by means of interval estimation as the price of grains and vegetables fluctuate every day during crop growth seasons taking daily price as sample to calculate their upper and lower limits of interval agricultural production costs are determined based on the field research and verbal questioning of local farmers then it could roughly be converted to agricultural production costs per unit area or per unit of crop yield fao 56 penman monteith method is employed to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration et 0 then irrigation water requirements actual evapotranspiration is calculated for the determination of the limits of crop water requirements in the optimization model see eq 4d which are based on e t c k c e t o where et c is the actual evapotranspiration mm day k c is the crop coefficient obtained from field experiments the meteorological data is collected from zhangye national meteorological station no 52562 located in ganzhou district during 1967 2015 based on these samples taking 90 confidence level as standard to estimate the upper limit and lower limit of irrigation water requirements thus this study adopts the lower limit to express the i r min j and the upper limit to represents the i r max j in arid area with low precipitation select the usda soil conservation method p e p t 125 0 2 p t 125 p t 250 mm p t is the total measured data during the growing season to calculate effective precipitation smith 1991 in terms of deep percolation it is not measured data but is presented as a ratio between deep percolation amount and total irrigation water supply i e sum of effective precipitation surface water and groundwater such a ratio i e 0 192 0 217 is obtained from the study of jiang 2017 4 results analysis and discussion because the indfccp approach is formulated by integrating techniques of iqp and dfccp method thus it has the advantages arising from the above two methods therefore it is particularly critical for managers to determine the confidence level eleven scenarios by confidence levels are considered in this study that is α 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 through solving the indfccp approach by transforming into the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios twenty two sets of feasible solutions can be generated and most of them are intervals therefore optimal solutions at each confidence level are analyzed and examined in the following details including optimal system benefits and optimal solutions of irrigation water allocation 4 1 optimal system benefits fig 3a b show that gradual changes of confidence levels will notably yield different objective function values under the maximum and minimum reliability scenarios clearly results present an approximately proportional decline trend as the increases of confidence levels this can be explained by the theoretical basis of indfccp method generally a higher confidence level represents a higher satisfaction degree of constraints which naturally lead to a smaller decision space e g less water use volume for solving model and thus result in a decreased system benefit moreover it is obvious that different optimal results may be yielded at the same confidence level namely under the minimum reliability scenario optimal system benefits of both the upper and lower bounds are higher than that under the maximum reliability scenario for instance optimal system benefits are 500 1 910 2 106 yuan α 0 499 6 909 7 106 yuan α 0 5 and 499 1 909 3 106 yuan α 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario meanwhile the results are 499 0 909 2 106 yuan α 0 498 7 908 9 106 yuan α 0 5 and 498 2 908 4 106 yuan α 1 0 under the maximum reliability scenario respectively by comparing the outcomes between the above two scenarios solutions seem likely to be conservative but reliable under the maximum reliability scenario the significance of the above results in the practical application is to reduce the amount of total irrigation water under the maximum reliability scenario which is conducive to maintain environmental and ecological quality this also implies that a lower system benefit occurs concurrently with a lower system failure risk level therefore the above results show tradeoffs among system benefits reliability of satisfaction degree of constraints and system failure risk levels in an interactive way 4 2 optimal solutions this study aims to generate and identify optimal solution of irrigation water e g allocated surface water and groundwater resources allocation to different crops i e multiple competing users in the study area to pursue the maximum agricultural returns thus optimal solutions of the decision variables under a variety of confidence levels can be generated taking confidence levels α 0 0 5 and 1 0 to examine the variations of allocated water figs 4a and b 5a and b 6a and b present optimal solutions at α 0 0 5 and 1 0 under both reliability scenarios respectively from fig 4a the allocated surface water for seed maize spring wheat and economic crops are deterministic values and other results are interval values from fig 4b the allocated surface water for spring wheat and economic crops are fixed values it can also be seen that field maize is mainly irrigated by surface water while other three crops are mainly irrigated by groundwater for example under the minimum reliability scenario optimal water allocation is 4409 2 4912 7 m3 ha 324 2 1015 2 m3 ha surface water groundwater for filed maize 2158 6 m3 ha 4093 1 4418 7 m3 ha for seed maize 688 7 m3 ha 1795 1 2387 8 m3 ha for spring wheat and 554 5 m3 ha 2969 0 m3 ha for economic crops moreover the allocated surface water for field maize is larger than that of the maximum reliability scenario compared with the minimum reliability scenario conversely the results of groundwater are contrary to that of surface water the solutions indicate that the allocated surface water are increased from α 0 to α 0 5 under these two reliability scenarios except seed maize however when α is raised from 0 5 to 1 0 the allocated surface water for seed maize is increased for example optimal solutions for seed maize at α 0 5 are 0 6187 3 6577 3 m3 ha under the minimum reliability scenario and 1261 2 1434 3 m3 ha 4990 6 5143 0 m3 ha under the maximum reliability scenario respectively this can be further explained by the planting area of seed maize namely although optimal irrigation water allocation does not change proportionately in the light of confidence level the total irrigation surface water and groundwater amount shows such an approximately proportional changing trend fig 7 shows the upper bound of total irrigation water amount from α 0 to α 1 0 under the minimum reliability scenario obviously the amount of total surface water is increased but the amount of total groundwater is decreased indicating that the two water sources are relatively complemented compared with the results at α 0 the amount of total surface water upper bound increases by nearly 24 at α 1 0 conversely the amount of total groundwater upper bound decreases from 37 8 106 m3 to 32 0 106 m3 when α 0 1 0 understandably with the increase of confidence level manager and study systems will become more conservative in this case the groundwater use volume will be reduced and thus more surface water will be irrigated furthermore fig 8 illustrates the comparison of total surface water and groundwater between the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios similar to the results in fig 7 the amount of total surface water rises steadily while the amount of total groundwater experiences a steady decline with an increased confidence level under these two scenarios especially it is clear that the amount of total surface water under the minimum reliability scenario is lower than that under the maximum reliability scenario the average difference between these two scenarios are 5 58 106 m3 among all the confidence levels conversely the amount of total groundwater shows an opposite trend therefore planning under the minimum reliability scenario generally shows a positive attitude on water use volume but with a lower reliability level planning under the maximum reliability scenario has a closely link with a more dependable policy on water use volume thereby leading to higher reliability level and lower system failure risk level 4 3 discussion the indfccp approach is formulated by the combination of the iqp dfccp and interval quadratic cwpfs methods within a general irrigation water management modeling framework thus the results can readily reflect the characteristics of the above techniques firstly the cwpfs in the entire growth period have been extended from linear shape to interval quadratic ones there are many studies on irrigation water planning and management purposes based on cwpfs for example guo et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhang and guo 2017 proposed several inexact optimization models for irrigation water resources management based on linear expressions of cwpfs li et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 developed interval based inexact irrigation water allocation models arisen from interval linear cwpfs generally these studies have a specific assumption that the study area is a low yield area with insufficient irrigation water concurrently with hardly advanced management level li et al 2016 in fact due to lower management level and traditional flood irrigation method excessive irrigation water will be used and over irrigation even waterlogging problems will be produced in some areas which will have effects on crop yields however linear cwpfs is not realistic in the case of over irrigation to determine the optimal irrigation water applied e t j o p t corresponding the maximum possible yield for each crop becomes critical for irrigation water management and quadratic shape cwpfs are suitable for such conditions in this study the related optimal solutions indicate that total irrigation water applied to field maize and spring wheat i e s w j o p t g w j o p t p e d p are less than e t j o p t corresponding to their maximum yields optimal irrigation water allocation of the economic crops shows that it can closely realize the theoretical maximum possible yield s w j o p t g w j o p t p e d p e t j o p t therefore using interval quadratic cwpfs is superior to cwpfs with linear and interval linear shape furthermore the advantages of the interval quadratic cwpfs are highlighted by employing deterministic quadratic cwpfs to the same study for comparison the formulation of this model is realized by replacing these interval variables or parameters as deterministic ones which are derived from taking their mean values of the upper and lower bounds table 3 presents the solutions resulting from deterministic cwpfs at α 0 0 5 and 1 0 under the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios fig 9 reflects the system benefits resulting from the deterministic cwpfs it can be seen that the deterministic system benefits fall within the interval solutions from the indfccp approach implying that this is a special case from the deterministic cwpfs for example system benefits under the minimum reliability scenario are 696 2 106 yuan α 0 1 696 0 106 yuan α 0 3 695 8 106 yuan α 0 5 695 6 106 yuan α 0 7 695 4 106 yuan α 0 9 respectively in contrast interval quadratic cwpfs present more information linked with system uncertainties and complexities in the practical applications therefore solutions from the indfccp approach can provide more flexible choices within interval fluctuations and thus better support effective decision making plans additionally when confidence level is fixed at α 1 0 without considering fuzziness in the double sided constraints the indfccp approach can be rewritten as a general iqp model see fig 6a and b in this case optimal solutions will be restricted as a single interval solution when all the constraints are satisfied α 1 0 results can be bound by the strict conditions without any allowable constraint violation risk level this conservative decision making plan may lead to moderate economic benefits however the indfccp approach can handle double sided fuzziness and introduce the confidence levels to quantitatively express the manager s preferences on the tradeoffs among system benefits confidence levels and system failure risk degrees moreover double sided fuzzy chance constraints are divided into the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios which can generate more cost effective solutions than that of a general iqp modeling framework therefore the indfccp approach can thus facilitate to identify cost effective solutions of irrigation water allocation under complexity and uncertainty 5 conclusions an interval nonlinear double sided fuzzy chance constrained programming indfccp approach is formulated for supporting optimal irrigation water allocation under complexity and uncertainty in this study an extension regarding the form of cwpfs from linear interval linear to interval quadratic has been done to present more valuable information associated with system uncertainties and complexities in practical conditions it can deal with discrete intervals and fuzzy uncertainties allowable constraints violation risks levels are introduced using the concept of confidence levels where each confidence level includes the minimum and maximum reliability scenarios clearly it can be realized a higher system benefits at a lower confidence level under the minimum reliability scenario it is obvious that interval solutions can provide flexible decision space and alternatives within the lower and upper bounds based on managers preferences which implies that the decision making alternatives are likely to be affected by these uncertain modeling inputs system benefits under the minimum reliability scenario range from 499 1 909 3 106 yuan at α 1 0 to 500 1 910 2 106 yuan at α 0 similarly system benefits under the maximum reliability scenario range from 498 2 908 4 106 yuan at α 1 0 to 499 1 909 3 106 yuan at α 0 therefore optimal irrigation water resources management strategies are linked to confidence levels and reliability scenarios which is also related to constraints violations and system failure risk degrees this is an attempt to demonstrate the developed optimization model for effective irrigation water allocation by a case study of the yid in the heihe river basin northwest china in an arid area the formulation of the indfccp approach and its results make it highly possible be applicable to other similar management issues under uncertainty without loss of generality although this study shows several advantages in tackling irrigation water allocation there are still some limitations that require to be improved for example only some parameters are presented as fuzzy numbers full or more fuzzy parameters and their arithmetic operations should be considered to enhance existing fuzzy programming methods in addition because the irrigation district measures hundreds of km2 the spatial variability of those water balance components should be involved into distributed agro hydrological model using observation experiments at regional scale in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

10313,the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrhs is an in situ rainfall collection and utilization technique that has been widely adopted in global arid and semiarid farming areas because of its significant benefits to soil water availability and crop yield however the integrated effects of different ridge furrow configurations on rainwater collection and crop performance are still lacking using a specialized database drawn from field experiments in the loess plateau we examined the regional effects of three typical ridge furrow configurations namely high 1 1 uniform 1 1 and low 1 1 ridge furrow ratios on soil water storage crop water use efficiency wue and grain yield the high ridge furrow ratio achieved the greatest improvements in soil water storage than the other two ratios compared with traditional flat planting without ridge furrow configuration crop yield and wue were significantly increased by 37 65 27 12 31 70 and 47 70 30 00 and 17 80 under high uniform and low ridge furrow ratios respectively improvements in crop yield and wue due to the different ridge furrow configurations were jointly affected by climate soil organic matter and fertilizer application the mean annual precipitation of 600 mm and the mean annual temperature of 12 can be used as the threshold for selecting the ratio of ridge furrow an increase in soil organic matter gradually declined the increase in grain yield and wue owing to the three ridge furrow ratios such that the maximum effect was found for the high ridge furrow ratio among the three ratios the improvements in crop yield and wue were most notable when the application rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer were 100 200 kg ha 1 and 101 125 kg ha 1 respectively this study examined the scientific basis of a ridge furrow farming practice for enhancing rainfall use and crop wue thus these results offer novel insights for the optimized design of a ridge furrow ratio in dryland agroecosystems of the loess plateau by taking into account site based climatic conditions soil fertility and fertilization input level keywords crop yield water use efficiency ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system ridge furrow ratio soil water storage 1 introduction drylands cover 41 of the global terrestrial area and are used for rainfed cropping by millions of small farmers food security tends to be low due mainly to limited water resources and hence low crop productivity food production in drylands has to cope with two main problems associated with the lack of rainfall namely rainwater collection and soil water retention drylands are the predominant type of agricultural land use in china especially in the loess plateau which accounts for more than 60 of the total arable area despite this huge land coverage the total grain production in the loess plateau is less than 25 of the national total wang et al 2015 wei et al 2018 such a yield gap is mainly caused by scarce and uneven rainfall insufficient groundwater resources poor soil quality and low water use efficiency wue in the loess plateau therefore enhancing rainwater collection and utilization efficiency is the key to promoting agricultural production in the area li et al 2012 2014 to tackle this problem many rainwater harvesting practices have been fully explored and developed over the last four decades among these technologies in situ rainfall collection techniques have proven to be a promising way to improve rainfall use efficiency soil water availability and crop productivity in dryland farming areas gan et al 2013 han et al 2014 zhang 2016 the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrhs is one of the most effective in situ rainwater harvesting techniques and has been widely adopted in the loess plateau for over 40 years jia et al 2006a li et al 2002 mo et al 2013 the rfrhs typically consist of two innovative farming practices alternating ridge furrow configurations and soil surface mulching fig 1 in practice ridges with various widths are established in the field to channel rainwater into furrows and minimize surface water runoff naturally occurring furrows at the junction between ridges can then be used for collecting water and sowing crops mo et al 2016 mulching is a vital component to guarantee the success of rfrhs in arid and semiarid areas where scarce and unpredictable precipitation high evaporation and low water availability are the major factors limiting agricultural productivity soil surface mulching provides physical barriers to prevent evaporation and improves soil water availability there are many mulching materials and techniques used in the production of field crops in the loess plateau for instance plastic film is usually used to cover the ridges when planting maize wheat potato whereas gravel and sand rock fragments and crop straw are popular for mulching furrows for crops such as watermelon and small cereals over the past decades different ridge to furrow ratios and mulching techniques have been extensively explored in various regions of the loess plateau to meet the requirements of local climatic conditions dominant crops edaphic and other resource endowments li et al 2007 however the optimal site and crop specific ridge furrow configurations and corresponding mulching techniques have not been successfully identified in the loess plateau especially with regard to soil water availability and crop productivity the rfrhs can significantly affect rainwater harvesting efficiency and crop productivity based on the differences in ridge furrow ratios and mulching technique used in practice the application of various ridge furrow configurations and mulching techniques depends on multiple factors typically including in season precipitation amount thermal source crop type fertilization application and land flatness under different rainfall conditions soil water availability is strictly governed by the ridge furrow ratio in rfrhs mainly owing to the fact that the differences in the ratio which often lead to changes in runoff intensity and hence soil water infiltration liu et al 2020 for the same crop jia et al 2006b found that under rfrhs the choice of the ridge furrow ratio was related to rainfall and the optimal ratio is 1 i e 60 cm 60 cm at a semiarid site li and gong 2002 also noted that a favorable ratio is 1 under dry conditions however the best ratio is 1 4 in the area where rainfall is around 500 mm li et al 2019a indicated that in order to achieve a greater grain yield and wue the optimal ratio should be 1 i e 70 cm 40 cm at a semi humid site in addition the optimal ridge furrow ratio depends on the crop type probably owing to the distinct root architecture and water uptake characteristics for instance a higher ridge furrow ratio 2 1 in width may increase rainfall use efficiency in maize but not in wheat li and gong 2002 in wheat production a normal sized ridge furrow unit is 0 6 m of wheat crop sown in furrows combined with 0 2 m plastic covered ridges moreover in areas where the soil slope ranges between 6 and 12 a ridge to furrow ratio of 10 cm 30 cm is the most effective in preventing runoff and increasing soil water content when rows are along the contour li et al 2019b in addition to the ridge furrow configuration mulching material and techniques are critical factors that affect soil water storage and crop productivity both plastic film and crop straw mulching are the most popular techniques in the loess plateau because of their significant effects on soil water storage despite countless studies revealing that site and crop specific ridge furrow configurations are promising solutions for improving rainfall harvesting and crop productivity the effects from different field investigations demonstrate high levels of variation across experimental sites these inconsistent findings may strongly affect decision making for large area popularization and the application of rfrhs in the loess plateau therefore a regional scale quantitative assessment of the impact of ridge furrow configuration on soil water harvesting and crop productivity is urgently required in the present study by compiling a specialized database drawn from field experiments with different ridge furrow configurations we performed a meta analysis to quantify the integrated responses of soil water thermal conditions crop yield and wue to the different configurations to identify the dominant drivers to support future rfrhs development we also evaluated whether the strength of these effects varied based on land management i e crop type mulching technique and fertilizer input environmental factors i e climate precipitation and temperature and edaphic conditions i e texture bulk density and total nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 data source and collection we extracted data from pairwise comparisons on ridge furrow and traditional flat planting systems from peer reviewed research papers published up until the end of 2019 relevant publications were collected using two search engines the china knowledge network http www cnki net and the web of science http access webofknowledge com the key words were ridge furrow wue and yield candidate studies were individually examined for the data meeting the following criteria 1 pairwise comparisons on ridge furrow i e treatment group

agricultural area of the loess plateau and included at least one of our concerned parameters i e soil water content grain yield and wue 3 only field studies with replicated experimental designs were included and greenhouse and laboratory incubation experiments were excluded and 4 the crops studied were limited to corn wheat and potato finally 63 articles were included in our data pool detailed information on these studies can be found in the supplementary material table a 1 for each measurement in both the treatment and control groups the mean value sample size and standard deviations sd were extracted where we could neither extract nor calculate standard deviations from standard errors we calculated the average coefﬁcient of variation cv within each dataset and then approximated the missing standard deviations by multiplying the reported means by the average cvs groenigen et al 2011 wang et al 2015b all raw data were either collected directly from tables and texts or digitized graphs using web plot digitizer 3 8 software 2 2 data preparation to examine the effects of ridge furrow configuration on the spatial distribution of soil water the data of soil water content measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm were collected from each eligible study after ensuring that the above criterion were met 20 studies on soil water content n 231 for 0 160 cm in each soil layer and n 229 for 160 200 cm in each soil layer and 63 studies on crop yield n 282 and wue n 252 were included in the statistics all these studies involved three provinces located in the loess plateau which are presented in fig 2 the mean annual rainfall mean annual temperature and soil physical and chemical properties of the experimental sites in these three provinces are presented in table 1 based on previous studies on the ridge and furrow sizes of rfrhs we divided the ridge furrow ratio into the following three groups when the width of ridges was larger than the furrows i e wrtf deng et al 2006 li et al 2019a li and gong 2002 the ridges and furrows had the same width i e srfw ding et al 2007 qiang et al 2011 and the width of ridges was narrower than the furrows i e nrtf wang et al 2005a wheat corn rice and potato are recognized as the four major food crops in the world and play an important role in ensuring food security however there are few studies on the application of rfrhs in rice therefore in this study we focused on three crops namely wheat corn and potato fao 2015 to further explain the variations in crop grain yield and wue as affected by different ridge furrow ratios the subgroup classification of the dataset was as follows 1 climatic factors according to the rainfall dividing line in the loess plateau i e 400 mm semi arid zone and semi humid drought prone zone and 600 mm semi humid drought prone zone and semi humid zone we divided rainfall into three categories 400 mm 400 600 mm and 600 mm according to wang et al 2018a the annual average temperature was divided into three categories 7 c 7 12 c and 12 2 to reveal the influence of soil physical and chemical factors on the effect of different ridge furrow ratios the following classifications were made bulk density 1 3 1 3 1 4 and 1 4 soil organic matter 10 g kg 1 10 14 g kg 1 and 14 g kg 1 soil total nitrogen 0 75 g kg 1 0 75 1 g kg 1 and 1 g kg 1 soil available nitrogen 60 mg kg 1 and 60 mg

analysis the natural logarithm of the response ratio was used as the effect value for the meta analysis borenstein et al 2011 luo et al 2010 in order to assess the response to the effects of different ridge furrow ratios the equation is as follows 1 r xe xc 2 rr ln r ln xe xc ln xe ln xc to more intuitively express the effect of different ridge furrow ratios on crop yield and wue eq 2 was converted to eq 3 3 effect r 1 100 where xe is the yield or wue of the crop under rfrhs and xc is the yield or wue of the crop under fp the openmee wallace et al 2017 with the hedges olkin random model was used to calculate the weighted effect value and 95 bootstrap confidence interval ci hedges et al 1999 if the 95 ci contained 0 this indicated that the rfrhs had no significant effect on crop yield and wue

substantial unexplained variation remains when the fail safe number n 5 n 10 n is the number of datasets used this indicates that the results have no publication bias xiang et al 2017 as nyield and nwue were 21209478 and 2911277 respectively we concluded that our results were likely not influenced by publication bias 3 results 3 1 soil water availability in general the ridge furrow configuration exerted a significant and positive effect on soil water content fig 3 compared with fp the increase in the soil water content gradually decreased with an increase in soil depth under the three ridge furrow ratios wrtf srfw and nrtf increased the soil water content of the 0 200 cm soil layer by an average of 4 81 1 89 and 0 98 respectively among which the soil water content of the 0 80 cm soil layer increased the most by an average of 5 43 2 55 and 1 27 respectively 3 2 crop grain yield and wue compared with fp the ridge furrow configuration significantly increased crop grain yield by 32 98 and wue by 32 31 across the dataset fig 4 the increasing effect on grain yield varied among the three ridge furrow ratios fig 4a such that wrtf had the largest yield increasing effect 37 63 followed by nrtf 31 72 and srfw 27 05 compared with fp wrtf srfw and nrtf increased crop wue by 47 71 30 03 and 17 85 respectively 3 3 effect of climatic factors on grain yield and wue the increasing magnitude of grain yield and wue under the three ridge furrow ratios was significantly affected by climatic conditions fig 5 across the dataset the effect sizes of grain yield and wue were negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation and the correlation coefficient slope was 0 0876 and 0 0238 respectively fig 6a and b among the three ridge furrow ratios when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm wrtf showed the best grain yield and wue increasing effect however when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm nrtf showed a greater increase in grain yield and wue fig 5a and b the effect size of crop yield was also negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and the correlation coefficient slope was 0 02407 fig 6c when the mean annual temperature was 12 c wrtf showed the best crop grain yield and wue increasing effect but when the mean annual temperature was 12 c nrtf showed a greater increase in grain yield and wue fig 5c and d 3 4 effect of soil factors on grain yield and wue fig 7 shows that the improvement in crop grain yield and wue by the three ridge furrow ratios is affected by soil factors with an increase in the soil bulk density the effect sizes of the three ridge furrow ratios all decreased fig 7a and fig 8a when the soil bulk density was 1 3 the grain yield and wue increasing effect of nrtf were 53 76 and 55 58 respectively which were greater than those of wrtf 36 34 and 52 50 respectively and srfw 31 26 and 39 10 respectively fig 7a with a soil bulk density of 1 3 1 4 the grain yield and wue advantage due to wrtf was 23 61 and 24 73 respectively which were greater than nrtf 17 35 and 13 88 respectively and srfw 12 75 and 22 51 respectively an increase in soil organic matter also reduced the effect sizes of the three ridge furrow ratios fig 7b and fig 8b under the same soil organic matter content compared with srfw and nrtf wrtf showed a more pronounced yield increasing effect when the soil total nitrogen content was moderate 0 75 1 g kg 1 the three ridge furrow ratios all had a better grain yield and wue increasing effect and under the three categories of soil total nitrogen content wrtf showed the best effect surprisingly soil available nutrients including available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium had no significant influence on the effects of the three ridge furrow ratios fig 7d f and fig 8d f 3 5 effect of agronomic management factors on grain yield and wue the three ridge furrow ratios significantly improved the grain yield and wue of the three crops fig 9 overall under the different ridge furrow ratios the grain yield of potato corn and wheat increased by 48 3 42 3 and 26 0 respectively and wue increased by 65 9 31 0 and 28 8 respectively compared with those under fp in addition the potato yield and wue improvement effects were the largest under the three ridge furrow ratios followed by corn and wheat yields among the three crops the yield increasing effect under wrtf was consistently greater than that under srfw and nrtf for potato and corn however wheat yield and wue improved the most under nrtf the application rate of fertilizers under the three ridge furrow ratios had a significant effect on grain yield and wue fig 10 under a moderate nitrogen fertilizer application rate 100 200 kg ha 1 the three ridge furrow ratios all showed the best crop yield and wue increasing effect with an increase in the phosphate fertilizer p2o5 application rate the crop yield and wue improvement effect under the three ridge furrow ratios showed an increasing trend additionally the amount of potassium fertilizer did not influence the effects of the three ridge furrow ratios whether covered with plastic film or not the three ridge furrow ratios significantly increased grain yield and wue fig 11 however compared with no mulching the effects of the three ridge furrow ratios under mulching were more significant p 0 001 under the three ridge furrow ratios mulching both the ridges and furrows showed greater advantages in improving grain yield and wue compared with mulching the ridges only and no mulching 4 discussion soil water availability is one of the most important driving factors in agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 especially under dryland conditions the rfrhs is an in situ rainfall collection and utilization technique that has been widely adopted in global arid and semiarid farming areas because of its significant benefits on soil water availability and crop grain yield by reshaping the microtopography of the soil surface the ridge furrow configuration can substantially contribute to rainfall harvesting and soil water retention fig 3 as the basic component of rfrhs the design of the ridge furrow ratio is a determinant of rainfall collection efficiency and thus crop performance our meta analysis indicated that the soil water content of the 0 200 cm layer increased by 3 40 5 66 under a high ridge to furrow ratio whereas a minimum increase of 0 60 1 50 was found under a lower ratio fig 3 this difference could be attributed to the amount of soil surface area producing runoff and amount of rainfall harvesting fig 1 in general a higher ratio will produce a larger soil surface area to generate runoff and narrower furrows to gather the runoff a high ratio has proven particularly effective in areas where rainfall is scarce and often occurs in the form of a slight event li et al 2019a however in some semi humid and humid areas a decreased ridge furrow ratio is the most effective in expanding the space of soil water availability and fostering a larger crop root system li and gong 2002 in arid and semiarid areas an improvement in soil water availability inevitably provides a basis for crop growth and yield performance however the effect of the ridge furrow configuration on crop yield and wue is strongly dependent on climatic conditions in general the positive effect of the ridge furrow configuration on both grain yield and wue were negatively correlated with annual mean temperature and precipitation fig 6 this was consistent with the conclusion by wang et al 2020 when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm and the average annual temperature was 12 the high ridge furrow ratio showed the best grain yield and wue advantage however it is interesting that when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm and the average annual temperature was 12 the low ridge furrow ratio showed crop grain yield and wue the most fig 5 one possible explanation is that the high ridge to furrow ratio is more efficient in warming the soil collecting rainwater and conserving moisture in areas with suboptimal climatic conditions and is thus comparatively more productive li et al 2019b however in areas where the climate is relatively mild but still cannot satisfy crop growth nrtf can increase the crop planting area adjust the row spacing avoid overcrowding of the aboveground canopy optimize the use of light energy by crops and is thus relatively more likely to the accumulate crop dry matter ling and zhang 1993 when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm the wue of crops was greatly improved under three ridge furrow ratios this may be because ridge furrow planting increases the soil water content and reduces water evaporation which leads to more water loss through crop transpiration daryanto et al 2017 and finally leads to the improvement of wue however when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm the effect of ridge furrow planting was weakened and the effect of improving crop wue was also reduced soil physical and chemical properties were also closely associated with the effects of ridge furrow configuration on crop yield and wue fig 7 with the increase in soil bulk density the yield increasing effect of the three furrows showed a downward trend which is consistent with the conclusions of wang et al 2020 this can be explained by the fact that larger soil bulk density is not conducive to rainwater infiltration thereby resulting in lower soil water content geng and dai 2011 interestingly when the soil bulk density was 1 3 the difference in the yield increasing effect among the three ridge furrow ratios was not significant p 0 05 however when the soil bulk density was 1 3 the ridge furrow ratio of 1 had the greatest yield increasing effect this may be due to the difficulty associated with rainwater infiltration under a high soil bulk density zheng et al 2004 which requires a larger collection area to harvest rainwater in addition both soil total nitrogen and organic matter had a significant effect on the improvement in crop yield and wue under the different ridge furrow configurations with an increase in soil organic matter and total nitrogen content the yield increasing effect of the three ridge furrow configurations gradually decreased fig 7b and c indicating that this technique is most effective in fields with poor soil and low fertility the significant improvement in grain yield and wue of all three crops under the three ridge furrow ratios demonstrated good applicability to different crops fig 9 the grain yield advantage was more pronounced for corn and potato under a ridge furrow ratio of 1 which could be attributed to the higher water and temperature demands of relatively larger plants such as corn and potato and because the number of plants per unit area can be easily modified by adjusting the plant spacing in contrast wheat exhibited a greater increase in yield under a ridge furrow ratio of 1 which can be explained by the fact that its grain yield is greatly affected by planting area and thus a greater planting area will produce more ears per unit area ultimately improving grain yield in the present study three ridge furrow ratios significantly improved the soil hydrothermal status fig 3 and supplementary materials fig a 1 which resulted in a higher utilization efficiency of fertilizers by crops ahamefule and peter 2014 kaya et al 2005 in the present study medium input of nitrogen 101 200 kg ha 1 and phosphorus 101 125 kg ha 1 fertilizer under all the ridge furrow ratios showed the best effect fig 10 which is consistent with the results of li et al 2018 generally the lower the nutrient input from outside the greater the dependence of crop production on the inherent capacity of the soil to supply nutrients wang et al 2018b the improvement of the hydrothermal environment increases the root activity of crops which improves the absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus a medium input of nitrogen 100 200 kg ha 1 and phosphorus 101 125 kg ha 1 fertilizer ensures that crops have access to essential soil nutrients but do not over rely on these additional nutrients while ensuring a higher fertilizer utilization efficiency although it is possible to obtain higher yields under high nitrogen applications hu et al 2013 the associated negative implications such as the waste of resources environmental pollution and economic losses cannot be ignored therefore the optimization of crop fertilization under different ridge furrow ratios can be promising in terms of achieving a more acceptable tradeoff between the negative impacts of excessive fertilizer applications and maximum crop yield in the present study the application of potassium fertilizer had no significant effect on the effect of the three ridge furrow ratios this is mainly due to the high potassium content in the soil in the loess plateau wu et al 2013 which can meet crop demands mulching is an important field management measure of rfrhs which can increase the accumulation of soil water by limiting the evaporation of soil moisture ramakrishna et al 2006 in addition mulching can effectively increase the surface temperature of the soil gan et al 2013 especially during the early stages of crop growth wang et al 2005b compared with fp rfrhs combined with mulching significantly increased the temperature in the 0 15 cm soil layer supplementary materials fig a 1a especially by mulching both the ridges and furrows supplementary materials fig a 1 b such improvements in hydrothermal conditions play an important role in ensuring crop emergence dry matter accumulation and yield formation ren et al 2016 the variations in mulching techniques under different ridge furrow configurations led to differences in soil water content and temperature thus the improvement effect on crop yield and wue differed fig 11 compared with no mulching the crop yield and wue of the three ridge furrow ratios were significantly improved by the mulching of ridges and furrows and ridges only although the yield increasing effect associated with mulching both the ridges and furrows was greater than that of mulching the ridges only under different ridge furrow ratios there was no significant difference this may be because mulching of the ridges and furrows can still maintain a higher soil temperature during the later stages of crop growth accelerate the senescence of the root system and indirectly affect the crop yield formation therefore mulching of the ridges and furrows is recommended in areas with severe drought and low temperature conditions whereas mulching of the ridges only is more suitable under relatively mild conditions it is undeniable that the future climate change will lead to a more severe agricultural production situation in arid and semi arid areas and the decrease in precipitation will have a greater impact than the increase in temperature therefore the utilization of ineffective rainfall is more important for future agricultural production and the ridge furrow configuration should adapt to climate change and increase the ratio of ridge furrow appropriately 5 conclusions our findings indicated that the practical application of different ridge furrow configurations verses flat planting significantly increased soil water content crop yield and water use efficiency in the loess plateau climatic factors and soil physical and chemical factors including soil bulk density soil organic matter and total nitrogen content were the key factors affecting the action of the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrhs the choice of different configurations should also be based on local climatic factors and planted varieties the application of chemical fertilizers significantly influenced the effect of the rfrhs we recommend an application rate of 100 200 kg ha 1 and 100 125 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer respectively in the future changes in climate and the environment will influence the positive effects of the rfrhs thus furrow configurations will need to be adjusted timeously to maximize production potential in addition more attention should be given to the retrieval and recycling of farmland film residues to reduce the risk of associated environmental problems and ensure the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

the mean annual precipitation of 600 mm and the mean annual temperature of 12 can be used as the threshold for selecting the ratio of ridge furrow an increase in soil organic matter gradually declined the increase in grain yield and wue owing to the three ridge furrow ratios such that the maximum effect was found for the high ridge furrow ratio among the three ratios the improvements in crop yield

mulching techniques have been extensively explored in various regions of the loess plateau to meet the requirements of local climatic conditions dominant crops edaphic and other resource endowments li et al 2007 however the optimal site and crop specific ridge furrow configurations and corresponding mulching techniques have not been successfully identified in the loess plateau especially with regard to soil water availability and crop productivity the rfrhs can significantly affect rainwater harvesting efficiency and crop productivity based on the differences in ridge furrow ratios and mulching technique used in practice the application of various ridge furrow configurations and mulching techniques depends on multiple factors typically including in season precipitation amount thermal source crop type fertilization application and land flatness under different rainfall conditions soil water availability is strictly governed by the ridge furrow ratio in rfrhs mainly owing to the fact that the differences in the ratio which often lead to changes in runoff intensity and hence soil water infiltration liu et al 2020 for the same crop jia et al 2006b found that under rfrhs the choice of the ridge furrow ratio was related to rainfall and the optimal ratio is 1 i e 60 cm 60 cm at a semiarid site li and gong 2002 also noted that a favorable ratio is 1 under dry conditions however the best ratio is 1 4 in the area where rainfall is around 500 mm li et al 2019a indicated that in order to achieve a greater grain yield and wue the optimal ratio should be 1 i e 70 cm 40 cm at a semi humid site in addition the optimal ridge furrow ratio depends on the crop type probably owing to the distinct root architecture and water uptake characteristics for instance a higher ridge furrow ratio 2 1 in width may increase rainfall use efficiency in maize but not in wheat li and gong 2002 in wheat production a normal sized ridge furrow unit is 0 6 m of wheat crop sown in furrows combined with 0 2 m plastic covered ridges moreover in areas where the soil slope ranges between 6 and 12 a ridge to furrow ratio of 10 cm 30 cm is the most effective in preventing runoff and increasing soil water content when rows are along the contour li et al 2019b in addition to the ridge furrow configuration mulching material and techniques are critical factors that affect soil water storage and crop productivity both plastic film and crop straw mulching are the most popular techniques in the loess plateau because of their significant effects on soil water storage despite countless studies revealing that site and crop specific ridge furrow configurations are promising solutions for improving rainfall harvesting and crop productivity the effects from different field investigations demonstrate high levels of variation across experimental sites these inconsistent findings may strongly affect decision making for large area popularization and the application of rfrhs in the loess plateau therefore a regional scale quantitative assessment of the impact of ridge furrow configuration on soil water harvesting and crop productivity is urgently required in the present study by compiling a specialized database drawn from field experiments with different ridge furrow configurations we performed a meta analysis to quantify the integrated responses of soil water thermal conditions crop yield and wue to the different configurations to identify the dominant drivers to support future rfrhs development we also evaluated whether the strength of these effects varied based on land management i e crop type mulching technique and fertilizer input environmental factors i e climate precipitation and temperature and edaphic conditions i e texture bulk density and total nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 data source and collection we extracted data from pairwise comparisons on ridge furrow and traditional flat planting systems from peer reviewed research papers published up until the end of 2019 relevant publications were collected using two search engines the china knowledge network http www cnki net and the web of science http access webofknowledge com the key words were ridge furrow wue and yield candidate studies were individually examined for the data meeting the following criteria 1 pairwise comparisons on ridge furrow i e treatment group

agricultural area of the loess plateau and included at least one of our concerned parameters i e soil water content grain yield and wue 3 only field studies with replicated experimental designs were included and greenhouse and laboratory incubation experiments were excluded and 4 the crops studied were limited to corn wheat and potato finally 63 articles were included in our data pool detailed information on these studies can be found in the supplementary material table a 1 for each measurement in both the treatment and control groups the mean value sample size and standard deviations sd were extracted where we could neither extract nor calculate standard deviations from standard errors we calculated the average coefﬁcient of variation cv within each dataset and then approximated the missing standard deviations by multiplying the reported means by the average cvs groenigen et al 2011 wang et al 2015b all raw data were either collected directly from tables and texts or digitized graphs using web plot digitizer 3 8 software 2 2 data preparation to examine the effects of ridge furrow configuration on the spatial distribution of soil water the data of soil water content measured at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm were collected from each eligible study after ensuring that the above criterion were met 20 studies on soil water content n 231 for 0 160 cm in each soil layer and n 229 for 160 200 cm in each soil layer and 63 studies on crop yield n 282 and wue n 252 were included in the statistics all these studies involved three provinces located in the loess plateau which are presented in fig 2 the mean annual rainfall mean annual temperature and soil physical and chemical properties of the experimental sites in these three provinces are presented in table 1 based on previous studies on the ridge and furrow sizes of rfrhs we divided the ridge furrow ratio into the following three groups when the width of ridges was larger than the furrows i e wrtf deng et al 2006 li et al 2019a li and gong 2002 the ridges and furrows had the same width i e srfw ding et al 2007 qiang et al 2011 and the width of ridges was narrower than the furrows i e nrtf wang et al 2005a wheat corn rice and potato are recognized as the four major food crops in the world and play an important role in ensuring food security however there are few studies on the application of rfrhs in rice therefore in this study we focused on three crops namely wheat corn and potato fao 2015 to further explain the variations in crop grain yield and wue as affected by different ridge furrow ratios the subgroup classification of the dataset was as follows 1 climatic factors according to the rainfall dividing line in the loess plateau i e 400 mm semi arid zone and semi humid drought prone zone and 600 mm semi humid drought prone zone and semi humid zone we divided rainfall into three categories 400 mm 400 600 mm and 600 mm according to wang et al 2018a the annual average temperature was divided into three categories 7 c 7 12 c and 12 2 to reveal the influence of soil physical and chemical factors on the effect of different ridge furrow ratios the following classifications were made bulk density 1 3 1 3 1 4 and 1 4 soil organic matter 10 g kg 1 10 14 g kg 1 and 14 g kg 1 soil total nitrogen 0 75 g kg 1 0 75 1 g kg 1 and 1 g kg 1 soil available nitrogen 60 mg kg 1 and 60 mg

following categories low application rate n 0 100 kg ha 1 p2o5 50 75 kg ha 1 and k2o 50 75 kg ha 1 scientific fertilizer application rate n 100 200 kg ha 1 p2o5 76 100 kg ha 1 and k2o 76 100 kg ha 1 and farmers frequently used fertilizer application rate n 200 300 300 400 kg ha 1 p2o5 101 125 126 150 kg ha 1 and k2o 101 125 kg ha 1 the specific information is presented in table 2 2 3 data analysis the natural logarithm of the response ratio was used as the effect value for the meta analysis borenstein et al 2011 luo et al 2010 in order to assess the response to the effects of different ridge furrow ratios the equation is as follows 1 r xe xc 2 rr ln r ln xe xc ln xe ln xc to more intuitively express the effect of different ridge furrow ratios on crop yield and wue eq 2 was converted to eq 3 3 effect r 1 100 where xe is the yield or wue of the crop under rfrhs and xc is the yield or wue of the crop under fp the openmee wallace et al 2017 with the hedges olkin random model was used to calculate the weighted effect value and 95 bootstrap confidence interval ci hedges et al 1999 if the 95 ci contained 0 this indicated that the rfrhs had no significant effect on crop yield and wue

effect was considered significantly different at the α 0 05 level curtis 1996 gurevitch et al 1992 otherwise there was no significant difference we used heterogeneity tests to investigate whether models could explain significant variation supplementary material table a 2 qm indicates the percent of heterogeneity in effect sizes explained by each model a significant qe indicates that substantial unexplained variation remains when the fail safe number n 5 n 10 n is the number of datasets used this indicates that the results have no publication bias xiang et al 2017 as nyield and nwue were 21209478 and 2911277 respectively we concluded that our results were likely not influenced by publication bias 3 results 3 1 soil water availability in general the ridge furrow configuration exerted a significant and positive effect on soil water content fig 3 compared with fp the increase in the soil water content gradually decreased with an increase in soil depth under the three ridge furrow ratios wrtf srfw and nrtf increased the soil water content of the 0 200 cm soil layer by an average of 4 81 1 89 and 0 98 respectively among which the soil water content of the 0 80 cm soil layer increased the most by an average of 5 43 2 55 and 1 27 respectively 3 2 crop grain yield and wue compared with fp the ridge furrow configuration significantly increased crop grain yield by 32 98 and wue by 32 31 across the dataset fig 4 the increasing effect on grain yield varied among the three ridge furrow ratios fig 4a such that wrtf had the largest yield increasing effect 37 63 followed by nrtf 31 72 and srfw 27 05 compared with fp wrtf srfw and nrtf increased crop wue by 47 71 30 03 and 17 85 respectively 3 3 effect of climatic factors on grain yield and wue the increasing magnitude of grain yield and wue under the three ridge furrow ratios was significantly affected by climatic conditions fig 5 across the dataset the effect sizes of grain yield and wue were negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation and the correlation coefficient slope was 0 0876 and 0 0238 respectively fig 6a and b among the three ridge furrow ratios when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm wrtf showed the best grain yield and wue increasing effect however when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm nrtf showed a greater increase in grain yield and wue fig 5a and b the effect size of crop yield was also negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and the correlation coefficient slope was 0 02407 fig 6c when the mean annual temperature was 12 c wrtf showed the best crop grain yield and wue increasing effect but when the mean annual temperature was 12 c nrtf showed a greater increase in grain yield and wue fig 5c and d 3 4 effect of soil factors on grain yield and wue fig 7 shows that the improvement in crop grain yield and wue by the three ridge furrow ratios is affected by soil factors with an increase in the soil bulk density the effect sizes of the three ridge furrow ratios all decreased fig 7a and fig 8a when the soil bulk density was 1 3 the grain yield and wue increasing effect of nrtf were 53 76 and 55 58 respectively which were greater than those of wrtf 36 34 and 52 50 respectively and srfw 31 26 and 39 10 respectively fig 7a with a soil bulk density of 1 3 1 4 the grain yield and wue advantage due to wrtf was 23 61 and 24 73 respectively which were greater than nrtf 17 35 and 13 88 respectively and srfw 12 75 and 22 51 respectively an increase in soil organic matter also reduced the effect sizes of the three ridge furrow ratios fig 7b and fig 8b under the same soil organic matter content compared with srfw and nrtf wrtf showed a more pronounced yield increasing effect when the soil total nitrogen content was moderate 0 75 1 g kg 1 the three ridge furrow ratios all had a better grain yield and wue increasing effect and under the three categories of soil total nitrogen content wrtf showed the best effect surprisingly soil available nutrients including available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium had no significant influence on the effects of the three ridge furrow ratios fig 7d f and fig 8d f 3 5 effect of agronomic management factors on grain yield and wue the three ridge furrow ratios significantly improved the grain yield and wue of the three crops fig 9 overall under the different ridge furrow ratios the grain yield of potato corn and wheat increased by 48 3 42 3 and 26 0 respectively and wue increased by 65 9 31 0 and 28 8 respectively compared with those under fp in addition the potato yield and wue improvement effects were the largest under the three ridge furrow ratios followed by corn and wheat yields among the three crops the yield increasing effect under wrtf was consistently greater than that under srfw and nrtf for potato and corn however wheat yield and wue improved the most under nrtf the application rate of fertilizers under the three ridge furrow ratios had a significant effect on grain yield and wue fig 10 under a moderate nitrogen fertilizer application rate 100 200 kg ha 1 the three ridge furrow ratios all showed the best crop yield and wue increasing effect with an increase in the phosphate fertilizer p2o5 application rate the crop yield and wue improvement effect under the three ridge furrow ratios showed an increasing trend additionally the amount of potassium fertilizer did not influence the effects of the three ridge furrow ratios whether covered with plastic film or not the three ridge furrow ratios significantly increased grain yield and wue fig 11 however compared with no mulching the effects of the three ridge furrow ratios under mulching were more significant p 0 001 under the three ridge furrow ratios mulching both the ridges and furrows showed greater advantages in improving grain yield and wue compared with mulching the ridges only and no mulching 4 discussion soil water availability is one of the most important driving factors in agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 especially under dryland conditions the rfrhs is an in situ rainfall collection and utilization technique that has been widely adopted in global arid and semiarid farming areas because of its significant benefits on soil water availability and crop grain yield by reshaping the microtopography of the soil surface the ridge furrow configuration can substantially contribute to rainfall harvesting and soil water retention fig 3 as the basic component of rfrhs the design of the ridge furrow ratio is a determinant of rainfall collection efficiency and thus crop performance our meta analysis indicated that the soil water content of the 0 200 cm layer increased by 3 40 5 66 under a high ridge to furrow ratio whereas a minimum increase of 0 60 1 50 was found under a lower ratio fig 3 this difference could be attributed to the amount of soil surface area producing runoff and amount of rainfall harvesting fig 1 in general a higher ratio will produce a larger soil surface area to generate runoff and narrower furrows to gather the runoff a high ratio has proven particularly effective in areas where rainfall is scarce and often occurs in the form of a slight event li et al 2019a however in some semi humid and humid areas a decreased ridge furrow ratio is the most effective in expanding the space of soil water availability and fostering a larger crop root system li and gong 2002 in arid and semiarid areas an improvement in soil water availability inevitably provides a basis for crop growth and yield performance however the effect of the ridge furrow configuration on crop yield and wue is strongly dependent on climatic conditions in general the positive effect of the ridge furrow configuration on both grain yield and wue were negatively correlated with annual mean temperature and precipitation fig 6 this was consistent with the conclusion by wang et al 2020 when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm and the average annual temperature was 12 the high ridge furrow ratio showed the best grain yield and wue advantage however it is interesting that when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm and the average annual temperature was 12 the low ridge furrow ratio showed crop grain yield and wue the most fig 5 one possible explanation is that the high ridge to furrow ratio is more efficient in warming the soil collecting rainwater and conserving moisture in areas with suboptimal climatic conditions and is thus comparatively more productive li et al 2019b however in areas where the climate is relatively mild but still cannot satisfy crop growth nrtf can increase the crop planting area adjust the row spacing avoid overcrowding of the aboveground canopy optimize the use of light energy by crops and is thus relatively more likely to the accumulate crop dry matter ling and zhang 1993 when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm the wue of crops was greatly improved under three ridge furrow ratios this may be because ridge furrow planting increases the soil water content and reduces water evaporation which leads to more water loss through crop transpiration daryanto et al 2017 and finally leads to the improvement of wue however when the mean annual precipitation was 600 mm the effect of ridge furrow planting was weakened and the effect of improving crop wue was also reduced soil physical and chemical properties were also closely associated with the effects of ridge furrow configuration on crop yield and wue fig 7 with the increase in soil bulk density the yield increasing effect of the three furrows showed a downward trend which is consistent with the conclusions of wang et al 2020 this can be explained by the fact that larger soil bulk density is not conducive to rainwater infiltration thereby resulting in lower soil water content geng and dai 2011 interestingly when the soil bulk density was 1 3 the difference in the yield increasing effect among the three ridge furrow ratios was not significant p 0 05 however when the soil bulk density was 1 3 the ridge furrow ratio of 1 had the greatest yield increasing effect this may be due to the difficulty associated with rainwater infiltration under a high soil bulk density zheng et al 2004 which requires a larger collection area to harvest rainwater in addition both soil total nitrogen and organic matter had a significant effect on the improvement in crop yield and wue under the different ridge furrow configurations with an increase in soil organic matter and total nitrogen content the yield increasing effect of the three ridge furrow configurations gradually decreased fig 7b and c indicating that this technique is most effective in fields with poor soil and low fertility the significant improvement in grain yield and wue of all three crops under the three ridge furrow ratios demonstrated good applicability to different crops fig 9 the grain yield advantage was more pronounced for corn and potato under a ridge furrow ratio of 1 which could be attributed to the higher water and temperature demands of relatively larger plants such as corn and potato and because the number of plants per unit area can be easily modified by adjusting the plant spacing in contrast wheat exhibited a greater increase in yield under a ridge furrow ratio of 1 which can be explained by the fact that its grain yield is greatly affected by planting area and thus a greater planting area will produce more ears per unit area ultimately improving grain yield in the present study three ridge furrow ratios significantly improved the soil hydrothermal status fig 3 and supplementary materials fig a 1 which resulted in a higher utilization efficiency of fertilizers by crops ahamefule and peter 2014 kaya et al 2005 in the present study medium input of nitrogen 101 200 kg ha 1 and phosphorus 101 125 kg ha 1 fertilizer under all the ridge furrow ratios showed the best effect fig 10 which is consistent with the results of li et al 2018 generally the lower the nutrient input from outside the greater the dependence of crop production on the inherent capacity of the soil to supply nutrients wang et al 2018b the improvement of the hydrothermal environment increases the root activity of crops which improves the absorption of nitrogen and phosphorus a medium input of nitrogen 100 200 kg ha 1 and phosphorus 101 125 kg ha 1 fertilizer ensures that crops have access to essential soil nutrients but do not over rely on these additional nutrients while ensuring a higher fertilizer utilization efficiency although it is possible to obtain higher yields under high nitrogen applications hu et al 2013 the associated negative implications such as the waste of resources environmental pollution and economic losses cannot be ignored therefore the optimization of crop fertilization under different ridge furrow ratios can be promising in terms of achieving a more acceptable tradeoff between the negative impacts of excessive fertilizer applications and maximum crop yield in the present study the application of potassium fertilizer had no significant effect on the effect of the three ridge furrow ratios this is mainly due to the high potassium content in the soil in the loess plateau wu et al 2013 which can meet crop demands mulching is an important field management measure of rfrhs which can increase the accumulation of soil water by limiting the evaporation of soil moisture ramakrishna et al 2006 in addition mulching can effectively increase the surface temperature of the soil gan et al 2013 especially during the early stages of crop growth wang et al 2005b compared with fp rfrhs combined with mulching significantly increased the temperature in the 0 15 cm soil layer supplementary materials fig a 1a especially by mulching both the ridges and furrows supplementary materials fig a 1 b such improvements in hydrothermal conditions play an important role in ensuring crop emergence dry matter accumulation and yield formation ren et al 2016 the variations in mulching techniques under different ridge furrow configurations led to differences in soil water content and temperature thus the improvement effect on crop yield and wue differed fig 11 compared with no mulching the crop yield and wue of the three ridge furrow ratios were significantly improved by the mulching of ridges and furrows and ridges only although the yield increasing effect associated with mulching both the ridges and furrows was greater than that of mulching the ridges only under different ridge furrow ratios there was no significant difference this may be because mulching of the ridges and furrows can still maintain a higher soil temperature during the later stages of crop growth accelerate the senescence of the root system and indirectly affect the crop yield formation therefore mulching of the ridges and furrows is recommended in areas with severe drought and low temperature conditions whereas mulching of the ridges only is more suitable under relatively mild conditions it is undeniable that the future climate change will lead to a more severe agricultural production situation in arid and semi arid areas and the decrease in precipitation will have a greater impact than the increase in temperature therefore the utilization of ineffective rainfall is more important for future agricultural production and the ridge furrow configuration should adapt to climate change and increase the ratio of ridge furrow appropriately 5 conclusions our findings indicated that the practical application of different ridge furrow configurations verses flat planting significantly increased soil water content crop yield and water use efficiency in the loess plateau climatic factors and soil physical and chemical factors including soil bulk density soil organic matter and total nitrogen content were the key factors affecting the action of the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system rfrhs the choice of different configurations should also be based on local climatic factors and planted varieties the application of chemical fertilizers significantly influenced the effect of the rfrhs we recommend an application rate of 100 200 kg ha 1 and 100 125 kg ha 1 of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer respectively in the future changes in climate and the environment will influence the positive effects of the rfrhs thus furrow configurations will need to be adjusted timeously to maximize production potential in addition more attention should be given to the retrieval and recycling of farmland film residues to reduce the risk of associated environmental problems and ensure the sustainable development of agricultural ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10314,unreasonable layout of drip irrigation systems and inappropriate irrigation decision making methods in orchards in water scarce areas in northern china result in low water use efficiency wue in order to reveal the effect of drip irrigation mode on wue of orchards and improve efficient use of water resources this study used pear pyrus pyrifolia cv whangkeumbae as a test material to conduct a two year field irrigation experiment considering the two factors of drip irrigation pipes layout and lower limit of soil moisture five drip irrigation modes and a control treatment ck were set up by

wue of 70 fc increased by 13 04 7 56 12 21 respectively however the irrigation mode of 60 fc soil moisture lower limit effectively improved the fruit quality soluble solids titratable acid considering the factors of drip irrigation pipes layout subsurface drip irrigation significantly increased wue by 34 39 35 35 compared with surface drip irrigation p 0 05 and increased wue by 16 36 24 77 compared with ring drip irrigation the wue of pear tree and the cv showed a linear positive correlation considering all aspects we concluded that the mode of the subsurface drip irrigation with double lines under soil moisture lower limit of 60 fc was the best irrigation mode in pear orchard the research results provide a typical reference for further research on perennial fruit trees to improve wue keywords drip irrigation the layout of drip irrigation pipes the soil moisture lower limit water use efficiency pear 1 introduction water scarcity is a worldwide topic agricultural irrigation water accounts for 74 of the global total water consumption intrigliolo et al 2013 however with the rapid development of global population economy and cities and global warming it will inevitably lead to increased competition for water resources and reduce the water supply for agricultural irrigation frisvold and konyar 2012 piao et al 2010 therefore improving water use efficiency wue by improving irrigation technology becomes the top priority for growers to improve fruit yield quality and market competition drip irrigation as a technology that can both ensure yield and improve wue has been widely valued by scientists livellara et al 2011 reyes cabrera et al 2016 topak et al 2011 ja franco et al 2000 the application of drip irrigation in orchards is increasing worldwide bravdo and proebsting 1993 different drip irrigation pipes layouts have variable impacts on the water consumption and yield of fruit trees robles et al 2016 conducted two consecutive years of experiments on lemon trees and proposed that compared with surface drip irrigation subsurface drip irrigation could save 19 water without reducing production which could improve wue han et al 2018 compared the effects of sprinkler irrigation surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation on wue growth and yield of different varieties of apples it was proved that subsurface drip irrigation can effectively reduce water consumption by 27 37 and reduce the growth of weeds sun et al 2016 also obtained similar conclusions pointing out that subsurface drip irrigation can significantly improve the yield 10 4 16 7 wue 13 4 and quality the soluble protein content vc soluble sugar and organic acid contents of jujube trees also the drip irrigation with ring can save water by 37 and increase yield by 34 1 45 1 compared to the conventional border irrigation on apple orchards wang et al 2013 liao et al 2019a 2019b studied the water absorption characteristics of cherries and the results showed that compared with the layout of drip irrigation with parallel pipes the layout of drip irrigation with ring can effectively increase the water contribution ratio in the main root zone of cherry trees by 25 22 5 in the leaf expansion stage and maturation stage respectively addition yang et al 2013 pointed out that alternate drip irrigation had been proven to increase the wue of young pear trees by 17 1 46 1 and improve the irrigation uniformity and wue of the root zone of the trees gong et al 2004 and song et al 2008 used peach trees as experimental materials to obtain similar conclusions adjusting soil moisture content under specific drip irrigation pipes layout can significantly affect crop wue liao et al 2019a 2019b in a previous study on fruit trees guo 2006 conducted a two year water and fertilizer study on fuji apples and crisp pears and pointed out that the demand for water on fruit trees was more urgent than fertilizers there is no need to pursue high water high fertilizer and high yield at the same time in production mode there should be an optimal water productivity value for fruit trees as the soil moisture increases qin 2016 and li et al 2017a 2017b pointed out that the reference value of the suitable soil moisture lower limit of apple trees under drip irrigation is 60 field capacity fc zhang et al 2010 studied apple trees in the semi arid region of loess hills and pointed out that when the soil moisture was maintained at 60 fc 80 fc net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of the leaves remained relatively stable liang et al 2009 found that the soil moisture lower limit of grapes should be controlled around 70 fc li et al 2016 and garcía et al 2020 also pointed out that deficit irrigation can significantly improve the wue of fruit trees and fruit quality similar results had been confirmed in many other studies indicating that proper water regulation can have a positive effect on fruit tree growth yield and wue cheng et al 2003 lei et al 1991 li et al 2001 yan et al 2011 although the predecessors have made many achievements in terms of drip irrigation pipes layout and suitable soil moisture lower limit for fruit trees especially pear trees there is relatively less research in this area under different irrigation modes drip irrigation pipes layout and soil moisture research on regulating the growth and wue of fruit trees is rare thus further research is needed to help formulate drip irrigation modes for fruit trees we took pear trees pyrus pyrifolia cv whangkeumbae as the research species the purpose were to reveal the spatial variability of soil moisture and water consumption dynamics of fruit trees under different drip irrigation modes to clarify the effects of different drip irrigation modes on fruit yield and quality and wue and to propose a suitable drip irrigation mode to provide a typical reference for improving the wue of fruit trees 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiments were conducted during april 2018 march 2020 in the pear orchard at the beijing daxing shengzelin manor 116 29 e and 39 36 n china the average annual precipitation is around 556 mm and the average sunshine duration is 2459 h the annual average temperature is 11 6 and the frost free period is 185 d and the warm temperate zone is a semi humid continental monsoon climate the physical and chemical properties of the experimental soil are shown in table 1 the local irrigation mode of the experimental orchard is drip irrigation with single line and the irrigation water is groundwater the lab analysis of the experiment include fruit quality was carried out at the panggezhuang station of beijing engineering technology research center of national water saving irrigation 2 2 experimental treatments the 8 year old golden pear tree p pyrifolia cv whangkeumbae was used as the test material the experimental site was divided into three plots a b and c as three repetitions and each plot was 30 m 24 m there were 6 rows of pear trees planted in the plot and 10 pear trees each row and trees were planted at row spacing 4 m plant spacing 3 m the layout of the experimental area is shown in fig 1 a in this study the local irrigation mode of drip irrigation with single line ck as a control treatment and five drip irrigation modes were established table 2 the drip irrigation pipes of ck were arranged on the west side of the pear tree 40 cm away from the pear tree the pipes of drip irrigation with double lines were arranged on the east and west sides of the pear tree each 40 cm away from the pear tree the pipes of drip irrigation with ring the pe was connected from the branch pipes from the pipes to the row connect drip irrigation pipes to each tree separately with pear tree as the center surrounded the drip irrigation pipes into a circle with a radius of 40 cm and fixed the drip irrigation pipes with iron wire the pipes of subsurface drip irrigation with double lines put the drip irrigation into a 50 mm diameter pvc pipe holes with pitch of 25 cm and diameters of 10 mm was formed on the pvc and a layer of non woven fabric was wrapped around the pvc pipe therefore we can prevent the drip irrigation pipes from being blocked by soil and plant roots in the ground dig 40 cm deep ditches at 40 cm away both sides of the pear tree put into the drip irrigation belt and bury it the drip irrigation pipes were purchased from beijing lvyuan plastic co ltd beijing china and the dripper spacing is 25 cm and the dripper flow rate is 2 5 l h 1 the specific layouts of the drip irrigation pipes are shown in fig 1 b soil moisture monitoring was done by trime pico iph imk0 germany and three parameter instrument the acclima tdr 315l one plant in each plot of each treatment was randomly selected as a soil moisture monitoring point and two monitoring sections were set to measure the spatial distribution of soil moisture along the direction of the drip irrigation pipes every 30 cm and perpendicular to the direction of drip irrigation pipes every 40 cm place five pvc soil moisture monitoring tubes were placed in each monitoring section fig 1c the monitoring section has a depth of 100 cm measured every 7 10 days used to estimate pear evapotranspiration et by soil water balance method the layout of tdr 315l is shown in fig 1 d each treatment group randomly selected a pear tree in each plot and arranged a three parameter instrument probe at 30 cm next to it which mainly monitors the surface layer of 0 70 cm with large dynamic changes of soil moisture for soil moisture five probes were buried in each treatment the depth of the burial was 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 50 cm 70 cm and the collection interval is 0 5 h the irrigation time was accurately judged by comparing the data of trim pico iph and tdr 315l the meteorological data were obtained from an automatic weather station hobo u30 onset usa 150 m away from pear orchard 2 3 water fertilizer and agronomic management the amount and time of irrigation for ck followed the traditional methods of local orchard managers the five drip irrigation modes were supplemented according to the soil moisture lower limit the irrigation amount and irrigation time of winter irrigation follow the traditional methods of local orchard managers the irrigation amount for five drip irrigation modes was calculated using the following equation 1 i 10 p h β 1 β 2 θ where i is the amount of irrigation mm p is the percentage of soil wetting area taken 0 33 h is the designed wetting depth cm in this paper the monitoring depth for soil moisture was 100 cm due to the root depth of the investigated pear tree is in the range of 0 80 cm therefore h was set as 100 cm β 1 and β 2 represent the upper limit and the lower limit of average soil moisture content the upper limit of average soil moisture content is 100 fc the lower limit of average soil moisture content was taken as a percentage of the fc according to the irrigation mode θ is the soil field capacity to ensure the accuracy of irrigation amount an automatic irrigation control system was established and the irrigation time and amount of different drip irrigation modes are shown in table 3 the fertilization management during april 2018 march 2020 was the same apply organic fertilizer once every two years in autumn each time 2 m3 per pear tree 40 80 cm deep at the outer periphery of the pear tree crown at the time of this test organic fertilizer was applied as of october 2017 weeding was carried out after the flowering stage middle and late april every 20 25 days pruning operations were carried out at the leaf expansion stage early april and the fruit expansion stage early may and pulling operations were performed at the leaf exhibition stage early april flowering stage mid and late april fruit expansion stage early may and maturity stage june respectively 2 4 yield and quality four plants were randomly selected in each treatment and all of the pear fruits from these pear trees were picked to be weighed to calculate the average yield per plant the total yield was obtained by area conversion using the average yield per plant three pear fruits were randomly selected for each treatment to detect the soluble solids sulfuric acid anthrone colorimetry method titratable acid sodium hydroxide phenolphthalein titration method and vc molybdenum blue colorimetric method the average value was the final measurement value 2 5 evapotranspiration and wue pear tree water consumption et mm was estimated using the soil water balance method following eq 2 and wue kg m 3 was calculated with the following eq 3 2 et i p u d r δs 3 wue 0 1y et where et is the water consumption of the pear tree mm i is the irrigation amount mm p is the amount of precipitation mm u is the groundwater recharge amount mm because the groundwater depth is greater than 10 m so it is ignored u 0 d is the amount of deep drainage mm this test uses drip irrigation the irrigation quota is small irrigation basically does not produce leakage so d 0 r is the surface runoff mm because the test area is flat and r is negligible δs 10h θ t2 θ t1 where θ t1 and θ t2 are the average moisture content of the soil at the depth of 0 100 cm in the root zone at t1 and t2 respectively and y was the yield kg hm 2 calculated at the harvest stage 2 6 data analysis the contour distribution of soil moisture and the spatial distribution of the coefficient of variation cv were plotted in surfer 12 0 golden software colorado usa the box chart for soil moisture data distribution was drawn with originpro 2018 originlab corporation massachusetts usa and the correlation between soil moisture content and the cv between the cv and wue were also obtained from originpro 2018 the goal of this research was to study the diﬀerence between different drip irrigation modes therefore the aﬀecting factors of lower limit of soil moisture and the layout of drip irrigation pipes were assumed to be combined into one factor i e drip irrigation mode during the statistical analysis process under this assumption one way anova spss 20 0 ibm usa was used for significance tests and the differences between treatments were determined by lsd s multiple range test 3 results 3 1 distribution characteristics of soil moisture a box chart of the average soil moisture content under different drip irrigation modes during april 2018 march 2020 is displayed in fig 2 most data of soil moisture in different drip irrigation modes were within the range of 1 5 iqr interquartile range and the middle lines and mean values of soil moisture were relatively close the average soil moisture content of the 0 100 cm soil profile for different drip irrigation modes decreased in the following order ck w1d w2d w3d w3db w3r in which the mode of maximum moisture content was ck 86 13 and the mode of minimum moisture content was in w3r 69 96 with the decrease of the lower limit the average soil moisture content of different irrigation modes decreased gradually by 10 29 15 34 and fluctuations of the soil moisture data gradually increased fig 3 shows the contour distribution of the average soil moisture content under different drip irrigation modes during april 2018 march 2020 the ck had high soil moisture content in the middle and deep profile and the area of high soil moisture content was large in the wid mode the soil moisture content of the surface layer along the direction of drip irrigation pipes within 50 cm from the pear tree was significantly reduced in the w2d mode the soil moisture content within 80 cm from the pear tree on the section perpendicular to the direction of the drip irrigation pipes was low the modes of w3d w3db and w3r showed the phenomenon of low soil moisture content in the soil layer of 80 100 cm only and there were no obvious water consumption areas in the two profiles near the tree body generally with the decrease of irrigation amount the area of high soil moisture gradually decreased along the direction of the drip irrigation pipes and vertical to the direction of the drip irrigation pipes the soil moisture content of the 30 60 cm layer of each profile in different modes was relatively low indicating that this soil layer belongs to the main root zone of pear trees with densely distributed root systems and strong vigor this result is supported by previous reports chen and shao 2003 kang et al 1992 in addition ck and w1d were heavily irrigated resulting in high moisture content in the middle and deep layer the deep layer water may supplement the shallow soil moisture but this supplementation was slow so ck and w1d had irrigation water waste 3 2 characteristics of the cv of soil moisture the cv was linearly related to soil moisture fig 4 it can be seen from fig 5 that the ck only showed weak cv in the soil surface layer of 0 20 cm surface transpiration and the middle layer of 40 60 cm root concentrated distribution area the location of the cv under the w1d mode showed that the root system grows and develops mainly within 30 cm of the surface layer near the tree along the direction of the drip irrigation pipes under the w3d w3db and w3r modes the cv of each layer were larger than other modes and the cv of the 80 100 cm layer is particularly large the cv in shallow layer 0 40 cm of w3db was larger than that of w3d the cv of w3r was more uniform due to the layout of drip irrigation pipes which was more conducive to the uniform growth of the root system 3 3 water consumption of pear tree at different growth stages the water consumption of pear trees under different drip irrigation modes is shown in table 4 the results showed that the fruit growth stage was the highest water consumption rate wcr stage of pear trees and the wcr was also significantly affected by irrigation modes during the flowering stage and fruit growth stage the average daily water consumption of the ck reached 2 46 2 8 mm and 4 11 4 36 mm respectively which was significantly higher than other drip irrigation modes p 0 05 at the fruit mature stage different drip irrigation modes showed no significant difference in water consumption the possible reason may be the rainy season during this period and all modes had been fully supplemented by precipitation the wcr of w3d w3db and w3r3 was maintained at 0 83 0 97 mm at the leaf fall stage which was significantly lower than other treatments p 0 05 overwintering stage affected by air temperature fruit trees were in the dormant period the amount of evapotranspiration was very small and the stage of the lowest water consumption in the whole growth year of pear trees and there was no obvious difference in daily water consumption intensity among different modes during this stage in terms of total water consumption amount et during the growth period its et values had a positive correlation with irrigation amount ck had the largest irrigation amount and the et value reached 708 39 770 24 mm which was significantly higher than the other five drip irrigation modes p 0 05 the w3d w3db and w3r3 modes had lower irrigation amounts et values of which were reduced by 13 29 24 96 compared to w1d and w2d modes comparing to w3d w3db and w3r et of w3db was lower than that of w3d and the et value of w3r was lower than the w3d in 2018 and 2019 3 4 yield wue and fruit quality different drip irrigation modes caused significant differences in yield and wue fig 6 in 2018 and 2019 the w3db mode obtained the maximum yield of 31218 75 kg hm 2 and 29752 08 kg hm 2 and the highest wue of 5 82 kg m 3 5 54 kg m 3 which was significantly higher than other drip irrigation modes p 0 05 considering the layouts of drip irrigation pipes the yield of the w3db mode was 32 61 33 57 higher than the w3d mode 22275 23541 67 kg hm 2 p 0 05 the wue of w3db mode was significantly improved by 35 12 35 35 compared with the w3d mode 4 1 4 3 kg m 3 p 0 05 the yield 25020 83 25568 75 kg hm 2 and wue 4 67 4 71 kg m 3 of the w3r mode were increased by 6 28 14 79 and 8 6 14 88 respectively compared to the w3d mode considering only the soil moisture lower limit the yield of the w2d mode in 2018 2019 27156 25 27833 33 kg hm 2 increased by 9 91 17 09 and 18 23 21 91 compared to w1d mode and w3d mode respectively and wue 4 16 4 41 kg m 3 of the w2d mode was 12 21 13 03 higher than w1d and 7 56 higher than w3d mode only 2019 it indicated that the w3db mode was most beneficial to improve the wue and achieve the effect of saving water and increasing production fig 7 in addition compared with ck the drip irrigation modes with low irrigation amount improved fruit quality table 5 the total nitrogen content w3r soluble solids content w3d w3db and w3r and titratable acid content w3db and w3r indicators were significantly improved p 0 05 in 2019 zhen et al 2013 and li et al 2017 also confirmed this conclusion 3 5 regression analysis of the wue and the cv of soil moisture the wue of pear trees in 2018 2019 was linearly related to the cv indicating that increasing the cv was beneficial to improving wue during the construction and management of the drip irrigation system it is necessary to consider the influence of different layout methods and the lower limit of soil moisture on the soil water vapor environment to form a spatial variation condition of soil moisture that is conducive to fruit tree yield increase and quality improvement and improve wue and benefits 4 discussion soil moisture is a key factor for the growth and development of crops puértolas et al 2015 yuan et al 2003 and its distribution is affected by natural processes such as rainfall evapotranspiration soil texture and agricultural managements including irrigation modes and tillage measures etc das and binayak 2006 li et al 2008 2011 wang et al 2012 zheng et al 2019 and the difference in drip irrigation mode will cause significant difference in wue the wue is a major indicator for studying forest vegetation water resource balance etc in recent years it has become a hot spot for many scholars at home and abroad robles et al 2016 khan shahbaz et al 2020 shan 1996 xiong et al 2005 thus it is necessary to further explore the effects of different drip irrigation modes on the spatial distribution of soil moisture the cv and the wue in a research report on the spatial variability of soil moisture in sand field jujube trees zhao et al 2016 pointed out that the lower the soil moisture the stronger the spatial variability of water and this study also obtained similar results namely soil moisture content and the cv with linear correlation fig 4 the ck with the largest irrigation amount had no obvious water consumption phenomenon and the cv was very small indicating that with the soil moisture content increased aeration of the soil reduced insufficient oxygen supply capacity possible resulting in weakened plant root system vitality poor growth this conclusion was supported by scholars such as cai 2006 and guo 2019 similarly in the w1d mode due to high irrigation amount during the redistribution of soil moisture after the radial water migration to be stable the water would still moved deeper under the influence of gravity resulting in the phenomenon of high moisture content in the middle and deep layer soils only the surface of the soil was obviously water consumption and the cv values within 50 cm of the tree along with the drip irrigation pipes direction according to preliminary analysis it may be the result of the root system being given oxygen in the surface layer and the tree s absorption of water and the partial growth of the root system the surface layer is the boundary between the soil and the atmosphere the soil moisture is most sensitive to atmospheric precipitation and evaporation and the water exchange is violent compared with other modes the w2d mode showed an obvious low soil moisture content area the vertical to the direction of drip irrigation pipe within 80 cm of tree indicating that this area had strong root vitality and was more conducive to the growth of the root system by water absorption when the lower limit of the soil moisture was controlled at 60 fc there was no obvious water consumption area near the tree indicating that the soil moisture of the lower limit of 60 fc may not meet the needs of root growth and the 80 100 cm soil layer exhibited the phenomenon of low soil moisture and high cv which is mainly because the amount of irrigation was low in this case the initial concentration of the irrigation water was concentrated near the surface layer and the vertical distance of the moist peak was small thus the final amount of water could not reach the deep soil which can only be supplemented by rainfall the above mentioned aspects explained that the interannual fluctuation of deep soil moisture was large and its cv was strong also w2d had the highest yield and maximum wue compared with w1d w2d and w3d from the perspective of the growth of the root system and the wue 70 fc was the suitable soil moisture lower limit for pear trees in this study however existing reports on fruit trees proved that the appropriate lower limits of soil moisture for different fruit tree varieties were different qin 2016 and li et al 2017a 2017b pointed out that the suitable soil moisture lower limit of young apple trees was 60 fc through field experiments while li et al 2016 showed that the suitable soil moisture lower limit of young apple trees was 70 fc similarly liang et al 2009 found through experimental research that the soil moisture lower limit of grapes should be controlled at around 70 fc the reasons for the inconsistency of the study results with qin 2016 and li et al 2017a 2017b and others are unclear which may be related to the variety and age of fruit trees and may also be affected by factors such as soil texture water source and local agronomic measures compared with the w3d mode the surface water 0 40 cm of the w3db mode was both replenished by rising capillary forces and infiltrated downwards by rainfall so the surface soil was more variable which was consistent with the results of ma and ren 2005 indicating that subsurface drip irrigation can effectively improve the aeration of the soil surface facilitate the absorption of water by the root system and avoid the inefficient loss of soil moisture soil evaporation between trees due to the uniform irrigation affected by the layout of drip irrigation pipes the spatial distribution of soil moisture of w3r mode was more even and stable so the cv was smaller indicating that the ring drip irrigation pipes selection was more conducive to the uniform growth of the root system meanwhile the w3db mode had a significantly higher wue than the w3d mode p 0 05 and the w3r mode had higher wue than the w3d mode previous studies robles et al 2016 sun et al 2016 liao et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2013 also reported similar conclusions confirming the patterns of subsurface drip irrigation and ring drip irrigation can effectively increase yield and improve wue only considering the layout of drip irrigation pipe the subsurface drip irrigation and the ring drip irrigation was worth recommending 5 conclusion in this study by comparing and studying the effects of five drip irrigation modes and local traditional irrigation modes on soil moisture characteristics pear tree water consumption yield fruit quality and wue it was found that there were obvious differences in the cv characteristics of soil moisture among the five drip irrigation modes the cv and soil moisture content showed a significant linear negative correlation p 0 05 the resulting differences in soil water aeration and heat had effects on the development of fruit tree roots compared with local traditional irrigation mode the range of et was 708 39 770 24 mm five drip irrigation modes the range of et was 535 59 669 27 mm can significantly reduce et of pear trees p 0 05 and improve the wue among them the w3db mode the range of et was 536 18 537 22 mm worked best considering only the soil moisture lower limit the yield in w2d mode was increased by 9 91 17 09 and 18 23 21 91 respectively compared to w1d mode and w3d mode and wue in w2d mode was 12 21 13 04 higher than w1d mode which confirmed that the soil moisture lower limit of pear trees should be kept at 70 fc but the modes of 60 fc soil moisture lower limit can effectively improve fruit quality soluble solids titratable acid considering the layout of drip irrigation pipes the w3db mode can significantly increased the yield by 16 36 24 77 and the wue by 17 62 24 63 compared with w3r increase the yield by 32 61 33 57 and the wue is 34 39 35 35 p 0 05 compared with w3d in addition there was a positive linear relationship between the wue and the cv based on the comprehensive analysis of the effect of drip irrigation mode on fruit quality and wue we conclude that w3db subsurface drip irrigation with double lines under soil moisture lower limit of 60 fc was the best drip irrigation mode in pear orchard we provide an effective drip irrigation mode to improve the wue of pear orchards however in the subsequent research we can try to couple the optimal irrigation water limit with the optimal drip irrigation pipe layout to explore a more optimal irrigation mode author contribution l wang and w wu conceived and

10314,unreasonable layout of drip irrigation systems and inappropriate irrigation decision making methods in orchards in water scarce areas in northern china result in low water use efficiency wue in order to reveal the effect of drip irrigation mode on wue of orchards and improve efficient use of water resources this study used pear pyrus pyrifolia cv whangkeumbae as a test material to conduct a two year field irrigation experiment considering the two factors of drip irrigation pipes layout and lower limit of soil moisture five drip irrigation modes and a control treatment ck were set up by measuring the soil moisture content water consumption yield and fruit quality the effects of different drip irrigation modes on spatial coefficient of variation cv of soil moisture pear tree growth

had an effect on the development of fruit tree roots five drip irrigation modes significantly reduced the et value of pear trees and improved wue compared with ck p 0 05 among them the mode of subsurface drip irrigation with double lines under soil moisture lower limit of 60 the field capacity fc worked best considering only the soil moisture lower limit compared with 80 fc and 60 fc the wue of 70 fc increased by 13 04 7 56 12 21 respectively however the irrigation mode of 60 fc soil moisture lower limit effectively improved the fruit quality soluble solids titratable acid considering the factors of drip irrigation pipes layout subsurface drip irrigation significantly increased wue by 34 39 35 35 compared with surface drip irrigation p 0 05 and increased wue by 16 36 24 77 compared with ring drip irrigation the wue of pear tree and the cv showed a linear positive correlation considering all aspects we concluded that the mode of the subsurface drip irrigation with double lines under soil moisture lower limit of 60 fc was the best irrigation mode in pear orchard the research results provide a typical reference for further research on perennial fruit trees to improve wue keywords drip irrigation the layout of drip irrigation pipes the soil moisture lower limit water use efficiency pear 1 introduction water scarcity is a worldwide topic agricultural irrigation water accounts for 74 of the global total water consumption intrigliolo et al 2013 however with the rapid development of global population economy and cities and global warming it will inevitably lead to increased competition for water resources and reduce the water supply for agricultural irrigation frisvold and konyar 2012 piao et al 2010 therefore improving water use efficiency wue by improving irrigation technology becomes the top priority for growers to improve fruit yield quality and market competition drip irrigation as a technology that can both ensure yield and improve wue has been widely valued by scientists livellara et al 2011 reyes cabrera et al 2016 topak et al 2011 ja franco et al 2000 the application of drip irrigation in orchards is increasing worldwide bravdo and proebsting 1993 different drip irrigation pipes layouts have variable impacts on the water consumption and yield of fruit trees robles et al 2016 conducted two consecutive years of experiments on lemon trees and proposed that compared with surface drip irrigation subsurface drip irrigation could save 19 water without reducing production which could improve wue han et al 2018 compared the effects of sprinkler irrigation surface drip irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation on wue growth and yield of different varieties of apples it was proved that subsurface drip irrigation can effectively reduce water consumption by 27 37 and reduce the growth of weeds sun et al 2016 also obtained similar conclusions pointing out that subsurface drip irrigation can significantly improve the yield 10 4 16 7 wue 13 4 and quality the soluble protein content vc soluble sugar and organic acid contents of jujube trees also the drip irrigation with ring can save water by 37 and increase yield by 34 1 45 1 compared to the conventional border irrigation on apple orchards wang et al 2013 liao et al 2019a 2019b studied the water absorption characteristics of cherries and the results showed that compared with the layout of drip irrigation with parallel pipes the layout of drip irrigation with ring can effectively increase the water contribution ratio in the main root zone of cherry trees by 25 22 5 in the leaf expansion stage and maturation stage respectively addition yang et al 2013 pointed out that alternate drip irrigation had been proven to increase the wue of young pear trees by 17 1 46 1 and improve the irrigation uniformity and wue of the root zone of the trees gong et al 2004 and song et al 2008 used peach trees as experimental materials to obtain similar conclusions adjusting soil moisture content under specific drip irrigation pipes layout can significantly affect crop wue liao et al 2019a 2019b in a previous study on fruit trees guo 2006 conducted a two year water and fertilizer study on fuji apples and crisp pears and pointed out that the demand for water on fruit trees was more urgent than fertilizers there is no need to pursue high water high fertilizer and high yield at the same time in production mode there should be an optimal water productivity value for fruit trees as the soil moisture increases qin 2016 and li et al 2017a 2017b pointed out that the reference value of the suitable soil moisture lower limit of apple trees under drip irrigation is 60 field capacity fc zhang et al 2010 studied apple trees in the semi arid region of loess hills and pointed out that when the soil moisture was maintained at 60 fc 80 fc net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate of the leaves remained relatively stable liang et al 2009 found that the soil moisture lower limit of grapes should be controlled around 70 fc li et al 2016 and garcía et al 2020 also pointed out that deficit irrigation can significantly improve the wue of fruit trees and fruit quality similar results had been confirmed in many other studies indicating that proper water regulation can have a positive effect on fruit tree growth yield and wue cheng et al 2003 lei et al 1991 li et al 2001 yan et al 2011 although the predecessors have made many achievements in terms of drip irrigation pipes layout and suitable soil moisture lower limit for fruit trees especially pear trees there is relatively less research in this area under different irrigation modes drip irrigation pipes layout and soil moisture research on regulating the growth and wue of fruit trees is rare thus further research is needed to help formulate drip irrigation modes for fruit trees we took pear trees pyrus pyrifolia cv whangkeumbae as the research species the purpose were to reveal the spatial variability of soil moisture and water consumption dynamics of fruit trees under different drip irrigation modes to clarify the effects of different drip irrigation modes on fruit yield and quality and wue and to propose a suitable drip irrigation mode to provide a typical reference for improving the wue of fruit trees 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site description

hydroxide phenolphthalein titration method and vc molybdenum blue colorimetric method the average value was the final measurement value 2 5 evapotranspiration and wue pear tree water consumption et mm was estimated using the soil water balance method following eq 2 and wue kg m 3 was calculated with the following eq 3 2 et i p u d r δs 3 wue 0 1y et where et is the water consumption of the pear tree mm i is the irrigation amount mm p is the amount of precipitation mm u is the groundwater recharge amount mm because the groundwater depth is greater than 10 m so it is ignored u 0 d is the amount of deep drainage mm this test uses drip irrigation the irrigation quota is small irrigation basically does not produce leakage so d 0 r is the surface runoff mm because the test area is flat and r is negligible δs 10h θ t2 θ t1 where θ t1 and θ t2 are the average moisture content of the soil at the depth of 0 100 cm in the root zone at t1 and t2 respectively and y was the yield kg hm 2 calculated at the harvest stage 2 6 data analysis the contour distribution of soil moisture and the spatial distribution of the coefficient of variation cv were plotted in surfer 12 0 golden software colorado usa the box chart for soil moisture data distribution was drawn with originpro 2018 originlab corporation massachusetts usa and the correlation between soil moisture content and the cv between the cv and wue were also obtained from originpro 2018 the goal of this research was to study the diﬀerence between different drip irrigation modes therefore the aﬀecting factors of lower limit of soil moisture and the layout of drip irrigation pipes were assumed to be combined into one factor i e drip irrigation mode during the statistical analysis process under this assumption one way anova spss 20 0 ibm usa was used for significance tests and the differences between treatments were determined by lsd s multiple range test 3 results 3 1 distribution characteristics of soil moisture a box chart of the average soil moisture content under different drip irrigation modes during april 2018 march 2020 is displayed in fig 2 most data of soil moisture in different drip irrigation modes were within the range of 1 5 iqr interquartile range and the middle lines and mean values of soil moisture were relatively close the average soil moisture content of the 0 100 cm soil profile for different drip irrigation modes decreased in the following order ck w1d w2d w3d w3db w3r in which the mode of maximum moisture content was ck 86 13 and the mode of minimum moisture content was in w3r 69 96 with the decrease of the lower limit the average soil moisture content of different irrigation modes decreased gradually by 10 29 15 34 and fluctuations of the soil moisture data gradually increased fig 3 shows the contour distribution of the average soil moisture content under different drip irrigation modes during april 2018 march 2020 the ck had high soil moisture content in the middle and deep profile and the area of high soil moisture content was large in the wid mode the soil moisture content of the surface layer along the direction of drip irrigation pipes within 50 cm from the pear tree was significantly reduced in the w2d mode the soil moisture content within 80 cm from the pear tree on the section perpendicular to the direction of the drip irrigation pipes was low the modes of w3d w3db and w3r showed the phenomenon of low soil moisture content in the soil layer of 80 100 cm only and there were no obvious water consumption areas in the two profiles near the tree body generally with the decrease of irrigation amount the area of high soil moisture gradually decreased along the direction of the drip irrigation pipes and vertical to the direction of the drip irrigation pipes the soil moisture content of the 30 60 cm layer of each profile in different modes was relatively low indicating that this soil layer belongs to the main root zone of pear trees with densely distributed root systems and strong vigor this result is supported by previous reports chen and shao 2003 kang et al 1992 in addition ck and w1d were heavily irrigated resulting in high moisture content in the middle and deep layer the deep layer water may supplement the shallow soil moisture but this supplementation was slow so ck and w1d had irrigation water waste 3 2 characteristics of the cv of soil moisture the cv was linearly related to soil moisture fig 4 it can be seen from fig 5 that the ck only showed weak cv in the soil surface layer of 0 20 cm surface transpiration and the middle layer of 40 60 cm root concentrated distribution area the location of the cv under the w1d mode showed that the root system grows and develops mainly within 30 cm of the surface layer near the tree along the direction of the drip irrigation pipes under the w3d w3db and w3r modes the cv of each layer were larger than other modes and the cv of the 80 100 cm layer is particularly large the cv in shallow layer 0 40 cm of w3db was larger than that of w3d the cv of w3r was more uniform due to the layout of drip irrigation pipes which was more conducive to the uniform growth of the root system 3 3 water consumption of pear tree at different growth stages the water consumption of pear trees under different drip irrigation modes is shown in table 4 the results showed that the fruit growth stage was the highest water consumption rate wcr stage of pear trees and the wcr was also significantly affected by irrigation modes during the flowering stage and fruit growth stage the average daily water consumption of the ck reached 2 46 2 8 mm and 4 11 4 36 mm respectively which was significantly higher than other drip irrigation modes p 0 05 at the fruit mature stage different drip irrigation modes showed no significant difference in water consumption the possible reason may be the rainy season during this period and all modes had been fully supplemented by precipitation the wcr of w3d w3db and w3r3 was maintained at 0 83 0 97 mm at the leaf fall stage which was significantly lower than other treatments p 0 05 overwintering stage affected by air temperature fruit trees were in the dormant period the amount of evapotranspiration was very small and the stage of the lowest water consumption in the whole growth year of pear trees and there was no obvious difference in daily water consumption intensity among different modes during this stage in terms of total water consumption amount et during the growth period its et values had a positive correlation with irrigation amount ck had the largest irrigation amount and the et value reached 708 39 770 24 mm which was significantly higher than the other five drip irrigation modes p 0 05 the w3d w3db and w3r3 modes had lower irrigation amounts et values of which were reduced by 13 29 24 96 compared to w1d and w2d modes comparing to w3d w3db and w3r et of w3db was lower than that of w3d and the et value of w3r was lower than the w3d in 2018 and 2019 3 4 yield wue and fruit quality different drip irrigation modes caused significant differences in yield and wue fig 6 in 2018 and 2019 the w3db mode obtained the maximum yield of 31218 75 kg hm 2 and 29752 08 kg hm 2 and the highest wue of 5 82 kg m 3 5 54 kg m 3 which was significantly higher than other drip irrigation modes p 0 05 considering the layouts of drip irrigation pipes the yield of the w3db mode was 32 61 33 57 higher than the w3d mode 22275 23541 67 kg hm 2 p 0 05 the wue of w3db mode was significantly improved by 35 12 35 35 compared with the w3d mode 4 1 4 3 kg m 3 p 0 05 the yield 25020 83 25568 75 kg hm 2 and wue 4 67 4 71 kg m 3 of the w3r mode were increased by 6 28 14 79 and 8 6 14 88 respectively compared to the w3d mode considering only the soil moisture lower limit the yield of the w2d mode in 2018 2019 27156 25 27833 33 kg hm 2 increased by 9 91 17 09 and 18 23 21 91 compared to w1d mode and w3d mode respectively and wue 4 16 4 41 kg m 3 of the w2d mode was 12 21 13 03 higher than w1d and 7 56 higher than w3d mode only 2019 it indicated that the w3db mode was most beneficial to improve the wue and achieve the effect of saving water and increasing production fig 7 in addition compared with ck the drip irrigation modes with low irrigation amount improved fruit quality table 5 the total nitrogen content w3r soluble solids content w3d w3db and w3r and titratable acid content w3db and w3r indicators were significantly improved p 0 05 in 2019 zhen et al 2013 and li et al 2017 also confirmed this conclusion 3 5 regression analysis of the wue and the cv of soil moisture the wue of pear trees in 2018 2019 was linearly related to the cv indicating that increasing the cv was beneficial to improving wue during the construction and management of the drip irrigation system it is necessary to consider the influence of different layout methods and the lower limit of soil moisture on the soil water vapor environment to form a spatial variation condition of soil moisture that is conducive to fruit tree yield increase and quality improvement and improve wue and benefits 4 discussion soil moisture is a key factor for the growth and development of crops puértolas et al 2015 yuan et al 2003 and its distribution is affected by natural processes such as rainfall evapotranspiration soil texture and agricultural managements including irrigation modes and tillage measures etc das and binayak 2006 li et al 2008 2011 wang et al 2012 zheng et al 2019 and the difference in drip irrigation mode will cause significant difference in wue the wue is a major indicator for studying forest vegetation water resource balance etc in recent years it has become a hot spot for many scholars at home and abroad robles et al 2016 khan shahbaz et al 2020 shan 1996 xiong et al 2005 thus it is necessary to further explore the effects of different drip irrigation modes on the spatial distribution of soil moisture the cv and the wue in a research report on the spatial variability of soil moisture in sand field jujube trees zhao et al 2016 pointed out that the lower the soil moisture the stronger the spatial variability of water and this study also obtained similar results namely soil moisture content and the cv with linear correlation fig 4 the ck with the largest irrigation amount had no obvious water consumption phenomenon and the cv was very small indicating that with the soil moisture content increased aeration of the soil reduced insufficient oxygen supply capacity possible resulting in weakened plant root system vitality poor growth this conclusion was supported by scholars such as cai 2006 and guo 2019 similarly in the w1d mode due to high irrigation amount during the redistribution of soil moisture after the radial water migration to be stable the water would still moved deeper under the influence of gravity resulting in the phenomenon of high moisture content in the middle and deep layer soils only the surface of the soil was obviously water consumption and the cv values within 50 cm of the tree along with the drip irrigation pipes direction according to preliminary analysis it may be the result of the root system being given oxygen in the surface layer and the tree s absorption of water and the partial growth of the root system the surface layer is the boundary between the soil and the atmosphere the soil moisture is most sensitive to atmospheric precipitation and evaporation and the water exchange is violent compared with other modes the w2d mode showed an obvious low soil moisture content area the vertical to the direction of drip irrigation pipe within 80 cm of tree indicating that this area had strong root vitality and was more conducive to the growth of the root system by water absorption when the lower limit of the soil moisture was controlled at 60 fc there was no obvious water consumption area near the tree indicating that the soil moisture of the lower limit of 60 fc may not meet the needs of root growth and the 80 100 cm soil layer exhibited the phenomenon of low soil moisture and high cv which is mainly because the amount of irrigation was low in this case the initial concentration of the irrigation water was concentrated near the surface layer and the vertical distance of the moist peak was small thus the final amount of water could not reach the deep soil which can only be supplemented by rainfall the above mentioned aspects explained that the interannual fluctuation of deep soil moisture was large and its cv was strong also w2d had the highest yield and maximum wue compared with w1d w2d and w3d from the perspective of the growth of the root system and the wue 70 fc was the suitable soil moisture lower limit for pear trees in this study however existing reports on fruit trees proved that the appropriate lower limits of soil moisture for different fruit tree varieties were different qin 2016 and li et al 2017a 2017b pointed out that the suitable soil moisture lower limit of young apple trees was 60 fc through field experiments while li et al 2016 showed that the suitable soil moisture lower limit of young apple trees was 70 fc similarly liang et al 2009 found through experimental research that the soil moisture lower limit of grapes should be controlled at around 70 fc the reasons for the inconsistency of the study results with qin 2016 and li et al 2017a 2017b and others are unclear which may be related to the variety and age of fruit trees and may also be affected by factors such as soil texture water source and local agronomic measures compared with the w3d mode the surface water 0 40 cm of the w3db mode was both replenished by rising capillary forces and infiltrated downwards by rainfall so the surface soil was more variable which was consistent with the results of ma and ren 2005 indicating that subsurface drip irrigation can effectively improve the aeration of the soil surface facilitate the absorption of water by the root system and avoid the inefficient loss of soil moisture soil evaporation between trees due to the uniform irrigation affected by the layout of drip irrigation pipes the spatial distribution of soil moisture of w3r mode was more even and stable so the cv was smaller indicating that the ring drip irrigation pipes selection was more conducive to the uniform growth of the root system meanwhile the w3db mode had a significantly higher wue than the w3d mode p 0 05 and the w3r mode had higher wue than the w3d mode previous studies robles et al 2016 sun et al 2016 liao et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2013 also reported similar conclusions confirming the patterns of subsurface drip irrigation and ring drip irrigation can effectively increase yield and improve wue only considering the layout of drip irrigation pipe the subsurface drip irrigation and the ring drip irrigation was worth recommending 5 conclusion in this study by comparing and studying the effects of five drip irrigation modes and local traditional irrigation modes on soil moisture characteristics pear tree water consumption yield fruit quality and wue it was found that there were obvious differences in the cv characteristics of soil moisture among the five drip irrigation modes the cv and soil moisture content showed a significant linear negative correlation p 0 05 the resulting differences in soil water aeration and heat had effects on the development of fruit tree roots compared with local traditional irrigation mode the range of et was 708 39 770 24 mm five drip irrigation modes the range of et was 535 59 669 27 mm can significantly reduce et of pear trees p 0 05 and improve the wue among them the w3db mode the range of et was 536 18 537 22 mm worked best considering only the soil moisture lower limit the yield in w2d mode was increased by 9 91 17 09 and 18 23 21 91 respectively compared to w1d mode and w3d mode and wue in w2d mode was 12 21 13 04 higher than w1d mode which confirmed that the soil moisture lower limit of pear trees should be kept at 70 fc but the modes of 60 fc soil moisture lower limit can effectively improve fruit quality soluble solids titratable acid considering the layout of drip irrigation pipes the w3db mode can significantly increased the yield by 16 36 24 77 and the wue by 17 62 24 63 compared with w3r increase the yield by 32 61 33 57 and the wue is 34 39 35 35 p 0 05 compared with w3d in addition there was a positive linear relationship between the wue and the cv based on the comprehensive analysis of the effect of drip irrigation mode on fruit quality and wue we conclude that w3db subsurface drip irrigation with double lines under soil moisture lower limit of 60 fc was the best drip irrigation mode in pear orchard we provide an effective drip irrigation mode to improve the wue of pear orchards however in the subsequent research we can try to couple the optimal irrigation water limit with the optimal drip irrigation pipe layout to explore a more optimal irrigation mode author contribution l wang and w wu conceived and
