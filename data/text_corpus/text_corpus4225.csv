21125,thrust efficiency induced pressure on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface of five conventional propellers and twenty eight tandem propellers were studied comprehensively by numerical method to assess the ability of two different types of propellers in dealing with efficiency cavitation vibration and noise problems the flow field was simulated by solving rans equations with sst k ω turbulence model for the conventional propellers the effect of disk ratio and number of blades was investigated for the tandem propellers the vortex blade interaction and effect of blade phase angle and diameter ratio were studied then a comparison was made between new tandem propellers and conventional propellers results show that compared with the conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more blades the efficiency of the tandem propeller is much higher in most working conditions the induced pressure is comparable and cavitation performance is a little bit worse compared with the conventional propeller with smaller disk ratio and fewer blades although the tandem propeller has relatively lower efficiency the induced pressure is significantly reduced and cavitation is improved obviously the study shows that the new tandem propeller has more advantages and potentials than the conventional propeller in dealing with these problems keywords marine propellers tandem propellers open water performance exciting forces cavitation numerical simulation 1 introduction to save shipping costs the ship s main dimension and deadweight increase obviously but the diameter of marine propellers is often limited by the depth of waterways and ports as a result the propeller is often overloaded when functioning in this context cavitation stern vibration and noise problems related to marine propellers become more and more prominent which have attracted extensive attention ittc 2017 as known the conventional propeller has simple structures and high efficiency which is the most widely used propulsion in ship and ocean engineering generally the conventional propeller with high efficiency has smaller disk ratio and fewer number of blades but these propellers are not good at dealing with cavitation stern vibration and noise problems based on existing theories sheng 2019 increasing disk ratio can reduce the load per unit area on blade surface which is beneficial for reducing cavitation increasing the number of blades can diminish the propeller induced pressure on hull surface which is beneficial for stern vibration and noise radiation reduction however with the increase of disk ratio and blade numbers the interaction between adjacent blades intensifies and the ability of fluid passing through the propeller disk plane is weakened which may lead to a decrease of the efficiency to some extent therefore to reduce the side effect of blade interactions on efficiency we proposed to put the blades originally distributed at one plane into two different planes so the disk area and number of blades at each plane are reduced significantly which may improve the efficiency and also retains the main advantages of the conventional propeller with more blades and larger disk ratio actually the new structure is known as the tandem propeller compared with the conventional propeller although the tandem propeller has some disadvantages longer shaft heavier structure higher manufacture cost et al it is famous for the ability to handle severe stern structural vibrations caused by propeller induced pressures sheng 2019 sun et al 1980 1983 fig 1 presents a six bladed conventional propeller au6 60 and a tandem propeller consisting of two three bladed conventional propellers au3 30 notice that the conventional propeller and the tandem propeller have the same blade number and disk ratio for the tandem propeller the blade located in the upstream plane is called the front propeller front p and the downstream blade is called the rear propeller rear p in fig 1 l is the axial distance between the front and rear propellers and θ is the delayed phase angle of the rear propeller s blade compared with corresponding blade of the front propeller in our previous study yao et al 2020 we have conducted large numbers of numerical simulations to investigate the effect of diameter ratio d d blade phase angle θ and axial distance l on the open water performance of tandem propellers and made a comparison of the performance between the new canard tandem propeller and the traditional tandem propeller d and d are the diameter of the front and rear propellers respectively however the performance of the new canard tandem propeller has never been compared with that of the most widely used conventional propeller which is important to assess the ability of the new tandem propeller in addition the propeller induced pressure on hull surface which is the main cause of stern vibrations and noise radiation has not been investigated therefore it is necessary to investigate the induced pressures by the new tandem propeller for a surface ship the stern post which connects the bottom keel with the stern plate is not horizontal the red dotted line in fig 2 for a traditional tandem propeller because the diameter of the front propeller and the rear propeller are the same the distance between the front propeller and the stern post may be much smaller than that between the rear propeller and the stern post s 1 s 2 the smaller spacing may lead to a sharp increase of the propeller induced pressure if the canard tandem propeller is applied because the diameter of the front propeller is smaller there is a larger distance between the front propeller and the stern post s 3 s 1 a larger distance is beneficial for reducing the propeller induced pressure on hull surface as discussed the new canard tandem propeller may have more advantages in comprehensively dealing with efficiency cavitation vibration and noise problems than the conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more number of blades therefore a direct and comprehensive comparison of the hydrodynamic performance between the new canard tandem propeller and the conventional propeller is urgently needed and the results are important for the development of tandem propellers to explore propeller open water performance induced fluctuating pressure on hull surface and pressure distribution on blade surface of a marine propeller methods such as model tests potential flow calculations and numerical simulations can be used in the early stage the research on tandem propellers mainly depends on model tests he et al 2015 sun et al 1979 1986 marlin 1968 titoff and biskup 1966 however the cost of a model test is relatively high considering that the hydrodynamic performance of tandem propellers is much more complex which is related to multiple geometric parameters and the combination of these parameters to save costs most of the existing model tests on tandem propellers is not comprehensive in the selection of geometric parameters the potential method is based on the assumption that the fluid is non viscous hou et al 2014 tried to apply the panel method for the prediction of steady hydrodynamic performance of tandem propellers and found that the accuracy of the method is acceptable recently the development of numerical simulation methods provides a reliable auxiliary means for the study of propeller hydrodynamic problems di mascio et al 2014 wang et al 2017 dubbioso et al 2013 muscari et al 2017 some scholars have tried to use different numerical simulation methods to study the open water performance and cavitation problems of the tandem propeller yu 2014 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 du and zhang 2018 koronowicz et al 2010 boucetta and imine 2017 2019 liu and gong 2020 in the past few years the authors have accumulated a certain experience on the numerical study of marine propellers concerning different hydrodynamic problems yao and zhang 2017 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d zhang and jaiman 2019 yao et al 2020 such as the transition flow over model propeller blades open water performance and the scale effects propeller exciting forces tip vortex flow noise of conventional propellers wake field of ducted propellers and hydrodynamic performance of tandem propellers et al which laid a solid foundation for the present study according to accumulated experience as for the prediction of propeller open water performance solving rans equations is a good choice because the accuracy is enough and the cost is acceptable for general workstations the commonly used turbulence models is the sst k ω model which combines the advantages of k ε and standard k ω models moving reference frame model simulates the rotating motion of the propeller by setting a rotating reference frame which is only suitable for a steady state simulation sliding mesh model can simulate the real rotating motion of the propeller which is often used in a transient simulation therefore in this study by solving rans equations with sst k ω turbulence model a steady state simulation of the flow field around the propeller was conducted to obtain propeller performance in open water then the flow field obtained from the steady state simulation is used as initial field conditions for a transient simulation in which we can obtain time history of propeller induced pressures on hull surface based on this simple method we carried out a comprehensive study on the hydrodynamics of five conventional propellers and twenty four tandem propellers the content of this study is divided into three parts in the first part five conventional propellers with different disk ratios and different number of blades were designed and the effect of disk ratio and number of blades on propeller thrust efficiency induced pressures on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface was investigated in the second part the effect of vortex blade interaction on the efficiency of the tandem propeller was investigated after that we focused on the effect of blade phase angle and diameter ratio on the induced pressure by the tandem propeller and the negative pressure distribution on blade surface in the third part two conventional propellers au3 30 and au6 60 and a new canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 θ 60 with relatively high performance were selected for a comparison on this basis the advantages and disadvantages of the conventional propeller and the new tandem propeller on the comprehensive treatment of efficiency cavitation vibration and noise radiation problems are discussed 2 propeller models computational domain and numerical methods 2 1 propeller models for conventional propellers to investigate the effect of disk ratio and blade numbers on the open water performance induced pressure on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface five au series conventional propellers with different number of blades and different disk ratios are designed fig 3 and the main particulars of these propellers are listed in table 1 twenty four tandem propellers including eight traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 and sixteen canard tandem propellers d d 1 0 are designed the tandem propeller is made of two three bladed conventional propellers au3 30 the values of three important geometric parameters are listed in table 2 model geometries of two traditional tandem propellers and four canard tandem propellers are presented in fig 4 as known the space for propeller installation is very limited due to the exists of ship stern and rudder fig 2 so the allowable variation range of the spacing between the front and rear propellers is small moreover based on the results of our previous study yao et al 2020 the axial distance between the front and rear propellers is set as 0 2d in this study 2 2 computational domain fig 5 presents an overview of the entire computational domain with boundary conditions and meshing skills the diameter of the entire domain is 10 times that of the rear propeller a small cylindrical region was designed which is the rotation domain the rest of the domain maintains static the distance between the propeller and the velocity inlet boundary is 3d the outlet boundary is set to the pressure outlet condition sliding wall boundary is applied to ignore the influence of wall to simulate the flow field around the propeller and predict open water performance and the induced pressures on hull surface the mesh near the propeller needs to be refined as shown in fig 5 in addition twenty layers of cells are designed within the boundary layer to guarantee that the flow field near the blade surface are resolved accurately the height of the first layer cell near blade surface was determined for the purpose of making the averaged wall y value being less than 1 2 3 numerical methods 2 3 1 steady state simulation for obtaining propeller open water performance a steady state simulation of the propeller at six advance coefficients table 3 was conducted to obtain open water performance curves moving reference frame model was applied for simulating the motion of the propeller a segregated flow solver was used to solve the governing equations the number of iterations is initially set as 1000 times for each working condition during the simulation several criteria were used for convergence judgement for example the variation of values of residuals and physical quantities with iteration and the development of flow field a detailed introduction of the convergence judgement can be found in our previous study yao et al 2020 2 3 2 transient simulation for time history of propeller induced pressure a transient numerical simulation was conducted to obtain time history of propeller induced pressures on hull surface sliding mesh technology was applied to simulate the rotating propeller an implicit solver and the second order temporal discretization were applied for solving the unsteady governing equations according to accumulated experience the time step is set to the time of the propeller rotating one degree which guarantees that the numerical result is independent of the time step the number of iterations in each time step is 10 the total physical time is 0 5 s so the propeller rotates 7 5 revolutions at the speed of 15 rps revolution per second the initial condition for the transient simulation is the flow field obtained by previous steady state simulations to focus on the characteristics of the induced pressure caused by the two different types of propellers the complex interference between the stern and a rotating propeller is not considered a plate is placed above the propeller which represents the hull surface several pressure gauges are set on the plate to receive propeller induced pressures this method is classic and useful which is often used in model tests and numerical simulations for the purpose of simplifying problems therefore twelve pressure gauges along with the stern post are set to obtain propeller induced pressures in the simulation of the propeller in open water the positions and coordinates of the twelve pressure gauges are presented in fig 6 and table 4 respectively in the figure the disk planes of the front propeller and the rear propeller correspond to two cross sections passing through p3 and p1 respectively while in the simulation of conventional propellers the plane of the propeller is located in the cross section passing through p2 to show the relation between the induced pressure on hull surface and the position of propeller blades an angle α is defined in fig 7 for the following discussions 2 3 3 grid sensitivity and accuracy study note that the steady state numerical method in this study is the same with that used in our previous publication yao et al 2020 where a detailed information about the grid sensitivity and accuracy study of the numerical method can be found as for the transient simulation method open water performance of a tandem propeller d d 1 0 θ 0 with the working conditions in table 3 was predicted the numerical results and available experimental data sun et al 1983 are presented in table 5 the maximum difference between the results of transient simulations and experimental data is 2 4 in efficiency when j 0 2 which shows clearly that the results predicted by the two numerical methods are basically the same and also quite close to experimental data the comparison demonstrates the accuracy of the transient numerical simulation method 3 results and discussions 3 1 conventional propellers 3 1 1 effect of blade number and disk ratio on propeller open water performance fig 8 presents numerical results of open water performance of the five conventional propellers the data are also provided in table 6 and table 7 it is clear that both the thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q of the propeller increase obviously with the increase of disk ratio and number of blades at any advance coefficient but the efficiency decreases when the advance coefficient is small the decline of efficiency is not obvious as the advance coefficient increases the efficiency decline is getting more and more prominent table 8 lists a comparison of the efficiency between the three bladed propeller au3 30 and the six bladed propeller au6 60 the comparison shows that the maximum efficiency can be reduced up to 8 04 of course the difference between the efficiency of au3 30 and au7 70 is even greater which is not provided in the table 3 1 2 effect of blade number and disk ratio on propeller induced pressure since the propeller induced pressure on hull surface is directly related to the load of the whole propeller to make a fair comparison it is necessary to adjust the working condition of the propeller to ensure that the load of each propeller is basically the same table 9 lists the new working condition for each propeller which is determined using the linear interpolation method based on large numbers of simulations during the process the inflow velocity remains the same and the rotating speed of the propeller is adjusted to generate the same thrust the thrust and torque of the five propellers at new working conditions are presented in table 9 it is clear that the difference in thrust is less than 1 and the difference in torque is less than 4 based on the results it can be considered that the load of each propeller is basically the same fig 9 presents the time history of pressures received at twelve gauges induced by the conventional propeller au6 60 in two revolutions non dimensional pressure is defined as c p p 2ρv 2 where p is the received gauge pressure ρ is the water density and v is the advance velocity it is clear that for the three gauges at the same cross section the amplitudes of the three pressure signals are basically the same except for a small difference in their phases therefore in the following discussions only the pressures received at the four gauges in the central longitudinal plane are discussed from fig 9 it is also clear that the maximum pressure appears in upstream of the propeller s plane not right above the propeller and the induced pressure downstream of the propeller is small fig 10 shows the time history of pressures received at the four gauges in the central longitudinal plane induced by au3 30 au4 40 au6 60 and au7 70 in two revolutions for the three bladed propeller au3 30 the difference between the four pressure signals is quite significant with the increase of disk ratio and number of blades such difference is getting smaller more importantly it is quite clear that the maximum pressure induced by the propeller au3 30 is much larger than that induced by the propeller au7 70 fig 11 presents a comparison of the amplitudes of the induced pressure by the five conventional propellers at two main characteristic frequencies the blade passing frequency bpf and the double blade passing frequency 2bpf first the induced pressure at p3 is the largest among the four gauges which is upstream of the propeller second it is clear that the amplitudes of the pressure of 2bpf component are much smaller than that of the bpf component third with the increase of disk ratio and blade numbers the propeller induced pressures received at all gauges are decreasing the reason may be that when the load on the whole propeller keeps the same the increase of disk ratio and blade number reduces the load on each blade which is beneficial for reducing propeller induced pressure on hull surface the study shows that the method to reduce the propeller induced pressure by increasing disk ratio and blade numbers is very effective 3 1 3 negative pressure distribution on the blade surface fig 12 presents the negative pressure distribution on the blade surface of five conventional propellers new working condition of each propeller to generate the same thrust is listed in table 9 it is quite clear that with the increase of disk ratio and blade numbers the minimum pressure on the suction side of the blade is increasing and the area of the surface with negative pressure is decreasing which means that the propeller cavitation is reduced according to the saturation vapor pressure theory ge et al 2020 3 2 tandem propellers 3 2 1 effect of vortex blade interaction on propeller open water performance according to the old theory sun et al 1983 which is based on the study of traditional tandem propellers the efficiency of the tandem propeller is basically determined by vortex blade interactions the efficiency is greatest when the blade phase angle makes the rear blade right in the middle of two adjacent tip vortices shedding from the front propeller s blades while the efficiency is minimal when the rear blade is located right at the position of the tip vortex from the front propeller s blade fig 13 presents the effect of blade phase angle θ on the efficiency of tandem propellers with different diameter ratios at different advance coefficients figs 14 16 present the vortex structures of the tandem propeller at several specific blade phase angles using the q criterion yao and zhang 2018d from fig 13 for the conventional propeller d d 1 0 when j 1 0 the efficiency of the tandem propeller is greatest when θ is close to 0 and the efficiency is minimal when θ is close to 60 then let us pay attention to fig 16 when d d 1 0 and θ 0 the rear propeller blade is located right in the middle of two adjacent vortices shedding from the front propeller while when d d 1 0 and θ 60 the rear propeller blade is located right at the position of the vertex from the front propeller s blade therefore the numerical results seem to be consistent with the old theory however when we check the results at other working conditions we find that the old theory is not always right for example when j 0 6 from fig 15 the traditional tandem propeller with the blade phase angle of 15 is supposed to have the highest efficiency based on the old theory but from fig 13 the highest efficiency appears when θ 115 another important finding is that for the tandem propeller with different diameter ratios at the same advance coefficient the variation of the efficiency with blade phase angle is different but we find that the change of the blade phase angle with the maximum and minimum efficiency has some kind of migration rule let us pay attention to the case when j 1 0 fig 13 when d d 1 0 the blade phase angle corresponding to the maximum efficiency is 0 and that of the lowest efficiency is 60 when d d 0 9 the blade phase angle corresponding to the maximum efficiency is 15 and that of the lowest efficiency is 75 when d d 0 8 the blade phase angle corresponding to the maximum efficiency is 30 and that of the lowest efficiency is close to 90 the same migration rule can also be found for the propeller working at other advance coefficients the results show that the vortex blade interaction is not only related to the blade phase angle but also to the diameter ratio besides considering that the change of the blade phase angle changes the relative position of the front and rear blades the blade blade interaction also changes which will affect the performance therefore for tandem propellers the vortex blade interaction and the blade blade interaction are closely related studying one of them separately cannot clearly explain the complex phenomenon the interference between the two complex interactions and the effect need to be further clarified 3 2 2 effect of diameter ratio and blade phase angle on propeller induced pressure six tandem propellers including two traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 and four new canard tandem propellers d d 1 0 are selected to investigate propeller induced pressure on hull surface table 10 in this study two limiting cases of the blade phase angles 0 and 60 for the tandem propeller consisting of two three bladed conventional propellers are selected for the study on the effect of blade phase angle the reason is that when θ 0 the circumferential positions of the front propeller s blades and the rear propeller s blades are exactly the same while when θ 60 all six blades of the tandem propeller are uniformly distributed in the circumferential direction which may be beneficial to reduce propeller induced pressures on hull surface in addition since the propeller induced pressure is directly related to the load of the propeller to make a fair comparison it is necessary to adjust the working condition of each propeller see table 10 so the thrust and torque of each propeller are basically the same see table 11 and table 12 fig 17 presents the load distribution on the front and rear propellers of the tandem propeller with different diameter ratios and different blade phase angles it is clear that the effect of blade phase angle on the load distribution of the front and rear propellers is small while the effect of diameter ratio is significant for the traditional tandem propeller d d 1 0 the load on the front propeller is much greater than that on the rear propeller with the decrease of the front propeller s diameter the load distribution on the front and rear propellers changes for the canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 the load on the rear propeller is slightly greater than that of the front propeller for the tandem propeller when d d 0 8 the load on the rear propeller is much greater than that of the front propeller this study shows that the load shifts from the front propeller to the rear propeller when reducing the front propeller s diameter fig 18 shows the time history of the induced pressures at the four gauges by two sets of tandem propellers with different blade phase angles 0 and 60 in two revolutions generally as for the two traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 it is clear that the induced pressure received at upstream gauges is greater than that at the downstream gauges and the gauge with the maximum pressure is p4 however as for the canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 the pressures at the four gauges show different patterns more importantly it is quite clear that the amplitude of the pressure induced by the tandem propeller when θ 0 is much greater than that induced by the tandem propeller when θ 60 fig 19 presents the effect of blade phase angle on the induced pressure of the tandem propeller as for the two traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 when the blade phase angle θ changes from 0 to 60 the amplitudes of the induced pressures at bpf are significantly reduced similarly as for the canard tandem propellers when d d 0 9 the amplitudes of the pressures at bpf induced by the tandem propeller when θ 60 are much smaller than that by the tandem propeller when θ 0 note that as for the canard tandem propeller when d d 0 8 the effect on reducing the induced pressures by changing the blade phase angle is relatively small the reason maybe that the load on the front propeller is much smaller than that of the rear propeller see fig 17 so the induced pressure is mainly caused by the rear propeller overall the propeller induced pressures on hull surface can be significantly reduced by making all blades of the tandem propeller evenly distributed in the circumferential direction in addition the effect of the blade phase angle on the propeller induced pressure at 2bpf is negligible fig 20 presents the effect of diameter ratio on the induced pressures by the tandem propeller when θ 0 it is clear that when the diameter of the front propeller decreases although the pressure received at p1 and p2 increases the pressure at p4 is significantly reduced so the maximum pressure decreases the results demonstrate that the effect of reducing the front propeller s diameter to some extent on reducing the induced pressures on hull surface by tandem propellers when θ 0 is obvious however the situation is a little bit different for the tandem propellers when θ 60 and the results are presented in fig 21 for gauges p1 p2 and p3 the amplitudes of the pressures at bpf is increasing but the pressure at p4 is decreasing in this situation the effect of reducing the front propeller s diameter is not obvious on the contrary a further reduction of the front propeller s diameter may increase the induced pressure the reason is that when θ 60 the load is distributed relatively evenly in the circumferential direction when d d 1 0 and the reduction of the front propeller s diameter results in unevenly load on all blades and heavier load on the rear propeller 3 2 3 negative pressure on blade surface fig 22 presents the effect of diameter ratio and blade phase angle on the negative pressure over the tandem propeller s blade surface generally for the two traditional tandem propellers the negative pressure on the front propeller s blade surface is much lower which suggests that cavitation is more likely to occur on the front propeller when the diameter of the front propeller decreases the load on the rear propeller is increasing which suggests that the cavitation will mainly occur on the rear propeller considering that the bubbles shedding from the front propeller blade may affect the cavitation of the rear propeller we believe that the best situation is that the front propeller bears the maximum load under the condition that no cavitation occurs in this case the cavitation on the rear propeller is better than that on a single propeller in addition from the figure the effect of blade phase angle on the negative pressure on blade surface is small but this does not mean that the effect on the actual cavitation can be ignored because the cavitation interference between the front and rear propellers is also related to their relative positions which are determined by the blade phase angle and other parameters 3 3 comparison between new canard tandem propellers and conventional propellers in the following sections a comparison was made on the open water performance induced pressures on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface of three propellers including a selected new canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 θ 60 a conventional propeller au3 30 with smaller disk ratio and fewer blades a conventional propeller au6 60 with larger disk ratio and more blades 3 3 1 comparison of open water performance fig 23 shows the thrust and torque coefficients efficiency of the three propellers at different advance coefficients it is clear that at most advance coefficients the thrust and torque coefficients of the tandem propeller are greater than that of au3 30 but smaller than that of au6 60 more importantly the comparison on efficiency of the three propellers is interesting when the advance coefficient is small j 0 2 namely the propeller being heavily loaded the efficiency of the tandem propeller is much greater than that of au6 60 and is even greater than that of au3 30 therefore for some ships like the tugboat the propeller is often work under such small advance coefficients and the advantage of the tandem propeller is obvious when the propeller working at a medium advance coefficient j 0 6 although the efficiency of the tandem propeller is smaller than au3 30 it is still much greater than that of au6 60 when the propeller works at a high advance coefficient j 1 0 the efficiency of the tandem propeller is comparable to that of au6 60 only when the propeller works at an extremely high advance coefficient j 1 2 the efficiency of the tandem propeller is smaller than that of au6 60 this study shows that the efficiency of the tandem propeller is usually smaller than that of the conventional propeller with smaller disk ratio and fewer blade numbers but it is greater than that of the conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more blades at most advance coefficients j 3 3 2 comparison of propeller induced pressure fig 24 shows the amplitudes of the induced pressure at bpf and 2bpf by the three propellers first a comparison between the tandem propeller and the conventional propeller au3 30 was made it is quite clear that the induced pressures at bpf by the canard tandem propeller are much smaller than that induced by au3 30 although the amplitude at 2bpf of the two propellers are close the amplitudes at 2bpf are much smaller than that at bpf in addition the position of the maximum pressure is also different second let us focus on the comparison between the tandem propeller and the conventional propeller au6 60 the amplitudes of the induced pressure at bpf by the tandem propeller are comparable to that of au6 60 but the amplitude of 2bpf component is much greater which sometimes needs special attention 3 3 3 comparison of negative pressure on blade surface fig 25 presents the negative pressure distribution on blade surface of the three selected propellers it is clear that compared with au3 30 the negative pressure distribution on blade surface of the canard tandem propeller is improved the minimum pressure increases and the area of negative pressure decreases significantly however the comparison between the tandem propeller with the conventional propeller au6 60 reveals that the cavitation of the tandem propeller is a little bit worse than that of au6 60 the reason is that when the two propellers generate the same thrust for the conventional propeller the load on each blades is the same and for the canard tandem propeller the reduction of the front propeller s diameter may result in the load of the rear propeller being greater than that of the front propeller which may cause cavitation on the rear propeller therefore the best situation for improve cavitation is to make sure that the front and rear propellers bear the same load besides for the tandem propeller when θ 60 due to the influence of tip vortices shedding from the front propeller the minimum pressure on the rear propeller may decrease which may also affect propeller cavitation 4 conclusion by solving rans equations with sst k ω turbulence model using the star ccm solver a steady state simulation of the flow field around the propeller was conducted to obtain propeller open water performance and a transient numerical simulation was conducted to predict the fluctuating pressures on hull surface induced by a rotating propeller based on this simple method we carried out a comprehensive study on the hydrodynamics of five conventional propellers and twenty four tandem propellers the effect of variety of factors on propeller performance induced pressures on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface was discussed eventually we made a comprehensive comparison of thrust efficiency exciting forces and cavitation between new canard tandem propellers and conventional propellers 1 for the conventional propeller at any advance coefficient with the increase of disk ratio and number of blades the thrust of the propeller increases but the efficiency reduction is quite obvious especially at high advance coefficients the propeller induced pressure on hull surface is significantly reduced and propeller cavitation is also improved according to the saturation vapor pressure theory 2 for the tandem propeller the effect of blade phase angle on the performance is complicated the vortex blade interaction will affect the efficiency but the old theory about the optimum blade phase angle for the greatest efficiency is not always right a migration rule was found about the optimum blade phase angle for high efficiency which is the function of diameter ratio and advance coefficient as for the induced pressure on hull surface when the blade phase angle is 60 the propeller induced pressure is much smaller than that of the tandem propeller when the blade phase angle is 0 in addition when the blade phase angle is 0 the induced pressure decreases significantly with the decrease of the front propeller s diameter while when the blade phase angle is 60 the effect of reducing the front propeller s diameter on the induced pressure is not obvious as for the study of negative pressure distribution on blade surface propeller cavitation is improved when the front propeller diameter is reduced based on the analysis but it is important to note that the diameter of the front propeller should not be too small 3 for the comparison of the three propellers efficiency at a small advance coefficient j 0 2 the canard tandem propeller has the highest efficiency at a medium advance coefficient j 0 6 the efficiency of the canard tandem propeller is still higher than that of au6 60 at a high advance coefficient j 1 0 the efficiency is still comparable to that of au6 60 only at an extremely high advance coefficient j 1 2 the efficiency is still lower than au6 60 generally in most cases the canard tandem propeller is more efficient than the conventional propeller with more blades and larger disk ratio 4 for the comparison of induced pressure on hull surface by the three propellers the induced pressures by the canard tandem propeller are much smaller than that induced by au3 30 the induced pressure at bpf by the canard tandem propeller and au6 60 are basically the same but the amplitudes of the pressure at 2bpf induced by the canard tandem propeller is greater than that by au6 60 which also needs to be noticed 5 based on the comparison of negative pressure distribution on blade surface of the three propellers the cavitation of the canard tandem propeller may be much less than that of au3 30 but a little bit more than that of au6 60 the conclusion is reached based on the negative pressure on blade surface according to the saturation vapor pressure theory here it is important to point out that the cavitation of the tandem propeller may be much more complicated due to the interaction between the front and rear propellers and also the vortex blade interaction generally it is important to note that the complicated interference between the front and rear propellers is far from clear so there is still much room for efficiency improvement of the tandem propellers in this paper only a canard tandem propeller with relatively good performance was selected for the comparison with two commonly used conventional propellers which have been developed very maturely even so the results of the comparison already show that the tandem propeller has more advantages and potential in the comprehensive treatment of efficiency cavitation vibration and noise problems over the conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more number of blades as pointed out in this study a further investigation on the vortex blade interaction and the blade blade interaction is needed credit authorship

21125,thrust efficiency induced pressure on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface of five conventional propellers and twenty eight tandem propellers were studied

conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more blades the efficiency of the tandem propeller is much higher in most working conditions the induced pressure is comparable and cavitation performance is a little bit worse compared with the conventional propeller with smaller disk ratio and fewer blades although the tandem propeller has relatively lower efficiency the induced pressure is significantly reduced and cavitation is improved obviously the study shows that the new tandem propeller has more advantages and potentials than the conventional propeller in dealing with these problems keywords marine propellers tandem propellers open water performance exciting forces cavitation numerical simulation 1 introduction to save shipping costs the ship s main dimension and deadweight increase obviously but the diameter of marine propellers is often limited by the depth of waterways and ports as a result the propeller is often overloaded when functioning in this context cavitation stern vibration and noise problems related to marine propellers become more and more prominent which have attracted extensive attention ittc 2017 as known the conventional propeller has simple structures and high efficiency which is the most widely used propulsion in ship and ocean engineering generally the conventional propeller with high efficiency has smaller disk ratio and fewer number of blades but these propellers are not good at dealing with cavitation stern vibration and noise problems based on existing theories sheng 2019 increasing disk ratio can reduce the load per unit area on blade surface which is beneficial for reducing cavitation increasing the number of blades can diminish the propeller induced pressure on hull surface which is beneficial for stern vibration and noise radiation reduction however with the increase of disk ratio and blade numbers the interaction between adjacent blades intensifies and the ability of fluid passing through the propeller disk plane is weakened which may lead to a decrease of the efficiency to some extent therefore to reduce the side effect of blade interactions on efficiency we proposed to put the blades originally distributed at one plane into two different planes so the disk area and number of blades at each plane are reduced significantly which may improve the efficiency and also retains the main advantages of the conventional propeller with more blades and larger disk ratio actually the new structure is known as the tandem propeller compared with the conventional propeller although the tandem propeller has some disadvantages longer shaft heavier structure higher manufacture cost et al it is famous for the ability to handle severe stern structural vibrations caused by propeller induced pressures sheng 2019 sun et al 1980 1983 fig 1 presents a six bladed conventional propeller au6 60 and a tandem propeller consisting of two three bladed conventional propellers au3 30 notice that the conventional propeller and the tandem propeller have the same blade number and disk ratio for the tandem propeller the blade located in the upstream plane is called the front propeller front p and the downstream blade is called the rear propeller rear p in fig 1 l is the axial distance between the front and rear propellers and θ is the delayed phase angle of the rear propeller s blade compared with corresponding blade of the front propeller in our previous study yao et al 2020 we have conducted large numbers of numerical simulations to investigate the effect of diameter ratio d d blade phase angle θ and axial distance l on the open water performance of tandem propellers and made a comparison of the performance between the new canard tandem propeller and the traditional tandem propeller d and d are the diameter of the front and rear propellers respectively however the performance of the new canard tandem propeller has never been compared with that of the most widely used conventional propeller which is important to assess the ability of the new tandem propeller in addition the propeller induced pressure on hull surface which is the main cause of stern vibrations and noise radiation has not been investigated therefore it is necessary to investigate the induced pressures by the new tandem propeller for a surface ship the stern post which connects the bottom keel with the stern plate is not horizontal the red dotted line in fig 2 for a traditional tandem propeller because the diameter of the front propeller and the rear propeller are the same the distance between the front propeller and the stern post may be much smaller than that between the rear propeller and the stern post s 1 s 2 the smaller spacing may lead to a sharp increase of the propeller induced pressure if the canard tandem propeller is applied because the diameter of the front propeller is smaller there is a larger distance between the front propeller and the stern post s 3 s 1 a larger distance is beneficial for reducing the propeller induced pressure on hull surface as discussed the new canard tandem propeller may have more advantages in comprehensively dealing with efficiency cavitation vibration and noise problems than the conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more number of blades therefore a direct and comprehensive comparison of the hydrodynamic performance between the new canard tandem propeller and the conventional propeller is urgently needed and the results are important for the development of tandem propellers to explore propeller open water performance induced fluctuating pressure on hull surface and pressure distribution on blade surface of a marine propeller methods such as model tests potential flow calculations and numerical simulations can be used in the early stage the research on tandem propellers mainly depends on model tests he et al 2015 sun et al 1979 1986 marlin 1968 titoff and biskup 1966 however the cost of a model test is relatively high considering that the hydrodynamic performance of tandem propellers is much more complex which is related to multiple geometric parameters and the combination of these parameters to save costs most of the existing model tests on tandem propellers is not comprehensive in the selection of geometric parameters the potential method is based on the assumption that the fluid is non viscous hou et al 2014 tried to apply the panel method for the prediction of steady hydrodynamic performance of tandem propellers and found that the accuracy of the method is acceptable recently the development of numerical simulation methods provides a reliable auxiliary means for the study of propeller hydrodynamic problems di mascio et al 2014 wang et al 2017 dubbioso et al 2013 muscari et al 2017 some scholars have tried to use different numerical simulation methods to study the open water performance and cavitation problems of the tandem propeller yu 2014 hu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 du and zhang 2018 koronowicz et al 2010 boucetta and imine 2017 2019 liu and gong 2020 in the past few years the authors have accumulated a certain experience on the numerical study of marine propellers concerning different hydrodynamic problems yao and zhang 2017 2018a 2018b 2018c 2018d zhang and jaiman 2019 yao et al 2020 such as the transition flow over model propeller blades open water performance and the scale effects propeller exciting forces tip vortex flow noise of conventional propellers wake field of ducted propellers and hydrodynamic performance of tandem propellers et al which laid a solid foundation for the present study according to accumulated experience as for the prediction of propeller open water performance solving rans equations is a good choice because the accuracy is enough and the cost is acceptable for general workstations the commonly used turbulence models is the sst k ω model which combines the advantages of k ε and standard k ω models moving reference frame model simulates the rotating motion of the propeller by setting a rotating reference frame which is only suitable for a steady state simulation sliding mesh model can simulate the real rotating motion of the propeller which is often used in a transient simulation therefore in this study by solving rans equations with sst k ω turbulence model a steady state simulation of the flow field around the propeller was conducted to obtain propeller performance in open water then the flow field obtained from the steady state simulation is used as initial field conditions for a transient simulation in which we can obtain time history of propeller induced pressures on hull surface based on this simple method we carried out a comprehensive study on the hydrodynamics of five conventional propellers and twenty four tandem propellers the content of this study is divided into three parts in the first part five conventional propellers with different disk ratios and different number of blades were designed and the effect of disk ratio and number of blades on propeller thrust efficiency induced pressures on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface was investigated in the second part the effect of vortex blade interaction on the efficiency of the tandem propeller was investigated after that we focused on the effect of blade phase angle and diameter ratio on the induced pressure by the tandem propeller and the negative pressure distribution on blade surface in the third part two conventional propellers au3 30 and au6 60 and a new canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 θ 60 with relatively high performance were selected for a comparison on this basis the advantages and disadvantages of the conventional propeller and the new tandem propeller on the comprehensive treatment of efficiency cavitation vibration and noise radiation problems are discussed 2 propeller models computational domain and numerical methods 2 1 propeller models for conventional propellers to investigate the effect of disk ratio and blade numbers on the open water performance induced pressure on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface five au series conventional propellers with different number of blades and different disk ratios are designed fig 3 and the main particulars of these propellers are listed in table 1 twenty four tandem propellers including eight traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 and sixteen canard tandem propellers d d 1 0 are designed the tandem propeller is made of two three bladed conventional propellers au3 30 the values of three important geometric parameters are listed in table 2 model geometries of two traditional tandem propellers and four canard tandem propellers are presented in fig 4 as known the space for propeller installation is very limited due to the exists of ship stern and rudder fig 2 so the allowable variation range of the spacing between the front and rear propellers is small moreover based on the results of our previous study yao et al 2020 the axial distance between the front and rear propellers is set as 0 2d in this study 2 2 computational domain fig 5 presents an overview of the entire computational domain with boundary conditions and meshing skills the diameter of the entire domain is 10 times that of the rear propeller a small cylindrical region was designed which is the rotation domain the rest of the domain maintains static the distance between the propeller and the velocity inlet boundary is 3d the outlet boundary is set to the pressure outlet condition sliding wall boundary is applied to ignore the influence of wall to simulate the flow field around the propeller and predict open water performance and the induced pressures on hull surface the mesh near the propeller needs to be refined as shown in fig 5 in addition twenty layers of cells are designed within the boundary layer to guarantee that the flow field near the blade surface are resolved accurately the height of the first layer cell near blade surface was determined for the purpose of making the averaged wall y value being less than 1 2 3 numerical methods 2 3 1 steady state simulation for obtaining propeller open water performance a steady state simulation of the propeller at six advance coefficients table 3 was conducted to obtain open water performance curves moving reference frame model was applied for simulating the motion of the propeller a segregated flow solver was used to solve the governing equations the number of iterations is initially set as 1000 times for each working condition during the simulation several criteria were used for convergence judgement for example the variation of values of residuals and physical quantities with iteration and the development of flow field a detailed introduction of the convergence judgement can be found in our previous study yao et al 2020 2 3 2 transient simulation for time history of propeller induced pressure a transient numerical simulation was conducted to obtain time history of propeller induced pressures on hull surface sliding mesh technology was applied to simulate the rotating propeller an implicit solver and the second order temporal discretization were applied for solving the unsteady governing equations according to accumulated experience the time step is set to the time of the propeller rotating one degree which guarantees that the numerical result is independent of the time step the number of iterations in each time step is 10 the total physical time is 0 5 s so the propeller rotates 7 5 revolutions at the speed of 15 rps revolution per second the initial condition for the transient simulation is the flow field obtained by previous steady state simulations to focus on the characteristics of the induced pressure caused by the two different types of propellers the complex interference between the stern and a rotating propeller is not considered a plate is placed above the propeller which represents the hull surface several pressure gauges are set on the plate to receive propeller induced pressures this method is classic and useful which is often used in model tests and numerical simulations for the purpose of simplifying problems therefore twelve pressure gauges along with the stern post are set to obtain propeller induced pressures in the simulation of the propeller in open water the positions and coordinates of the twelve pressure gauges are presented in fig 6 and table 4 respectively in the figure the disk planes of the front propeller and the rear propeller correspond to two cross sections passing through p3 and p1 respectively while in the simulation of conventional propellers the plane of the propeller is located in the cross section passing through p2 to show the relation between the induced pressure on hull surface and the position of propeller blades an angle α is defined in fig 7 for the following discussions 2 3 3 grid sensitivity and accuracy study note that the steady state numerical method in this study is the same with that used in our previous publication yao et al 2020 where a detailed information about the grid sensitivity and accuracy study of the numerical method can be found as for the transient simulation method open water performance of a tandem propeller d d 1 0 θ 0 with the working conditions in table 3 was predicted the numerical results and available experimental data sun et al 1983 are presented in table 5 the maximum difference between the results of transient simulations and experimental data is 2 4 in efficiency when j 0 2 which shows clearly that the results predicted by the two numerical methods are basically the same and also quite close to experimental data the comparison demonstrates the accuracy of the transient numerical simulation method 3 results and discussions 3 1 conventional propellers 3 1 1 effect of blade number and disk ratio on propeller open water performance fig 8 presents numerical results of open water performance of the five conventional propellers the data are also provided in table 6 and table 7 it is clear that both the thrust coefficient k t and torque coefficient k q of the propeller increase obviously with the increase of disk ratio and number of blades at any advance coefficient but the efficiency decreases when the advance coefficient is small the decline of efficiency is not obvious as the advance coefficient increases the efficiency decline is getting more and more prominent table 8 lists a comparison of the efficiency between the three bladed propeller au3 30 and the six bladed propeller au6 60 the comparison shows that the maximum efficiency can be reduced up to 8 04 of course the difference between the efficiency of au3 30 and au7 70 is even greater which is not provided in the table 3 1 2 effect of blade number and disk ratio on propeller induced pressure since the propeller induced pressure on hull surface is directly related to the load of the whole propeller to make a fair comparison it is necessary to adjust the working condition of the propeller to ensure that the load of each propeller is basically the same table 9 lists the new working condition for each propeller which is determined using the linear interpolation method based on large numbers of simulations during the process the inflow velocity remains the same and the rotating speed of the propeller is adjusted to generate the same thrust the thrust and torque of the five propellers at new working conditions are presented in table 9 it is clear that the difference in thrust is less than 1 and the difference in torque is less than 4 based on the results it can be considered that the load of each propeller is basically the same fig 9 presents the time history of pressures received at twelve gauges induced by the conventional propeller au6 60 in two revolutions non dimensional pressure is defined as c p p 2ρv 2 where p is the received gauge pressure ρ is the water density and v is the advance velocity it is clear that for the three gauges at the same cross section the amplitudes of the three pressure signals are basically the same except for a small difference in their phases therefore in the following discussions only the pressures received at the four gauges in the central longitudinal plane are discussed from fig 9 it is also clear that the maximum pressure appears in upstream of the propeller s plane not right above the propeller and the induced pressure downstream of the propeller is small fig 10 shows the time history of pressures received at the four gauges in the central longitudinal plane induced by au3 30 au4 40 au6 60 and au7 70 in two revolutions for the three bladed propeller au3 30 the difference between the four pressure signals is quite significant with the increase of disk ratio and number of blades such difference is getting smaller more importantly it is quite clear that the maximum pressure induced by the propeller au3 30 is much larger than that induced by the propeller au7 70 fig 11 presents a comparison of the amplitudes of the induced pressure by the five conventional propellers at two main characteristic frequencies the blade passing frequency bpf and the double blade passing frequency 2bpf first the induced pressure at p3 is the largest among the four gauges which is upstream of the propeller second it is clear that the amplitudes of the pressure of 2bpf component are much smaller than that of the bpf component third with the increase of disk ratio and blade numbers the propeller induced pressures received at all gauges are decreasing the reason may be that when the load on the whole propeller keeps the same the increase of disk ratio and blade number reduces the load on each blade which is beneficial for reducing propeller induced pressure on hull surface the study shows that the method to reduce the propeller induced pressure by increasing disk ratio and blade numbers is very effective 3 1 3 negative pressure distribution on the blade surface fig 12 presents the negative pressure distribution on the blade surface of five conventional propellers new working condition of each propeller to generate the same thrust is listed in table 9 it is quite clear that with the increase of disk ratio and blade numbers the minimum pressure on the suction side of the blade is increasing and the area of the surface with negative pressure is decreasing which means that the propeller cavitation is reduced according to the saturation vapor pressure theory ge et al 2020 3 2 tandem propellers 3 2 1 effect of vortex blade interaction on propeller open water performance according to the old theory sun et al 1983 which is based on the study of traditional tandem propellers the efficiency of the tandem propeller is basically determined by vortex blade interactions the efficiency is greatest when the blade phase angle makes the rear blade right in the middle of two adjacent tip vortices shedding from the front propeller s blades while the efficiency is minimal when the rear blade is located right at the position of the tip vortex from the front propeller s blade fig 13 presents the effect of blade phase angle θ on the efficiency of tandem propellers with different diameter ratios at different advance coefficients figs 14 16 present the vortex structures of the tandem propeller at several specific blade phase angles using the q criterion yao and zhang 2018d from fig 13 for the conventional propeller d d 1 0 when j 1 0 the efficiency of the tandem propeller is greatest when θ is close to 0 and the efficiency is minimal when θ is close to 60 then let us pay attention to fig 16 when d d 1 0 and θ 0 the rear propeller blade is located right in the middle of two adjacent vortices shedding from the front propeller while when d d 1 0 and θ 60 the rear propeller blade is located right at the position of the vertex from the front propeller s blade therefore the numerical results seem to be consistent with the old theory however when we check the results at other working conditions we find that the old theory is not always right for example when j 0 6 from fig 15 the traditional tandem propeller with the blade phase angle of 15 is supposed to have the highest efficiency based on the old theory but from fig 13 the highest efficiency appears when θ 115 another important finding is that for the tandem propeller with different diameter ratios at the same advance coefficient the variation of the efficiency with blade phase angle is different but we find that the change of the blade phase angle with the maximum and minimum efficiency has some kind of migration rule let us pay attention to the case when j 1 0 fig 13 when d d 1 0 the blade phase angle corresponding to the maximum efficiency is 0 and that of the lowest efficiency is 60 when d d 0 9 the blade phase angle corresponding to the maximum efficiency is 15 and that of the lowest efficiency is 75 when d d 0 8 the blade phase angle corresponding to the maximum efficiency is 30 and that of the lowest efficiency is close to 90 the same migration rule can also be found for the propeller working at other advance coefficients the results show that the vortex blade interaction is not only related to the blade phase angle but also to the diameter ratio besides considering that the change of the blade phase angle changes the relative position of the front and rear blades the blade blade interaction also changes which will affect the performance therefore for tandem propellers the vortex blade interaction and the blade blade interaction are closely related studying one of them separately cannot clearly explain the complex phenomenon the interference between the two complex interactions and the effect need to be further clarified 3 2 2 effect of diameter ratio and blade phase angle on propeller induced pressure six tandem propellers including two traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 and four new canard tandem propellers d d 1 0 are selected to investigate propeller induced pressure on hull surface table 10 in this study two limiting cases of the blade phase angles 0 and 60 for the tandem propeller consisting of two three bladed conventional propellers are selected for the study on the effect of blade phase angle the reason is that when θ 0 the circumferential positions of the front propeller s blades and the rear propeller s blades are exactly the same while when θ 60 all six blades of the tandem propeller are uniformly distributed in the circumferential direction which may be beneficial to reduce propeller induced pressures on hull surface in addition since the propeller induced pressure is directly related to the load of the propeller to make a fair comparison it is necessary to adjust the working condition of each propeller see table 10 so the thrust and torque of each propeller are basically the same see table 11 and table 12 fig 17 presents the load distribution on the front and rear propellers of the tandem propeller with different diameter ratios and different blade phase angles it is clear that the effect of blade phase angle on the load distribution of the front and rear propellers is small while the effect of diameter ratio is significant for the traditional tandem propeller d d 1 0 the load on the front propeller is much greater than that on the rear propeller with the decrease of the front propeller s diameter the load distribution on the front and rear propellers changes for the canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 the load on the rear propeller is slightly greater than that of the front propeller for the tandem propeller when d d 0 8 the load on the rear propeller is much greater than that of the front propeller this study shows that the load shifts from the front propeller to the rear propeller when reducing the front propeller s diameter fig 18 shows the time history of the induced pressures at the four gauges by two sets of tandem propellers with different blade phase angles 0 and 60 in two revolutions generally as for the two traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 it is clear that the induced pressure received at upstream gauges is greater than that at the downstream gauges and the gauge with the maximum pressure is p4 however as for the canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 the pressures at the four gauges show different patterns more importantly it is quite clear that the amplitude of the pressure induced by the tandem propeller when θ 0 is much greater than that induced by the tandem propeller when θ 60 fig 19 presents the effect of blade phase angle on the induced pressure of the tandem propeller as for the two traditional tandem propellers d d 1 0 when the blade phase angle θ changes from 0 to 60 the amplitudes of the induced pressures at bpf are significantly reduced similarly as for the canard tandem propellers when d d 0 9 the amplitudes of the pressures at bpf induced by the tandem propeller when θ 60 are much smaller than that by the tandem propeller when θ 0 note that as for the canard tandem propeller when d d 0 8 the effect on reducing the induced pressures by changing the blade phase angle is relatively small the reason maybe that the load on the front propeller is much smaller than that of the rear propeller see fig 17 so the induced pressure is mainly caused by the rear propeller overall the propeller induced pressures on hull surface can be significantly reduced by making all blades of the tandem propeller evenly distributed in the circumferential direction in addition the effect of the blade phase angle on the propeller induced pressure at 2bpf is negligible fig 20 presents the effect of diameter ratio on the induced pressures by the tandem propeller when θ 0 it is clear that when the diameter of the front propeller decreases although the pressure received at p1 and p2 increases the pressure at p4 is significantly reduced so the maximum pressure decreases the results demonstrate that the effect of reducing the front propeller s diameter to some extent on reducing the induced pressures on hull surface by tandem propellers when θ 0 is obvious however the situation is a little bit different for the tandem propellers when θ 60 and the results are presented in fig 21 for gauges p1 p2 and p3 the amplitudes of the pressures at bpf is increasing but the pressure at p4 is decreasing in this situation the effect of reducing the front propeller s diameter is not obvious on the contrary a further reduction of the front propeller s diameter may increase the induced pressure the reason is that when θ 60 the load is distributed relatively evenly in the circumferential direction when d d 1 0 and the reduction of the front propeller s diameter results in unevenly load on all blades and heavier load on the rear propeller 3 2 3 negative pressure on blade surface fig 22 presents the effect of diameter ratio and blade phase angle on the negative pressure over the tandem propeller s blade surface generally for the two traditional tandem propellers the negative pressure on the front propeller s blade surface is much lower which suggests that cavitation is more likely to occur on the front propeller when the diameter of the front propeller decreases the load on the rear propeller is increasing which suggests that the cavitation will mainly occur on the rear propeller considering that the bubbles shedding from the front propeller blade may affect the cavitation of the rear propeller we believe that the best situation is that the front propeller bears the maximum load under the condition that no cavitation occurs in this case the cavitation on the rear propeller is better than that on a single propeller in addition from the figure the effect of blade phase angle on the negative pressure on blade surface is small but this does not mean that the effect on the actual cavitation can be ignored because the cavitation interference between the front and rear propellers is also related to their relative positions which are determined by the blade phase angle and other parameters 3 3 comparison between new canard tandem propellers and conventional propellers in the following sections a comparison was made on the open water performance induced pressures on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface of three propellers including a selected new canard tandem propeller d d 0 9 θ 60 a conventional propeller au3 30 with smaller disk ratio and fewer blades a conventional propeller au6 60 with larger disk ratio and more blades 3 3 1 comparison of open water performance fig 23 shows the thrust and torque coefficients efficiency of the three propellers at different advance coefficients it is clear that at most advance coefficients the thrust and torque coefficients of the tandem propeller are greater than that of au3 30 but smaller than that of au6 60 more importantly the comparison on efficiency of the three propellers is interesting when the advance coefficient is small j 0 2 namely the propeller being heavily loaded the efficiency of the tandem propeller is much greater than that of au6 60 and is even greater than that of au3 30 therefore for some ships like the tugboat the propeller is often work under such small advance coefficients and the advantage of the tandem propeller is obvious when the propeller working at a medium advance coefficient j 0 6 although the efficiency of the tandem propeller is smaller than au3 30 it is still much greater than that of au6 60 when the propeller works at a high advance coefficient j 1 0 the efficiency of the tandem propeller is comparable to that of au6 60 only when the propeller works at an extremely high advance coefficient j 1 2 the efficiency of the tandem propeller is smaller than that of au6 60 this study shows that the efficiency of the tandem propeller is usually smaller than that of the conventional propeller with smaller disk ratio and fewer blade numbers but it is greater than that of the conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more blades at most advance coefficients j 3 3 2 comparison of propeller induced pressure fig 24 shows the amplitudes of the induced pressure at bpf and 2bpf by the three propellers first a comparison between the tandem propeller and the conventional propeller au3 30 was made it is quite clear that the induced pressures at bpf by the canard tandem propeller are much smaller than that induced by au3 30 although the amplitude at 2bpf of the two propellers are close the amplitudes at 2bpf are much smaller than that at bpf in addition the position of the maximum pressure is also different second let us focus on the comparison between the tandem propeller and the conventional propeller au6 60 the amplitudes of the induced pressure at bpf by the tandem propeller are comparable to that of au6 60 but the amplitude of 2bpf component is much greater which sometimes needs special attention 3 3 3 comparison of negative pressure on blade surface fig 25 presents the negative pressure distribution on blade surface of the three selected propellers it is clear that compared with au3 30 the negative pressure distribution on blade surface of the canard tandem propeller is improved the minimum pressure increases and the area of negative pressure decreases significantly however the comparison between the tandem propeller with the conventional propeller au6 60 reveals that the cavitation of the tandem propeller is a little bit worse than that of au6 60 the reason is that when the two propellers generate the same thrust for the conventional propeller the load on each blades is the same and for the canard tandem propeller the reduction of the front propeller s diameter may result in the load of the rear propeller being greater than that of the front propeller which may cause cavitation on the rear propeller therefore the best situation for improve cavitation is to make sure that the front and rear propellers bear the same load besides for the tandem propeller when θ 60 due to the influence of tip vortices shedding from the front propeller the minimum pressure on the rear propeller may decrease which may also affect propeller cavitation 4 conclusion by solving rans equations with sst k ω turbulence model using the star ccm solver a steady state simulation of the flow field around the propeller was conducted to obtain propeller open water performance and a transient numerical simulation was conducted to predict the fluctuating pressures on hull surface induced by a rotating propeller based on this simple method we carried out a comprehensive study on the hydrodynamics of five conventional propellers and twenty four tandem propellers the effect of variety of factors on propeller performance induced pressures on hull surface and negative pressure distribution on blade surface was discussed eventually we made a comprehensive comparison of thrust efficiency exciting forces and cavitation between new canard tandem propellers and conventional propellers 1 for the conventional propeller at any advance coefficient with the increase of disk ratio and number of blades the thrust of the propeller increases but the efficiency reduction is quite obvious especially at high advance coefficients the propeller induced pressure on hull surface is significantly reduced and propeller cavitation is also improved according to the saturation vapor pressure theory 2 for the tandem propeller the effect of blade phase angle on the performance is complicated the vortex blade interaction will affect the efficiency but the old theory about the optimum blade phase angle for the greatest efficiency is not always right a migration rule was found about the optimum blade phase angle for high efficiency which is the function of diameter ratio and advance coefficient as for the induced pressure on hull surface when the blade phase angle is 60 the propeller induced pressure is much smaller than that of the tandem propeller when the blade phase angle is 0 in addition when the blade phase angle is 0 the induced pressure decreases significantly with the decrease of the front propeller s diameter while when the blade phase angle is 60 the effect of reducing the front propeller s diameter on the induced pressure is not obvious as for the study of negative pressure distribution on blade surface propeller cavitation is improved when the front propeller diameter is reduced based on the analysis but it is important to note that the diameter of the front propeller should not be too small 3 for the comparison of the three propellers efficiency at a small advance coefficient j 0 2 the canard tandem propeller has the highest efficiency at a medium advance coefficient j 0 6 the efficiency of the canard tandem propeller is still higher than that of au6 60 at a high advance coefficient j 1 0 the efficiency is still comparable to that of au6 60 only at an extremely high advance coefficient j 1 2 the efficiency is still lower than au6 60 generally in most cases the canard tandem propeller is more efficient than the conventional propeller with more blades and larger disk ratio 4 for the comparison of induced pressure on hull surface by the three propellers the induced pressures by the canard tandem propeller are much smaller than that induced by au3 30 the induced pressure at bpf by the canard tandem propeller and au6 60 are basically the same but the amplitudes of the pressure at 2bpf induced by the canard tandem propeller is greater than that by au6 60 which also needs to be noticed 5 based on the comparison of negative pressure distribution on blade surface of the three propellers the cavitation of the canard tandem propeller may be much less than that of au3 30 but a little bit more than that of au6 60 the conclusion is reached based on the negative pressure on blade surface according to the saturation vapor pressure theory here it is important to point out that the cavitation of the tandem propeller may be much more complicated due to the interaction between the front and rear propellers and also the vortex blade interaction generally it is important to note that the complicated interference between the front and rear propellers is far from clear so there is still much room for efficiency improvement of the tandem propellers in this paper only a canard tandem propeller with relatively good performance was selected for the comparison with two commonly used conventional propellers which have been developed very maturely even so the results of the comparison already show that the tandem propeller has more advantages and potential in the comprehensive treatment of efficiency cavitation vibration and noise problems over the conventional propeller with larger disk ratio and more number of blades as pointed out in this study a further investigation on the vortex blade interaction and the blade blade interaction is needed credit authorship

21126,the hydrodynamics of a circular cylinder in confined flows have great significance to fundamental fluid mechanics and engineering applications however a major gap of knowledge exists regarding the impact of blockage on the hydrodynamic properties of the cylinder including the fluctuating lift coefficient c l mean drag coefficient c d and strouhal number st to fill the knowledge gap three dimensional numerical simulations are conducted at blockage ratios up to β 1 2 where β d h d and h are the cylinder diameter and channel height respectively and reynolds numbers from re 300 to 30 000 the present study reveals that confinement causes a significant increase of c d and st whereas different behaviours of c l are observed in laminar and turbulent flow regimes further a reverse karman vortex street is observed at all blockage ratios between 1 6 and 1 2 for reynolds numbers less than 1 000 the invert location where the vortex trajectories originating from the top and bottom of the cylinder intersect in the wake depends on the reynolds number and the blockage ratio at reynolds numbers above 1 000 the reverse karman vortex street does not occur and the vortices organise themselves in a single row with an alternate arrangement in the wake keywords blockage ratio vortex shedding drag lift strouhal number reverse karman vortex street 1 introduction 1 1 overview research on flows over a stationary cylinder has been conducted for many decades in experimental studies the cylinder is typically positioned symmetrically across the depth of a flow channel assuming the cylinder is horizontal under this configuration the ratio between the cylinder s diameter d and the channel height h is defined as the blockage ratio β that is 1 β d h it is generally recommended to keep the blockage ratio below 5 to avoid any negative effects from the sidewalls prasanth et al 2006 many researchers have reported that a high blockage ratio may progressively influence the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cylinder and significantly alter the wake downstream for instance west and apelt 1982 experimentally observed a gradual increase of the pressure drag at blockage ratios from 6 to 16 they also observed an increase of the strouhal number with the blockage ratio el sherbiny 1972 conducted an experiment with a confined cylinder at reynolds numbers re ranging from 10 000 to 120 000 and β 35 5 and reported that the pressure drag and the lift coefficients increased significantly with increasing blockage ratio further richter and naudascher 1976 showed that the fluctuating lift coefficient is approximately seven times higher than that of an unconfined cylinder at re 50 000 and β 50 further reports on the changes of the strouhal number and the hydrodynamic coefficients with the blockage ratio can be found in the studies of hiwada and mabuchi 1981 khan and mughal 2006 so and savkar 1980 in engineering applications the blockage effects may be beneficial for heat transfer enhancement mixing and energy harvesting by vortex induced vibration viv previous studies have demonstrated that the local heat transfer of a channel flow is greatly enhanced by disturbing the flow with a circular cylinder placed in the middle of the channel hiwada and mabuchi 1981 oyakawa and mabuchi 1981 the higher the blockage ratio is the higher the heat transfer rate the heat transfer enhancement can reach up to 40 at the blockage ratio of 60 mathis et al 2016 mathis et al 2014 further a high blockage ratio also causes a significant increase in the lift coefficient of the cylinder this is useful for designing energy harvesting devices by enhancing viv of the confined circular cylinder s as indicated by soti and de 2020 and jiang et al 2013 it is understood that the presence of the sidewalls constricts the cross flow which essentially causes a greater pressure variation on the cylinder surface the flow passing through the gaps between the cylinder and the sidewalls is accelerated causing the vortices to shed from the cylinder at an increased rate as a result the pressure drag and the strouhal number are greatly enhanced hiwada and mabuchi 1981 observed an exponential increase of both the pressure drag and the strouhal number when the flow was constricted at blockage ratios between 40 and 60 for blockage ratios above 60 no dominant frequency was found in their spectral analysis indicating a suppression of the vortex shedding in addition to the primary vortex shedding from the cylinder vortices are also shed from the sidewalls which are related to the appearance of the reverse karman vortex street singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 or also known as criss cross motion suzuki et al 1993 shair et al 1963 carried out experiments to study the effect of high blockage ratios β 20 on the stability of the wake it was found that the critical reynolds number re crit at which vortex shedding starts to appear is strongly dependent on the blockage ratio more specifically the instability of the wake is observed at re crit 130 for β 20 while the critical reynolds number for unbounded flows is widely reported at re crit 47 subsequently chen et al 1995 expanded the range of re crit for β 70 in a two dimensional simulation and sahin and owens 2004 further extended re crit for β 90 griffith et al 2011 conducted a two dimensional computational study to visualise the confined flow structure at re 300 and β 50 by using floquet stability analysis the authors observed the occurrence of modes a and b instabilities at re 160 and 290 respectively using the same methodology camarri and giannetti 2010 observed modes a and b instabilities for β 20 at re 204 and 256 respectively at β 33 3 rehimi et al 2008 demonstrated modes a and b instabilities at re 159 and 400 respectively in a particle image velocimetry piv experiment for comparisons modes a and b of the wake instability for unconfined flows are reported to occur at re about 190 and 230 respectively williamson 1996 overall the blockage ratio not only affects the hydrodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinder but also modifies the flow field in the near wake the effects are insignificant when the blockage ratio is relatively small say β 5 10 for higher blockage ratios some correctional models have been proposed to compensate the blockage effects which are well documented by zdravkovich 1997 1 2 gap of knowledge fig 1 summarises the results of the fluctuating lift coefficient at various reynolds numbers and blockage ratios taken from two representative investigations one is the experimental study of richter and naudascher 1976 who measured the hydrodynamic forces of a cylinder at four blockage ratios from 1 6 to 1 2 with re from 20 000 to 400 000 the other is the numerical study of singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 who examined the hydrodynamic properties of a cylinder at six blockage ratios from 1 8 to 1 2 for reynolds numbers up to 250 it is clear in fig 1 that a major gap of knowledge exists regarding the behaviour of the fluctuating lift coefficient at blockage ratios from 1 6 to 1 2 over the reynolds number range between 250 and 20 000 similarly a knowledge gap also exists for the drag coefficient and the strouhal number over the same parameter ranges to our best knowledge no study to date has fulfilled the above knowledge gaps by either numerical or experimental investigations in this study a series of three dimensional 3 d numerical simulations are carried out to address the issue blockage ratios from 1 6 to 1 2 and reynolds number from 300 to 30 000 are calculated also investigated in this study is the reverse karman vortex street phenomenon in what follows section 2 will introduce two types of flows relevant to a confined cylinder and the relationship between the reynolds numbers characterising the two types of flows sections 3 and 4 will describe the details of the numerical models dependence tests and numerical results finally the major findings of this study will be summarised in section 5 2 flow classification 2 1 ambiguity of two co existing flows the problem of a circular cylinder in a confined flow considered in this study may be classified in two distinct ways one as an internal flow through a confined flow channel and the other as an external flow past a circular cylinder accordingly the flow may be characterised by two reynolds numbers for a channel flow the reynolds number is defined as 2 r e c h n 2 h u m ν where u m and ν are the mean flow velocity across the channel height h and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively for an external flow past an unconfined cylinder the reynolds number is defined as follow 3 r e d u 0 ν where u 0 is the free stream velocity the co existing internal and external flows involve two reynolds numbers consequently there is an ambiguity in choosing an appropriate reynolds number to characterise the flow most of the previous studies focus on the state of the flow over the cylinder without considering the state of the channel flow e g el sherbiny 1972 richter and naudascher 1976 chen et al 1995 sahin and owens 2004 singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 mathupriya et al 2018 2 2 relationship between the two reynolds numbers to properly address the flow regime of the combined channel cylinder flow a relationship between the two reynolds numbers needs to be established the presence of the cylinder in a flow channel may lead to a scenario in which the downstream flow becomes turbulent while the upstream flow is laminar nevertheless the confined flow is mainly characterised by the state of the upstream flow regardless of the flow conditions downstream for simplicity fully developed flow conditions are assumed in this study and both the cylinder length and the channel width are assumed to be infinite with such assumptions the reynolds number re cyl for the flow past the confined cylinder which differs from the reynolds number re for an unconfined cylinder given in equation 3 above is defined in term of the centreline velocity u c as 4 r e c y l d u c ν it is worth noting that in the literature different characteristic velocities have been used to define the reynolds number of the flow past a confined cylinder chen et al 1995 mitry 1977 sahin and owens 2004 shair et al 1963 among them the centreline velocity is widely used kanaris et al 2011 sahin and owens 2004 singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 as it can be easily measured in experiments combining equations 2 and 4 and substituting β d h yields the relationship between the reynolds numbers of the channel flow and the flow past the confined cylinder as follows 5 r e c h n 2 β u m u c r e c y l for fully developed turbulent channel flows re chn 2 800 the ratio between u m and u c is approaching unity therefore equation 5 may be simplified as 6 r e c h n 2 β r e c y l f o r r e c h n 2 800 in contrast for fully developed laminar channel flows re chn 2 800 u m u c equals to 2 3 whan and rothfus 1959 hanks and rou 1966 hanks 1967 accordingly equation 5 can be rewritten as 7 r e c h n 4 3 β r e c y l f o r r e c h n 2 800 equation 5 7 indicate the reynolds number relationship between the channel flow and the flow past the confined cylinder which depends on the blockage ratio since the blockage ratio must be less than 1 0 otherwise there is no flow through the channel and the blockage effect is negligible for β 0 05 equation 5 7 are applicable for 0 05 β 1 0 3 numerical approaches and tests 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in this study the commercial cfd package ansys fluent version 18 2 which is a finite volume based cfd solver ansys inc 2013 is adopted the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 2 a cylinder of diameter d is symmetrically positioned between two parallel walls separated by a distance h which is varied to achieve the desired blockage ratios as suggested by chen et al 1995 the streamwise length of the computational domain should be three fold of the distance from the inlet to the cylinder axis to reduce negative effects on the recirculation zone behind the cylinder here the upstream length from the inlet to the cylinder axis is set to 15d while the outlet is located at 30d downstream lei cheng and kavanagh 2001 recommended that the spanwise length of the cylinder should be at least twice of the cylinder diameter here the spanwise length is set to πd with the cartesian coordinate system defined in fig 2 the computational domain is confined to 15d x 30d h 2 y h 2 and 0 z πd where x y z refer to the streamwise lateral and spanwise directions respectively table 1 summarises the reynolds numbers considered in selected numerical studies and the corresponding locations of the outlet boundary adopted in the simulations as shown in table 1 the outflow locations adopted in the previous studies are typically around 20d to 30d although the previous studies are on unconfined flows whereas the present study is concerned with confined flows the highest reynolds number considered in this study is significantly lower than those of unconfined flows considered by others alonzo garcía et al 2015 kim 2006 lee and yang 2017 lloyd and james 2016 accordingly it is deemed acceptable to place the outlet boundary at 30d from the cylinder the boundary conditions applied in the numerical models are as follows velocity inlet and fully developed flow conditions are prescribed at the inlet and outlet respectively rigid no slip wall conditions are prescribed on the surface of the cylinder and the top and bottom boundaries and periodic conditions are assumed in the spanwise direction different velocity profiles are specified at the inlet depending on the cylinder reynolds number for re cyl 1 000 a parabolic velocity profile for the poiseuille flow is imposed at the inlet as 8 u y u c 1 4 y h 2 for re cyl 1 000 the velocity profile at the inlet is determined numerically from separate 3 d simulations of flow through a long channel without the cylinder 3 2 numerical models 3 2 1 laminar model it is anticipated that the critical reynolds number for the laminar to turbulent transition of a confined flow depends on the blockage ratio which is unknown in the literature for an external flow past a circular cylinder at re 1 000 a laminar model is usually adopted accordingly we used a laminar model to resolve the confined flows with re cyl 1 000 in this study it is worth noting that in this paper laminar flow refers to the flow calculated using a laminar model which directly solves the following navier stokes equations for 3 d incompressible flows 9 u i t u j u i x i 1 ρ p x i ν u i 2 x j x j i j 1 2 3 10 u i x i 0 where x 1 x 2 x 3 x y z are the cartesian coordinates refer to fig 2 u i is the velocity component in the x i direction the t is the time and p is the pressure 3 2 2 turbulent model large eddy simulation les model is adopted to calculate flows with re cyl 1 000 the filtered navier stoke equations for incompressible flows are written as 11 u i t x j u i u j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j i j 1 2 3 12 u i x i 0 where u i is the filtered velocity component p is the filtered pressure and τ ij is sub grid scale sgs stress tensor which is defined as 13 τ i j u i u j u i u j the sgs turbulent stresses are modelled as 14 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j where τ k k is the isotropic part of the sgs stress and s i j is the resolved rate of strain tensor given by 15 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the sgs wale wall adapting local eddy viscosity model which was adopted by wornom et al 2011 for unconfined flows past a cylinder at 3 900 re 20 000 is adopted in this study the eddy viscosity μ t in the sgs wale model is given by 16 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 where l s and s i j d are calculated as follows 17 l s min κ d c w v 1 3 18 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 g i j u i x j the wale constant c w is set to 0 325 as recommended in the ansys fluent theory guide ansys inc 2013 3 3 numerical schemes the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations scheme is adopted for resolving the pressure velocity coupling in both laminar and turbulent models in the laminar model the second order central differencing and second order upwind schemes are applied to the pressure terms and advection terms respectively and the second order implicit scheme is adopted for the transient formulation in the les model the bounded central differencing and bounded second order implicit schemes are applied for the spatial discretization and the transient formulation respectively 3 4 dependence tests the sensitivities of numerical results such as the fluctuating lift coefficient c l the mean drag coefficient c d the strouhal number st and the negative base pressure c pb to the mesh resolution time step and convergence criteria i e the residuals are evaluated for the laminar and turbulent models respectively the general procedures adopted for the mesh dependence tests at various blockage ratios are as follows firstly a structured mesh is constructed for a cylinder in an unconfined flow and a mesh dependence test is carried out to determine a suitable mesh for resolving the flow over the unconfined cylinder subsequently the computational domain is truncated from both sides in the lateral direction to obtain a blockage ratio of 1 6 the smallest blockage ratio considered in this study the mesh resolution in the vicinity of the cylinder is preserved while the meshes near the top and bottom boundaries are reconstructed to resolve the wall boundary layers the grid in the wake region up to 10d downstream from the cylinder axis is further refined to resolve the complex wake flow structures the same domain truncation and mesh refinement processes are repeated for the blockage ratios of 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 in sequence further details of the dependence tests for the laminar and turbulent flows are briefly described below 3 4 1 laminar flows for laminar flows we first carry out a two dimensional 2 d mesh dependence test for an unconfined cylinder at re 1 000 the computational domain adopted for this test is bounded by 15d x 30d and 10d y 10d starting with a coarse mesh refer to m02 in table 2 the sensitivity of the monitored flow parameters to the mesh resolution and the time step is tested by keeping the cfl courant freidrichs lewy number less than unity and constant in doing so we double the number of mesh elements from m02 and in the meantime halve the time step refer to m02 d1 in table 2 the same process is repeated for a second time m02 d2 specific details of the mesh sizes time steps and the corresponding results are given in table 2 here the results obtained with m02 and m02 d1 are compared with those obtained with m02 d2 and the variations in percentages are shown in brackets it is seen in the table that the variations of the calculated hydrodynamic properties of interest among these three sets of results are all below 3 considering the significant demand of computing resources for 3 d calculations m02 with a minimum radial spacing δr min 10 3 d the first cell off the cylinder surface 120 nodes around the cylinder circumference and the non dimensional time step δt 2 01 10 4 is chosen for the subsequent 3 d tests in this study the time is normalised as t tu c d where t is the dimensional time the same normalisation applies to the time step δt subsequently a 3 d mesh is constructed by replicating m02 along the spanwise direction the spanwise length of the computational domain is πd the time step determined from the above 2 d test is adopted in the 3 d tests the dependence of the numerical results on the spanwise grid resolution δz is evaluated in doing so the 3 d calculations with different spanwise grid resolutions are extended up to 500 non dimensional time approximately 90 vortex shedding cycles and the variations of the hydrodynamic properties such as the drag lift strouhal number and negative base pressure of the cylinder with the spanwise grid resolution are examined table 3 shows the results obtained from the spanwise grid resolution test in table 3 the percentage variations are relative to the results obtained with the finest mesh m02 4 the results show that the grid resolution in the spanwise direction significantly affects the predicted hydrodynamic properties of the cylinder there is a dramatic drop nearly four times of the predicted fluctuating lift coefficient when δz is reduced from 0 2d to 0 03d further there are considerable variations of the predicted mean drag coefficient and the negative base pressure whereas the strouhal number only varies slightly since m02 3 gives relatively small variations of the hydrodynamic properties less than 3 compared to those of m02 4 it is chosen for further tests subsequently the residuals for the convergence of the continuity and momentum equations are tested with m02 3 it is found that the residuals of 10 5 for both the continuity and momentum equations are adequate for laminar flows up to re 1 000 to ensure better numerical accuracy all the residuals are set to 10 6 in this study the above dependence tests indicate that the mesh m02 3 with 1 026 million cells and the spanwise resolution δz 0 05d is adequate for resolving the laminar flows past an unconfined cylinder with re 1 000 in each of the above described mesh time step and residual dependence tests the numerical uncertainty is estimated to be less than 3 for the predicted mean drag fluctuating lift strouhal number and negative base pressure following the above 3 d tests for an unconfined cylinder the computational domain is truncated in the lateral direction to achieve the blockage ratio of 1 6 as mentioned above the quality of the mesh near the cylinder is preserved after the truncation of the computational domain while the meshes near the lateral boundaries are reconstructed the sensitivity of the numerical results to the time step and the mesh resolutions in the spanwise direction and in the x y plane is then tested and an appropriate 3 d mesh with local refinement in the near wake region up to 10d from the cylinder axis refer to fig 3 is identified for this blockage ratio subsequently the computational domain is further truncated to achieve the higher blockage ratios of 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 respectively the time step and spanwise grid resolution are kept the same as those for the blockage ratio of 1 6 and only the sensitivity of the numerical results to the mesh resolution in the x y plane is tested at the higher blockage ratios similarly an appropriate mesh with local refinement in the near wake region up to 10d from the cylinder axis is identified at each blockage ratio the overall numerical uncertainty is estimated to be below 3 according to the dependence tests at each blockage ratio for a confined cylinder with re cyl 1 000 3 4 2 transitional and turbulent flows for transitional and turbulent flows a mesh dependence test is conducted first for an unconfined cylinder with re 30 000 in a 3 d domain bounded by 15d x 30d 20d y 20d 0 z πd for this test a relatively coarse mesh with 120 nodes around the circumference of the cylinder and a spanwise grid resolution of 0 1d is constructed initially since properly resolving the flow around the cylinder is the most critical to the prediction of the hydrodynamic properties and the effect of the flow in the far field is less important the region surrounding the cylinder is focused on when refining the mesh we first fix the mesh resolution in the spanwise direction and refine the mesh in the x y plane within the region of 6d from the cylinder axis in doing so the number of nodes along the circumference of the cylinder is doubled from 120 to 240 and the mesh is refined in the radial direction by halving the height of the first cell off the cylinder surface and maintaining the same radial growth rate in the meantime the time step is also halved the same local mesh refinement and time step reduction processes are repeated for a second time which results in the finest mesh with 480 nodes around the cylinder surface following the test of the mesh resolution in the x y plane the mesh resolution in the spanwise direction is then tested by gradually reducing the spanwise cell size δz from 0 1d to 0 03d afterwards the sensitivity of the numerical results to the residual for convergence is checked all the 3 d calculations are extended up to 300 non dimensional time about 60 vortex shedding cycles and the variations of the hydrodynamic properties are examined it is found that a mesh with 4 98 million cells 240 nodes along the circumference of the cylinder a spanwise grid resolution δz 0 03d and δr min 5 10 4 d along with the residuals of 10 6 for both the continuity and momentum equations and the dimensionless time step δt 3 01 10 3 is adequate for resolving the turbulent flows around the unconfined cylinder these settings give y 1 0 for re 30 000 and the overall numerical uncertainty is estimated to be below 3 subsequently the 3 d domain is truncated in the lateral direction to achieve the desired blockage ratio of 1 6 and the meshes near the lateral boundaries are reconstructed details of the mesh and time step dependence test and the corresponding results for β 1 6 are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively in table 5 the percentage variations of all quantities are calculated relative to the results obtained in the base case b16 t it is seen in table 5 that further reducing the time step i e b16 t2 in table 5 and refining the mesh in the spanwise direction and in the x y plane i e b16 tfz and b16 tfxy respectively result in no more than 3 variations of all the predicted quantities for the purpose of capturing the flow structures around the cylinder and in the near wake b16 tfxy is chosen for re cyl 30 000 in the present investigation further tests similar to those described above for the laminar flow past confined cylinders are carried out to check the sensitivity of the results to the time step the spanwise grid resolution and the local mesh refinement in the near wake region up to 10d from the cylinder axis based on these tests a 3 d mesh with local refinement is chosen for this blockage ratio the same processes are repeated for each of the higher blockage ratios β 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 and an appropriate mesh with local refinement is selected for further calculations the numerical uncertainties for all the blockage ratios are estimated to be less than 3 based on the above described dependence tests 3 5 numerical validation to validate the present numerical models several simulations are conducted for flows past a circular cylinder at different blockage ratios and reynolds numbers covering both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes fig 4 shows the comparisons of the predicted pressure coefficient distributions from the present numerical models with published experimental and numerical data fig 4 a and b are for isolated cylinders with re 1 000 and 20 000 respectively and fig 4c is for a confined cylinder with β 1 2 and re 45 000 it is seen in fig 4 that in general the cp predictions from the present computational models show a very good agreement with the published data at re 1 000 only a minor deviation of the cp plot from the experimental measurement of norberg 2002 is observed and at re 45 000 the deviation of the pressure coefficients between the present prediction and the experimental measurement of hiwada and mabuchi 1981 is mainly at the back of the cylinder around the rear stagnation point an excellent agreement with the experimental measurement of norberg 2002 and the numerical prediction of moussaed et al 2014 is achieved for re 20 000 overall the comparisons in fig 4 demonstrate that both the laminar and large eddy simulation models can properly resolve the laminar and turbulent flows past circular cylinders with and without blockage effects this also confirms the validity of the above described mesh time step and residual dependence studies 4 results and discussions 4 1 flow structures fig 5 shows snapshots of the spanwise vortical structures obtained at the blockage ratios of 1 6 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 respectively for re cyl 300 here the vortical structures are visualised using the lambda 2 criterion λ2 due to its ability to capture vortex cores near the walls refer to jeong and hussain 2006 and kanaris et al 2011 the λ2 is the second negative eigenvalue of s2 ω2 where s and ω are the symmetric and antisymmetric part of the gradient velocity tensor respectively in the present study the spanwise vorticity is normalised by u c d as ω z u c d v x u y u c d and λ2 is normalised by u c d 2 as e2 λ2 u c d 2 the iso surfaces of the non dimensional eigenvalue e2 0 2 coloured by the spanwise vorticity are depicted in fig 5 it is clear in fig 5 that the primary vortices generated from either the top or bottom side of the cylinder cross over the x z symmetry plane in the wake this phenomenon is known as reverse karman vortex street refer to camarri and giannetti 2010 and is observed at all blockage ratios for re cyl up to 1 000 in this study in addition smaller vortex cores are visible on the top and bottom walls in the vicinity of the cylinder at β 1 3 and β 1 2 see fig 5c and d which are referred to as secondary vortices the mechanism responsible for the occurrence of the reverse karman vortex street remains controversial in the literature two possible mechanisms have been proposed one is related to the entrainment of the incoming vorticity camarri and giannetti 2007 and the other is related to the interaction between the primary vortices from the cylinder and the two lateral walls i e the top and bottom walls refer to the discussions in zovatto and pedrizzetti 2001 and singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 the present study supports the latter at the relatively low blockage ratios such as 1 6 and 1 4 the interaction between the shear layers on the top and bottom walls with the shear layers on the cylinder is relatively weak and no separation of the wall shear layers is observed however at the higher blockage ratios of 1 3 and 1 2 the gap flows between the cylinder and the top and bottom walls intensify as a result secondary vortices are formed on the top and bottom walls due to separations of the wall shear layers refer to fig 5c and d the interaction of the shear layers on the lateral walls and the cylinder described above causes the formation of the reverse karman vortex street to further illustrate the formation process of the reverse karman vortex street fig 6 shows a full cycle of the flow development at β 1 3 and re cyl 300 the period of the cycle is denoted by t at t 0 refer to fig 6a an elliptically shaped positive secondary vortex sv is present on the top wall at approximately 2d behind the cylinder marked by a thick red dashed circle in the figure this vortex rotates in the same counterclockwise direction as the primary vortex pv shed from the lower side of the cylinder at the same time a negative clockwise sv marked by a thick blue dashed circle is present on the bottom wall at approximately 3d behind the cylinder at t t 4 the negative sv on the bottom wall is entrained into the wake by the positive pv issued from the lower side of the cylinder this negative sv then merges with the negative pv issued from the top side of the cylinder at t t 2 resulting in the negative pv from the top side of the cylinder being pulled across the symmetry plane the merged sv and pv form a large vortex which rolls over downstream between t t 2 and t 3t 4 the positive sv on the top wall is undergoing a similar process i e being entrained into the wake by the negative pv issued from the top side of the cylinder it then merges with the positive pv from the bottom side of the cylinder at a time after t 3t 4 these processes of vortex issuing entrainment and merging occur alternatively between the top and bottom sides of the cylinder which are clearly observable from animated flow development a parameter characterising the reverse karman vortex street phenomenon is the invert location denoted by x inv measured from the cylinder axis where the trajectories of the primary vortices intersect the trajectories of the primary vortices may be obtained by tracking the minima pressure over time refer to camarri and giannetti 2007 alternatively camarri and giannetti 2007 suggested that the invert location may be found by tracking the location where the time averaged velocity defect is recovered in the present investigation the invert locations are obtained using the latter approach the results are plotted in fig 7 for re cyl 1 000 at various blockage ratios it is seen in this figure that for β 1 3 the invert location behind the circular cylinder generally increases with the reynolds number and retains a constant value beyond a certain reynolds number depending on the blockage ratio the behaviour of the invert location at the highest blockage ratio β 1 2 is different from that at the lower blockage ratios it first decreases slightly as the reynolds number increases and then retains a constant value beyond the reynolds number of 700 overall the increase of the blockage ratio causes the invert location to move closer to the cylinder and become less dependent on the reynolds number at medium reynolds numbers 1 000 re cyl 3 900 it is found that the interaction between the primary and secondary vortices becomes weaker at all blockage ratios this is associated with the instability and breakdown of the primary vortices as a result the reverse karman vortex street is not observed at high reynolds numbers re cyl 3 900 the secondary vortices also break down and the wake organises in a single vortex row with an alternate arrangement of clockwise and counterclockwise vortices a snapshot of the iso surface of e2 5 coloured by the spanwise vorticity for re cyl 30 000 and β 1 3 is presented in fig 8 confirming the presence of a single vortex row in the wake the distance between two consecutive vortex cores is approximately 2d 4 2 hydrodynamic properties of the cylinder the hydrodynamic properties of the circular cylinder considered in this study include the fluctuating lift coefficient c l the mean drag coefficient c d and the strouhal number st the fluctuating lift coefficient is calculated as follows 19 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 where n c l i c l are the number of data samples in the time series of c l the lift coefficient at discrete time and the time averaged lift coefficient respectively the lift coefficient is defined as 20 c l f l 0 5 ρ u c 2 d l where f l l are the lift force and cylinder length respectively the mean drag coefficient and the strouhal number are defined below 21 c d f d 0 5 ρ u c 2 d l 22 s t f d u c where f d is the drag force and f is the shedding frequency of the primary vortices in this study the vortex shedding frequency is obtained from fast fourier transform fft of the time history of the calculated lift force figs 9 and 10 show sample time series of c l and c d of the cylinder obtained at the reynolds number of 1 000 and different blockage ratios it is clearly seen in fig 9 that as the blockage ratio is increased from 1 6 to 1 3 the drag coefficient increases steadily from 0 93 to 1 10 when the blockage ratio is increased further to 1 2 there is a sudden jump of the mean drag coefficient from about 1 10 to 1 70 further it is observable in fig 10 that increasing the blockage ratio causes the lift coefficient to fluctuate at an increased frequency i e a higher blockage ratio results in more shedding cycles over the same time period which reflects the enhancement of the vortex shedding frequency 4 2 1 fluctuating lift coefficient fig 11 plots the fluctuating lift coefficient of the circular cylinder as a function of the cylinder reynolds number at blockage ratios from β 0 to β 1 2 the plotted data includes the numerical data of singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 for re cyl up to 250 the experimental data of richter and naudascher 1976 for re cyl above 20 000 and the results from the present investigation for re cyl between 300 and 30 000 overall the present results of the fluctuating lift coefficient with changing reynolds number and blockage ratios are consistent with those reported by singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 and richter and naudascher 1976 for laminar and turbulent flows respectively it is seen in fig 11 that the increase of the blockage ratio results in two opposing behaviours of the c l in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes for 300 re cyl 1 000 the effects of the blockage on the fluctuating lift coefficients are very weak when the blockage ratio is smaller than 1 3 as can be seen in fig 11 the three c l curves for the blockage ratios of 1 6 1 4 and 1 3 almost overlap with each other except for a slight drop as the blockage ratio is increased from 1 6 to 1 3 however a further increase of the blockage ratio to 1 2 results in a remarkable drop of c l at re cyl 300 and 500 the cause to the reduction of c l with increasing blockage ratio is associated with the appearances of the secondary vortices and consequent formation of the reverse karman vortex street the presence of the secondary vortices on the top and bottom walls for β 1 3 and 1 2 results in relatively stronger gap flows between the cylinder and the channel walls which force the primary vortices to shed earlier than those expected for unconfined cylinders the relatively smaller primary vortices result in smaller c l in the confined flows refer to singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 further it is interesting to see in fig 11 that the ascending behaviour of the c l with increasing reynolds number beyond re cyl 3 900 at different blockage ratios is the replica of the c l behaviour of the unconfined cylinder this growth of the c l indicates that the flow is entering into a different flow regime for reynolds numbers from o 104 to o 105 clearly the effect of the blockage ratio on the c l becomes more pronounced in this regime it is also noticed in the figure that there is a distinct mismatch of c l at β 1 2 and re cyl 30 000 between the present simulation and the experimental measurement of richter and naudascher 1976 the reason for this deviation is unknown and further experimental and numerical investigations are needed to resolve the discrepancy 4 2 2 mean drag coefficient the mean drag coefficients calculated using the present numerical models for re cyl 300 30 000 at four blockage ratios are plotted in fig 12 along with the experimental measurement of richter and naudascher 1976 and the numerical prediction of singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 other data reported in the literature for similar blockage ratios are also included in the figure in general the present prediction of the mean drag behaviour in both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes is consistent with those reported in the literature it is clear in fig 12 that a higher blockage ratio generally results in a higher drag coefficient for reynolds numbers up to 30 000 the effect of the reynolds number on the mean drag coefficient is more pronounced at large blockage ratios for instance at β 1 2 the mean drag coefficient is significantly higher than that at the lower blockage ratios further the mean drag coefficient reduces sharply with the increasing reynolds number from 100 to 1 000 and increases sharply with increasing reynolds number beyond 1 000 the blockage effect on the mean drag coefficient is negligible for re cyl 1 000 and β 1 4 fig 12 also shows a major mismatch between the present prediction and the experimental data of richter and naudascher 1976 for re cyl 20 000 and 30 000 at β 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 while the cause of the mismatch is unknown the results of el sherbiny 1972 for re 30 000 at the blockage ratios of 26 5 and 35 5 are consistent with the present predictions at β 1 4 and 1 3 respectively further the results from hiwada and mabuchi 1981 for re 45 000 at various blockage ratios are also close to the present predictions 4 2 3 strouhal number the strouhal number calculated using the present numerical models over the ranges of the reynolds numbers and blockage ratios are plotted in fig 13 along with the experimental and numerical data of richter and naudascher 1976 and singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 it is seen in fig 13 that the strouhal number is susceptible to the changes of both the blockage ratio and the reynolds number the increase of the blockage ratio results in an increase of the strouhal number over the full range of the reynolds numbers but the increase of the reynolds number causes different behaviours of the st in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes overall the present numerical models predict consistent strouhal number behaviour with those reported previously in terms of its dependence on the reynolds number and the blockage ratio it is also interesting to note that the change of the st with the reynolds number correlates to the behaviour of the fluctuating lift coefficient for example at β 1 2 the st increases while the c l decreases with increasing reynolds number for 300 re cyl 3 900 and for 3 900 re cyl 30 000 the c l increases significantly while the st reduces gradually see figs 11 and 13 this observation suggests that it is impossible to achieve a very high fluctuating lift coefficient and a high vortex shedding frequency simultaneously 5 conclusions this study has examined the hydrodynamic properties of and the flow features behind a circular cylinder in confined flows by three dimensional numerical simulations the range of the blockage ratios under consideration is from 0 to 1 2 and the range of the reynolds numbers is from 300 to 30 000 the present numerical results show that a reverse karman vortex street is present in the wake of the cylinder at all blockage ratios for re cyl 1 000 and its formation is a result of the interaction between the shear layers on the cylinder and those on the two lateral walls it is found that the invert location depends on both the reynolds number and the blockage ratio at high reynolds numbers re cyl 1 000 the reverse karman vortex street is not observed and the vortex cores are aligned in a single row with an alternate arrangement in the wake behind the cylinder the present study has also fulfilled the gap of data for the fluctuating lift coefficient the mean drag coefficient and the strouhal number in the transitional to turbulent flow regimes at different blockage ratios it is found that a higher blockage ratio results in a greater drag coefficient and a higher strouhal number however the fluctuating lift coefficient behaves differently with the changing blockage ratio in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes it decreases with increasing blockage ratio in laminar flows and increases with increasing blockage ratio in turbulent flows corresponding experiments are required to validate the present simulations credit authorship contribution

21126,the hydrodynamics of a circular cylinder in confined flows have great significance to fundamental fluid mechanics and engineering applications however a major gap of knowledge exists regarding the impact of blockage on the hydrodynamic properties of the cylinder including the fluctuating lift coefficient c l mean drag coefficient c d and strouhal number st to fill the knowledge gap three dimensional numerical simulations are conducted at blockage ratios up to β 1 2 where β d h d and h are the cylinder diameter and channel height respectively and reynolds numbers from re 300 to 30 000 the present study reveals that confinement causes a significant increase of c d and st whereas different behaviours of c l are observed in laminar and turbulent flow regimes further a reverse karman vortex street is observed at all blockage ratios between 1 6 and 1 2 for reynolds numbers less than 1 000 the invert location where the vortex trajectories originating from the top and bottom of the cylinder intersect in the wake depends on the reynolds number and the blockage ratio at reynolds numbers above 1 000 the reverse karman vortex street does not occur and the vortices organise themselves in a single row with an alternate arrangement in the wake keywords blockage ratio vortex shedding drag lift strouhal number reverse karman vortex street 1 introduction 1 1 overview research on flows over a stationary cylinder has been conducted for many decades in experimental studies the cylinder is typically positioned symmetrically across the depth of a flow channel assuming the cylinder is horizontal under this configuration the ratio between the cylinder s diameter d and the channel height h is defined as the blockage ratio β that is 1 β d h it is generally recommended to keep the blockage ratio below 5 to avoid any negative effects from the sidewalls prasanth et al 2006 many researchers have reported that a high blockage ratio may progressively influence the hydrodynamic characteristics of the cylinder and significantly alter the wake downstream for instance west and apelt 1982 experimentally observed a gradual increase of the pressure drag at blockage ratios from 6 to 16 they also observed an increase of the strouhal number with the blockage ratio el sherbiny 1972 conducted an experiment with a confined cylinder at reynolds numbers re ranging from 10 000 to 120 000 and β 35 5 and reported that the pressure drag and the lift coefficients increased significantly with increasing blockage ratio further richter and naudascher 1976 showed that the fluctuating lift coefficient is approximately seven times higher than that of an unconfined cylinder at re 50 000 and β 50 further reports on the changes of the strouhal number and the hydrodynamic coefficients with the blockage ratio can be found in the studies of hiwada and mabuchi 1981 khan and mughal 2006 so and savkar 1980 in engineering applications the blockage effects may be beneficial for heat transfer enhancement mixing and energy harvesting by vortex induced vibration viv previous studies have demonstrated that the local heat transfer of a channel flow is greatly enhanced by disturbing the flow with a circular cylinder placed in the middle of the channel hiwada and mabuchi 1981 oyakawa and mabuchi 1981 the higher the blockage ratio is the higher the heat transfer rate the heat transfer enhancement can reach up to 40 at the blockage ratio of 60 mathis et al 2016 mathis et al 2014 further a high blockage ratio also causes a significant increase in the lift coefficient of the cylinder this is useful for designing energy harvesting devices by enhancing viv of the confined circular cylinder s as indicated by soti and de 2020 and jiang et al 2013 it is understood that the presence of the sidewalls constricts the cross flow which essentially causes a greater pressure variation on the cylinder surface the flow passing through the gaps between the cylinder and the sidewalls is accelerated causing the vortices to shed from the cylinder at an increased rate as a result the pressure drag and the strouhal number are greatly enhanced hiwada and mabuchi 1981 observed an exponential increase of both the pressure drag and the strouhal number when the flow was constricted at blockage ratios between 40 and 60 for blockage ratios above 60 no dominant frequency was found in their spectral analysis indicating a suppression of the vortex shedding in addition to the primary vortex shedding from the cylinder vortices are also shed from the sidewalls which are related to the appearance of the reverse karman vortex street singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 or also known as criss cross motion suzuki et al 1993 shair et al 1963 carried out experiments to study the effect of high blockage ratios β 20 on the stability of the wake it was found that the critical reynolds number re crit at which vortex shedding starts to appear is strongly dependent on the blockage ratio more specifically the instability of the wake is observed at re crit 130 for β 20 while the critical reynolds number for unbounded flows is widely reported at re crit 47 subsequently chen et al 1995 expanded the range of re crit for β 70 in a two dimensional simulation and sahin and owens 2004 further extended re crit for β 90 griffith et al 2011 conducted a two dimensional computational study to visualise the confined flow structure at re 300 and β 50 by using floquet stability analysis the authors observed the occurrence of modes a and b instabilities at re 160 and 290 respectively using the same methodology camarri and giannetti 2010 observed modes a and b instabilities for β 20 at re 204 and 256 respectively at β 33 3 rehimi et al 2008 demonstrated modes a and b instabilities at re 159 and 400 respectively in a particle image velocimetry piv experiment for comparisons modes a and b of the wake instability for unconfined flows are reported to occur at re about 190 and 230 respectively williamson 1996 overall the blockage ratio not only affects the hydrodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinder but also modifies the flow field in the near wake the effects are insignificant when the blockage ratio is relatively small say β 5 10 for higher blockage ratios some correctional models have been proposed to compensate the blockage effects which are well documented by zdravkovich 1997 1 2 gap of knowledge fig 1 summarises the results of the fluctuating lift coefficient at various reynolds numbers and blockage ratios taken from two representative investigations one is the experimental study of richter and naudascher 1976 who measured the hydrodynamic forces of a cylinder at four blockage ratios from 1 6 to 1 2 with re from 20 000 to 400 000 the other is the numerical study of singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 who examined the hydrodynamic properties of a cylinder at six blockage ratios from 1 8 to 1 2 for reynolds numbers up to 250 it is clear in fig 1 that a major gap of knowledge exists regarding the behaviour of the fluctuating lift coefficient at blockage ratios from 1 6 to 1 2 over the reynolds number range between 250 and 20 000 similarly a knowledge gap also exists for the drag coefficient and the strouhal number over the same parameter ranges to our best knowledge no study to date has fulfilled the above knowledge gaps by either numerical or experimental investigations in this study a series of three dimensional 3 d numerical simulations are carried out to address the issue blockage ratios from 1 6 to 1 2 and reynolds number from 300 to 30 000 are calculated also investigated in this study is the reverse karman vortex street phenomenon in what follows section 2 will introduce two types of flows relevant to a confined cylinder and the relationship between the reynolds numbers characterising the two types of flows sections 3 and 4 will describe the details of the numerical models dependence tests and numerical results finally the major findings of this study will be summarised in section 5 2 flow classification 2 1 ambiguity of two co existing flows the problem of a circular cylinder in a confined flow considered in this study may be classified in two distinct ways one as an internal flow through a confined flow channel and the other as an external flow past a circular cylinder accordingly the flow may be characterised by two reynolds numbers for a channel flow the reynolds number is defined as 2 r e c h n 2 h u m ν where u m and ν are the mean flow velocity across the channel height h and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid respectively for an external flow past an unconfined cylinder the reynolds number is defined as follow 3 r e d u 0 ν where u 0 is the free stream velocity the co existing internal and external flows involve two reynolds numbers consequently there is an ambiguity in choosing an appropriate reynolds number to characterise the flow most of the previous studies focus on the state of the flow over the cylinder without considering the state of the channel flow e g el sherbiny 1972 richter and naudascher 1976 chen et al 1995 sahin and owens 2004 singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 mathupriya et al 2018 2 2 relationship between the two reynolds numbers to properly address the flow regime of the combined channel cylinder flow a relationship between the two reynolds numbers needs to be established the presence of the cylinder in a flow channel may lead to a scenario in which the downstream flow becomes turbulent while the upstream flow is laminar nevertheless the confined flow is mainly characterised by the state of the upstream flow regardless of the flow conditions downstream for simplicity fully developed flow conditions are assumed in this study and both the cylinder length and the channel width are assumed to be infinite with such assumptions the reynolds number re cyl for the flow past the confined cylinder which differs from the reynolds number re for an unconfined cylinder given in equation 3 above is defined in term of the centreline velocity u c as 4 r e c y l d u c ν it is worth noting that in the literature different characteristic velocities have been used to define the reynolds number of the flow past a confined cylinder chen et al 1995 mitry 1977 sahin and owens 2004 shair et al 1963 among them the centreline velocity is widely used kanaris et al 2011 sahin and owens 2004 singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 as it can be easily measured in experiments combining equations 2 and 4 and substituting β d h yields the relationship between the reynolds numbers of the channel flow and the flow past the confined cylinder as follows 5 r e c h n 2 β u m u c r e c y l for fully developed turbulent channel flows re chn 2 800 the ratio between u m and u c is approaching unity therefore equation 5 may be simplified as 6 r e c h n 2 β r e c y l f o r r e c h n 2 800 in contrast for fully developed laminar channel flows re chn 2 800 u m u c equals to 2 3 whan and rothfus 1959 hanks and rou 1966 hanks 1967 accordingly equation 5 can be rewritten as 7 r e c h n 4 3 β r e c y l f o r r e c h n 2 800 equation 5 7 indicate the reynolds number relationship between the channel flow and the flow past the confined cylinder which depends on the blockage ratio since the blockage ratio must be less than 1 0 otherwise there is no flow through the channel and the blockage effect is negligible for β 0 05 equation 5 7 are applicable for 0 05 β 1 0 3 numerical approaches and tests 3 1 computational domain and boundary conditions in this study the commercial cfd package ansys fluent version 18 2 which is a finite volume based cfd solver ansys inc 2013 is adopted the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 2 a cylinder of diameter d is symmetrically positioned between two parallel walls separated by a distance h which is varied to achieve the desired blockage ratios as suggested by chen et al 1995 the streamwise length of the computational domain should be three fold of the distance from the inlet to the cylinder axis to reduce negative effects on the recirculation zone behind the cylinder here the upstream length from the inlet to the cylinder axis is set to 15d while the outlet is located at 30d downstream lei cheng and kavanagh 2001 recommended that the spanwise length of the cylinder should be at least twice of the cylinder diameter here the spanwise length is set to πd with the cartesian coordinate system defined in fig 2 the computational domain is confined to 15d x 30d h 2 y h 2 and 0 z πd where x y z refer to the streamwise lateral and spanwise directions respectively table 1 summarises the reynolds numbers considered in selected numerical studies and the corresponding locations of the outlet boundary adopted in the simulations as shown in table 1 the outflow locations adopted in the previous studies are typically around 20d to 30d although the previous studies are on unconfined flows whereas the present study is concerned with confined flows the highest reynolds number considered in this study is significantly lower than those of unconfined flows considered by others alonzo garcía et al 2015 kim 2006 lee and yang 2017 lloyd and james 2016 accordingly it is deemed acceptable to place the outlet boundary at 30d from the cylinder the boundary conditions applied in the numerical models are as follows velocity inlet and fully developed flow conditions are prescribed at the inlet and outlet respectively rigid no slip wall conditions are prescribed on the surface of the cylinder and the top and bottom boundaries and periodic conditions are assumed in the spanwise direction different velocity profiles are specified at the inlet depending on the cylinder reynolds number for re cyl 1 000 a parabolic velocity profile for the poiseuille flow is imposed at the inlet as 8 u y u c 1 4 y h 2 for re cyl 1 000 the velocity profile at the inlet is determined numerically from separate 3 d simulations of flow through a long channel without the cylinder 3 2 numerical models 3 2 1 laminar model it is anticipated that the critical reynolds number for the laminar to turbulent transition of a confined flow depends on the blockage ratio which is unknown in the literature for an external flow past a circular cylinder at re 1 000 a laminar model is usually adopted accordingly we used a laminar model to resolve the confined flows with re cyl 1 000 in this study it is worth noting that in this paper laminar flow refers to the flow calculated using a laminar model which directly solves the following navier stokes equations for 3 d incompressible flows 9 u i t u j u i x i 1 ρ p x i ν u i 2 x j x j i j 1 2 3 10 u i x i 0 where x 1 x 2 x 3 x y z are the cartesian coordinates refer to fig 2 u i is the velocity component in the x i direction the t is the time and p is the pressure 3 2 2 turbulent model large eddy simulation les model is adopted to calculate flows with re cyl 1 000 the filtered navier stoke equations for incompressible flows are written as 11 u i t x j u i u j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i x j x j τ i j x j i j 1 2 3 12 u i x i 0 where u i is the filtered velocity component p is the filtered pressure and τ ij is sub grid scale sgs stress tensor which is defined as 13 τ i j u i u j u i u j the sgs turbulent stresses are modelled as 14 τ i j 1 3 τ k k δ i j 2 μ t s i j where τ k k is the isotropic part of the sgs stress and s i j is the resolved rate of strain tensor given by 15 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the sgs wale wall adapting local eddy viscosity model which was adopted by wornom et al 2011 for unconfined flows past a cylinder at 3 900 re 20 000 is adopted in this study the eddy viscosity μ t in the sgs wale model is given by 16 μ t ρ l s 2 s i j d s i j d 3 2 s i j s i j 5 2 s i j d s i j d 5 4 where l s and s i j d are calculated as follows 17 l s min κ d c w v 1 3 18 s i j d 1 2 g i j 2 g j i 2 1 3 δ i j g k k 2 g i j u i x j the wale constant c w is set to 0 325 as recommended in the ansys fluent theory guide ansys inc 2013 3 3 numerical schemes the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations scheme is adopted for resolving the pressure velocity coupling in both laminar and turbulent models in the laminar model the second order central differencing and second order upwind schemes are applied to the pressure terms and advection terms respectively and the second order implicit scheme is adopted for the transient formulation in the les model the bounded central differencing and bounded second order implicit schemes are applied for the spatial discretization and the transient formulation respectively 3 4 dependence tests the sensitivities of numerical results such as the fluctuating lift coefficient c l the mean drag coefficient c d the strouhal number st and the negative base pressure c pb to the mesh resolution time step and convergence criteria i e the residuals are evaluated for the laminar and turbulent models respectively the general procedures adopted for the mesh dependence tests at various blockage ratios are as follows firstly a structured mesh is constructed for a cylinder in an unconfined flow and a mesh dependence test is carried out to determine a suitable mesh for resolving the flow over the unconfined cylinder subsequently the computational domain is truncated from both sides in the lateral direction to obtain a blockage ratio of 1 6 the smallest blockage ratio considered in this study the mesh resolution in the vicinity of the cylinder is preserved while the meshes near the top and bottom boundaries are reconstructed to resolve the wall boundary layers the grid in the wake region up to 10d downstream from the cylinder axis is further refined to resolve the complex wake flow structures the same domain truncation and mesh refinement processes are repeated for the blockage ratios of 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 in sequence further details of the dependence tests for the laminar and turbulent flows are briefly described below 3 4 1 laminar flows for laminar flows we first carry out a two dimensional 2 d mesh dependence test for an unconfined cylinder at re 1 000 the computational domain adopted for this test is bounded by 15d x 30d and 10d y 10d starting with a coarse mesh refer to m02 in table 2 the sensitivity of the monitored flow parameters to the mesh resolution and the time step is tested by keeping the cfl courant freidrichs lewy number less than unity and constant in doing so we double the number of mesh elements from m02 and in the meantime halve the time step refer to m02 d1 in table 2 the same process is repeated for a second time m02 d2 specific details of the mesh sizes time steps and the corresponding results are given in table 2 here the results obtained with m02 and m02 d1 are compared with those obtained with m02 d2 and the variations in percentages are shown in brackets it is seen in the table that the variations of the calculated hydrodynamic properties of interest among these three sets of results are all below 3 considering the significant demand of computing resources for 3 d calculations m02 with a minimum radial spacing δr min 10 3 d the first cell off the cylinder surface 120 nodes around the cylinder circumference and the non dimensional time step δt 2 01 10 4 is chosen for the subsequent 3 d tests in this study the time is normalised as t tu c d where t is the dimensional time the same normalisation applies to the time step δt subsequently a 3 d mesh is constructed by replicating m02 along the spanwise direction the spanwise length of the computational domain is πd the time step determined from the above 2 d test is adopted in the 3 d tests the dependence of the numerical results on the spanwise grid resolution δz is evaluated in doing so the 3 d calculations with different spanwise grid resolutions are extended up to 500 non dimensional time approximately 90 vortex shedding cycles and the variations of the hydrodynamic properties such as the drag lift strouhal number and negative base pressure of the cylinder with the spanwise grid resolution are examined table 3 shows the results obtained from the spanwise grid resolution test in table 3 the percentage variations are relative to the results obtained with the finest mesh m02 4 the results show that the grid resolution in the spanwise direction significantly affects the predicted hydrodynamic properties of the cylinder there is a dramatic drop nearly four times of the predicted fluctuating lift coefficient when δz is reduced from 0 2d to 0 03d further there are considerable variations of the predicted mean drag coefficient and the negative base pressure whereas the strouhal number only varies slightly since m02 3 gives relatively small variations of the hydrodynamic properties less than 3 compared to those of m02 4 it is chosen for further tests subsequently the residuals for the convergence of the continuity and momentum equations are tested with m02 3 it is found that the residuals of 10 5 for both the continuity and momentum equations are adequate for laminar flows up to re 1 000 to ensure better numerical accuracy all the residuals are set to 10 6 in this study the above dependence tests indicate that the mesh m02 3 with 1 026 million cells and the spanwise resolution δz 0 05d is adequate for resolving the laminar flows past an unconfined cylinder with re 1 000 in each of the above described mesh time step and residual dependence tests the numerical uncertainty is estimated to be less than 3 for the predicted mean drag fluctuating lift strouhal number and negative base pressure following the above 3 d tests for an unconfined cylinder the computational domain is truncated in the lateral direction to achieve the blockage ratio of 1 6 as mentioned above the quality of the mesh near the cylinder is preserved after the truncation of the computational domain while the meshes near the lateral boundaries are reconstructed the sensitivity of the numerical results to the time step and the mesh resolutions in the spanwise direction and in the x y plane is then tested and an appropriate 3 d mesh with local refinement in the near wake region up to 10d from the cylinder axis refer to fig 3 is identified for this blockage ratio subsequently the computational domain is further truncated to achieve the higher blockage ratios of 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 respectively the time step and spanwise grid resolution are kept the same as those for the blockage ratio of 1 6 and only the sensitivity of the numerical results to the mesh resolution in the x y plane is tested at the higher blockage ratios similarly an appropriate mesh with local refinement in the near wake region up to 10d from the cylinder axis is identified at each blockage ratio the overall numerical uncertainty is estimated to be below 3 according to the dependence tests at each blockage ratio for a confined cylinder with re cyl 1 000 3 4 2 transitional and turbulent flows for transitional and turbulent flows a mesh dependence test is conducted first for an unconfined cylinder with re 30 000 in a 3 d domain bounded by 15d x 30d 20d y 20d 0 z πd for this test a relatively coarse mesh with 120 nodes around the circumference of the cylinder and a spanwise grid resolution of 0 1d is constructed initially since properly resolving the flow around the cylinder is the most critical to the prediction of the hydrodynamic properties and the effect of the flow in the far field is less important the region surrounding the cylinder is focused on when refining the mesh we first fix the mesh resolution in the spanwise direction and refine the mesh in the x y plane within the region of 6d from the cylinder axis in doing so the number of nodes along the circumference of the cylinder is doubled from 120 to 240 and the mesh is refined in the radial direction by halving the height of the first cell off the cylinder surface and maintaining the same radial growth rate in the meantime the time step is also halved the same local mesh refinement and time step reduction processes are repeated for a second time which results in the finest mesh with 480 nodes around the cylinder surface following the test of the mesh resolution in the x y plane the mesh resolution in the spanwise direction is then tested by gradually reducing the spanwise cell size δz from 0 1d to 0 03d afterwards the sensitivity of the numerical results to the residual for convergence is checked all the 3 d calculations are extended up to 300 non dimensional time about 60 vortex shedding cycles and the variations of the hydrodynamic properties are examined it is found that a mesh with 4 98 million cells 240 nodes along the circumference of the cylinder a spanwise grid resolution δz 0 03d and δr min 5 10 4 d along with the residuals of 10 6 for both the continuity and momentum equations and the dimensionless time step δt 3 01 10 3 is adequate for resolving the turbulent flows around the unconfined cylinder these settings give y 1 0 for re 30 000 and the overall numerical uncertainty is estimated to be below 3 subsequently the 3 d domain is truncated in the lateral direction to achieve the desired blockage ratio of 1 6 and the meshes near the lateral boundaries are reconstructed details of the mesh and time step dependence test and the corresponding results for β 1 6 are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively in table 5 the percentage variations of all quantities are calculated relative to the results obtained in the base case b16 t it is seen in table 5 that further reducing the time step i e b16 t2 in table 5 and refining the mesh in the spanwise direction and in the x y plane i e b16 tfz and b16 tfxy respectively result in no more than 3 variations of all the predicted quantities for the purpose of capturing the flow structures around the cylinder and in the near wake b16 tfxy is chosen for re cyl 30 000 in the present investigation further tests similar to those described above for the laminar flow past confined cylinders are carried out to check the sensitivity of the results to the time step the spanwise grid resolution and the local mesh refinement in the near wake region up to 10d from the cylinder axis based on these tests a 3 d mesh with local refinement is chosen for this blockage ratio the same processes are repeated for each of the higher blockage ratios β 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 and an appropriate mesh with local refinement is selected for further calculations the numerical uncertainties for all the blockage ratios are estimated to be less than 3 based on the above described dependence tests 3 5 numerical validation to validate the present numerical models several simulations are conducted for flows past a circular cylinder at different blockage ratios and reynolds numbers covering both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes fig 4 shows the comparisons of the predicted pressure coefficient distributions from the present numerical models with published experimental and numerical data fig 4 a and b are for isolated cylinders with re 1 000 and 20 000 respectively and fig 4c is for a confined cylinder with β 1 2 and re 45 000 it is seen in fig 4 that in general the cp predictions from the present computational models show a very good agreement with the published data at re 1 000 only a minor deviation of the cp plot from the experimental measurement of norberg 2002 is observed and at re 45 000 the deviation of the pressure coefficients between the present prediction and the experimental measurement of hiwada and mabuchi 1981 is mainly at the back of the cylinder around the rear stagnation point an excellent agreement with the experimental measurement of norberg 2002 and the numerical prediction of moussaed et al 2014 is achieved for re 20 000 overall the comparisons in fig 4 demonstrate that both the laminar and large eddy simulation models can properly resolve the laminar and turbulent flows past circular cylinders with and without blockage effects this also confirms the validity of the above described mesh time step and residual dependence studies 4 results and discussions 4 1 flow structures fig 5 shows snapshots of the spanwise vortical structures obtained at the blockage ratios of 1 6 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 respectively for re cyl 300 here the vortical structures are visualised using the lambda 2 criterion λ2 due to its ability to capture vortex cores near the walls refer to jeong and hussain 2006 and kanaris et al 2011 the λ2 is the second negative eigenvalue of s2 ω2 where s and ω are the symmetric and antisymmetric part of the gradient velocity tensor respectively in the present study the spanwise vorticity is normalised by u c d as ω z u c d v x u y u c d and λ2 is normalised by u c d 2 as e2 λ2 u c d 2 the iso surfaces of the non dimensional eigenvalue e2 0 2 coloured by the spanwise vorticity are depicted in fig 5 it is clear in fig 5 that the primary vortices generated from either the top or bottom side of the cylinder cross over the x z symmetry plane in the wake this phenomenon is known as reverse karman vortex street refer to camarri and giannetti 2010 and is observed at all blockage ratios for re cyl up to 1 000 in this study in addition smaller vortex cores are visible on the top and bottom walls in the vicinity of the cylinder at β 1 3 and β 1 2 see fig 5c and d which are referred to as secondary vortices the mechanism responsible for the occurrence of the reverse karman vortex street remains controversial in the literature two possible mechanisms have been proposed one is related to the entrainment of the incoming vorticity camarri and giannetti 2007 and the other is related to the interaction between the primary vortices from the cylinder and the two lateral walls i e the top and bottom walls refer to the discussions in zovatto and pedrizzetti 2001 and singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 the present study supports the latter at the relatively low blockage ratios such as 1 6 and 1 4 the interaction between the shear layers on the top and bottom walls with the shear layers on the cylinder is relatively weak and no separation of the wall shear layers is observed however at the higher blockage ratios of 1 3 and 1 2 the gap flows between the cylinder and the top and bottom walls intensify as a result secondary vortices are formed on the top and bottom walls due to separations of the wall shear layers refer to fig 5c and d the interaction of the shear layers on the lateral walls and the cylinder described above causes the formation of the reverse karman vortex street to further illustrate the formation process of the reverse karman vortex street fig 6 shows a full cycle of the flow development at β 1 3 and re cyl 300 the period of the cycle is denoted by t at t 0 refer to fig 6a an elliptically shaped positive secondary vortex sv is present on the top wall at approximately 2d behind the cylinder marked by a thick red dashed circle in the figure this vortex rotates in the same counterclockwise direction as the primary vortex pv shed from the lower side of the cylinder at the same time a negative clockwise sv marked by a thick blue dashed circle is present on the bottom wall at approximately 3d behind the cylinder at t t 4 the negative sv on the bottom wall is entrained into the wake by the positive pv issued from the lower side of the cylinder this negative sv then merges with the negative pv issued from the top side of the cylinder at t t 2 resulting in the negative pv from the top side of the cylinder being pulled across the symmetry plane the merged sv and pv form a large vortex which rolls over downstream between t t 2 and t 3t 4 the positive sv on the top wall is undergoing a similar process i e being entrained into the wake by the negative pv issued from the top side of the cylinder it then merges with the positive pv from the bottom side of the cylinder at a time after t 3t 4 these processes of vortex issuing entrainment and merging occur alternatively between the top and bottom sides of the cylinder which are clearly observable from animated flow development a parameter characterising the reverse karman vortex street phenomenon is the invert location denoted by x inv measured from the cylinder axis where the trajectories of the primary vortices intersect the trajectories of the primary vortices may be obtained by tracking the minima pressure over time refer to camarri and giannetti 2007 alternatively camarri and giannetti 2007 suggested that the invert location may be found by tracking the location where the time averaged velocity defect is recovered in the present investigation the invert locations are obtained using the latter approach the results are plotted in fig 7 for re cyl 1 000 at various blockage ratios it is seen in this figure that for β 1 3 the invert location behind the circular cylinder generally increases with the reynolds number and retains a constant value beyond a certain reynolds number depending on the blockage ratio the behaviour of the invert location at the highest blockage ratio β 1 2 is different from that at the lower blockage ratios it first decreases slightly as the reynolds number increases and then retains a constant value beyond the reynolds number of 700 overall the increase of the blockage ratio causes the invert location to move closer to the cylinder and become less dependent on the reynolds number at medium reynolds numbers 1 000 re cyl 3 900 it is found that the interaction between the primary and secondary vortices becomes weaker at all blockage ratios this is associated with the instability and breakdown of the primary vortices as a result the reverse karman vortex street is not observed at high reynolds numbers re cyl 3 900 the secondary vortices also break down and the wake organises in a single vortex row with an alternate arrangement of clockwise and counterclockwise vortices a snapshot of the iso surface of e2 5 coloured by the spanwise vorticity for re cyl 30 000 and β 1 3 is presented in fig 8 confirming the presence of a single vortex row in the wake the distance between two consecutive vortex cores is approximately 2d 4 2 hydrodynamic properties of the cylinder the hydrodynamic properties of the circular cylinder considered in this study include the fluctuating lift coefficient c l the mean drag coefficient c d and the strouhal number st the fluctuating lift coefficient is calculated as follows 19 c l 1 n i 1 n c l i c l 2 where n c l i c l are the number of data samples in the time series of c l the lift coefficient at discrete time and the time averaged lift coefficient respectively the lift coefficient is defined as 20 c l f l 0 5 ρ u c 2 d l where f l l are the lift force and cylinder length respectively the mean drag coefficient and the strouhal number are defined below 21 c d f d 0 5 ρ u c 2 d l 22 s t f d u c where f d is the drag force and f is the shedding frequency of the primary vortices in this study the vortex shedding frequency is obtained from fast fourier transform fft of the time history of the calculated lift force figs 9 and 10 show sample time series of c l and c d of the cylinder obtained at the reynolds number of 1 000 and different blockage ratios it is clearly seen in fig 9 that as the blockage ratio is increased from 1 6 to 1 3 the drag coefficient increases steadily from 0 93 to 1 10 when the blockage ratio is increased further to 1 2 there is a sudden jump of the mean drag coefficient from about 1 10 to 1 70 further it is observable in fig 10 that increasing the blockage ratio causes the lift coefficient to fluctuate at an increased frequency i e a higher blockage ratio results in more shedding cycles over the same time period which reflects the enhancement of the vortex shedding frequency 4 2 1 fluctuating lift coefficient fig 11 plots the fluctuating lift coefficient of the circular cylinder as a function of the cylinder reynolds number at blockage ratios from β 0 to β 1 2 the plotted data includes the numerical data of singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 for re cyl up to 250 the experimental data of richter and naudascher 1976 for re cyl above 20 000 and the results from the present investigation for re cyl between 300 and 30 000 overall the present results of the fluctuating lift coefficient with changing reynolds number and blockage ratios are consistent with those reported by singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 and richter and naudascher 1976 for laminar and turbulent flows respectively it is seen in fig 11 that the increase of the blockage ratio results in two opposing behaviours of the c l in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes for 300 re cyl 1 000 the effects of the blockage on the fluctuating lift coefficients are very weak when the blockage ratio is smaller than 1 3 as can be seen in fig 11 the three c l curves for the blockage ratios of 1 6 1 4 and 1 3 almost overlap with each other except for a slight drop as the blockage ratio is increased from 1 6 to 1 3 however a further increase of the blockage ratio to 1 2 results in a remarkable drop of c l at re cyl 300 and 500 the cause to the reduction of c l with increasing blockage ratio is associated with the appearances of the secondary vortices and consequent formation of the reverse karman vortex street the presence of the secondary vortices on the top and bottom walls for β 1 3 and 1 2 results in relatively stronger gap flows between the cylinder and the channel walls which force the primary vortices to shed earlier than those expected for unconfined cylinders the relatively smaller primary vortices result in smaller c l in the confined flows refer to singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 further it is interesting to see in fig 11 that the ascending behaviour of the c l with increasing reynolds number beyond re cyl 3 900 at different blockage ratios is the replica of the c l behaviour of the unconfined cylinder this growth of the c l indicates that the flow is entering into a different flow regime for reynolds numbers from o 104 to o 105 clearly the effect of the blockage ratio on the c l becomes more pronounced in this regime it is also noticed in the figure that there is a distinct mismatch of c l at β 1 2 and re cyl 30 000 between the present simulation and the experimental measurement of richter and naudascher 1976 the reason for this deviation is unknown and further experimental and numerical investigations are needed to resolve the discrepancy 4 2 2 mean drag coefficient the mean drag coefficients calculated using the present numerical models for re cyl 300 30 000 at four blockage ratios are plotted in fig 12 along with the experimental measurement of richter and naudascher 1976 and the numerical prediction of singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 other data reported in the literature for similar blockage ratios are also included in the figure in general the present prediction of the mean drag behaviour in both the laminar and turbulent flow regimes is consistent with those reported in the literature it is clear in fig 12 that a higher blockage ratio generally results in a higher drag coefficient for reynolds numbers up to 30 000 the effect of the reynolds number on the mean drag coefficient is more pronounced at large blockage ratios for instance at β 1 2 the mean drag coefficient is significantly higher than that at the lower blockage ratios further the mean drag coefficient reduces sharply with the increasing reynolds number from 100 to 1 000 and increases sharply with increasing reynolds number beyond 1 000 the blockage effect on the mean drag coefficient is negligible for re cyl 1 000 and β 1 4 fig 12 also shows a major mismatch between the present prediction and the experimental data of richter and naudascher 1976 for re cyl 20 000 and 30 000 at β 1 4 1 3 and 1 2 while the cause of the mismatch is unknown the results of el sherbiny 1972 for re 30 000 at the blockage ratios of 26 5 and 35 5 are consistent with the present predictions at β 1 4 and 1 3 respectively further the results from hiwada and mabuchi 1981 for re 45 000 at various blockage ratios are also close to the present predictions 4 2 3 strouhal number the strouhal number calculated using the present numerical models over the ranges of the reynolds numbers and blockage ratios are plotted in fig 13 along with the experimental and numerical data of richter and naudascher 1976 and singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 it is seen in fig 13 that the strouhal number is susceptible to the changes of both the blockage ratio and the reynolds number the increase of the blockage ratio results in an increase of the strouhal number over the full range of the reynolds numbers but the increase of the reynolds number causes different behaviours of the st in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes overall the present numerical models predict consistent strouhal number behaviour with those reported previously in terms of its dependence on the reynolds number and the blockage ratio it is also interesting to note that the change of the st with the reynolds number correlates to the behaviour of the fluctuating lift coefficient for example at β 1 2 the st increases while the c l decreases with increasing reynolds number for 300 re cyl 3 900 and for 3 900 re cyl 30 000 the c l increases significantly while the st reduces gradually see figs 11 and 13 this observation suggests that it is impossible to achieve a very high fluctuating lift coefficient and a high vortex shedding frequency simultaneously 5 conclusions this study has examined the hydrodynamic properties of and the flow features behind a circular cylinder in confined flows by three dimensional numerical simulations the range of the blockage ratios under consideration is from 0 to 1 2 and the range of the reynolds numbers is from 300 to 30 000 the present numerical results show that a reverse karman vortex street is present in the wake of the cylinder at all blockage ratios for re cyl 1 000 and its formation is a result of the interaction between the shear layers on the cylinder and those on the two lateral walls it is found that the invert location depends on both the reynolds number and the blockage ratio at high reynolds numbers re cyl 1 000 the reverse karman vortex street is not observed and the vortex cores are aligned in a single row with an alternate arrangement in the wake behind the cylinder the present study has also fulfilled the gap of data for the fluctuating lift coefficient the mean drag coefficient and the strouhal number in the transitional to turbulent flow regimes at different blockage ratios it is found that a higher blockage ratio results in a greater drag coefficient and a higher strouhal number however the fluctuating lift coefficient behaves differently with the changing blockage ratio in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes it decreases with increasing blockage ratio in laminar flows and increases with increasing blockage ratio in turbulent flows corresponding experiments are required to validate the present simulations credit authorship contribution

21127,offshore and oil gas industries have shown the interest toward the use of dissimilar metals so there is the problem of their joining the aim of this research activity was to analyze the fatigue behaviour of ti6al4v inconel 625 nickel alloy 625 welded joint obtained by laser welding the investigated joint was obtained including intermediate layers of vanadium and aisi 304 stainless steel to enhance the mechanical properties the experimental results in terms of fatigue strength demonstrated a good quality of the obtained joints the temperature of the specimens during the fatigue tests was detected by means of an infrared camera for applying the thermographic method and assessing the fatigue strength the value of the fatigue strength predicted by the thermographic method shows a good agreement with the value obtained from the traditional procedure keywords dissimilar welding fatigue infrared thermography offshore structures thermographic method 1 introduction nowadays the problem of joining different materials represents an important challenge the predominant type of dissimilar welded joints used for shipbuilding applications is represented by the al steel type joint and several experimental investigations are reported in literature boroński et al 2020 corigliano et al 2018 findik 2011 kaya 2018 zhang et al 2015 however al steel joints cannot satisfy their use where more requirements as protection from corrosion which lowers significantly mechanical properties garbatov 2020 woloszyk and garbatov 2020 self weight reduction and higher static and fatigue strengths are needed for many applications as offshore and oil gas structures wang and pei 2019 for this reason other materials are employed in marine environments chandrasekaran and jain 2016 iannuzzi et al 2017 the ti 6al 4v alloy is one of the most used materials thanks to an exceptional combination of low density high mechanical strength and corrosion resistance titanium alloys are used for exploration and production in ocean engineering systems pipelines are currently manufactured with titanium as key component and submerged operations depend on it potential applications of titanium alloys include shafts and pressure housings subsea wellhead and riser components hasson and crowe 1982 peacock 1996 rosenberg 1982 the first application of titanium alloys in dynamic offshore riser systems was a taper stress joint schutz et al 2001 stainless steel which has good corrosion resistant properties is also a material that is often used in offshore structures lemke and harris 1983 syed et al 2016 but it has some negative aspect as higher density and lower tensile strength with respect to titanium alloys inconel alloys are powerful materials because of their corrosion resistance at various temperatures in combination with good mechanical strength this material has been commonly used in offshore processing piping in order to extend the maintenance term and improve the quality of anti corrosion dupont 1996 hibner and shoemaker 2001 silva et al 2012 fasteners made of inconel alloy are also used in offshore and subsea applications due to its high strength properties pires et al 2011 inconel 625 is also applied for the separation of extracted fluids in liquefied natural gas production systems where temperatures can be extremely high in a strong volatile and corrosive environment this alloy presents also excellent fatigue and thermal fatigue strength as well as creep strength it is frequently used to line steel transfer piping in sour gas and gas extraction machinery furthermore inconel 625 has recently been adopted as thermal spray coatings metallic materials to enhance corrosion resistance lópez ortega et al 2018 yung et al 2019 problems arise when two of the aforementioned materials could be used in the same context to minimize weight and to have good tensile and corrosion resistant properties ninomi et al 2007 peacock 1994 indeed up to present only applications of stainless steel inconel 625 joints for offshore and oil gas industry are principally employed milititsky et al 2010 when it comes to titanium alloys because titanium is in general more noble having a higher potential than most other metals commonly used in sea water piping systems it is the other metal not titanium that is damaged if titanium or some other metal with equal galvanic potential is used i e alloy 625 throughout the system galvanic corrosion will not occur t r bulletin 2014 from an engineering point of view it is important to consider bimetallic corrosion of the materials in frequently encountered service environments such as seawater the bimetallic corrosion due to the coupling of the most frequently used alloys in marine environments are collected into four groups according to national physical laboratory 2000 ti alloys and inconel alloys belong to the best performing group namely group 1 that includes all passive alloys which adopt electropositive potentials in sea water and that therefore can be coupled without significant problems this good property of the investigated alloys confirms their applications in seawater for offshore structures thus it seems clear that inconel and titanium alloys being the best performing materials for subsea applications could easily coexist and sometimes could be useful or necessary to connect them both titanium and inconel alloys have good mechanical properties if compared to standard structural steels however some differences make these two alloys suitable to be welded titanium has the highest strength to weight ratio compared to most metals including inconel but inconel is stiffer than titanium at the same time titanium alloys are characterized by lower plasticity nickel based alloys are characterized by good plasticity and smaller brittleness nickel alloys preserve their properties in large ranges of temperatures particularly at elevated temperatures thus the titanium alloys are more indicated when there is a necessity of weight reduction and inconel alloys are needed when higher plasticity and less brittleness are required still these two materials are hardly weldable using both traditional and innovative welding techniques the operating window for obtaining good quality ti inconel joints is generally narrow and requires also very accurate control of the positioning of the laser beam with tolerances less than 0 05 mm chen et al 2011 furthermore the direct welding of the two alloys ti and ni presents different problems formation of fragile compounds high residual stresses segregation in particular the quality of the welded joints is strongly influenced by the formation of brittle intermetallic phases cracks and porosities furthermore due to the difference in terms of thermal expansion coefficient residual stresses are generated during the welding process which can compromise the fatigue performance of the joint direct welding is also complicated by the different density and diffusivity which imply a strong inhomogeneity of the joint the heat treatment which is usually necessary for stress relief within components welded in homogeneous titanium alloy joints is deleterious on the dissimilar joint as due to the different expansion coefficient additional stresses arise along the line of welding which in the area adjacent to the weld bead assume significant values only few studies regarding fibre laser welding chen et al 2011 gao et al 2018 which obtained a tensile strength of about 145 mpa diffusion bonding alemán et al 1995 and explosion welding topolski et al 2016 are reported in literature up to the authors knowledge moreover to the authors knowledge there are no studies in literature reporting fatigue tests which confirm good quality of ti6al4v inconel 625 dissimilar welded joints when dissimilar metals have to be welded is common to use one or more intermediate layers to enhance adhesion mechanical properties i e pure al layers for al steel joints used in shipbuilding corigliano et al 2018 in the present study ti6al4v inconel 625 welded joints were achieved by laser welding the use of intermediate layers was adopted due to the difficulty of directly joining these two materials and to enhance the mechanical properties the main aim of this research activity deals with the fatigue analysis of the investigated ti inconel 625 laser welded joints experimental tests were carried out to assess their fatigue strength the temperature increment of the specimen surface was detected during the fatigue tests by means of an infrared camera the analysis of the thermographic images allowed the assessment of the fatigue strength of the welded joints applying the thermographic method tm the tm based on ir technique is a powerful non contact measurement method for predicting the fatigue strength la rosa and risitano 2000 and the whole s n curve fargione et al 2002 by means of not excessive time consuming tests this experimental method is based on the assumption that the fatigue limit is considered as the highest stress level during a fatigue test producing no temperature increment tm has already been applied successfully to assess the fatigue strength of several kinds of welded joints from simple to more complex joints geometries astarita et al 2019 crupi et al 2007 fan et al 2011 2015 wang et al 2015 williams et al 2013a zhang et al 2014 when complex geometries are investigated generally the zone subjected to the maximum temperature is the same zone where higher stresses and strains are observed as stress concentration areas 2 materials and methods as mentioned it is difficult to achieve high quality welded joints made of ti inconel alloys by direct welding the alternative way is to interpose one or more transition materials in the form of an insert of appropriate thickness considering elements having excellent corrosion resistance the first one to be considered was vanadium v 99 9 of 10 mm which does not form intermetallics with ti alloys vanadium has a body centred cubic crystal structure mechanical properties depend strongly from the degree of hardening the tensile strength varies between 800 mpa for the cold laminated material and 400 mpa after annealing at 450 c for 24 h tomashchuk et al 2015 some preliminary tests with the sole use of vanadium as interlayers showed that vanadium is perfectly compatible with ti alloys but only partially with ni based alloys as inconel 625 this result underlined the need to introduce a further interlayer indeed some literature studies indicated a good miscibility of chromium with vanadium ghosh 2002 thus considering that some stainless steels are weldable to both vanadium tomashchuk et al 2015 and inconel alloys kourdani and derakhshandeh haghighi 2018 mithilesh et al 2014 and have also good corrosion resistance an interlayer made of stainless steel aisi 304 of 15 mm was further introduced full penetration single pass without filler material butt joints were obtained by means of laser welding inert gas was used to protect the melt and welded material the chemical composition of the investigated alloys is reported in table 1 the mechanical properties in terms of yield and ultimate strengths ϭy and ϭu ultimate strain ɛu and modulus of elasticity e of the investigated alloys are reported in table 2 fig 1 reports the final joint the investigated specimens were obtained from the same plate 200 mm length as shown in fig 1 to minimize dispersion due to different welding parameters and conditions the cross section is 2 mm 10 mm fatigue tests were carried out at a frequency of 10 hz using an italsigma servo hydraulic testing machine with a 25 kn load cell during the tests an infrared ir camera was applied to monitor the surface temperature of the specimen the specimens were black painted and the ir camera was calibrated considering the blackbody reference for the surface emissivity the temperature trend during the tests was analyzed by means of a flir systems x6400sc ir camera with a resolution of 640 480 pixels the thermal images were acquired at intervals of 30 s by the flir researchir max software the tests were carried out with a load ratio r 0 1 to avoid buckling since the weld represents a weak section no dog bone specimens shapes were needed the length between the grips was about 160 mm the test was stopped when the specimen was broken into two pieces even though the aim of the present research activity is to perform the fatigue assessment of the investigated welded joints some preliminary static tensile tests were performed and a tensile strength value of 320 mpa was obtained considering that the nominal cross section is 10 mm 2 mm 20 mm2 comparing this data with the values of tensile strength of the investigated alloys it results that the tensile strength of the dissimilar joint is slightly lower to the one of vanadium which has the lowest value of tensile strength however it can be considered a good result due to the difficulty of obtaining a ti6al4v inconel 625 welded joint 3 results and discussion the parameters used and the results obtained are shown in table 3 the same table also reports the fracture zone where v ss means interface between vanadium and aisi 304 stainless steel while ti v means interface between ti6al4v and vanadium as expected considering that heat treated vanadium is the less resistant material and its tensile strength is about 400 mpa all the specimens have fractured in correspondence of one of the welds with vanadium the fracture zone occurs at the interface between ti6al4v and vanadium or at the interface between aisi 304 and vanadium four specimens failed across the interface between ti6al4v and vanadium specimens 4 5 6 8 corresponding to δϭ equal to 180 200 220 mpa while three specimens at the interface between aisi 304 and vanadium specimens 3 7 9 corresponding to δϭ equal to 170 200 220 mpa thus the fracture zone interface between ti6al4v and vanadium or between aisi 304 and vanadium is not dependent on the applied load range the fracture surface of specimen 9 δσ 220 mpa nf 149 345 cycles located at v ss interface was analyzed by means of sem eds as depicted in fig 2 a crack initiation is located near the surface in proximity of a primary α facet crupi et al 2017 fig 2b shows the typical fatigue striations of the slow propagation at the end of fatigue life the propagation was very fast leading to a brittle cleavage fracture fig 2c the assumption that crack initiation is due to a colony of primary α phase is supported by eds which shows an al enriched composition in such area fig 3 salem et al 2008 following the tests carried out it was possible to obtain the s n curve in terms of the stress range δϭ calculated on the cross section of the specimen vs number of cycles to failure as shown in fig 4 the fatigue test was suspended and considered as a run out if the failure did not occur within 5 million cycles the fatigue strength δσ0 exp was assumed as the value of stress range corresponding to a number of cycles of 5 106 cycles in the s n curve the regression curve of the failed specimens is 1 log n 11 723 log δ σ 74 783 equation 1 can be expressed in the following form 2 δ σ 589 4 n 0 085 equations 1 and 2 are obtained considering the nominal stress of the welded joint in the nominal stress based approach the s n curves are used in conjunction with the nominal stress range produced by the fatigue loads applied during the service life however in the real structures nominal stress is not easy to define as in simple laboratory specimens other criteria such as the lefm chapetti and jaureguizahar 2012 and local stress based approaches dong 2001 dong et al 2014 are preferred when the investigated welded joints have complex geometries even if the computational effort is generally greater than for the nominal stress method the result of the fatigue strength at 5 106 cycles is therefore δσ0 exp 159 mpa which is in line with the runout obtained for specimen 2 δσ 160 mpa this value is particularly promising considering that it is even higher than the tensile strength achieved during static tests in gao et al 2018 of the investigated ti inconel joint obtained by means of laser welding technique the authors are aware that the investigated joint in gao et al 2018 is not exactly the same type of welded joint studied in this research activity but it was taken as a reference for comparison since the aim was to obtain a ti inconel transition joint and due to lack of ti6al4v inconel 625 joints literature studies the fatigue strength was predicted by means of the tm it is known that when a specimen is subjected to fatigue loadings higher than its fatigue strength an increment of its superficial temperature is observed during the test la rosa and risitano 2000 the δt n curve was obtained for all the test using an ir camera the ir technique confirmed its suitability in detecting the rupture zone which is identified with the point subjected to the maximum temperature red triangle of the ir maps reported in fig 5 the temperature variation δt was calculated as the actual temperature minus the initial temperature of the specimen surface δt t t t0 the temperature evolution which is related to the internal microstructural changes fan et al 2015 shows the typical three phases crupi et al 2007 fan et al 2011 2015 la rosa and risitano 2000 wang et al 2015 williams et al 2013b zhang et al 2014 as displayed in fig 5 a rapid increment in phase i an almost constant value δts during phase ii and a sudden increase in phase iii just before the specimen failure the tm was applied plotting the stabilized temperature variation δts during phase ii as a function of δσ2 achieving the results shown in fig 6 the fatigue strength evaluated by applying the tm that requires a limited number of specimens is assumed as the stress range level that produces no temperature increment la rosa and risitano 2000 from the graph a regression curve as displayed in fig 6 is obtained the x axis intercept δσ2 0 tm is the value at which there would be no temperature increment during a fatigue tests and it is therefore possible to evaluate the stress range δσ for which no temperature increment would be observed by its square root the so calculated δσ0 tm corresponds to the fatigue strength according to the tm for this reason the fatigue strength value is obtained by the square root value of intercept of the regression line of fig 6 with the x axes this allowed obtaining a fatigue strength value δσ0 tm 149 mpa this result differs only by about 6 from the value obtained by classical experimental tests δσ0 exp 159 mpa the tm showed its effectiveness for the investigated welded joints and further confirmed the quality of the junction the results of other butt joint having a similar geometry including homogeneous joints made of the same base materials used in the present research activity is shown in table 4 the comparison clearly shows the good quality of the ti inconel joint obtained in the present research activity since its fatigue strength is comparable to fatigue strength of vanadium and homogeneous welded joints made of aisi 304 and ti6al4v as welded it also confirms that it is possible to achieve the rupture zones with about the same probability at the interface between vanadium aisi 304 or between vanadium ti 6al4v having these three materials similar fatigue strength when welded 4 conclusions the aim of this research activity was to analyze the fatigue behaviour of a new type of ti6al4v inconel 625 welded joint obtained by laser welding plates of 200 mm length were made with inserts in vanadium and aisi 304 steel due to the difficulty of directly joining titanium to inconel fatigue tests revealed a fatigue strength of 159 mpa which confirms a good quality of the investigated joint the obtained fatigue strength was compared to other welded joints having a similar geometry including homogeneous joints made of the same base materials used in the present research activity the comparison showed

21127,offshore and oil gas industries have shown the interest toward the use of dissimilar metals so there is the problem of their joining the aim of this research activity was to analyze the fatigue behaviour of ti6al4v inconel 625 nickel alloy 625 welded joint obtained by laser welding the investigated joint was obtained including intermediate layers of vanadium and aisi 304 stainless steel to enhance the mechanical properties the experimental results in terms of fatigue strength demonstrated a good quality of the obtained joints the temperature of the specimens during the fatigue tests was detected by means of an infrared camera for applying the thermographic method and assessing the fatigue strength the value of the fatigue strength predicted by the thermographic method shows a good agreement with the value obtained from the traditional procedure keywords dissimilar welding fatigue infrared thermography offshore structures thermographic method 1 introduction nowadays the problem of joining different materials represents an important challenge the predominant type of dissimilar welded joints used for shipbuilding applications is represented by the al steel type joint and several experimental investigations are reported in literature boroński et al 2020 corigliano et al 2018 findik 2011 kaya 2018 zhang et al 2015 however al steel joints cannot satisfy their use where more requirements as protection from corrosion which lowers significantly mechanical properties garbatov 2020 woloszyk and garbatov 2020 self weight reduction and higher static and fatigue strengths are needed for many applications as offshore and oil gas structures wang and pei 2019 for this reason other materials are employed in marine environments chandrasekaran and jain 2016 iannuzzi et al 2017 the ti 6al 4v alloy is one of the most used materials thanks to an exceptional combination of low density high mechanical strength and corrosion resistance titanium alloys are used for exploration and production in ocean engineering systems pipelines are currently manufactured with titanium as key component and submerged operations depend on it potential applications of titanium alloys include shafts and pressure housings subsea wellhead and riser components hasson and crowe 1982 peacock 1996 rosenberg 1982 the first application of titanium alloys in dynamic offshore riser systems was a taper stress joint schutz et al 2001 stainless steel which has good corrosion resistant properties is also a material that is often used in offshore structures lemke and harris 1983 syed et al 2016 but it has some negative aspect as higher density and lower tensile strength with respect to titanium alloys inconel alloys are powerful materials because of their corrosion resistance at various temperatures in combination with good mechanical strength this material has been commonly used in offshore processing piping in order to extend the maintenance term and improve the quality of anti corrosion dupont 1996 hibner and shoemaker 2001 silva et al 2012 fasteners made of inconel alloy are also used in offshore and subsea applications due to its high strength properties pires et al 2011 inconel 625 is also applied for the separation of extracted fluids in liquefied natural gas production systems where temperatures can be extremely high in a strong volatile and corrosive environment this alloy presents also excellent fatigue and thermal fatigue strength as well as creep strength it is frequently used to line steel transfer piping in sour gas and gas extraction machinery furthermore inconel 625 has recently been adopted as thermal spray coatings metallic materials to enhance corrosion resistance lópez ortega et al 2018 yung et al 2019 problems arise when two of the aforementioned materials could be used in the same context to minimize weight and to have good tensile and corrosion resistant properties ninomi et al 2007 peacock 1994 indeed up to present only applications of stainless steel inconel 625 joints for offshore and oil gas industry are principally employed milititsky et al 2010 when it comes to titanium alloys because titanium is in general more noble having a higher potential than most other metals commonly used in sea water piping systems it is the other metal not titanium that is damaged if titanium or some other metal with equal galvanic potential is used i e alloy 625 throughout the system galvanic corrosion will not occur t r bulletin 2014 from an engineering point of view it is important to consider bimetallic corrosion of the materials in frequently encountered service environments such as seawater the bimetallic corrosion due to the coupling of the most frequently used alloys in marine environments are collected into four groups according to national physical laboratory 2000 ti alloys and inconel alloys belong to the best performing group namely group 1 that includes all passive alloys which adopt electropositive potentials in sea water and that therefore can be coupled without significant problems this good property of the investigated alloys confirms their applications in seawater for offshore structures thus it seems clear that inconel and titanium alloys being the best performing materials for subsea applications could easily coexist and sometimes could be useful or necessary to connect them both titanium and inconel alloys have good mechanical properties if compared to standard structural steels however some differences make these two alloys suitable to be welded titanium has the highest strength to weight ratio compared to most metals including inconel but inconel is stiffer than titanium at the same time titanium alloys are characterized by lower plasticity nickel based alloys are characterized by good plasticity and smaller brittleness nickel alloys preserve their properties in large ranges of temperatures particularly at elevated temperatures thus the titanium alloys are more indicated when there is a necessity of weight reduction and inconel alloys are needed when higher plasticity and less brittleness are required still these two materials are hardly weldable using both traditional and innovative welding techniques the operating window for obtaining good quality ti inconel joints is generally narrow and requires also very accurate control of the positioning of the laser beam with tolerances less than 0 05 mm chen et al 2011 furthermore the direct welding of the two alloys ti and ni presents different problems formation of fragile compounds high residual stresses segregation in particular the quality of the welded joints is strongly influenced by the formation of brittle intermetallic phases cracks and porosities furthermore due to the difference in terms of thermal expansion coefficient residual stresses are generated during the welding process which can compromise the fatigue performance of the joint direct welding is also complicated by the different density and diffusivity which imply a strong inhomogeneity of the joint the heat treatment which is usually necessary for stress relief within components welded in homogeneous titanium alloy joints is deleterious on the dissimilar joint as due to the different expansion coefficient additional stresses arise along the line of welding which in the area adjacent to the weld bead assume significant values only few studies regarding fibre laser welding chen et al 2011 gao et al 2018 which obtained a tensile strength of about 145 mpa diffusion bonding alemán et al 1995 and explosion welding topolski et al 2016 are reported in literature up to the authors knowledge moreover to the authors knowledge there are no studies in literature reporting fatigue tests which confirm good quality of ti6al4v inconel 625 dissimilar welded joints when dissimilar metals have to be welded is common to use one or more intermediate layers to enhance adhesion mechanical properties i e pure al layers for al steel joints used in shipbuilding corigliano et al 2018 in the present study ti6al4v inconel 625 welded joints were achieved by laser welding the use of intermediate layers was adopted due to the difficulty of directly joining these two materials and to enhance the mechanical properties the main aim of this research activity deals with the fatigue analysis of the investigated ti inconel 625 laser welded joints experimental tests were carried out to assess their fatigue strength the temperature increment of the specimen surface was detected during the fatigue tests by means of an infrared camera the analysis of the thermographic images allowed the assessment of the fatigue strength of the welded joints applying the thermographic method tm the tm based on ir technique is a powerful non contact measurement method for predicting the fatigue strength la rosa and risitano 2000 and the whole s n curve fargione et al 2002 by means of not excessive time consuming tests this experimental method is based on the assumption that the fatigue limit is considered as the highest stress level during a fatigue test producing no temperature increment tm has already been applied successfully to assess the fatigue strength of several kinds of welded joints from simple to more complex joints geometries astarita et al 2019 crupi et al 2007 fan et al 2011 2015 wang et al 2015 williams et al 2013a zhang et al 2014 when complex geometries are investigated generally the zone subjected to the maximum temperature is the same zone where higher stresses and strains are observed as stress concentration areas 2 materials and methods as mentioned it is difficult to achieve high quality welded joints made of ti inconel alloys by direct welding the alternative way is to interpose one or more transition materials in the form of an insert of appropriate thickness considering elements having excellent corrosion resistance the first one to be considered was vanadium v 99 9 of 10 mm which does not form intermetallics with ti alloys vanadium has a body centred cubic crystal structure mechanical properties depend strongly from the degree of hardening the tensile strength varies between 800 mpa for the cold laminated material and 400 mpa after annealing at 450 c for 24 h tomashchuk et al 2015 some preliminary tests with the sole use of vanadium as interlayers showed that vanadium is perfectly compatible with ti alloys but only partially with ni based alloys as inconel 625 this result underlined the need to introduce a further interlayer indeed some literature studies indicated a good miscibility of chromium with vanadium ghosh 2002 thus considering that some stainless steels are weldable to both vanadium tomashchuk et al 2015 and inconel alloys kourdani and derakhshandeh haghighi 2018 mithilesh et al 2014 and have also good corrosion resistance an interlayer made of stainless steel aisi 304 of 15 mm was further introduced full penetration single pass without filler material butt joints were obtained by means of laser welding inert gas was used to protect the melt and welded material the chemical composition of the investigated alloys is reported in table 1 the mechanical properties in terms of yield and ultimate strengths ϭy and ϭu ultimate strain ɛu and modulus of elasticity e of the investigated alloys are reported in table 2 fig 1 reports the final joint the investigated specimens were obtained from the same plate 200 mm length as shown in fig 1 to minimize dispersion due to different welding parameters and conditions the cross section is 2 mm 10 mm fatigue tests were carried out at a frequency of 10 hz using an italsigma servo hydraulic testing machine with a 25 kn load cell during the tests an infrared ir camera was applied to monitor the surface temperature of the specimen the specimens were black painted and the ir camera was calibrated considering the blackbody reference for the surface emissivity the temperature trend during the tests was analyzed by means of a flir systems x6400sc ir camera with a resolution of 640 480 pixels the thermal images were acquired at intervals of 30 s by the flir researchir max software the tests were carried out with a load ratio r 0 1 to avoid buckling since the weld represents a weak section no dog bone specimens shapes were needed the length between the grips was about 160 mm the test was stopped when the specimen was broken into two pieces even though the aim of the present research activity is to perform the fatigue assessment of the investigated welded joints some preliminary static tensile tests were performed and a tensile strength value of 320 mpa was obtained considering that the nominal cross section is 10 mm 2 mm 20 mm2 comparing this data with the values of tensile strength of the investigated alloys it results that the tensile strength of the dissimilar joint is slightly lower to the one of vanadium which has the lowest value of tensile strength however it can be considered a good result due to the difficulty of obtaining a ti6al4v inconel 625 welded joint 3 results and discussion the parameters used and the results obtained are shown in table 3 the same table also reports the fracture zone where v ss means interface between vanadium and aisi 304 stainless steel while ti v means interface between ti6al4v and vanadium as expected considering that heat treated vanadium is the less resistant material and its tensile strength is about 400 mpa all the specimens have fractured in correspondence of one of the welds with vanadium the fracture zone occurs at the interface between ti6al4v and vanadium or at the interface between aisi 304 and vanadium four specimens failed across the interface between ti6al4v and vanadium specimens 4 5 6 8 corresponding to δϭ equal to 180 200 220 mpa while three specimens at the interface between aisi 304 and vanadium specimens 3 7 9 corresponding to δϭ equal to 170 200 220 mpa thus the fracture zone interface between ti6al4v and vanadium or between aisi 304 and vanadium is not dependent on the applied load range the fracture surface of specimen 9 δσ 220 mpa nf 149 345 cycles located at v ss interface was analyzed by means of sem eds as depicted in fig 2 a crack initiation is located near the surface in proximity of a primary α facet crupi et al 2017 fig 2b shows the typical fatigue striations of the slow propagation at the end of fatigue life the propagation was very fast leading to a brittle cleavage fracture fig 2c the assumption that crack initiation is due to a colony of primary α phase is supported by eds which shows an al enriched composition in such area fig 3 salem et al 2008 following the tests carried out it was possible to obtain the s n curve in terms of the stress range δϭ calculated on the cross section of the specimen vs number of cycles to failure as shown in fig 4 the fatigue test was suspended and considered as a run out if the failure did not occur within 5 million cycles the fatigue strength δσ0 exp was assumed as the value of stress range corresponding to a number of cycles of 5 106 cycles in the s n curve the regression curve of the failed specimens is 1 log n 11 723 log δ σ 74 783 equation 1 can be expressed in the following form 2 δ σ 589 4 n 0 085 equations 1 and 2 are obtained considering the nominal stress of the welded joint in the nominal stress based approach the s n curves are used in conjunction with the nominal stress range produced by the fatigue loads applied during the service life however in the real structures nominal stress is not easy to define as in simple laboratory specimens other criteria such as the lefm chapetti and jaureguizahar 2012 and local stress based approaches dong 2001 dong et al 2014 are preferred when the investigated welded joints have complex geometries even if the computational effort is generally greater than for the nominal stress method the result of the fatigue strength at 5 106 cycles is therefore δσ0 exp 159 mpa which is in line with the runout obtained for specimen 2 δσ 160 mpa this value is particularly promising considering that it is even higher than the tensile strength achieved during static tests in gao et al 2018 of the investigated ti inconel joint obtained by means of laser welding technique the authors are aware that the investigated joint in gao et al 2018 is not exactly the same type of welded joint studied in this research activity but it was taken as a reference for comparison since the aim was to obtain a ti inconel transition joint and due to lack of ti6al4v inconel 625 joints literature studies the fatigue strength was predicted by means of the tm it is known that when a specimen is subjected to fatigue loadings higher than its fatigue strength an increment of its superficial temperature is observed during the test la rosa and risitano 2000 the δt n curve was obtained for all the test using an ir camera the ir technique confirmed its suitability in detecting the rupture zone which is identified with the point subjected to the maximum temperature red triangle of the ir maps reported in fig 5 the temperature variation δt was calculated as the actual temperature minus the initial temperature of the specimen surface δt t t t0 the temperature evolution which is related to the internal microstructural changes fan et al 2015 shows the typical three phases crupi et al 2007 fan et al 2011 2015 la rosa and risitano 2000 wang et al 2015 williams et al 2013b zhang et al 2014 as displayed in fig 5 a rapid increment in phase i an almost constant value δts during phase ii and a sudden increase in phase iii just before the specimen failure the tm was applied plotting the stabilized temperature variation δts during phase ii as a function of δσ2 achieving the results shown in fig 6 the fatigue strength evaluated by applying the tm that requires a limited number of specimens is assumed as the stress range level that produces no temperature increment la rosa and risitano 2000 from the graph a regression curve as displayed in fig 6 is obtained the x axis intercept δσ2 0 tm is the value at which there would be no temperature increment during a fatigue tests and it is therefore possible to evaluate the stress range δσ for which no temperature increment would be observed by its square root the so calculated δσ0 tm corresponds to the fatigue strength according to the tm for this reason the fatigue strength value is obtained by the square root value of intercept of the regression line of fig 6 with the x axes this allowed obtaining a fatigue strength value δσ0 tm 149 mpa this result differs only by about 6 from the value obtained by classical experimental tests δσ0 exp 159 mpa the tm showed its effectiveness for the investigated welded joints and further confirmed the quality of the junction the results of other butt joint having a similar geometry including homogeneous joints made of the same base materials used in the present research activity is shown in table 4 the comparison clearly shows the good quality of the ti inconel joint obtained in the present research activity since its fatigue strength is comparable to fatigue strength of vanadium and homogeneous welded joints made of aisi 304 and ti6al4v as welded it also confirms that it is possible to achieve the rupture zones with about the same probability at the interface between vanadium aisi 304 or between vanadium ti 6al4v having these three materials similar fatigue strength when welded 4 conclusions the aim of this research activity was to analyze the fatigue behaviour of a new type of ti6al4v inconel 625 welded joint obtained by laser welding plates of 200 mm length were made with inserts in vanadium and aisi 304 steel due to the difficulty of directly joining titanium to inconel fatigue tests revealed a fatigue strength of 159 mpa which confirms a good quality of the investigated joint the obtained fatigue strength was compared to other welded joints having a similar geometry including homogeneous joints made of the same base materials used in the present research activity the comparison showed the good quality of the ti inconel joints obtained in the present research activity since its fatigue strength is comparable to the fatigue strength vanadium and of homogeneous welded joints made of aisi 304 and ti6al4v as welded specimens the ir technique was used to monitor the weld and showed its capability of detecting with the maximum temperature the fracture zone furthermore the tm was applied and showed a fatigue strength value in accordance with the results obtained from standard fatigue tests demonstrating its suitability also for this kind of welded joints credit authorship

21128,trading off the capital expenditure and dynamic performance of the substructure through optimization techniques is the key to wide application of floating wind turbines fwt in the energy industry the optimization of floating substructure is a high dimensional problem sensitivity analysis can help reducing the dimensions of design space by highlighting the most relevant design parameters to potential objective functions or to constraints and increasing the understanding in the interrelationship of various parameters throughout the design space this paper evaluates the influence of the hull main dimensions and mooring system parameters on the manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics of a four column semi submersible fwt two widely used global sensitivity analysis methods the variance based method and the density based method are employed to measure the sensitivity contributions of 10 design parameters the column radius is found to be one of the most influential factors for substructure manufacturing cost and surge natural frequency while the platform pitch and tower fore aft natural frequency are more sensitive to column spacing regarding the hydrodynamics column spacing column radius and platform draft are the three of the most critical factors for the wave frequency response in surge pitch and tower top acceleration the impact of draft is less significant in the case of low frequency second order hydrodynamic response column spacing and radius are much more dominant these results are confirmed by the visual inspection of the input output samples this information provides a new perspective to the fwt substructure design space and serves as a basis for the further sensitivity investigation on the long term dynamic performance such as the peak platform tilting angle nacelle acceleration fatigue damage at tower base and fairlead keywords floating wind turbines substructure global sensitivity analysis manufacturing cost structural properties hydrodynamics 1 introduction floating wind turbine fwt is an effective technology for deep sea wind exploitation one of the challenges for fwt development lies in the substructure design which is composed of a floating platform and a station keeping system it accounts for a considerable portion of the total cost of the whole system and greatly determines the dynamic performance of the system the way to trade off the capital expenditure and the performance aspects is the key to the wide application of fwt in the energy industry optimization techniques provide a promising solution to this problem after properly setting up design variables constraints and objective functions optimization algorithms optimizers can be utilized to search for the optimal design over the design space this approach had been applied to the fwt for different purposes for instance lemmer et al 2020 presented an exemplary methodology of hull shape optimization for a three column semi submersible platform with a consideration of controller design on the contrary brommundt et al 2012 and benassai et al 2018 focused on the mooring optimization with a constant floater geometry in karimi and hall s work karimi et al 2016 an optimization framework was built up by simultaneously parameterizing platform and the mooring configurations in order to explore the diversity of substructure design space fylling and berthelsen fylling and berthelsen 2011 developed the optimization tool windopt for the conceptual design of floater mooring system and dynamic cable more recently hegseth et al 2020 performed an integrated design optimization of the platform tower mooring system and blade pitch controller for a 10 mw spar floating wind turbine in general the first step of setting up an optimization process is to designate which variables to optimize for fwts the definition of a specific substructure involves dozens of parameters this naturally raises a question which parameters should be selected as design variables the most straightforward practice is to fully parameterize the structure however this will lead to a high dimensional optimization and substantial computing resources are required to achieve converged results a more efficient approach is to reduce the dimensions of design space select the parameters that are important to the objective functions as the free variables while keeping the less important ones constant throughout the optimization process the importance measurement of the structural parameters is the key to achieve this goal sensitivity analysis sa provides a solution to this task the design of fwt substructures can be seen as an input output process given a set of design parameters inputs with k factors the corresponding properties performance indicators outputs can always be found via mapping relations function model sa is to investigate how the variations in the output of a model can be attributed to the variations of its input factors obviously given a certain range of input variations the larger output variations are the more sensitive or important that input factor will be in general sa can be categorized into local and global analysis local sa considers the output variability against the input factors around a reference point while global sa considers the variations throughout the entire feasible design space it is worth noting that the substructure optimization discussed above mainly serves for the conceptual design stage in which the global information is the main concern for this reason this work focuses on global sa for most engineering problems the sensitivity indices si cannot be computed analytically because the explicit mathematical expression for input and output does not exist sampling based sa must be used two input sampling strategies are available for global sa the one at a time oat method and the all at a time aat method in oat output variations are induced by only varying one input factor while keeping all others fixed this approach is usually used with the morris method morris 1991 in this method the mean value of r elementary effects which is defined as the function partial derivative of a specific input factor around a reference point is taken as a measure of global sensitivity as only r k 1 function evaluations are required the computational cost is cheap and hence it is quite suitable for preliminary sa i e ranking and screening here ranking refers to generate the ranking of input factors according to their relative contribution to the output variability while screening refers to identify the least influential input factor on the output variability martin et al 2016 and velarde et al 2019 applied this method to the bottom fixed offshore wind turbine owt sa on operation and maintenance costs and foundation fatigue loads respectively however due to the oat sampling approach and the linear assumption the determination of high order interaction effects between input factors is not possible these effects can be crucial for the fwt substructure design some other sophisticated sa approaches based on the aat sampling strategy were proposed to overcome this limitation in aat output variations are induced by varying all the input factors simultaneously for example correlation methods use the correlation coefficient between the inputs and outputs e g the pearson the spearman or the partial correlation coefficient as a sensitivity measure regression analysis methods derive the sensitivity measure by fitting the input output samples to linear nonlinear functions pianosi et al 2016 velarde et al 2019 also employed this approach to the owt foundation fatigue analysis the advantage of these methods is that they can be easily implemented and applied to small datasets nevertheless they can be inaccurate if the input output relationship is strongly non monotonic or nonlinear which also can be the case for fwt substructure design based on the variance decomposition technique variance based sa methods are able to capture the nonlinear factor interaction effects throughout the feasible variability space in glišić s work the well known sobol index sobol 1993 which is a typical variance based sensitivity measure was applied to the fatigue sa of a monopile structure glišić et al 2017 this method makes the accurate quantitative sensitivity measure possible but a large number of function evaluations have to be paid to achieve converged results thus in order to improve the analysis efficiency variance based sa is usually conducted in conjunction with surrogate modeling also called metamodeling once surrogate models are set up the time consuming function evaluations are approximated by a simple algebraic calculation based on this method müller 2020 successfully quantified the load sensitivity of a fwt system to environmental conditions with an acceptable computational effort another way to speed up sa is to utilize the stepwise selection of input factors its main idea is that the simple and cost effective sa methods e g the morris method the pearson coefficient method the linear regression method etc are employed in the early stage of sa so as to identify the less influential factors then followed by application of more computationally intensive refined methods to a smaller set of input factors inspired by this idea hübler et al 2017 proposed a hierarchical four step global sa method for owt it is shown that for different substructures and load cases only a small subset of parameters is influential and many other inputs can be regarded as deterministic without losing accuracy these applications have demonstrated that sa is a powerful statistical tool that can help designers better understand the impact of various factors on offshore wind turbines the optimization of fwt substructure has long been regarded as a black box problem because we lack the knowledge of how the design variables affect the objective functions up to now no relevant research has comprehensively bridged the gap between the design variables i e hull shape and mooring layout and its performance indicators such as the manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics which is important to the fwt substructure design in the early stage this study attempts to address this problem by using sa fig 1 illustrates the input output logic for the fwt substructure sa in this work the inputs are the parameters that describe the geometry configuration of the structure based on which the inherent properties can be derived overall the aims of this study are twofold a to identify the design variables that are critical for the floater mooring configuration optimization during the conceptual design stage b to gain a better understanding of the high dimensional design space of a four column semi submersible substructure for fwt a case study is set up for a 10 mw floating wind turbine at first the feasible design space of the fwt substructure is defined with the consideration of design constraints the calculation of three categories of output indicators i e manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics are introduced in section 4 subsequently two selected sa methods are described and the sa workflow is summarized in section 5 finally all the sa results will be presented and discussed in section 6 and conclusions are drawn at the end of the paper 2 definition of the input variability space fig 2 shows the investigated fwt system it is the dtu 10mw reference floating wind turbine bak et al 2013 mounted on a four column steel semi submersible platform proposed by nautilus floating solutions s l yu et al 2017 the platform operates on the sea area of 130 m water depth and is equipped with a four line catenary mooring system 90 angle between adjacent lines the basic information of the original design such as the geometry dimensions structural and hydrodynamic properties had been summarized in a public definition document of the floating wind project lifes50 funded from the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation program yu et al 2017 the first step to set up the sensitivity study is to define the design space the substructure is parameterized by 11 variables which are listed and illustrated in table 1 and fig 2 respectively it should be noted that the minimum air gap required is an important consideration for the deck height of floating structures however a constant deck height above swl 7 776 m identical to the original design is employed throughout the sensitivity study in this way a constant design of the tower can be used the tower height depends on the deck height above swl if a constant hub height is applied which helps to simplify the analysis and stay focus on the substructure also for the sake of simplification structural components like stiffeners and bulkheads within the hull are not included the variable steel wall thickness in table 1 can be interpreted as an equivalent thickness which incorporates the mass contributions from the outer surface and the inner components given a draft value the ballast weight is determined by the equilibrium between the hull displacement and the total weight of the floating system turbine platform ballast and vertical load of the mooring pretension the mooring line configuration is described by four parameters based on these values some other mooring properties like the equivalent weight per length in water ω moor n m and the extensional stiffness ea n can be estimated by the following equations with the assumption that studless chain lines are employed barltrop 1998 1 ω m o o r 0 1875 d c h a i n 2 2 e a 90000 d c h a i n 2 3 constraints it will be risky to directly carry out the sa in the design space defined in table 1 because obviously not all the designs meet the basic requirement of floating structures and the infeasible designs will deteriorate the sa results hence multiple constraint conditions are applied to filter out the infeasible samples firstly in order to ensure the geometric rationality of the new generated designs the constraint conditions summarized in table 2 are employed besides the constraints related to design principles for floating structures should also be carefully taken into account for example the hydrostatic restoring capability particularly in the roll pitch degree of freedom dof is an important performance indicator for the floating platform because it correlates to the wind induced heel angle which will affect the wind power production and the maximum allowable tilting angle designs with large restoring stiffness will have a small mean roll pitch angle however it may also lead to a low natural period that overlaps with incident wave periods and results in resonant responses to further reduce the risk of resonance it is common to require a separation between heave and roll pitch natural period typically at least a few seconds overall four constraints are considered for the filtering of platform designs dnv rp 0286

pretension of the mooring system φ t t f a and φ t t s s are the first order fore aft and side side mode shape deflection at tower top φ s t t f a and φ s t t s s are their slope values c struc is the 8 8 stiffness matrix where the first 6 6 submatrix is the hydrostatic matrix of the floater while the elements in the seventh and eighth row and column denote the tower stiffness and its interaction with the floater see pegalajar jurado et al 2018 c moor is the linearized mooring stiffness matrix about the platform mean displacement where the elements in the seventh and eighth row and column are zeros note that these quantities are defined in the coordinate system shown in fig 2 the undamped coupled natural frequency can be derived by solving the eigenvalue problem as follows 10 ω 2 q ω m a ω 1 c struc c moor q ω where q is the 8 1 platform motion vector m and a are the 8 8 mass and added mass matrix since a depends on frequency the eigenvalue problem is solved by using the iterative approach for each frequency the eight possible natural frequencies are computed when one of the eight possible frequencies obtained is equal to the frequency of that particular iteration in the loop a system natural frequency is found due to its low cost and easy installation drag embedment anchors are frequently used in the catenary mooring system they work in a certain range of uplift angle normally 30 50 and a large angle induced by platform motions may lead to dragging failure to avoid this happening sufficient length of mooring line that lies on sea bed is needed in this case no vertical tension is applied on the anchor for this work it is assumed that at least one tenth of the mooring length is required to lie on the sea bed 11 l m o o r t v f r l d ω m o o r l m o o r 10 where t v frld is the vertical tension at fairlead the stiffness of the mooring system is another performance indicator of concern large translational platform displacements may result in the damage of dynamic cables as proposed by the literature benassai et al 2018 the reference platform admissible offset to water depth ratio 0 15 is employed 12 δ x o f f s e t z w a t e r 0 15 it should be noted that the platform offset and the fairlead tension vary with different environmental conditions but their mean amplitudes are mainly attributable to the mean aerodynamic loads which are available from the turbine thrust coefficient curve for this reason a quick preliminary inspection for eq 11 12 can be carried out under the rated wind condition considering that the mooring lines behave differently from different load directions the constraints are examined from 0 to 40 wind direction 0 aligns with the x axis in fig 2 with an interval of 10 the mooring tensions are calculated by using an in house quasi static code one of the key considerations in wind turbine design is the avoidance of resonant tower oscillations excited by rotor thrust fluctuations at rotational 1p or blade passing frequency 3p for three blade turbines as a boundary condition of floating wind turbines the platform hydrostatic and the mooring restoring stiffness has a remarkable impact on the tower eigenfrequency thus it is necessary to ensure that the tower eigenfrequency is outside the resonant region for each of platform mooring design fig 3 presents the campbell diagram of the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine the blue areas denote the resonant regions in which the tower eigenfrequency can be excited by the 1p 3p and 6p aerodynamic loads during the operation of the turbine while the green areas are the regions of potential feasible design which can be customarily categorized into stiff soft and soft soft design according to the relationship between the tower natural frequency and the exciting frequencies burton et al 2011 in this work only the stiff area is considered in the sa analysis because on the one hand the soft and soft soft areas overlap with the wave frequencies which normally range from 0 05 hz to 0 3 hz on the other hand in general the tower of floating wind turbine is subjected to larger internal loads than the one of onshore turbine soft designs are less likely to meet the requirements of ultimate and serviceability limit states 4 output evaluations 4 1 manufacturing cost the total construction expenditure of a floating substructure is composed of numerous aspects some of which greatly depend on project specific conditions such as the installation cost and the transportation cost thus this study only focuses on the manufacturing cost that is closely related to structural dimensions as the literature benveniste et al 2016 reports the total manufacturing cost of a single floating substructure includes the material cost the labor cost and the overhead cost the material cost consists of the expenditure on structural steel and ballast which can be easily estimated by multiplying the total mass by the material price for steel substructures the labor cost is mainly related to the welding length and the painting area farkas and jármai 2013 the welding length depends on the size of the raw steel plate that should be estimated based on steel industry standards dimension limitations of transportation vehicles as well as processing machines e g steel sheet rolling machine in this work we assume that the raw steel plate with a dimension of 10 m length 4 m width is adopted an example of the welding footprints for column and beam pontoon components are presented in fig 4 the fabrication time for welding is composed of three parts the time of preparation assembly and tacking t w1 the real welding time t w2 and the additional fabrication actions time t w3 min farkas and jármai 2013 13 t w 1 c 1 θ d w κ ρ v s t w 2 i c 2 i

equal to 0 1053 and 1 94 respectively when submerged arc welding saw approach with double k butt welds is employed farkas and jármai 2013 α wi is weld size l wi is welding length once the welding time is obtained the welding cost can be calculated by multiplying the labor price the estimation of painting cost is based on the painting price per unit area proposed by tizani et al 1996 a similar approach is applied for the mooring line cost estimation the overhead cost is not directly related to the manufacturing process but is necessary to run the business activity for instance labor administration office materials amortization and so on based on the engineering experience it accounts for around 27 of the total manufacturing cost benveniste et al 2016 finally the total manufacturing cost is estimated by the following equation 14 tc m ptfm p steel m blst p blst t w 1 t w 2 t w 3 p labor a p paint m moor p moor 0 73 where m ptfm m blst and m moor are the platform

samples are generated by using the nataf transformation technique liu and der kiureghian 1986 and the sensitivity indices see section 5 are computed for each price combination 4 2 structural properties structural properties here mainly refer to the restoring stiffness and the natural frequency of platform tower displacement to compute these quantities basic information such as the mass cog and moment of inertia calculation are required to realize batch calculation the parametric modeling technique is employed with the aid of the computer aided design cad program catia the hydrostatic stiffness is characterized by the fifth diagonal element of the c struc matrix 15 c struc 55 z i m i g ρ w g wp x 2 d s ρ w g v sub z c o b where m i and z i are the mass and the cog of the ith body of the multibody system z c o b is the z coordinate of cob the mooring property is characterized by the linearized horizontal restoring stiffness which can be estimated by the linear least squares fitting of the restoring force displacement curves around the platform undisplaced position with a consideration of 3 m perturbation in surge the platform and mooring properties are used as a description of tower boundary conditions and the tower modal analysis is carried out by using bmodes bir 2005 the first order fore aft natural frequency is concerned for this sa study 4 3 hydrodynamics for moored semi submersibles the wave induced motion response is mainly composed of two parts the wave frequency and the low frequency response the former is induced by the first order hydrodynamic load which is computed as 16 f hydro 1 ω x ω 2 s ω δ ω e i ϕ x ϕ s where x ω is first order wave excitation force moment for a unit wave amplitude s ω is the one side wave power spectrum density psd ϕ x and ϕ s are the phase for x ω and s ω respectively the low frequency response is induced by the second order hydrodynamic load which is critical for the semi submersibles because it can excite the resonant response typically in the less damped surge sway dof and consequently lead to considerable loads in mooring lines this effect is characterized by the full difference frequency quadratic transfer function qtf which can be computed by using the pinkster s approach pinkster 1980 given a wave spectrum of s ω the low frequency hydrodynamic loads are calculated as 17 f hydro 2 ω d ω d ω m ω n qtf ω d 2 s ω m δ ω 2 s ω n δ ω e i ϕ q t f ϕ m ϕ n where qtf ω d is the difference frequency hydrodynamic coefficient for the ω m ω n frequency pair ω d ω m ω n ϕ q t f denotes the phase for qtf ω d while ϕ m and ϕ n are the phases for the mth and nth wave component the wave induced motion response is solved by substituting the hydrodynamic loads to the equation of motion the first and second order responses are solved separately so as to investigate their influencing factors independently in sa 18 q 1 ω ω 2 m a ω i ω b r a d ω b v i s ω c s t r u c c moor 1 f hydro 1 ω 19

hydrodynamic coefficients are derived from the potential flow solver ansys aqwa ansys 2016 except b vis which is computed by using the iterative borgman linearization approach see lemmer et al 2018 the determination of other matrices had been introduced in the literature pegalajar jurado et al 2018 the wave induced horizontal nacelle acceleration is also a main consideration for fwt design with the small displacement deflection assumption it can be calculated as 20 a n a c 1 ω ω 2 q 1 1 ω z hub q 5 1 ω q 7 1 ω 21 a n a c 2 ω ω 2 q 1 2 ω z hub q 5 2 ω q 7 2 ω the first and second order standard deviations of motion response for the ith dof are 22 σ i 1 j 1 n ω q i 1 ω j 2 2 23 σ i 2 j 1 n ω q i 2 ω j 2 2 following the design basis document of the lifes50 project krieger et al 2015 21 representative wave conditions listed in table 4 are considered in this work h s t p and p are the significant wave height peak wave period and occurrence probability respectively and the jonswap spectrum is assumed finally the weighted standard deviations of first and second order motion response serve as the hydrodynamic performance indicators for the sa study 24 σ i 1 w j 1 n σ i j 1 p j 25 σ i 2 w j 1 n σ i j 2 p j 5 sensitivity analysis methodology according to the classification of global sa methods given by the literature pianosi et al 2016 two methods are able to deal with the nonlinear input output relationship the variance based method vbm and the density based method dbm both methods are based on the aat sampling strategy i e output variations are induced by varying all the input factors simultaneously the direct influence as well as the interaction effects of input factors on the output variations can be captured 5 1 variance based method given a model of the form y f x 1 x 2 x k with y a scalar output of the model f which is a function of k input factors x 1 x 2 x k the theory basis of vbm is that the output variance v y is a good proxy of output variation and it can be decomposed into items contributed by various sources of input variations saltelli et al 2010 26 v y i k v i i k j i k v i j v 12 k where v i represents the partial variance in y due to the individual main effect of the ith input factor while v ij is partial variance in y attributed to the interaction between the ith and jth factor so on and so forth for the higher order terms dividing both sides of the equation by v y we get the variance based sensitivity indices si 27 i k s i i k j i k s i j s 12 k 1 correspondingly s i is the main effect or the first order index that measures the direct contribution to output variance from individual factors mathematically it is the expected reduction in output variance when x i is completely determined without any uncertainty saltelli et al 2010 28 s i v y e x i v x i y x i v y v x i e x i y x i v y where v x i y x i indicates the variance of y taken over all possible values of x i all input factors except x i while keeping x i fixed e x i is the expectation operator taken over all possible values of x i the equation is simplified to one term by using the identity v x i e x i y x i e x i v x i y x i v y mood 1950 another popular variance based measure is the total order index s ti it measures the overall contribution from an input factor considering its direct effect and its interactions with other factors i e s ti is the sum of all items in eq 27 that related to x i considering v x i e x i y x i is the main effect of x i v y v x i e x i y x i must give the contribution of all x i related terms in eq 26 s ti thus can be written as 29 s t i v y v x i e x i y x i v y e x i v x i y x i v y the computation of these two variance based indices is quite straightforward the best practices given by saltelli et al 2010 recommended two efficient estimators for s i and s ti 30 v x i e x i y x i 1 n v j 1 n v f b j f a b i j f a j 31 e x i v x i y x i 1 2 n v j 1 n v f a j f a b i j 2 where a and b are two n v k independent sampling matrices where n v is the number of sampling points and k is the number of input factors they can be generated from a sobol quasi random sequence of size n v 2k a is the left half of the matrix and b is the right part of it a b i is the matrix that all columns are from a except the ith column which is from b i and j are the indices for input factors and sampling points respectively f denotes the output of corresponding sampling subset vbm is supposed to be more accurate than most of the commonly used sa methods such as the elementary effect test the correlation and regression analysis method and the statistical test because it is capable of capturing the nonlinear input output behavior another attractive feature is that the first order and higher order indices reflect the structure of the model itself oakley and o hagan 2004 which is beneficial to gain deeper insight into the black box problems e g substructure optimization for fwts however this feature is based on the variance decomposition with the assumption that input factors are independent the presence of correlations among input factors will deteriorate the tidy correspondence between variance based indices leading to counterintuitive results pianosi et al 2016 another assumption of vbm is that output variance is a good indicator that can fully characterize the output variation however that is not true when the output distribution is multi modal or highly skewed liu et al 2006 one typical example is the nonlinear function f x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1 and x 2 both follow χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom 10 and 13 978 respectively liu et al 2006 as fig 5 shows its output distribution is positively skew with a long right tail and the associated scatter plots indicate that in general x 1 is more influential on the output than x 2 which is also confirmed by the uncertainty analysis in liu et al 2006 however the total effect indices s t1 and s t2 by vbm are 0 5442 and 0 5462 showing an equal importance between the two factors it is certain that the conditions of substructure design problem will not perfectly fulfill these assumptions on the one hand the constraint conditions tailor the design space which is constructed by multiple dimensional variables see table 1 in this process these variables will inevitably more or less be correlated with each other even though they are sampled independently before the constraint conditions apply on the other hand the input output relations for this study are nonlinear hydrodynamics in particular highly skewed output may occur therefore it can be expected that applying vbm alone cannot guarantee the reliability of sa results 5 2 density based method the dbm is also introduced to this work in order to make up the limitations of vbm and increase the credibility of this sensitivity study via approach to approach comparison the key idea of dbm is to measure sensitivity through the variations in output pdf or cumulative distribution function cdf more specifically the sensitivity to input x i is measured by the divergence between the output unconditional pdf cdf which is generated by varying all the input factors synchronously and the conditional pdf cdf which is obtained by varying all the input factors but fixing x i to a prescribed value pianosi and wagener pianosi and wagener 2015 recommended using cdf as it makes the sensitivity index si easier to compute than the pdf approach following their practice the cdf divergence is represented by the kolmogorov smirnov statistic 32 k s x i max f y f y x i where f y and f y x i denotes the unconditional and conditional cdf respectively as ks depends on which value is x i fixed the si of dbm t i considers a statistic over all possible values of x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n 33 t i s t a t i s t i c x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n k s x i the statistic operation could be the maximum mean or median the mean is employed in this work fig 6 illustrates how this procedure works the red solid line denotes the output unconditional cdf while the dash lines indicate the conditional cdf when x i is fixed to six different values the mean value of the maximum distances between the dash lines and the red solid line are used for sensitivity measure the main advantage of dbm is that it does not rely on any assumption and thus can be applicable to various situations whatever the correlation between input factors and the type of output distribution however it has to be admitted that there is no perfect solution to sensitivity measurement dbm can capture the total effect but is difficult to recognize the main effect for individual input factors hence cannot explicitly reflect the model structure as vbm does even so dbm will be a good complement to vbm the main differences between vbm and dbm are summarized in table 5 5 3 sensitivity analysis workflow fig 7 summarizes the sa workflow for this work at first n v design samples are generated by sobol quasi random sequence after the initial input variability space is defined the constraint conditions are applied to inspect the feasibility of the generated samples the total manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamic performance are estimated for those designs that meet the basic requirement of floating structures with these results the sensitivity indices can be computed based on vbm and dbm normally it is not easy to make a reasonable guess for the number of samples thus a convergence analysis is carried out at the end of the loop the sampling subset will be extended and the sa procedure repeats until the si well converges 6 results and discussion 6 1 independence of input factors vbm has a relatively strict requirement on the input and output properties which should be carefully examined prior to the discussions on si results totally 145 100 design samples are generated by the sobol quasi random sequence only 9304 of them can fulfill the constraint conditions the proportion of infeasible designs is over 93 based on these valid samples correlation coefficients between input factors are calculated and presented in table 6 the elements with an absolute value greater than 0 2 are marked in red though most input factors show a good independence there are still several factors that are highly correlated one typical example is l moor and r moor fig 8 a displays all the feasible mooring l moor r moor combinations due to the constraint conditions the valid samples distribute along a narrow band and it shows a strong linear correlation between the two factors merely 3 4 r moor values are available for each l moor obviously this feature violates the vbm assumption that the input factors should be independent to address this problem l moor and r moor are treated as an integrated input factor when calculating the vbm si it is assumed that r moor is completely dependent on l mor more specifically when generating a b i for l moor the column elements of l moor and r moor in matrix a are substituted at the same time by the corresponding column elements from matrix b another example is r and d which is shown in fig 8 b with the increase of r the range of d gradually decreases at the end only the small or medium values are available this is attributed to the constraint condition eq 5 designs with large column spacing and radius tend to have a large hydrostatic stiffness resulting in a low pitch roll natural period that overlaps with wave periods for this reason the large large combinations are discarded which finally leads to the considerable correlation between these two factors a similar situation can be observed between w potn r and d the correlation between d and h frld is due to the geometrical constraint 6 2 skewness of output distribution the pattern of output distribution is also great of concern for the vbm application fig 9 presents the normalized pdfs of the investigated output in this work i e the total manufacturing cost tc the platform natural frequency in surge ω 1 and pitch ω 5 the fundamental tower bending frequency ω 7 the first order weighted standard deviation of platform surge σ 1 w 1 pitch σ 5 w 1 nacelle acceleration σ a n a c w 1 and the second order weighted standard deviation of platform surge σ 1 w 2 pitch σ 5 w 2 nacelle acceleration σ a n a c w 2 all the outputs follow unimodal distribution but their patterns are quite different tc and ω 5 basically follow normal distribution and their skewness see the values near the legend is small but for ω 1 σ 5 w 1 σ 1 w 2 σ 5 w 2 and σ a n a c w 2 long tails are seen on the right hand side of the curves thus their skewness is much higher the skewness of ω 7 σ 1 w 1 and σ a n a c w 1 is somewhere between them therefore it can be expected that vbm is more likely to have a better performance on tc and ω 5 than it does on ω 1 ω 1 σ 5 w 1 σ 1 w 2 σ 5 w 2 and σ a n a c w 2 6 3 convergence analysis as proposed in müller 2020 a convergence study is carried out in order to ensure that the sample size is sufficient to derive reasonable si results the convergence plots of vbm and dbm are displayed in fig 10 each subgraph describes the sensitivity contribution of one specific input factor to the 10 investigated outputs it can be seen that most of the si curves well converge for vbm basically a sample size of 3000 is required to achieve a reasonable convergence while 5000 samples are needed for dbm however it doesn t mean vbm is more computationally efficient than dbm because for dbm the total function evaluations are equal to the number of sample points but vbm has to spend additional computation efforts on the crossover sample subset a b i eq 30 31 all the si values are in the range of 0 1 the s ti values are always larger than their corresponding s i these observations indicate that the sa is well implemented serving as a good basis for the following discussions on how the platform mooring configuration influences the manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics 6 4 manufacturing cost fig 11 compares the manufacturing cost si of 10 input factors to facilitate the comparison the vbm si are normalized by the maximum s ti while the dbm si are normalized by the maximum t i in order to investigate the influence of price variation on the results si are computed for 2000 price combinations the bar length represents the median value of the normalized si on the top of each bar is a box plot denoting the variation range of si minimal variations are seen for most of the input factors demonstrating that the influence of price fluctuation is small in general columns are the main components for semi submersible structures which take up most of the material usage and labor cost for welding and painting thus it can be expected that design variables related to column dimension will play a key role on the total manufacturing cost the sa results show that the column radius is the most influential factor no matter from the perspective of s i s ti or t i the vbm ranks the platform draft s ti the second however its s i value is relatively small this implies that its sensitivity contributions to manufacturing cost mainly rely on the interaction effect with some other design variables it can be inferred that this interactive variable is the column radius because for some other factors their si values are either too small or their interaction effects are too weak dbm presents a different way of ranking the total effect of platform draft is moderate which is comparable to the column spacing pontoon width and wall thickness the chain diameter is the more influential factor which rank the second however the two results are still in agreement in some respects for instance the influence of deck height and fairlead position can almost be ignored the mooring line length is less important than the chain diameter which is consistent with the relation m m o o r d c h a i n 2 l m o r where m m o o r is total mass of the mooring lines it would be beneficial to qualitatively assess sensitivity by visual inspection of the input output samples on the one hand it is the most reliable approach to identify the divergence between vbm and dbm on the other hand compared with the global quantitative sa methods that merely provide a very general averaged sensitivity assessment it incorporates local sensitivity information thus it is a good complement to the quantitative sa scatter plot is the most commonly used tool for visualization pianosi et al 2016 it should be noted that the input factors are sampled discretely in this work e g only 6 values are available for column radius from 3 m to 8 m with an interval of 1 m each discrete input can correspond to thousands of output values which will lead to a highly overlapping and ambiguous plot to better display the output statistical features at each input value box plots are employed instead and the results are presented in fig 12 the red dots and horizontal lines indicate the mean and median values respectively the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles the whiskers correspond to a coverage of approximately 2 7σ σ is standard deviation of the data the cross marks the sample data outside the coverage note that fig 12 is based on the steel labor and mooring price of 0 524 kg 27 h and 2 kg respectively the box plots can clearly reflect the main effect s i which is defined by the v x i e x i y x i term in eq 28 at first the output expectation is taken over all input factors except x i keeping x i fixed at a specific value then the variance operator is taken over all possible values of x i in general s i is the variance of red dots shown in the box plots the monotonous red dots with large gradient tend to have a larger variance this is the case for column radius wall thickness chain diameter and pontoon width the s i results in fig 11 match quite well with this order but apparently underestimate the contribution of pontoon width the pontoon width s i is even smaller than the pontoon height which is counterintuitive for platform draft and column spacing the mean manufacturing cost experiences a visible increase at the beginning but its growth rate significantly drops down or even a negative growth rate is seen column spacing finally tends to converge to a constant value consistent with the explanation for fig 8 b it is the constraint of pitch roll natural period eq 5 that prevents unlimited cost increase the convergence or the decline segment offsets the sensitivity contribution from the initial ascending segment therefore on average relatively small s i values of these two input factors are seen in fig 11 underneath the box plots there shows the pdf of input factors the dash lines and solid lines indicate the distributions before and after the constraint conditions applied respectively remarkable change of distribution is seen in the input factors that highly get involved in constraints the initial sampling subset generated by sobol quasi random sequence basically follows the uniform distribution with the filtering of infeasible design combinations the kurtosis and skewness of distribution increase for vbm the calculated si tends to reflect the sensitivity in data intensive areas rather than the less dense areas in the case of draft column spacing and pontoon width although visible output variations are seen on the left hand side of the box plots the samples with large pdf values mainly lie in the region of mild output variation this is another reason for relatively small s i values coming out for these three input factors however dmb doesn t have this partial problem because as fig 6 illustrates each input value corresponds to one output cdf curve and the sensitivity measurement is the statistical result of all these cdfs with equal treatment this difference between the two methods can partially explain the significant divergence between s ti and t i in column spacing and pontoon width according to the definition formula eq 29 it is difficult to visualize the total effect s ti particularly for the high dimensional problem but we can achieve this indirectly by displaying the interaction between input factors because total effect is the sum of main effect and interaction effect fig 11 indicates a strong interaction between platform draft and column spacing it is reviewed by the three dimensional scatter plot in fig 13 in areas where the column radius is relatively small the manufacturing cost increase slowly as draft increases but the growth slope increases rapidly with the increase of column radius therefore from an economic point of view it would be better to adjust the substructure design through draft rather than column radius to meet the design requirements if it is possible in general most of the vbm results match well with the visualized data that is premised on a small skewness of output pdf as fig 9 shows compared to the dbm si the total effects of column spacing and pontoon width are underestimated see figs 11 and 12 which can be due to two main reasons the first is the unevenness of samples so that the vbm si tends to reflect the sensitivity in data intensive areas regardless of the less dense regions the second is the dependence between input factors that violates the assumption of vbm as table 6 shows the correlation between column spacing and pontoon width is non negligible 6 5 structural properties the surge natural frequency is a function of structure mass includes added mass and mooring stiffness fig 14 presents the normalized si results for horizontal mooring stiffness and platform surge natural frequency for the former the mooring length and chain diameter are the dominant factors the platform configuration parameters like column spacing also have a considerable impact because they influence the catenary shape thus resulting in different mooring geometric stiffness fig 15 illustrates the importance of fairlead position to mooring stiffness sample points of the same color denote the designs that equip mooring lines with the same length and chain diameter but different fairlead positions it is shown that the horizontal mooring stiffness varies a lot along with column spacing this explains the sensitivity contribution from column spacing as for fig 14 b dbm shows that the importance of platform configuration parameters increases to a comparable level of mooring parameters due to the high skewness of surge natural frequency distribution see fig 9 the vbm si results show a significant divergence with those of dbm it predicts that the mooring length is the most important factor and the contributions of platform configuration parameters are quite low once again this divergence is reviewed by the box plots shown in fig 16 it clearly shows that column radius and chain diameter are two of the most sensitive input factors while draft column spacing and mooring length are relatively less significant this observation is basically consistent with the dbm results and also confirms the inaccuracy of vbm however although the vbm performance is greatly affected by the skewness of output distribution its prediction on non sensitive factors still looks reasonable the s i values of deck height pontoon height and wall thickness are close to 0 the small skewness of platform pitch natural frequency and first order tower bending frequency give us confidence in the vbm results this is confirmed by the si comparison presented in fig 17 the total effects measured by vbm agree well with dbm platform pitch natural frequency is a function of hydrostatic stiffness which results from the effects of buoyancy gravity and water plane area of the floater fig 17 a and c shows the si for the pitch natural frequency and the hydrostatic stiffness respectively both of which indicate that the column spacing is the most sensitive input factor this implies that the water plane area effect plays a more critical role than the buoyancy gravity effect because the second moment of water plane area greatly depends on column spacing the influence of draft and column radius is also remarkable but the vbm results indicate that most of their contributions are from the interaction effects which apparently occur between the three main platform parameters the plot of the first order tower bending frequency in fig 17 b presents a similar trend with the pitch natural frequency the tower frequency is also a function of hydrostatic stiffness however it should be noted that their mechanism is different from that between pitch natural frequency and hydrostatic stiffness for an eigenvalue problem the solution not only depends on the inherent properties of the investigated system such as the mass stiffness and damping but also the boundary conditions applied the variations in platform hydrostatic stiffness will change the boundary conditions of the tower and thus result in the variations of eigenfrequencies fig 18 a displays how the platform pitch natural frequency varies with the three most influential input factors the increase or decrease of the natural frequency depends on whether the input factor contributes more to the stiffness term or to the inertia term interestingly a hybrid situation occurs in the case of column spacing the increase of column spacing will enlarge the second moment of water plane area hydrostatic stiffness as well as the moment of inertia of the floater the figure implies that the intensity of these two opposite effects greatly depends on the specific value of column spacing below 34 m the increase of column spacing contributes more to the hydrostatic stiffness as a result the statistics of pitch natural frequency increases beyond 34 m on the contrary the increase of moment of inertia which is proportional to the square of column spacing becomes more dominant thus an opposite trend is seen the growth of pitch natural frequency is far more notable with the increase of column radius than the draft which is consistent with the sa results in fig 17 a in fig 18 b the tower frequency tends to get lower as the size of the substructure increases as it involves the complex eigenvalue problem the reason behind is so implicit that an additional investigation is required 6 6 hydrodynamics the first order hydrodynamic performance of the floater is characterized by the weighted standard deviations of motion response defined by eq 24 25 the si results of three dofs of interest are displayed in fig 19 in general the three platform parameters draft column radius and column spacing which greatly determine the mass hydrostatic stiffness and wave excitation loads are the main considerations for the first order hydrodynamics vbm and dbm reach a consensus on this point though they diverge on the significance order of these three factors for the surge dof although the mooring parameters dominate the platform horizontal restoring stiffness as fig 14 a shows their impact on the first order hydrodynamics is relatively small in other words the contribution of the horizontal stiffness in eq 18 is less significant than the inertia and the wave excitation term both methods predict that the column spacing is an influential factor for the first order horizontal platform motion the main reason is that the variations in column spacing will change the column interaction in the wave field hence resulting in notable variations in hydrodynamic loads the influence of column radius is comparable and vbm indicates that it strongly interacts with draft and column spacing as for the pitch dof in fig 19 b draft plays a more crucial role than it does for the surge dof increasing draft will lead to greater moment of inertia added mass and hydrostatic stiffness because of the lower center of gravity which is beneficial to gain more stability for the floater on the other hand generally it will also increase the wave excitation loads because of the larger hull however the wave loads decrease with the increase of water depth since that the fluid particles move more slowly in the deeper water thus the total increase of wave loads shouldn t be large as a whole the positive side outweighs the negative side therefore it can be expected that properly increasing the platform draft can help to alleviate the first order pitch motion the nacelle acceleration mainly results from the sum of platform horizontal and rotational motion thus its si results inherit the characteristics of fig 19 a b fig 20 displays the first order response box plots against the three most influential input factors most of the figures present a common phenomenon there exists a critical value for the input factors below which remarkable variations in wave induced motion occur with the increase of draft and column spacing beyond that the statistics of response remains stable as mentioned above increasing column spacing helps to mitigate the column interaction in the wave field the box plots indicate that this effect is beneficial for the response reduction when the column spacing is smaller than 34 m which is the minimum distance to fully get rid of the column interaction effects it should be noted that this critical distance is related to the characteristic wave length thus is a site dependent value interestingly the critical draft is also around 34 m below this value the wave induced motion declines dramatically with the increase of draft this observation verifies the statement on fig 19 b above afterwards the statistical characteristics of platform motion almost stops changing however in the case of nacelle acceleration there shows a rising trend though not very significant a similar phenomenon had been discussed by lemmer et al 2020 they found that semi submersible platforms of shallow draft tend to suffer from lower wave induced fore aft motion at hub height than the deep draft designs due to the counter phase surge and pitch forcing the shallow draft platforms response in an out of phase way that pitch is positive when surge is negative thus the offset of these two dofs results in a relatively small tower top response in contrast the deep draft platforms have an in phase response of surge and pitch to waves the superposition of these two dofs leads to a remarkable tower top response these findings imply that it is inefficient to design the substructure to be particularly large from a point view of optimization practice it is recommended to set up a search domain design space that is equal or a little bit larger to the range of the critical values the platform and nacelle motion rises significantly with the increase of column radius therefore limiting the column radius is the key for hydrodynamic performance improvement as well as cost reduction the difference frequency second order hydrodynamic response is another performance indicator of concern for semi submersible substructures and the sa results are plotted in fig 21 for platform surge motion although notable divergence of the two methods is seen because of the skewness problem both methods indicate the importance of the mooring parameters the reason is that the platform slow drift motion is sensitive to the surge natural frequency which depends on the mooring configuration for instance in the sampling subset we found three typical substructure designs they share the same hull shape d 18 m r 7 m d 34 m but equip with three different mooring systems their surge natural frequencies are 0 0454 0 0704 and 0 109 rad s the corresponding σ 1 2 w values are 0 802 0 489 and 0 276 m respectively the maximum value is almost three times larger than the minimum fundamentally this reflects the gradient of the force qtf matrix in the direction perpendicular to the diagonal the force qtf matrix is mainly determined by the geometry and the mass distribution of the floater the matrix elements that play a key role in the structure response are those whose difference frequency is equal or adjacent to the natural frequency of the system these elements are located along the line that parallels to the matrix diagonal and the distance is the function of natural frequency figs 14 b and fig 16 indicate that the column radius chain diameter and column spacing are three of the most relevant parameters for surge natural frequency this feature is also inherited by the case of low frequency surge response however as fig 17 a shows the pitch natural frequency is basically independent from the mooring parameters therefore fig 21 b indicates that the low frequency pitch response is dominated by the platform parameters the tower top acceleration results from the platform surge and pitch motion thus it is somehow the combination of the two fig 21 c implies that it is more relevant to the pitch motion as the pitch natural frequency is much higher than the surge the corresponding box plots are displayed in fig 22 it once again demonstrates that dbm has a higher credibility than vbm in the highly skewed cases properly increasing the column spacing and mooring chain diameter is beneficial to mitigate the low frequency surge motion but its effect is far inferior to the effect of limiting the column radius for pitch and tower top motion however increasing the column spacing is the most effective way to minimize the low frequency response consistent with fig 20 the critical column spacing is also around 34 m by comparing figs 20 and 22 it is found that the amplitude of the second order surge and pitch motion is comparable to or sometimes higher than the first order response which implies the importance of the second order hydrodynamics for semi submersibles 7 conclusions in this work a sensitivity analysis procedure for a four column semi submersible floating wind turbine is set up to investigate the influence of substructure configuration parameters on manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics a large and constrained design space is defined with a consideration of basic design requirements for floating structures two widely used global sensitivity analysis methods vbm and dbm are employed to measure the sensitivity contributions of 10 design parameters the sensitivity indices are verified against the visual inspection of the input output samples and are compared over the design parameters the main conclusions are summarized as follows through the sensitivity analysis it is possible to identify how the design parameters influence the economy and the dynamic properties of the fwt system columns are the main components for semi submersible platforms column radius is the most influential design factor for substructure manufacturing cost and surge natural frequency because it determines the most of the material labor usage and the total mass inertia of the structure the platform pitch and tower fore aft natural frequency are more sensitive to column spacing which not only greatly affects the hydrostatic stiffness through the moment of water plane area but also the moment of inertia of the floater in terms of the first order hydrodynamics column spacing column radius and platform draft are the three of the most critical factors the increase of column spacing can remarkably mitigate the wave frequency response in surge pitch and tower top response the reason is that it alleviates the column interaction effects in wave fields and thus reduces the hydrodynamic loads increasing draft is beneficial to gain more platform stability however these measures are effective only when these two parameters are smaller than a critical value 34 m for this case beyond that the statistical characteristics of the hydrodynamic performance maintains stable the impact of draft is less significant in the case of low frequency second order hydrodynamic response column spacing and radius are much more dominant regarding the application of the sensitivity analysis methods the performance of vbm is affected by the skewness of the output distribution in the cases of small skewness the vbm results agree well with dbm however in the highly skewed cases the vbm results become unacceptable this is because vbm only evaluates the second moment of a distribution however it is no longer a good measure of dispersion for highly skewed distributions moreover the bias sampling due to the applied constraints may also influence the vbm results the vbm sensitivity indices tend to reflect the sensitivity in data intensive areas rather than the less dense areas even so the fwt sensitivity analysis without considering constraint conditions complete sampling subset is not recommended because the proportion of infeasible designs is so high over 93 that it will overwhelm the information from the feasible subset on the contrary dbm does not have these problems as it does not rely on any assumption as the vbm does its results are basically consistent with the visual inspection of the input output samples but the disadvantage is that it cannot reveal the interaction effects between input factors this work is the first step towards achieving the sensitivity analysis framework on the semisubmersible substructure of fwt it provides a new perspective to the fwt substructure design space and demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying sa techniques to the fwt substructure design in the near future these methods will be utilized further to investigate on how the long term dynamic performance e g peak nacelle acceleration and platform tilting angle lifetime

21128,trading off the capital expenditure and dynamic performance of the substructure through optimization techniques is the key to wide application of floating wind turbines fwt in the energy industry the optimization of floating substructure is a high dimensional problem sensitivity analysis can help reducing the dimensions of design space by highlighting the most relevant design parameters to potential objective functions or to constraints and increasing the understanding in the interrelationship of various parameters throughout the design space this paper evaluates the influence of the hull main dimensions and mooring system parameters on the manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics of a four column semi submersible fwt two widely used global sensitivity analysis methods the variance based method and the density based method are employed to measure the sensitivity contributions of 10 design parameters the column radius is found to be one of the most influential factors for substructure manufacturing cost and surge natural frequency while the platform pitch and tower fore aft natural frequency are more sensitive to column spacing regarding the hydrodynamics column spacing column radius and platform draft are the three of the most critical factors for the wave frequency response in surge pitch and tower top acceleration the impact of draft is less significant in the case of low frequency second order hydrodynamic response column spacing and radius are much more dominant these results are confirmed by the visual inspection of the input output samples this information provides a new perspective to the fwt substructure design space and serves as a basis for the further sensitivity investigation on the long term dynamic performance such as the peak platform tilting angle nacelle acceleration fatigue damage at tower base and fairlead keywords floating wind turbines substructure global sensitivity analysis manufacturing cost structural properties hydrodynamics 1 introduction floating wind turbine fwt is an effective technology for deep sea wind exploitation one of the challenges for fwt development lies in the substructure design which is composed of a floating platform and a station keeping system it accounts for a considerable portion of the total cost of the whole system and greatly determines the dynamic performance of the system the way to trade off the capital expenditure and the performance aspects is the key to the wide application of fwt in the energy industry optimization techniques provide a promising solution to this problem after properly setting up design variables constraints and objective functions optimization algorithms optimizers can be utilized to search for the optimal design over the design space this approach had been applied to the fwt for different purposes for instance lemmer et al 2020 presented an exemplary methodology of hull shape optimization for a three column semi submersible platform with a consideration of controller design on the contrary brommundt et al 2012 and benassai et al 2018 focused on the mooring optimization with a constant floater geometry in karimi and hall s work karimi et al 2016 an optimization framework was built up by simultaneously parameterizing platform and the mooring configurations in order to explore the diversity of substructure design space fylling and berthelsen fylling and berthelsen 2011 developed the optimization tool windopt for the conceptual design of floater mooring system and dynamic cable more recently hegseth et al 2020 performed an integrated design optimization of the platform tower mooring system and blade pitch controller for a 10 mw spar floating wind turbine in general the first step of setting up an optimization process is to designate which variables to optimize for fwts the definition of a specific substructure involves dozens of parameters this naturally raises a question which parameters should be selected as design variables the most straightforward practice is to fully parameterize the structure however this will lead to a high dimensional optimization and substantial computing resources are required to achieve converged results a more efficient approach is to reduce the dimensions of design space select the parameters that are important to the objective functions as the free variables while keeping the less important ones constant throughout the optimization process the importance measurement of the structural parameters is the key to achieve this goal sensitivity analysis sa provides a solution to this task the design of fwt substructures can be seen as an input output process given a set of design parameters inputs with k factors the corresponding properties performance indicators outputs can always be found via mapping relations function model sa is to investigate how the variations in the output of a model can be attributed to the variations of its input factors obviously given a certain range of input variations the larger output variations are the more sensitive or important that input factor will be in general sa can be categorized into local and global analysis local sa considers the output variability against the input factors around a reference point while global sa considers the variations throughout the entire feasible design space it is worth noting that the substructure optimization discussed above mainly serves for the conceptual design stage in which the global information is the main concern for this reason this work focuses on global sa for most engineering problems the sensitivity indices si cannot be computed analytically because the explicit mathematical expression for input and output does not exist sampling based sa must be used two input sampling strategies are available for global sa the one at a time oat method and the all at a time aat method in oat output variations are induced by only varying one input factor while keeping all others fixed this approach is usually used with the morris method morris 1991 in this method the mean value of r elementary effects which is defined as the function partial derivative of a specific input factor around a reference point is taken as a measure of global sensitivity as only r k 1 function evaluations are required the computational cost is cheap and hence it is quite suitable for preliminary sa i e ranking and screening here ranking refers to generate the ranking of input factors according to their relative contribution to the output variability while screening refers to identify the least influential input factor on the output variability martin et al 2016 and velarde et al 2019 applied this method to the bottom fixed offshore wind turbine owt sa on operation and maintenance costs and foundation fatigue loads respectively however due to the oat sampling approach and the linear assumption the determination of high order interaction effects between input factors is not possible these effects can be crucial for the fwt substructure design some other sophisticated sa approaches based on the aat sampling strategy were proposed to overcome this limitation in aat output variations are induced by varying all the input factors simultaneously for example correlation methods use the correlation coefficient between the inputs and outputs e g the pearson the spearman or the partial correlation coefficient as a sensitivity measure regression analysis methods derive the sensitivity measure by fitting the input output samples to linear nonlinear functions pianosi et al 2016 velarde et al 2019 also employed this approach to the owt foundation fatigue analysis the advantage of these methods is that they can be easily implemented and applied to small datasets nevertheless they can be inaccurate if the input output relationship is strongly non monotonic or nonlinear which also can be the case for fwt substructure design based on the variance decomposition technique variance based sa methods are able to capture the nonlinear factor interaction effects throughout the feasible variability space in glišić s work the well known sobol index sobol 1993 which is a typical variance based sensitivity measure was applied to the fatigue sa of a monopile structure glišić et al 2017 this method makes the accurate quantitative sensitivity measure possible but a large number of function evaluations have to be paid to achieve converged results thus in order to improve the analysis efficiency variance based sa is usually conducted in conjunction with surrogate modeling also called metamodeling once surrogate models are set up the time consuming function evaluations are approximated by a simple algebraic calculation based on this method müller 2020 successfully quantified the load sensitivity of a fwt system to environmental conditions with an acceptable computational effort another way to speed up sa is to utilize the stepwise selection of input factors its main idea is that the simple and cost effective sa methods e g the morris method the pearson coefficient method the linear regression method etc are employed in the early stage of sa so as to identify the less influential factors then followed by application of more computationally intensive refined methods to a smaller set of input factors inspired by this idea hübler et al 2017 proposed a hierarchical four step global sa method for owt it is shown that for different substructures and load cases only a small subset of parameters is influential and many other inputs can be regarded as deterministic without losing accuracy these applications have demonstrated that sa is a powerful statistical tool that can help designers better understand the impact of various factors on offshore wind turbines the optimization of fwt substructure has long been regarded as a black box problem because we lack the knowledge of how the design variables affect the objective functions up to now no relevant research has comprehensively bridged the gap between the design variables i e hull shape and mooring layout and its performance indicators such as the manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics which is important to the fwt substructure design in the early stage this study attempts to address this problem by using sa fig 1 illustrates the input output logic for the fwt substructure sa in this work the inputs are the parameters that describe the geometry configuration of the structure based on which the inherent properties can be derived overall the aims of this study are twofold a to identify the design variables that are critical for the floater mooring configuration optimization during the conceptual design stage b to gain a better understanding of the high dimensional design space of a four column semi submersible substructure for fwt a case study is set up for a 10 mw floating wind turbine at first the feasible design space of the fwt substructure is defined with the consideration of design constraints the calculation of three categories of output indicators i e manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics are introduced in section 4 subsequently two selected sa methods are described and the sa workflow is summarized in section 5 finally all the sa results will be presented and discussed in section 6 and conclusions are drawn at the end of the paper 2 definition of the input variability space fig 2 shows the investigated fwt system it is the dtu 10mw reference floating wind turbine bak et al 2013 mounted on a four column steel semi submersible platform proposed by nautilus floating solutions s l yu et al 2017 the platform operates on the sea area of 130 m water depth and is equipped with a four line catenary mooring system 90 angle between adjacent lines the basic information of the original design such as the geometry dimensions structural and hydrodynamic properties had been summarized in a public definition document of the floating wind project lifes50 funded from the european union s horizon 2020 research and innovation program yu et al 2017 the first step to set up the sensitivity study is to define the design space the substructure is parameterized by 11 variables which are listed and illustrated in table 1 and fig 2 respectively it should be noted that the minimum air gap required is an important consideration for the deck height of floating structures however a constant deck height above swl 7 776 m identical to the original design is employed throughout the sensitivity study in this way a constant design of the tower can be used the tower height depends on the deck height above swl if a constant hub height is applied which helps to simplify the analysis and stay focus on the substructure also for the sake of simplification structural components like stiffeners and bulkheads within the hull are not included the variable steel wall thickness in table 1 can be interpreted as an equivalent thickness which incorporates the mass contributions from the outer surface and the inner components given a draft value the ballast weight is determined by the equilibrium between the hull displacement and the total weight of the floating system turbine platform ballast and vertical load of the mooring pretension the mooring line configuration is described by four parameters based on these values some other mooring properties like the equivalent weight per length in water ω moor n m and the extensional stiffness ea n can be estimated by the following equations with the assumption that studless chain lines are employed barltrop 1998 1 ω m o o r 0 1875 d c h a i n 2 2 e a 90000 d c h a i n 2 3 constraints it will be risky to directly carry out the sa in the design space defined in table 1 because obviously not all the designs meet the basic requirement of floating structures and the infeasible designs will deteriorate the sa results hence multiple constraint conditions are applied to filter out the infeasible samples firstly in order to ensure the geometric rationality of the new generated designs the constraint conditions summarized in table 2 are employed besides the constraints related to design principles for floating structures should also be carefully taken into account for example the hydrostatic restoring capability particularly in the roll pitch degree of freedom dof is an important performance indicator for the floating platform because it correlates to the wind induced heel angle which will affect the wind power production and the maximum allowable tilting angle designs with large restoring stiffness will have a small mean roll pitch angle however it may also lead to a low natural period that overlaps with incident wave periods and results in resonant responses to further reduce the risk of resonance it is common to require a separation between heave and roll pitch natural period typically at least a few seconds overall four constraints are considered for the filtering of platform designs dnv rp 0286

q 4 and q 5 are the platform mean roll and pitch angle under rated wind condition ω eigen 3 ω eigen 4 and ω eigen 5 are the natural frequency in heave roll and pitch dof respectively these physical

with the floater see pegalajar jurado et al 2018 c moor is the linearized mooring stiffness matrix about the platform mean displacement where the elements in the seventh and eighth row and column are

1 c struc c moor q ω where q is the 8 1 platform motion vector m and a are the 8 8 mass and added mass matrix since a depends on frequency the eigenvalue problem is solved by using the iterative approach for each frequency the eight possible natural frequencies are computed when one of the eight possible frequencies obtained is equal to the frequency of that particular iteration in the loop a system natural frequency is found due to its low cost and easy installation drag embedment anchors are frequently used in the catenary mooring system they work in a certain range of uplift angle normally 30 50 and a large angle induced by platform motions may lead to dragging failure to avoid this happening sufficient length of mooring line that lies on sea bed is needed in this case no vertical tension is applied on the anchor for this work it is assumed that at least one tenth of the mooring length is required to lie on the sea bed 11 l m o o r t v f r l d ω m o o r l m o o r 10 where t v frld is the vertical tension at fairlead the stiffness of the mooring system is another performance indicator of concern large translational platform displacements may result in the damage of dynamic cables as proposed by the literature benassai et al 2018 the reference platform admissible offset to water depth ratio 0 15 is employed 12 δ x o f f s e t z w a t e r 0 15 it should be noted that the platform offset and the fairlead tension vary with different environmental conditions but their mean amplitudes are mainly attributable to the mean aerodynamic loads which are available from the turbine thrust coefficient curve for this reason a quick preliminary inspection for eq 11 12 can be carried out under the rated wind condition considering that the mooring lines behave differently from different load directions the constraints are examined from 0 to 40 wind direction 0 aligns with the x axis in fig 2 with an interval of 10 the mooring tensions are calculated by using an in house quasi static code one of the key considerations in wind turbine design is the avoidance of resonant tower oscillations excited by rotor thrust fluctuations at rotational 1p or blade passing frequency 3p for three blade turbines as a boundary condition of floating wind turbines the platform hydrostatic and the mooring restoring stiffness has a remarkable impact on the tower eigenfrequency thus it is necessary to ensure that the tower eigenfrequency is outside the resonant region for each of platform mooring design fig 3 presents the campbell diagram of the dtu 10mw reference wind turbine the blue areas denote the resonant regions in which the tower eigenfrequency can be excited by the 1p 3p and 6p aerodynamic loads during the operation of the turbine while the green areas are the regions of potential feasible design which can be customarily categorized into stiff soft and soft soft design according to the relationship between the tower natural frequency and the exciting frequencies burton et al 2011 in this work only the stiff area is considered in the sa analysis because on the one hand the soft and soft soft areas overlap with the wave frequencies which normally range from 0 05 hz to 0 3 hz on the other hand in general the tower of floating wind turbine is subjected to larger internal loads than the one of onshore turbine soft designs are less likely to meet the requirements of ultimate and serviceability limit states 4 output evaluations 4 1 manufacturing cost the total construction expenditure of a floating substructure is composed of numerous aspects some of which greatly depend on project specific conditions such as the installation cost and the transportation cost thus this study only focuses on the manufacturing cost that is closely related to structural dimensions as the literature benveniste et al 2016 reports the total manufacturing cost of a single floating substructure includes the material cost the labor cost and the overhead cost the material cost consists of the expenditure on structural steel and ballast which can be easily estimated by multiplying the total mass by the material price for steel substructures the labor cost is mainly related to the welding length and the painting area farkas and jármai 2013 the welding length depends on the size of the raw steel plate that should be estimated based on steel industry standards dimension limitations of transportation vehicles as well as processing machines e g steel sheet rolling machine in this work we assume that the raw steel plate with a dimension of 10 m length 4 m width is adopted an example of the welding footprints for column and beam pontoon components are presented in fig 4 the fabrication time for welding is composed of three

is obtained the welding cost can be calculated by multiplying the labor price the estimation of painting cost is based on the painting price per unit area proposed by tizani et al 1996 a similar approach is applied for the mooring line cost estimation the overhead cost is not directly related to the manufacturing process but is necessary to run the business activity for instance labor administration office materials amortization and so on based on the engineering experience it accounts for around 27 of the total manufacturing cost benveniste et al 2016 finally the total manufacturing cost is estimated by the following equation 14 tc m ptfm p steel m blst p blst t w 1 t w 2 t w 3 p labor a p paint m moor p moor 0 73 where m ptfm m blst and m moor are the platform

probability distributions those parameters and distributions listed in table 3 are based on the price surveys from existing cost analysis literatures see tizani et al 1996 myhr et al 2014 trading

samples are generated by using the nataf transformation technique liu and der kiureghian 1986 and the sensitivity indices see section 5 are computed for each price combination 4 2 structural properties structural properties here mainly refer to the restoring stiffness and the natural frequency of platform tower displacement to compute these quantities basic information such as the mass cog and moment of inertia calculation are required to realize batch calculation the parametric modeling technique is employed with the aid of the computer aided design cad program catia the hydrostatic stiffness is characterized by the fifth diagonal element of the c struc matrix 15 c struc 55 z i m i g ρ w g wp x 2 d s ρ w g v sub z c o b where m i and z i are the mass and the cog of the ith body of the multibody system z c o b is the z coordinate of cob the mooring property is characterized by the linearized horizontal restoring stiffness which can be estimated by the linear least squares fitting of the restoring force displacement curves around the platform undisplaced position with a consideration of 3 m perturbation in surge the platform and mooring properties are used as a description of tower boundary conditions and the tower modal analysis is carried out by using bmodes bir 2005 the first order fore aft natural frequency is concerned for this sa study 4 3 hydrodynamics for moored semi submersibles the wave induced motion response is mainly composed of two parts the wave frequency and the low frequency response the former is induced by the first order hydrodynamic load which is computed as 16 f hydro 1 ω x ω 2 s ω δ ω e i ϕ x ϕ s where x ω is first order wave excitation force moment for a unit wave amplitude s ω is the one side wave power spectrum density psd ϕ x and ϕ s are the phase for x ω and s ω respectively the low frequency response is induced by the second order hydrodynamic load which is critical for the semi submersibles because it can excite the resonant response typically in the less damped surge sway dof and consequently lead to considerable loads in mooring lines this effect is characterized by the full difference frequency quadratic transfer function qtf which can be computed by using the pinkster s approach pinkster 1980 given a wave spectrum of s ω the low frequency hydrodynamic loads are calculated as 17 f hydro 2 ω d ω d ω m ω n qtf ω d 2 s ω m δ ω 2 s ω n δ ω e i ϕ q t f ϕ m ϕ n where qtf ω d is the difference frequency hydrodynamic coefficient for the ω m ω n frequency pair ω d ω m ω n ϕ q t f denotes the phase for qtf ω d while ϕ m and ϕ n are the phases for the mth and nth wave component the wave induced motion response is solved by substituting the hydrodynamic loads to the equation of motion the first and second order responses are solved separately so as to investigate their influencing factors independently in sa 18 q 1 ω ω 2 m a ω i ω b r a d ω b v i s ω c s t r u c c moor 1 f hydro 1 ω 19

σ i 2 w j 1 n σ i j 2 p j 5 sensitivity analysis methodology according to the classification of global sa methods given by the literature pianosi et al 2016 two methods are able to deal with the nonlinear input output relationship the variance based method vbm and the density based method dbm both methods are based on the aat sampling strategy i e output variations are induced by varying all the input factors simultaneously the direct influence as well as the interaction effects of input factors on the output variations can be captured 5 1 variance based method given a model of the form y f x 1 x 2 x k with y a scalar output of the model f which is a function of k input factors x 1 x 2 x k the theory basis of vbm is that the output variance v y is a good proxy of output variation and it can be decomposed into items contributed by various sources of input variations saltelli et al 2010 26 v y i k v i i k j i k v i j v 12 k where v i represents the partial variance in y due to the individual main effect of the ith input factor while v ij is partial variance in y attributed to the interaction between the ith and jth factor so on and so forth for the higher order terms dividing both sides of the equation by v y we get the variance based sensitivity indices si 27 i k s i i k j i k s i j s 12 k 1 correspondingly s i is the main effect or the first order index that measures the direct contribution to output variance from individual factors mathematically it is the expected reduction in output variance when x i is completely determined without any uncertainty saltelli et al 2010 28 s i v y e x i v x i y x i v y v x i e x i y x i v y where v x i y x i indicates the variance of y taken over all possible values of x i all input factors except x i while keeping x i fixed e x i is the expectation operator taken over all possible values of x i the equation is simplified to one term by using the identity v x i e x i y x i e x i v x i y x i v y mood 1950 another popular variance based measure is the total order index s ti it measures the overall contribution from an input factor considering its direct effect and its interactions with other factors i e s ti is the sum of all items in eq 27 that related to x i considering v x i e x i y x i is the main effect of x i v y v x i e x i y x i must give the contribution of all x i related terms in eq 26 s ti thus can be written as 29 s t i v y v x i e x i y x i v y e x i v x i y x i v y the computation of these two variance based indices is quite straightforward the best practices given by saltelli et al 2010 recommended two efficient estimators for s i and s ti 30 v x i e x i y x i 1 n v j 1 n v f b j f a b i j f a j 31 e x i v x i y x i 1 2 n v j 1 n v f a j f a b i j 2 where a and b are two n v k independent sampling matrices where n v is the number of sampling points and k is the number of input factors they can be generated from a sobol quasi random sequence of size n v 2k a is the left half of the matrix and b is the right part of it a b i is the matrix that all columns are from a except the ith column which is from b i and j are the indices for input factors and sampling points respectively f denotes the output of corresponding sampling subset vbm is supposed to be more accurate than most of the commonly used sa methods such as the elementary effect test the correlation and regression analysis method and the statistical test because it is capable of capturing the nonlinear input output behavior another attractive feature is that the first order and higher order indices reflect the structure of the model itself oakley and o hagan 2004 which is beneficial to gain deeper insight into the black box problems e g substructure optimization for fwts however this feature is based on the variance decomposition with the assumption that input factors are independent the presence of correlations among input factors will deteriorate the tidy correspondence between variance based indices leading to counterintuitive results pianosi et al 2016 another assumption of vbm is that output variance is a good indicator that can fully characterize the output variation however that is not true when the output distribution is multi modal or highly skewed liu et al 2006 one typical example is the nonlinear function f x 1 x 2 x 1 x 2 where x 1 and x 2 both follow χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom 10 and 13 978 respectively liu et al 2006 as fig 5 shows its output distribution is positively skew with a long right tail and the associated scatter plots indicate that in general x 1 is more influential on the output than x 2 which is also confirmed by the uncertainty analysis in liu et al 2006 however the total effect indices s t1 and s t2 by vbm are 0 5442 and 0 5462 showing an equal importance between the two factors it is certain that the conditions of substructure design problem will not perfectly fulfill these assumptions on the one hand the constraint conditions tailor the design space which is constructed by multiple dimensional variables see table 1 in this process these variables will inevitably more or less be correlated with each other even though they are sampled independently before the constraint conditions apply on the other hand the input output relations for this study are nonlinear hydrodynamics in particular highly skewed output may occur therefore it can be expected that applying vbm alone cannot guarantee the reliability of sa results 5 2 density based method the dbm is also introduced to this work in order to make up the limitations of vbm and increase the credibility of this sensitivity study via approach to approach comparison the key idea of dbm is to measure sensitivity through the variations in output pdf or cumulative distribution function cdf more specifically the sensitivity to input x i is measured by the divergence between the output unconditional pdf cdf which is generated by varying all the input factors synchronously and the conditional pdf cdf which is obtained by varying all the input factors but fixing x i to a prescribed value pianosi and wagener pianosi and wagener 2015 recommended using cdf as it makes the sensitivity index si easier to compute than the pdf approach following their practice the cdf divergence is represented by the kolmogorov smirnov statistic 32 k s x i max f y f y x i where f y and f y x i denotes the unconditional and conditional cdf respectively as ks depends on which value is x i fixed the si of dbm t i considers a statistic over all possible values of x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n 33 t i s t a t i s t i c x i x i 1 x i 2 x i n k s x i the statistic operation could be the maximum mean or median the mean is employed in this work fig 6 illustrates how this procedure works the red solid line denotes the output unconditional cdf while the dash lines indicate the conditional cdf when x i is fixed to six different values the mean value of the maximum distances between the dash lines and the red solid line are used for sensitivity measure the main advantage of dbm is that it does not rely on any assumption and thus can be applicable to various situations whatever the correlation between input factors and the type of output distribution however it has to be admitted that there is no perfect solution to sensitivity measurement dbm can capture the total effect but is difficult to recognize the main effect for individual input factors hence cannot explicitly reflect the model structure as vbm does even so dbm will be a good complement to vbm the main differences between vbm and dbm are summarized in table 5 5 3 sensitivity analysis workflow fig 7 summarizes the sa workflow for this work at first n v design samples are generated by sobol quasi random sequence after the initial input variability space is defined the constraint conditions are applied to inspect the feasibility of the generated samples the total manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamic performance are estimated for those designs that meet the basic requirement of floating structures with these results the sensitivity indices can be computed based on vbm and dbm normally it is not easy to make a reasonable guess for the number of samples thus a convergence analysis is carried out at the end of the loop the sampling subset will be extended and the sa procedure repeats until the si well converges 6 results and discussion 6 1 independence of input factors vbm has a relatively strict requirement on the input and output properties which should be carefully examined prior to the discussions on si results totally 145 100 design samples are generated by the sobol quasi random sequence only 9304 of them can fulfill the constraint conditions the proportion of infeasible designs is over 93 based on these valid samples correlation coefficients between input factors are calculated and presented in table 6 the elements with an absolute value greater than 0 2 are marked in red though most input factors show a good independence there are still several factors that are highly correlated one typical example is l moor and r moor fig 8 a displays all the feasible mooring l moor r moor combinations due to the constraint conditions the valid samples distribute along a narrow band and it shows a strong linear correlation between the two factors merely 3 4 r moor values are available for each l moor obviously this feature violates the vbm assumption that the input factors should be independent to address this problem l moor and r moor are treated as an integrated input factor when calculating the vbm si it is assumed that r moor is completely dependent on l mor more specifically when generating a b i for l moor the column elements of l moor and r moor in matrix a are substituted at the same time by the corresponding column elements from matrix b another example is r and d which is shown in fig 8 b with the increase of r the range of d gradually decreases at the end only the small or medium values are available this is attributed to the constraint condition eq 5 designs with large column spacing and radius tend to have a large hydrostatic stiffness resulting in a low pitch roll natural period that overlaps with wave periods for this reason the large large combinations are discarded which finally leads to the considerable correlation between these two factors a similar situation can be observed between w potn r and d the correlation between d and h frld is due to the geometrical constraint 6 2 skewness of output distribution the pattern of output distribution is also great of concern for the vbm application fig 9 presents the normalized pdfs of the investigated output in this work i e the total manufacturing cost tc the platform natural frequency in surge ω 1 and pitch ω 5 the fundamental tower bending frequency ω 7 the first order weighted standard deviation of platform surge σ 1 w 1 pitch σ 5 w 1 nacelle acceleration σ a n a c w 1 and the second order weighted standard deviation of platform surge σ 1 w 2 pitch σ 5 w 2 nacelle acceleration σ a n a c w 2 all the outputs follow unimodal distribution but their patterns are quite different tc and ω 5 basically follow normal distribution and their skewness see the values near the legend is small but for ω 1 σ 5 w 1 σ 1 w 2 σ 5 w 2 and σ a n a c w 2 long tails are seen on the right hand side of the curves thus their skewness is much higher the skewness of ω 7 σ 1 w 1 and σ a n a c w 1 is somewhere between them therefore it can be expected that vbm is more likely to have a better performance on tc and ω 5 than it does on ω 1 ω 1 σ 5 w 1 σ 1 w 2 σ 5 w 2 and σ a n a c w 2 6 3 convergence analysis as proposed in müller 2020 a convergence study is carried out in order to ensure that the sample size is sufficient to derive reasonable si results the convergence plots of vbm and dbm are displayed in fig 10 each subgraph describes the sensitivity contribution of one specific input factor to the 10 investigated outputs it can be seen that most of the si curves well converge for vbm basically a sample size of 3000 is required to achieve a reasonable convergence while 5000 samples are needed for dbm however it doesn t mean vbm is more computationally efficient than dbm because for dbm the total function evaluations are equal to the number of sample points but vbm has to spend additional computation efforts on the crossover sample subset a b i eq 30 31 all the si values are in the range of 0 1 the s ti values are always larger than their corresponding s i these observations indicate that the sa is well implemented serving as a good basis for the following discussions on how the platform mooring configuration influences the manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics 6 4 manufacturing cost fig 11 compares the manufacturing cost si of 10 input factors to facilitate the comparison the vbm si are normalized by the maximum s ti while the dbm si are normalized by the maximum t i in order to investigate the influence of price variation on the results si are computed for 2000 price combinations the bar length represents the median value of the normalized si on the top of each bar is a box plot denoting the variation range of si minimal variations are seen for most of the input factors demonstrating that the influence of price fluctuation is small in general columns are the main components for semi submersible structures which take up most of the material usage and labor cost for welding and painting thus it can be expected that design variables related to column dimension will play a key role on the total manufacturing cost the sa results show that the column radius is the most influential factor no matter from the perspective of s i s ti or t i the vbm ranks the platform draft s ti the second however its s i value is relatively small this implies that its sensitivity contributions to manufacturing cost mainly rely on the interaction effect with some other design variables it can be inferred that this interactive variable is the column radius because for some other factors their si values are either too small or their interaction effects are too weak dbm presents a different way of ranking the total effect of platform draft is moderate which is comparable to the column spacing pontoon width and wall thickness the chain diameter is the more influential factor which rank the second however the two results are still in agreement in some respects for instance the influence of deck height and fairlead position can almost be ignored the mooring line length is less important than the chain diameter which is consistent with the relation m m o o r d c h a i n 2 l m o r where m m o o r is total mass of the mooring lines it would be beneficial to qualitatively assess sensitivity by visual inspection of the input output samples on the one hand it is the most reliable approach to identify the divergence between vbm and dbm on the other hand compared with the global quantitative sa methods that merely provide a very general averaged sensitivity assessment it incorporates local sensitivity information thus it is a good complement to the quantitative sa scatter plot is the most commonly used tool for visualization pianosi et al 2016 it should be noted that the input factors are sampled discretely in this work e g only 6 values are available for column radius from 3 m to 8 m with an interval of 1 m each discrete input can correspond to thousands of output values which will lead to a highly overlapping and ambiguous plot to better display the output statistical features at each input value box plots are employed instead and the results are presented in fig 12 the red dots and horizontal lines indicate the mean and median values respectively the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles the whiskers correspond to a coverage of approximately 2 7σ σ is standard deviation of the data the cross marks the sample data outside the coverage note that fig 12 is based on the steel labor and mooring price of 0 524 kg 27 h and 2 kg respectively the box plots can clearly reflect the main effect s i which is defined by the v x i e x i y x i term in eq 28 at first the output expectation is taken over all input factors except x i keeping x i fixed at a specific value then the variance operator is taken over all possible values of x i in general s i is the variance of red dots shown in the box plots the monotonous red dots with large gradient tend to have a larger variance this is the case for column radius wall thickness chain diameter and pontoon width the s i results in fig 11 match quite well with this order but apparently underestimate the contribution of pontoon width the pontoon width s i is even smaller than the pontoon height which is counterintuitive for platform draft and column spacing the mean manufacturing cost experiences a visible increase at the beginning but its growth rate significantly drops down or even a negative growth rate is seen column spacing finally tends to converge to a constant value consistent with the explanation for fig 8 b it is the constraint of pitch roll natural period eq 5 that prevents unlimited cost increase the convergence or the decline segment offsets the sensitivity contribution from the initial ascending segment therefore on average relatively small s i values of these two input factors are seen in fig 11 underneath the box plots there shows the pdf of input factors the dash lines and solid lines indicate the distributions before and after the constraint conditions applied respectively remarkable change of distribution is seen in the input factors that highly get involved in constraints the initial sampling subset generated by sobol quasi random sequence basically follows the uniform distribution with the filtering of infeasible design combinations the kurtosis and skewness of distribution increase for vbm the calculated si tends to reflect the sensitivity in data intensive areas rather than the less dense areas in the case of draft column spacing and pontoon width although visible output variations are seen on the left hand side of the box plots the samples with large pdf values mainly lie in the region of mild output variation this is another reason for relatively small s i values coming out for these three input factors however dmb doesn t have this partial problem because as fig 6 illustrates each input value corresponds to one output cdf curve and the sensitivity measurement is the statistical result of all these cdfs with equal treatment this difference between the two methods can partially explain the significant divergence between s ti and t i in column spacing and pontoon width according to the definition formula eq 29 it is difficult to visualize the total effect s ti particularly for the high dimensional problem but we can achieve this indirectly by displaying the interaction between input factors because total effect is the sum of main effect and interaction effect fig 11 indicates a strong interaction between platform draft and column spacing it is reviewed by the three dimensional scatter plot in fig 13 in areas where the column radius is relatively small the manufacturing cost increase slowly as draft increases but the growth slope increases rapidly with the increase of column radius therefore from an economic point of view it would be better to adjust the substructure design through draft rather than column radius to meet the design requirements if it is possible in general most of the vbm results match well with the visualized data that is premised on a small skewness of output pdf as fig 9 shows compared to the dbm si the total effects of column spacing and pontoon width are underestimated see figs 11 and 12 which can be due to two main reasons the first is the unevenness of samples so that the vbm si tends to reflect the sensitivity in data intensive areas regardless of the less dense regions the second is the dependence between input factors that violates the assumption of vbm as table 6 shows the correlation between column spacing and pontoon width is non negligible 6 5 structural properties the surge natural frequency is a function of structure mass includes added mass and mooring stiffness fig 14 presents the normalized si results for horizontal mooring stiffness and platform surge natural frequency for the former the mooring length and chain diameter are the dominant factors the platform configuration parameters like column spacing also have a considerable impact because they influence the catenary shape thus resulting in different mooring geometric stiffness fig 15 illustrates the importance of fairlead position to mooring stiffness sample points of the same color denote the designs that equip mooring lines with the same length and chain diameter but different fairlead positions it is shown that the horizontal mooring stiffness varies a lot along with column spacing this explains the sensitivity contribution from column spacing as for fig 14 b dbm shows that the importance of platform configuration parameters increases to a comparable level of mooring parameters due to the high skewness of surge natural frequency distribution see fig 9 the vbm si results show a significant divergence with those of dbm it predicts that the mooring length is the most important factor and the contributions of platform configuration parameters are quite low once again this divergence is reviewed by the box plots shown in fig 16 it clearly shows that column radius and chain diameter are two of the most sensitive input factors while draft column spacing and mooring length are relatively less significant this observation is basically consistent with the dbm results and also confirms the inaccuracy of vbm however although the vbm performance is greatly affected by the skewness of output distribution its prediction on non sensitive factors still looks reasonable the s i values of deck height pontoon height and wall thickness are close to 0 the small skewness of platform pitch natural frequency and first order tower bending frequency give us confidence in the vbm results this is confirmed by the si comparison presented in fig 17 the total effects measured by vbm agree well with dbm platform pitch natural frequency is a function of hydrostatic stiffness which results from the effects of buoyancy gravity and water plane area of the floater fig 17 a and c shows the si for the pitch natural frequency and the hydrostatic stiffness respectively both of which indicate that the column spacing is the most sensitive input factor this implies that the water plane area effect plays a more critical role than the buoyancy gravity effect because the second moment of water plane area greatly depends on column spacing the influence of draft and column radius is also remarkable but the vbm results indicate that most of their contributions are from the interaction effects which apparently occur between the three main platform parameters the plot of the first order tower bending frequency in fig 17 b presents a similar trend with the pitch natural frequency the tower frequency is also a function of hydrostatic stiffness however it should be noted that their mechanism is different from that between pitch natural frequency and hydrostatic stiffness for an eigenvalue problem the solution not only depends on the inherent properties of the investigated system such as the mass stiffness and damping but also the boundary conditions applied the variations in platform hydrostatic stiffness will change the boundary conditions of the tower and thus result in the variations of eigenfrequencies fig 18 a displays how the platform pitch natural frequency varies with the three most influential input factors the increase or decrease of the natural frequency depends on whether the input factor contributes more to the stiffness term or to the inertia term interestingly a hybrid situation occurs in the case of column spacing the increase of column spacing will enlarge the second moment of water plane area hydrostatic stiffness as well as the moment of inertia of the floater the figure implies that the intensity of these two opposite effects greatly depends on the specific value of column spacing below 34 m the increase of column spacing contributes more to the hydrostatic stiffness as a result the statistics of pitch natural frequency increases beyond 34 m on the contrary the increase of moment of inertia which is proportional to the square of column spacing becomes more dominant thus an opposite trend is seen the growth of pitch natural frequency is far more notable with the increase of column radius than the draft which is consistent with the sa results in fig 17 a in fig 18 b the tower frequency tends to get lower as the size of the substructure increases as it involves the complex eigenvalue problem the reason behind is so implicit that an additional investigation is required 6 6 hydrodynamics the first order hydrodynamic performance of the floater is characterized by the weighted standard deviations of motion response defined by eq 24 25 the si results of three dofs of interest are displayed in fig 19 in general the three platform parameters draft column radius and column spacing which greatly determine the mass hydrostatic stiffness and wave excitation loads are the main considerations for the first order hydrodynamics vbm and dbm reach a consensus on this point though they diverge on the significance order of these three factors for the surge dof although the mooring parameters dominate the platform horizontal restoring stiffness as fig 14 a shows their impact on the first order hydrodynamics is relatively small in other words the contribution of the horizontal stiffness in eq 18 is less significant than the inertia and the wave excitation term both methods predict that the column spacing is an influential factor for the first order horizontal platform motion the main reason is that the variations in column spacing will change the column interaction in the wave field hence resulting in notable variations in hydrodynamic loads the influence of column radius is comparable and vbm indicates that it strongly interacts with draft and column spacing as for the pitch dof in fig 19 b draft plays a more crucial role than it does for the surge dof increasing draft will lead to greater moment of inertia added mass and hydrostatic stiffness because of the lower center of gravity which is beneficial to gain more stability for the floater on the other hand generally it will also increase the wave excitation loads because of the larger hull however the wave loads decrease with the increase of water depth since that the fluid particles move more slowly in the deeper water thus the total increase of wave loads shouldn t be large as a whole the positive side outweighs the negative side therefore it can be expected that properly increasing the platform draft can help to alleviate the first order pitch motion the nacelle acceleration mainly results from the sum of platform horizontal and rotational motion thus its si results inherit the characteristics of fig 19 a b fig 20 displays the first order response box plots against the three most influential input factors most of the figures present a common phenomenon there exists a critical value for the input factors below which remarkable variations in wave induced motion occur with the increase of draft and column spacing beyond that the statistics of response remains stable as mentioned above increasing column spacing helps to mitigate the column interaction in the wave field the box plots indicate that this effect is beneficial for the response reduction when the column spacing is smaller than 34 m which is the minimum distance to fully get rid of the column interaction effects it should be noted that this critical distance is related to the characteristic wave length thus is a site dependent value interestingly the critical draft is also around 34 m below this value the wave induced motion declines dramatically with the increase of draft this observation verifies the statement on fig 19 b above afterwards the statistical characteristics of platform motion almost stops changing however in the case of nacelle acceleration there shows a rising trend though not very significant a similar phenomenon had been discussed by lemmer et al 2020 they found that semi submersible platforms of shallow draft tend to suffer from lower wave induced fore aft motion at hub height than the deep draft designs due to the counter phase surge and pitch forcing the shallow draft platforms response in an out of phase way that pitch is positive when surge is negative thus the offset of these two dofs results in a relatively small tower top response in contrast the deep draft platforms have an in phase response of surge and pitch to waves the superposition of these two dofs leads to a remarkable tower top response these findings imply that it is inefficient to design the substructure to be particularly large from a point view of optimization practice it is recommended to set up a search domain design space that is equal or a little bit larger to the range of the critical values the platform and nacelle motion rises significantly with the increase of column radius therefore limiting the column radius is the key for hydrodynamic performance improvement as well as cost reduction the difference frequency second order hydrodynamic response is another performance indicator of concern for semi submersible substructures and the sa results are plotted in fig 21 for platform surge motion although notable divergence of the two methods is seen because of the skewness problem both methods indicate the importance of the mooring parameters the reason is that the platform slow drift motion is sensitive to the surge natural frequency which depends on the mooring configuration for instance in the sampling subset we found three typical substructure designs they share the same hull shape d 18 m r 7 m d 34 m but equip with three different mooring systems their surge natural frequencies are 0 0454 0 0704 and 0 109 rad s the corresponding σ 1 2 w values are 0 802 0 489 and 0 276 m respectively the maximum value is almost three times larger than the minimum fundamentally this reflects the gradient of the force qtf matrix in the direction perpendicular to the diagonal the force qtf matrix is mainly determined by the geometry and the mass distribution of the floater the matrix elements that play a key role in the structure response are those whose difference frequency is equal or adjacent to the natural frequency of the system these elements are located along the line that parallels to the matrix diagonal and the distance is the function of natural frequency figs 14 b and fig 16 indicate that the column radius chain diameter and column spacing are three of the most relevant parameters for surge natural frequency this feature is also inherited by the case of low frequency surge response however as fig 17 a shows the pitch natural frequency is basically independent from the mooring parameters therefore fig 21 b indicates that the low frequency pitch response is dominated by the platform parameters the tower top acceleration results from the platform surge and pitch motion thus it is somehow the combination of the two fig 21 c implies that it is more relevant to the pitch motion as the pitch natural frequency is much higher than the surge the corresponding box plots are displayed in fig 22 it once again demonstrates that dbm has a higher credibility than vbm in the highly skewed cases properly increasing the column spacing and mooring chain diameter is beneficial to mitigate the low frequency surge motion but its effect is far inferior to the effect of limiting the column radius for pitch and tower top motion however increasing the column spacing is the most effective way to minimize the low frequency response consistent with fig 20 the critical column spacing is also around 34 m by comparing figs 20 and 22 it is found that the amplitude of the second order surge and pitch motion is comparable to or sometimes higher than the first order response which implies the importance of the second order hydrodynamics for semi submersibles 7 conclusions in this work a sensitivity analysis procedure for a four column semi submersible floating wind turbine is set up to investigate the influence of substructure configuration parameters on manufacturing cost structural properties and hydrodynamics a large and constrained design space is defined with a consideration of basic design requirements for floating structures two widely used global sensitivity analysis methods vbm and dbm are employed to measure the sensitivity contributions of 10 design parameters the sensitivity indices are verified against the visual inspection of the input output samples and are compared over the design parameters the main conclusions are summarized as follows through the sensitivity analysis it is possible to identify how the design parameters influence the economy and the dynamic properties of the fwt system columns are the main components for semi submersible platforms column radius is the most influential design factor for substructure manufacturing cost and surge natural frequency because it determines the most of the material labor usage and the total mass inertia of the structure the platform pitch and tower fore aft natural frequency are more sensitive to column spacing which not only greatly affects the hydrostatic stiffness through the moment of water plane area but also the moment of inertia of the floater in terms of the first order hydrodynamics column spacing column radius and platform draft are the three of the most critical factors the increase of column spacing can remarkably mitigate the wave frequency response in surge pitch and tower top response the reason is that it alleviates the column interaction effects in wave fields and thus reduces the hydrodynamic loads increasing draft is beneficial to gain more platform stability however these measures are effective only when these two parameters are smaller than a critical value 34 m for this case beyond that the statistical characteristics of the hydrodynamic performance maintains stable the impact of draft is less significant in the case of low frequency second order hydrodynamic response column spacing and radius are much more dominant regarding the application of the sensitivity analysis methods the performance of vbm is affected by the skewness of the output distribution in the cases of small skewness the vbm results agree well with dbm however in the highly skewed cases the vbm results become unacceptable this is because vbm only evaluates the second moment of a distribution however it is no longer a good measure of dispersion for highly skewed distributions moreover the bias sampling due to the applied constraints may also influence the vbm results the vbm sensitivity indices tend to reflect the sensitivity in data intensive areas rather than the less dense areas even so the fwt sensitivity analysis without considering constraint conditions complete sampling subset is not recommended because the proportion of infeasible designs is so high over 93 that it will overwhelm the information from the feasible subset on the contrary dbm does not have these problems as it does not rely on any assumption as the vbm does its results are basically consistent with the visual inspection of the input output samples but the disadvantage is that it cannot reveal the interaction effects between input factors this work is the first step towards achieving the sensitivity analysis framework on the semisubmersible substructure of fwt it provides a new perspective to the fwt substructure design space and demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying sa techniques to the fwt substructure design in the near future these methods will be utilized further to investigate on how the long term dynamic performance e g peak nacelle acceleration and platform tilting angle lifetime fatigue damage at tower base and fairlead is affected by the design parameters as well as the structure inherent properties credit authorship contribution statement shengtao zhou methodology software

performance regardless of the network choice it is also demonstrated that redundancy of training parameters could inject unwanted overfitting reducing model generalization to address this a method for quantifying feature importance has been proposed by exploiting the nature of decision tree algorithms and the gini impurity index reaffirming that structural features do indeed benefit model classification these results highlight the potential of tapping into the untapped pool of structural data for significant wave height prediction paving the way for new research to be undertaken in this direction keywords machine learning significant wave height prediction neural networks classification algorithms gini impurity index decision tree 1 introduction the expansion in various offshore activities along the growing need for managing efficiently marine energy systems and infrastructure such as wave energy converters and oil and gas platforms led to an increased interest in wave parameter characterization for both their design optimization efficient operation and integrity management to this purpose many elaborate studies have been undertaken to investigate wave characterization from multiple perspectives all in common grounds of improving accuracy and reducing computational demands over the years on the basis of growing and decaying wind wave energy spectra numerical models such as the swan ou et al 2002 rogers et al 2007 wam group 1988 hersbach and janssen 1999 monbaliu et al 2000 wave watch iii mentaschi et al 2015 jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 have been developed for solving for the effects of fetch duration and varying wind fields for both the cases of nearshore and deep ocean waves despite the complexity arising from solving the mathematically challenging physical equations that inevitably raise the computational burden these methods have been deemed by many researchers not to be of the desirable accuracy browne et al 2007 zijlema 2010 and do not generalize over various oceans and seas kumar et al 2018 since they require accurate local bathymetric surveys making their implementation a non trivial task browne et al 2007 to address the shortcomings of numerical methods and in an attempt to find an alternative to wave parameter prediction that benefits of reduced computational demands and improved accuracy researchers shifted their focus to data driven methods as the name suggest data driven methods make use of data characterizing the system of interest for determining an unknown mapping or dependencies between the inputs and the outputs zamani et al 2008 in the coastal and ocean engineering domain in particular meteorological and other response data often gathered from surface buoys pressure sensors and acoustic sensors are typically considered as inputs to the system while wave data typically the spatially variable significant wave height and wave period obtained in field or through simulations represent the outputs on which the model is to be trained and validated upon indeed over the previous decade there has been a tremendous increase in application of data driven methods in oceanic and coastal applications with particular focus on wave height prediction kumar et al 2018 amongst the earliest developed and most commonly used methods neural networks nn are capable of approximating complex nonlinear processes without prior system knowledge elbisy and osra 2019 nn have been extensively used in solving wave height prediction and forecasting problems browne et al 2007 deo et al 2001 gunaydın 2008 rao and mandal 2005 tolman et al 2005 providing a good alternative to statistical regression time series analyses and traditional numerical methods mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 still while these methods are considered superior to their predecessors they suffer with generalization overfitting and require time consuming trial and error for finding network parameters such as the number of hidden layers and neurons mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 along a similar trajectory and in an effort to improve the accuracy of nn while avoiding overfitting of the model feed forward neural networks ffnn deo et al 2001 makarynskyy 2004 makarynskyy et al 2005 recurrent neural networks rnn sadeghifar et al 2017 back propagation neural networks bpnn agrawal and deo 2002 makarynskyy 2004 and cascade correlation neural networks ccnn makarynskyy 2004 have been used for predicting wave heights with a reported fluctuating accuracy particularly at different wave height ranges most recently elbisy and osra 2019 compared the group method of data handling type neural networks gdmh nn with multi layer perceptron neural networks mlpnn in the prediction of significant wave height and zero crossing period tested and validated on field data the authors suggest that the gdmh nn is more robust and efficient than the mlpnn having the best prediction accuracy of significant wave height regardless of the wave height range decision tree algorithms have also been employed in the past for the prediction of the significant wave height the study of mahjoobi and shahidi 2008 demonstrated how regression and classification trees using the cart and c5 algorithm respectively can be leveraged in the successful prediction of significant wave heights the authors demonstrated the similarity of the developed decision trees to artificial nn anns in terms of error statistics most importantly the authors highlighted that compared to anns decision tree algorithms can intrinsically derive relative predictor importance through branching of the inputs compared to the time consuming sensitivity analysis required in the development of ann models random forests a multitude of decision trees have also been investigated for the problem of significant wave height prediction in the comparative study of sharma and jain 2018 in their study the developed random forests and anns exhibited similar performance while at the same time these models were outperformed by the particle swarm optimization pso model proposed by the authors of the study most recently in the comparative study of fan et al 2020 random forests were compared to both conventional and deep network methodologies for the case of significant height prediction naturally while random forests exhibited similar performance gains to conventional network methodologies such as the developed anns they were outperformed by the proposed deeper network methodologies of long short term memory lstm and residual network resnet soft computing methods such as the fuzzy inference system fis mahjoobi et al 2008 bayesian interference bi egozcue et al 2005 scotto and soares 2007 and support vector machines svm mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 have been also used in the forecasting and prediction of significant wind height using wind data in a comparative study undertaken by malekmohamadi et al 2011 the authors highlighted the promising results achieved by the three methods concluding that the accuracy of the fis bi svm and artificial nn is nearly the same in another study elgohary et al 2018 compared svm with nonlinear regression methods for the prediction of significant wave height the authors concluded that svm based on the radial basis function is superior to the nonlinear regression methods other popular methods namely k nearest neighbors knn linear regressions lr model trees m5 multilayer perceptron neural networks mlpnn and support vector regression svr algorithms have been investigated in the study of wei 2018 in which the different developed models were used in predicting nearshore wave characteristics during typhoon conditions the authors highlighted the performance of the different models at varying wave height ranges suggesting that the m5 mlpnn and svr have optimum wave height prediction performance at small moderate and large wave heights respectively most recently liu et al 2019 proposed the use of an end to end convolutional network for the prediction of wave height and period using simulated acceleration data of a numerically modeled surface buoy while it is known that converting buoy accelerations to wave heights is not a straight forward task owing to the accelerometer measuring gravity offset along with the acceleration of the buoy resulting to the introduction of a gravity component in each of the instrument s orthogonal directions bender et al 2010 liu et al 2019 had a different motive to bypass the numerical drift introduced during double integration that compromises the accuracy of the method their experiments showed that their data driven approach outperforms traditional numerical integration of the buoy s acceleration at the absence of explicit knowledge of the system s dynamics despite their method being yet to be tested in real sea conditions the approach of statistically correlating structural accelerations responses to significant wave heights shows great promise and paves the way for new research to be undertaken in the domain of machine learning and wave height characterization at the same time although the computational and mathematical issues of calculating wave heights from structural acceleration responses are shown to be alleviated through the use of data driven models setting up surface buoys remains an impractical and expensive task rather a large pool of useful data can be tapped considering the large number of marine and coastal facilities employing structural monitoring equipment to the author s best knowledge characterizing waves through supervised machine learning models trained on both meteorological and structural acceleration data remains to be investigated to this purpose and by exploiting the fact that machine learning models have a large data appetite this study proposes an alternative method for the real time prediction nowcasting of significant wave heights based on the joint use of structural monitoring and meteorological data more specifically acceleration data collected on a fixed bottom coastal jetty located in the southern coasts of cyprus coupled with wind speed and direction data obtained from the meteorological station found onsite are used to extract the features to be used as training inputs in both artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles it is worth highlighting the term prediction used throughout the study suggests the estimation of a value in this case the significant wave height based on the inputs described above in real time therefore it will be appropriate that the term nowcast and prediction of significant wave height be employed in tandem for this specific problem for clarity it would also be appropriate to differentiate prediction from forecasting based on the temporal dimension of the two for the first there exists no time constrain e g the significant wave height could potentially be predicted anytime in the past real time short term and long term future given the described input variables whereas the latter forecasting is futuristic entailing analysis of the past in the present study the effort is guided in the following direction to improve the wave predictive performance of current methodologies by utilizing for the first time readily available data gathered from structural condition monitoring systems present on coastal and offshore infrastructure as a vehicle towards this direction the classification performance of the developed networks is examined for the cases of i artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles for which only meteorological data are used as inputs during the network s training and ii artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles in which both meteorological and structural acceleration data are used during training the reasoning behind investigating these increasing in complexity network configurations is two folded firstly to allow the investigation of the sensitivity of the network to the structural training features establishing a benchmark of the influence of structural data on each model s performance secondly to allow the exploitation of the different machine learning algorithms in an effort to quantify the influence of the training parameters on each network 2 study area and instrumentation the comparison of different machine learning models entails the use of benchmark datasets that allow the developed models to be exposed and compared to literature unfortunately benchmark datasets and corresponding studies containing structural monitoring data along the required wave parameters for fulfilling the purposes of supervised learning do not currently exist to address this limitation and test the presented hypothesis this study exploits the monitoring equipment installed on the fixed bottom coastal jetty located in the southern coasts of cyprus and establishes a database from which both meteorological and structural data can be used to extract machine learning training features in the present study the dataset comprised of wind wave and structural acceleration data recorded for the months january to april 2020 for the data collection the following equipment was used namely a wind anemometer two triaxial accelerometers and a wave radar according to the manufacturer of the instruments the accuracy sensitivity of the accelerometers and wave radar is 0 4 db max over the bandwidth and 6 mm respectively all the equipment installed on the jetty is operated by vtt vassiliko ltd for structural integrity purposes the anemometer s speed and direction were recorded at 14 m above sea level while the wave radar was located at the t junction part of the jetty 10 m above sea level at the location of the wave radar the water depth is 18 70 m it is noteworthy that the seabed topography of the vassiliko bay area is relatively uniform with smooth gradients and no significant irregularities or obstructions aeoliki 2016 the acceleration datasets were acquired from two triaxial accelerometers installed on the coastal jetty the first accelerometer is located at the t junction on the lower deck deck1 of the jetty fig 1 while the second accelerometer is installed on the bridging elements of the t junction and the main structural system the dimensions of the t junction platform are 20 0 m in the x direction and 32 0 m in the y direction fig 1 both the anemometer and wave data were sampled at single minute intervals 0 0167 hz while acceleration data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 8 hz the sampling frequency of 8 hz was selected after numerically calculating the dominant structural modes of the t junction of the jetty to this purpose and for choosing an appropriate sampling frequency a lumped parameter numerical model was developed and standard modal analysis was performed to derive the modal frequencies of the t junction fig 1 illustrates the lumped parameter 2 dof numerical model of the t junction used in the modal analysis of the structure the two dominant structural translational modes are shown in table 1 below evidently there is a higher frequency attributed to the second mode in the y direction owing to the increased length and the corresponding increased stiffness in the particular direction most importantly the modal analysis suggests that in order to satisfy the nyquist frequency criterion the accelerometer s sampling frequency must be set approximately twice the highest frequency mode that is required to be observed since the highest frequency observable dominant translational mode was identified at 3 36 hz it was deemed appropriate that a sampling frequency of 8 hz to be selected to obtain an accurate representation of the structure s dynamic footprint and for increasing the signal to noise ratio the low frequency components of the signal were removed with the use of a butterworth filter and a cut off frequency of 0 1 hz the cut off frequency of 0 1 hz was selected based on the dynamics of the structure and the wave frequencies observed in the vasiliko bay area for the manipulation of the large acceleration dataset and for the compatibility of the acceleration data with the sampling frequencies of the wind and wave data feature extraction was performed on the acceleration dataset in single minute windows more specifically at each window interval the absolute signal energy standard deviation and root mean square values were calculated using parseval s theorem parseval and antoine 1799 and standard algebraic manipulation respectively 3 network training methodology for examining the influence of structural acceleration data in improving the classification performance of supervised machine learning algorithms networks of progressive complexity were designed and evaluated against a set of criteria more specifically simple feedforward neural networks trained to classify inputs according to target classes were succeeded by more advanced decision tree ensembles composed of weighted combinations of multiple classification models a total of four networks consisting of two artificial neural networks and two decision tree ensembles were developed and compared on a set of defined performance indices to exhibit the influence of structural acceleration features on the wave predicting capacity of the developed models the methodology adopted in this investigation is exhibited through the flowchart of fig 2 development of the nn models as a first step towards testing the presented hypothesis a simple feedforward neural network was designed and trained for the prediction of significant wave height exclusively on wind data and their derivative features recorded on the meteorological station found on site thus the term meteorological data will be used throughout the paper when referring to the data collected from the particular station accordingly the recorded m 1 wind speed and wind direction vectors were truncated in minute intervals from which the root mean square rms and standard deviation std values were extracted the resulting features namely rms wind speed rms wind direction std wind speed and std wind direction were used as the n 4 input matrix in the neural network subsequently the features from the input layer were propagated to the neurons of the middle layer commonly known as the hidden layer from this the weighted sums from the hidden layer were passed to the output layer for classification for the particular case the output classes labels were obtained for each of the n observations by discretizing the observed significant wave height h s in 0 20 m bins ranging from 0 2 to 3 8 m resulting to a total of 18 distinct classes the described architecture is exhibited in fig 3 owing to the fact that the model is trained to distinguish between a total of 18 classes the training methodology falls in the context of multiclass classification in accordance to good machine learning practice and in an attempt to obtain less biased models the dataset was divided in three groups for the respective training validation and testing of the developed models accordingly the first set consisting of 70 of wind wave and acceleration data was used for training the models e g finding appropriate weights and biases in the artificial neural network the second set the validation dataset consisting of 15 of the wind wave and acceleration data was used for providing an evaluation of the model fit while at the same time allowing fine tuning model hyperparameters the last set of data the testing dataset consisting of the final 15 of the complete dataset was used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model fit this final dataset which is neither used in training nor in validating the trained model is typically referred in literature as a holdout dataset accordingly from the total 51 444 feature samples 36 010 were used in training while 7717 and 7717 were retained for validation and testing respectively for the particular classification problem the number of hidden layers in the network and their corresponding neurons were selected iteratively it is noteworthy that when the number of hidden layers in the network exceed one the neural network is considered as a deep learning network sze et al 2017 still this paper distinguishes deep from shallow learning networks based on the ability of the first to derive their own features directly from data feature learning while the latter relies on handcrafted features based upon heuristics of the target problem to this end while the presented nn architecture of fig 3 contains a number of hidden layers exceeding 1 it still falls within the notion of shallow learning networks for finding the number of hidden layers a coarse optimization procedure was adopted in this respect 5 layers with neuron numbers ranging from 0 to 160 in 40 neuron bins were considered from this a total of 1364 unique combinations of nn architectures were developed with the following geometric progression of networks per layer single layer 4 network combinations double layer 16 network combinations triple layer 64 combinations quadruple layer 256 network combinations and quintuple layer 1024 network combinations for each of this 1364 unique nn architectures considered the crossentropy loss was calculated in accordance to 1 l o s s 1 n i 1 n j 1 c t i j log x i j 1 t i j log 1 x i j where n is the total number of observations x i j is the network response for a given category t i j is the target value of that category and c is the total number of categories it can be seen that crossentropy loss is calculated as the probability of a given observation being assigned to a given category summed over all categories and observations and normalized by the number of observations following standard nn training practice at each iteration the scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation method moller 1993 was used for minimizing the crossentropy loss through finding appropriate weight and bias values for each of the neurons in the network in this study the activation of each node was calculated with the sigmoid activation function for transforming the linear weight and bias combination to a nonlinear function allowing the application of the mentioned backpropagation method fig 4 exhibits the summary statistics of the coarse optimization procedure performed herein with reference to the same figure it is evident that for this particular problem case the developed nns show insensitivity to the addition of hidden layers rather the presence and extend of the whiskers indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles at increasing number of hidden layers and neuron combinations suggest that the nns are more likely to be sensitive to the variation of the number of neurons in each layer for this reason it was deemed appropriate that for computational efficiency purposes the nn architecture is limited to two hidden layers as shown in fig 3 and further fine tuning of the number of the neurons in each layer is to be performed in accordance to the 2 hidden layer architecture for the training of the second artificial neural network model the architecture presented in fig 3 was conservatively retained while the number of features extended to include the following structural monitoring parameters minute interval rms std and absolute signal energy ase extracted from the accelerometers placed on the jetty for all three orthogonal directions this corresponds to the following structural derived features namely rms accax rms accay rms accaz obtained from the accelerometer a located on deck 1 for all three orthogonal directions rms accbx rms accby rms accbz obtained from the accelerometer b on the t junction bridging elements for all three orthogonal directions similarly std and ase were used to extract the following structural features in the three orthogonal directions namely std accax std accay std accaz std accbx std accby std accbz ase accax ase accay ase accaz ase accbx ase accby ase accbz as a result the input matrix attained the size of n 22 with 18 features being attributed to structural data and 4 features being attributed to meteorological data for both cases the output classes remained 18 fig 5 presents the crossentropy loss calculated for the case of a neural networks trained only on meteorological features and b neural networks trained on both meteorological and structural acceleration derived features based on the 2 layer nn architecture described from these figures the point of minimum crossentropy loss was identified and the number of neurons at each hidden layer was noted for the two networks table 2 summarises the optimized number of hyperparameters selected for the developed artificial neural networks based on the minimum crossentropy loss development of the decision tree ensemble models for the next step following the same procedure as in the case of artificial neural networks tree ensemble classifiers were trained independently on i meteorological and ii a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features through the development of classification ensembles the objective was to use a combination ensemble of decision trees in an attempt to reduce variance while maintaining the low bias attributed single decision tree algorithms for the optimal hyperparameter selection in the ensemble e g finding the number of splits in each tree the number of trees in the ensemble and learning rate that minimize the loss function the following cross validation procedure was adopted 1 tree complexity level was increased from a single split tree stump or decision stump to a maximum n c 1 splits while also varying the learning rate for each ensemble of trees between 0 1 and 1 the resulting splitting sequence attained the form of 30 31 32 3m where 3 m n c 1 and the learning rate set attained the form of 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 n c is the number of observations in each cross validation fold of the k fold validation procedure adopted 2 the cross validated misclassification rate was estimated for each ensemble for a maximum of 150 boosted classification trees using 5 fold cross validation in this optimization procedure for each model a total of k 1 e g 4 different training attempts have been made during each training attempt the model was trained on the k 1 fold data while the first fold was treated as the validation set in doing so each sample was given the opportunity to be used in the holdout set 1 time while also used to train the model k 1 times for each attempt the misclassification rate was calculated and averaged over all attempts resulting theoretically to a less biased model 3 the cumulative cross validated misclassification rate of the ensembles was compared by plotting each ensemble s misclassification rate against the number of trees in the ensemble and different learning rates the results were then plotted on separate plots for varying tree complexity levels splits as seen in fig 4 4 the curve that achieved the minimum misclassification rate was identified and chosen while the corresponding learning cycle and learning rate was noted fig 6 demonstrates how the cross validated misclassification rate behaves at increasing number of trees learning rate and number of splits each curve in this figure contains a minimum cross validated misclassification rate occurring at the optimal number of trees in the ensemble the objective is to identify the maximum number of splits number of trees and learning rate that yields the lowest misclassification rate overall fig 7 and fig 8 complement the preceding figure by exhibiting values of the misclassification rate at varying splits and number of trees the optimal hyperparameter selection for i the tree ensemble trained only on features derived from meteorological data and ii the tree ensemble trained on a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features is summarized in table 3 below it is noteworthy that in the described methodology the adaboostm2 algorithm which extends adaboostm1 from binary to multi class classification is used for converting the set of weak learners into a strong one using this approach model predictions were made by calculating the weighted average of the predictions of each weak classifier accordingly the prediction of the ensemble model is taken as the sum of the weighted predictions it is important to highlight that despite the algorithm being widely considered flexible strong and in some cases better in avoiding model overfitting than other methods particular care should be given in the i quality of data ii presence of outliers and iii noisy data for these reasons the performance of the developed ensemble models should be thoroughly investigated as overfitting might naturally occur owing to the inherent complexity of the ensemble as well as the nature of the particular dataset this issue could be unsurprisingly amplified for the particular case examined herein as the additional features derived from structural acceleration data will naturally tend to overfit the model yielding one that does not generalize well in the following sections the relative performance of the developed models will be investigated thoroughly through the prism of comparative legitimacy overfitting and model generalization 4 classification performance evaluation despite the fact that the procedure adopted is similar to that of binary classification in the sense that each sample is assigned to a single label output class the classifiers developed for the particular problem described in the preceding sections are rather ambitious this is primarily attributed to the requirement of each classifier to distinguish between a total of 18 classes additionally with reference to fig 9 it is evident that the dataset is largely imbalanced for these reasons in order to correctly evaluate and make remarks on the performance of each classifier it is important to examine model performance for each individual class accordingly the sound evaluation of the trained classifier s performance in predicting the significant wave height entails the establishment of a set of multi class classification metrics based on the following four classifier response categories true positive tp the model correctly predicts the positive class true negative tn the model correctly predicts the negative class false positive fp the model incorrectly predicts the positive class false negative fn the model incorrectly predicts the negative class in the above the definition positive class is attributed to the particular class of interest e g if the objective is to identify class 1 this class attains the role of the positive class while the remaining classes e g class 2 18 are considered to be negative similarly when class 2 is to be detected class 2 becomes the positive class while the remaining classes e g 1 and 3 18 are considered the negative classes from these common multi class evaluation metrics for machine learning models are established and calculated according to the following accuracy number of observations identified to be either truly positive or truly negative out of the total number of observations 2 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n it is worth highlighting that since the classes are not equally represented fig 9 the accuracy metric might not be representative of the actual classifier s performance this can be exemplified by assuming a degenerate machine learning classifier that assigns class 2 to all the observations since class 2 represents approximately 25 of the observations the network attains an accuracy of 25 with no classification effort for this reason while the accuracy metric is retained other objective functions namely fscore and kappa statistic will be later defined as they are considered more appropriate measures of classification accuracy particularly for the cases of multi class classification problems with imbalanced datasets to calculate these objective functions the following expressions are defined true positive rate tpr sensitivity recall number of observations correctly identified as positive out of the total actual positives 3 t p r t p t p f n positive predictive values ppv precision number of observations correctly identified as positive out of the total items identified as positive 4 p p v t p t p f p true negative rate tnr specificity number of observations correctly identified as negative out of the total actual negatives 5 t n r t n t n f p fscore the harmonic average of the precision and recall it measures the effectiveness of identification when just as much importance is given to sensitivity as to precision 6 f s c o r e 2 t p r p p v t p r p p v table 4 indicatively summarises the classifier response and the extracted performance metrics for the developed e n s m s network as anticipated the accuracy index does a poor job in representing the true accuracy of the developed network to counter this sensitivity tpr precision ppv and their derivative fscore inarguably provide a better indicator of classification performance still it would be rather difficult to make accurate and concluding remarks on the classification performance if biases and corresponding identification of chance or base case level of the statistics are not taken into account it is therefore deemed important to establish further metrics that reflect the probability that the network s prediction is informed rather than being based on chance subsequently and for maintaining the fairness of the investigation of each individual network s classification performance as well as the comparison of the different networks this study makes use of the metrics presented by powers 2007 namely informedness markedness and kappa statistic cohen s kappa it is worth highlighting that each metric serves different purposes still consideration of a collection of metrics allows a more comprehensive study of classifier s performance the established metrics are calculated according to the following expressions informedness measures how informed is the network about both positives and negatives according to the following expression 7 i n f o r m e d n e s s t p r p f p r n in which r p t p f n is the total actual positives and r n t n f p represents the total actual negatives markedness measures the trustworthiness of positive and negative predictions by the network and is expressed by the following 8 m a r k e d n e s s t p p p f n p n where p p t p f p is the total number of observations identified as positives and p n f n t n represents the total number of observations identified as negatives from the expressions above it is evident that while recall precision and their derivative fscore are dependent only on t p f p f n r p p p they are also unaffected by the changes to t n r n and p n on the contrary informedness and markedness are dependent on all the above making these metrics sensitive to any change of these values and as a result more informative evaluation metrics kappa statistic compares the accuracy of the classifier to the accuracy of a random system 9 k a p p a p 0 p e 1 p e where p 0 is the total accuracy defined in equation 2 and p e is the random accuracy defined below 10 p e t n f p t n f n f n t p f p t p n 2 similarly since markedness measures how trustworthy the network s prediction are the higher the absolute value the higher the trust in the prediction a value of 1 would suggest that the network can be fully trusted for markedness positive polarity implies the trust is associated with the network s predictions being correct while negative polarity implies the trust is associated with the network s predictions being incorrect table 5 summarises the scores achieved by the four models on the training and validation dataset in descending order exhibiting the superiority of the tree ensemble models over the neural networks at the same time table 5 shows preliminarily a clear contribution of the structural features in elevating the performance of both the tree ensembles and the neural networks most importantly table 5 exhibits unrealistic classification performance gains from the inclusion of structural features in the e n s m s model this is most likely attributed to overfitting arising from the complexity of the algorithm and the inclusion of the additional structural features in the model s training on the contrary the nn model n n m s exhibits more realistic performance gains suggesting a less sensitive to overfitting network 5 unbiased performance evaluation in this study two different types of networks of increasing complexity have been investigated more specifically simple feedforward neural networks were developed and trained on both meteorological and a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features for establishing a benchmark performance metric as well as an influence indicator from the use of structural acceleration features as training inputs on the network s predictive capacity these simple to implement networks were succeeded by more complex networks namely decision tree ensemble classifiers developed to assist the validation of the initial hypothesis the notion behind using decision tree ensembles instead of a single decision tree algorithm is that an ensemble of decision trees can yield a strong learner that reduces variance while maintaining the low bias attributed to a single decision tree additionally the algorithmic nature of the decision tree allows the extraction of relative predictor importance assisting in proving the initial hypothesis still there exist cases where the increased network complexity generates overfitting as a matter of fact overfitting has always been considered a challenging problem in developing ensemble classifiers pourtaheri and zahiri 2016 therefore despite the fact that the use of classifiers of higher complexity naturally increases the success of the resulting learner this success does not always reflect on the test data in this study this issue is reflected in the results of table 5 in which the effects of overfitting are apparent to ensure that the developed algorithms have not learned too many of the nuances of the training data e g the algorithm describing the noise instead of the underlying unknown function to be approximated and as a result avoid model overfitting the so far adopted procedure included train test splits and cross validation for the case of neural networks and classification ensembles respectively as a final step in safeguarding the unbiased evaluation of the developed models a holdout set e g a dataset unseen by neither of the two types of networks was retained for the final model evaluation this holdout set was constructed by retaining 15 of random observations from the initial dataset the confusion matrices presented in fig 10 are used to summarize the prediction results of the wave characteristics classification problem by the different developed models on the holdout dataset the number of positive predictions is indicated by increasing shades of gray e g the higher the contrast the higher the predictive accuracy for the particular class table 6 complements the confusion matrices presented in fig 10 by summarising the average score achieved by each classification model on the unseen holdout dataset evidently there is an obvious drop in classification performance between the training validation results presented in table 5 and the results on the holdout set presented in table 6 this observation verifies the fact that the increased complexity and imbalance in the dataset could introduce unwanted overfitting of the models as anticipated despite the use of train test splits and cross validation in training overfitting is more profound in the case of decision tree ensembles owing to their inherent complexity nevertheless both the training validation and holdout dataset results are consistent in the sense that they exhibit an evident increase in classification performance when structural acceleration derived features are considered in the training of the algorithms despite literature prescribing methods to enhance the unbiased classification performance of both neural networks and decision tree ensembles with methods such as pruning early stopping regularization etc such an investigation deviates from the initial scope of this study however as the dataset in the particular case naturally expands over time the training of the networks on more data will certainly aid the development of less biased models at the same time another aspect that could drastically improve the classification accuracy of the network is improving the signal to noise ratio snr yet obviously this solely depends on the particular structure s dynamic response and sensitivity to the external perturbation i e the larger displacement of an offshore buoy or floating platform would yield a higher snr compared to the snr obtained in the case of the fixed bottom coastal jetty examined herein for this reason the results of the present study show great promise for the cases where a structure owing to its dynamics yields an enhanced snr as the classification accuracy is expected to be significantly improved complementing the above observations the nature of the decision tree algorithm is exploited for gaining insights into the relative importance of the features used in the development of the ensemble the idea is based on identifying the least relevant features in the dataset and removing them as they can be regarded as noise on which the model is being overfitted upon in order to identify and remove the least relevant features the gini impurity index which is the metric of determining how to split the data into smaller groups in decision tree algorithms is utilized the mathematical expression of the gini impurity index is presented below 11 g i 1 c p i 1 p i where c is the number of classes and p i is the probability of picking a data point with class i essentially the gini impurity index measures how often a random sample from a given dataset will be incorrectly labelled if it was randomly labelled according to the distribution of labels in the subset consequently this measure represents the probability of a new sample being incorrectly classified at a given node in a decision tree because a decision tree ensemble consists of multiple decision trees the gini index is leveraged to calculate mean decrease in gini which is a measure of variable importance for estimating a target variable in an ensemble mean decrease in gini is the mean value of a variable s total decrease in node impurity weighted by the proportion of samples reaching that node in each individual decision tree in the ensemble this is effectively a measure of how important a variable is for estimating the value of the target variable across all of the trees that make up the ensemble a higher mean decrease in gini indicates higher variable importance fig 11 illustrates the relative feature importance in the ensemble using this metric the most important variables to the model are indicated by the highest values of mean decrease in gini in the plot on the other hand the least important variables attain the lowest mean decrease in gini values in accordance to fig 11 the five most important features are ranked in the following order rms wind direction rms wind speed rms accax std wind speed and rms accbx it is evident that the signals from both the accelerometers are ranked within the five most prevalent features in the ensemble particularly the signals of both accelerometers in the x direction are shown to have a significant contribution in the ensemble s classification performance this might be the result of the directionality of the external perturbation e g both the wind and wave and the dynamic characteristics of the structure in that direction with the five most prevalent features being identified a final decision tree ensemble was trained based on the same training dataset used in the development of the previous networks this time retaining only the five features described above the resulting network namely the ens5f was evaluated on the unseen holdout dataset ensuring the unbiased evaluation of its performance fig 12 presents the confusion matrix of the ens5f network on the holdout dataset to maintain the fairness of the comparison the performance metrics described by equations 1 and 7 9 are also summarized on the same figure with reference to fig 12 an obvious increase in classification performance is observed over the networks developed on i meteorological and ii a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features this observation proves the concerns in regards to overfitting the models on features of low significance most of which are associated with the features extracted from structural data while at the same time suggesting that simple techniques for feature extraction like those presented herein can be leveraged to develop an improved model nevertheless this study has achieved its objective of proving that data obtained from structural monitoring equipment can be used in the development of machine learning models with enhanced predictive accuracy additionally the paper digs deeper into the development of the networks and identifies which of the features are worth retaining in an attempt to minimize the effects of overfitting and as a result improve the generalization of the models it would be thus more appropriate to conclude that while structural data obtained from monitoring equipment can significantly influence the network s performance the addition of irrelevant parameters can lead to overfitted models which overestimate the predictive capacity of a model therefore as in any network development case particular care should be given in the selection of the training features 6 conclusions this study proposes the use of structural acceleration data for improving the significant wave height prediction accuracy of multiclass classification models the paper is based on the idea that machine learning networks can pick up the intrinsic patterns in the acceleration signal and the underlying system s transfer function and under certain conditions can associate the structural response to a particular perturbation which for this case is characterized by the significant wave height the notion of using structural acceleration data allows a large pool of available data to be tapped by exploiting the structural monitoring equipment often installed on offshore and coastal infrastructure in examining this hypothesis data extracted from the structural monitoring equipment installed on the coastal jetty located in the southern coasts of cyprus along with data recorded from the meteorological station found onsite were used in the training of machine learning networks more specifically two machine learning networks of increasing complexity were trained independently on i meteorological and ii a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features for the fairness of the investigation for both the training of artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles measures were taken for the development of unbiased models using procedures such as train test splits and k fold validation at the same time conventional and less biased performance metrics have been established for reflecting the probability that the model s prediction is informed rather than being based on chance it has been shown that regardless the network choice the algorithms trained on a combination of structural acceleration and meteorological features outperformed their counterparts in every occasion additionally it has been demonstrated that despite the apparent contribution of structural features in improving prediction performance care should be taken in identifying the most important features to include in the training of the networks as redundancy of training parameters could inject unwanted overfitting in the generated model finally it is important to highlight the great promise of these results and the potential for future work to be undertaken in this direction either by testing the hypothesis on structures with a more profound dynamic footprint such as surface buoys and oil platforms which will naturally yield better classification accuracy attributed to the enhanced snr or by investigating deeper network methodologies that have the ability of deriving their own features funding this work was supported by the

21129,explicit wave models and expensive sensor equipment capable of predicting and measuring wave parameters often carry a prohibitive computational and financial expense to counter this this paper proposes an alternative method for nowcasting coastal zone significant wave heights through the joint use of meteorological and structural data in the training of supervised machine learning models in testing the hypothesis that structural data can improve model classification artificial neural network and decision tree models were developed trained and tested on field data recorded on a coastal jetty located in the southern coasts of cyprus a comprehensive investigation of the different models yields that the joint use of meteorological and structural features can improve classification performance regardless of the network choice it is also demonstrated that redundancy of training parameters could inject unwanted overfitting reducing model generalization to address this a method for quantifying feature importance has been proposed by exploiting the nature of decision tree algorithms and the gini impurity index reaffirming that structural features do indeed benefit model classification these results highlight the potential of tapping into the untapped pool of structural data for significant wave height prediction paving the way for new research to be undertaken in this direction keywords machine learning significant wave height prediction neural networks classification algorithms gini impurity index decision tree 1 introduction the expansion in various offshore activities along the growing need for managing efficiently marine energy systems and infrastructure such as wave energy converters and oil and gas platforms led to an increased interest in wave parameter characterization for both their design optimization efficient operation and integrity management to this purpose many elaborate studies have been undertaken to investigate wave characterization from multiple perspectives all in common grounds of improving accuracy and reducing computational demands over the years on the basis of growing and decaying wind wave energy spectra numerical models such as the swan ou et al 2002 rogers et al 2007 wam group 1988 hersbach and janssen 1999 monbaliu et al 2000 wave watch iii mentaschi et al 2015 jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 have been developed for solving for the effects of fetch duration and varying wind fields for both the cases of nearshore and deep ocean waves despite the complexity arising from solving the mathematically challenging physical equations that inevitably raise the computational burden these methods have been deemed by many researchers not to be of the desirable accuracy browne et al 2007 zijlema 2010 and do not generalize over various oceans and seas kumar et al 2018 since they require accurate local bathymetric surveys making their implementation a non trivial task browne et al 2007 to address the shortcomings of numerical methods and in an attempt to find an alternative to wave parameter prediction that benefits of reduced computational demands and improved accuracy researchers shifted their focus to data driven methods as the name suggest data driven methods make use of data characterizing the system of interest for determining an unknown mapping or dependencies between the inputs and the outputs zamani et al 2008 in the coastal and ocean engineering domain in particular meteorological and other response data often gathered from surface buoys pressure sensors and acoustic sensors are typically considered as inputs to the system while wave data typically the spatially variable significant wave height and wave period obtained in field or through simulations represent the outputs on which the model is to be trained and validated upon indeed over the previous decade there has been a tremendous increase in application of data driven methods in oceanic and coastal applications with particular focus on wave height prediction kumar et al 2018 amongst the earliest developed and most commonly used methods neural networks nn are capable of approximating complex nonlinear processes without prior system knowledge elbisy and osra 2019 nn have been extensively used in solving wave height prediction and forecasting problems browne et al 2007 deo et al 2001 gunaydın 2008 rao and mandal 2005 tolman et al 2005 providing a good alternative to statistical regression time series analyses and traditional numerical methods mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 still while these methods are considered superior to their predecessors they suffer with generalization overfitting and require time consuming trial and error for finding network parameters such as the number of hidden layers and neurons mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 along a similar trajectory and in an effort to improve the accuracy of nn while avoiding overfitting of the model feed forward neural networks ffnn deo et al 2001 makarynskyy 2004 makarynskyy et al 2005 recurrent neural networks rnn sadeghifar et al 2017 back propagation neural networks bpnn agrawal and deo 2002 makarynskyy 2004 and cascade correlation neural networks ccnn makarynskyy 2004 have been used for predicting wave heights with a reported fluctuating accuracy particularly at different wave height ranges most recently elbisy and osra 2019 compared the group method of data handling type neural networks gdmh nn with multi layer perceptron neural networks mlpnn in the prediction of significant wave height and zero crossing period tested and validated on field data the authors suggest that the gdmh nn is more robust and efficient than the mlpnn having the best prediction accuracy of significant wave height regardless of the wave height range decision tree algorithms have also been employed in the past for the prediction of the significant wave height the study of mahjoobi and shahidi 2008 demonstrated how regression and classification trees using the cart and c5 algorithm respectively can be leveraged in the successful prediction of significant wave heights the authors demonstrated the similarity of the developed decision trees to artificial nn anns in terms of error statistics most importantly the authors highlighted that compared to anns decision tree algorithms can intrinsically derive relative predictor importance through branching of the inputs compared to the time consuming sensitivity analysis required in the development of ann models random forests a multitude of decision trees have also been investigated for the problem of significant wave height prediction in the comparative study of sharma and jain 2018 in their study the developed random forests and anns exhibited similar performance while at the same time these models were outperformed by the particle swarm optimization pso model proposed by the authors of the study most recently in the comparative study of fan et al 2020 random forests were compared to both conventional and deep network methodologies for the case of significant height prediction naturally while random forests exhibited similar performance gains to conventional network methodologies such as the developed anns they were outperformed by the proposed deeper network methodologies of long short term memory lstm and residual network resnet soft computing methods such as the fuzzy inference system fis mahjoobi et al 2008 bayesian interference bi egozcue et al 2005 scotto and soares 2007 and support vector machines svm mahjoobi and mosabbeb 2009 have been also used in the forecasting and prediction of significant wind height using wind data in a comparative study undertaken by malekmohamadi et al 2011 the authors highlighted the promising results achieved by the three methods concluding that the accuracy of the fis bi svm and artificial nn is nearly the same in another study elgohary et al 2018 compared svm with nonlinear regression methods for the prediction of significant wave height the authors concluded that svm based on the radial basis function is superior to the nonlinear regression methods other popular methods namely k nearest neighbors knn linear regressions lr model trees m5 multilayer perceptron neural networks mlpnn and support vector regression svr algorithms have been investigated in the study of wei 2018 in which the different developed models were used in predicting nearshore wave characteristics during typhoon conditions the authors highlighted the performance of the different models at varying wave height ranges suggesting that the m5 mlpnn and svr have optimum wave height prediction performance at small moderate and large wave heights respectively most recently liu et al 2019 proposed the use of an end to end convolutional network for the prediction of wave height and period using simulated acceleration data of a numerically modeled surface buoy while it is known that converting buoy accelerations to wave heights is not a straight forward task owing to the accelerometer measuring gravity offset along with the acceleration of the buoy resulting to the introduction of a gravity component in each of the instrument s orthogonal directions bender et al 2010 liu et al 2019 had a different motive to bypass the numerical drift introduced during double integration that compromises the accuracy of the method their experiments showed that their data driven approach outperforms traditional numerical integration of the buoy s acceleration at the absence of explicit knowledge of the system s dynamics despite their method being yet to be tested in real sea conditions the approach of statistically correlating structural accelerations responses to significant wave heights shows great promise and paves the way for new research to be undertaken in the domain of machine learning and wave height characterization at the same time although the computational and mathematical issues of calculating wave heights from structural acceleration responses are shown to be alleviated through the use of data driven models setting up surface buoys remains an impractical and expensive task rather a large pool of useful data can be tapped considering the large number of marine and coastal facilities employing structural monitoring equipment to the author s best knowledge characterizing waves through supervised machine learning models trained on both meteorological and structural acceleration data remains to be investigated to this purpose and by exploiting the fact that machine learning models have a large data appetite this study proposes an alternative method for the real time prediction nowcasting of significant wave heights based on the joint use of structural monitoring and meteorological data more specifically acceleration data collected on a fixed bottom coastal jetty located in the southern coasts of cyprus coupled with wind speed and direction data obtained from the meteorological station found onsite are used to extract the features to be used as training inputs in both artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles it is worth highlighting the term prediction used throughout the study suggests the estimation of a value in this case the significant wave height based on the inputs described above in real time therefore it will be appropriate that the term nowcast and prediction of significant wave height be employed in tandem for this specific problem for clarity it would also be appropriate to differentiate prediction from forecasting based on the temporal dimension of the two for the first there exists no time constrain e g the significant wave height could potentially be predicted anytime in the past real time short term and long term future given the described input variables whereas the latter forecasting is futuristic entailing analysis of the past in the present study the effort is guided in the following direction to improve the wave predictive performance of current methodologies by utilizing for the first time readily available data gathered from structural condition monitoring systems present on coastal and offshore infrastructure as a vehicle towards this direction the classification performance of the developed networks is examined for the cases of i artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles for which only meteorological data are used as inputs during the network s training and ii artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles in which both meteorological and structural acceleration data are used during training the reasoning behind investigating these increasing in complexity network configurations is two folded firstly to allow the investigation of the sensitivity of the network to the structural training features establishing a benchmark of the influence of structural data on each model s performance secondly to allow the exploitation of the different machine learning algorithms in an effort to quantify the influence of the training parameters on each network 2 study area and instrumentation the comparison of different machine learning models entails the use of benchmark datasets that allow the developed models to be exposed and compared to literature unfortunately benchmark datasets and corresponding studies containing structural monitoring data along the required wave parameters for fulfilling the purposes of supervised learning do not currently exist to address this limitation and test the presented hypothesis this study exploits the monitoring equipment installed on the fixed bottom coastal jetty located in the southern coasts of cyprus and establishes a database from which both meteorological and structural data can be used to extract machine learning training features in the present study the dataset comprised of wind wave and structural acceleration data recorded for the months january to april 2020 for the data collection the following equipment was used namely a wind anemometer two triaxial accelerometers and a wave radar according to the manufacturer of the instruments the accuracy sensitivity of the accelerometers and wave radar is 0 4 db max over the bandwidth and 6 mm respectively all the equipment installed on the jetty is operated by vtt vassiliko ltd for structural integrity purposes the anemometer s speed and direction were recorded at 14 m above sea level while the wave radar was located at the t junction part of the jetty 10 m above sea level at the location of the wave radar the water depth is 18 70 m it is noteworthy that the seabed topography of the vassiliko bay area is relatively uniform with smooth gradients and no significant irregularities or obstructions aeoliki 2016 the acceleration datasets were acquired from two triaxial accelerometers installed on the coastal jetty the first accelerometer is located at the t junction on the lower deck deck1 of the jetty fig 1 while the second accelerometer is installed on the bridging elements of the t junction and the main structural system the dimensions of the t junction platform are 20 0 m in the x direction and 32 0 m in the y direction fig 1 both the anemometer and wave data were sampled at single minute intervals 0 0167 hz while acceleration data were recorded with a sampling frequency of 8 hz the sampling frequency of 8 hz was selected after numerically calculating the dominant structural modes of the t junction of the jetty to this purpose and for choosing an appropriate sampling frequency a lumped parameter numerical model was developed and standard modal analysis was performed to derive the modal frequencies of the t junction fig 1 illustrates the lumped parameter 2 dof numerical model of the t junction used in the modal analysis of the structure the two dominant structural translational modes are shown in table 1 below evidently there is a higher frequency attributed to the second mode in the y direction owing to the increased length and the corresponding increased stiffness in the particular direction most importantly the modal analysis suggests that in order to satisfy the nyquist frequency criterion the accelerometer s sampling frequency must be set approximately twice the highest frequency mode that is required to be observed since the highest frequency observable dominant translational mode was identified at 3 36 hz it was deemed appropriate that a sampling frequency of 8 hz to be selected to obtain an accurate representation of the structure s dynamic footprint and for increasing the signal to noise ratio the low frequency components of the signal were removed with the use of a butterworth filter and a cut off frequency of 0 1 hz the cut off frequency of 0 1 hz was selected based on the dynamics of the structure and the wave frequencies observed in the vasiliko bay area for the manipulation of the large acceleration dataset and for the compatibility of the acceleration data with the sampling frequencies of the wind and wave data feature extraction was performed on the acceleration dataset in single minute windows more specifically at each window interval the absolute signal energy standard deviation and root mean square values were calculated using parseval s theorem parseval and antoine 1799 and standard algebraic manipulation respectively 3 network training methodology for examining the influence of structural acceleration data in improving the classification performance of supervised machine learning algorithms networks of progressive complexity were designed and evaluated against a set of criteria more specifically simple feedforward neural networks trained to classify inputs according to target classes were succeeded by more advanced decision tree ensembles composed of weighted combinations of multiple classification models a total of four networks consisting of two artificial neural networks and two decision tree ensembles were developed and compared on a set of defined performance indices to exhibit the influence of structural acceleration features on the wave predicting capacity of the developed models the methodology adopted in this investigation is exhibited through the flowchart of fig 2 development of the nn models as a first step towards testing the presented hypothesis a simple feedforward neural network was designed and trained for the prediction of significant wave height exclusively on wind data and their derivative features recorded on the meteorological station found on site thus the term meteorological data will be used throughout the paper when referring to the data collected from the particular station accordingly the recorded m 1 wind speed and wind direction vectors were truncated in minute intervals from which the root mean square rms and standard deviation std values were extracted the resulting features namely rms wind speed rms wind direction std wind speed and std wind direction were used as the n 4 input matrix in the neural network subsequently the features from the input layer were propagated to the neurons of the middle layer commonly known as the hidden layer from this the weighted sums from the hidden layer were passed to the output layer for classification for the particular case the output classes labels were obtained for each of the n observations by discretizing the observed significant wave height h s in 0 20 m bins ranging from 0 2 to 3 8 m resulting to a total of 18 distinct classes the described architecture is exhibited in fig 3 owing to the fact that the model is trained to distinguish between a total of 18 classes the training methodology falls in the context of multiclass classification in accordance to good machine learning practice and in an attempt to obtain less biased models the dataset was divided in three groups for the respective training validation and testing of the developed models accordingly the first set consisting of 70 of wind wave and acceleration data was used for training the models e g finding appropriate weights and biases in the artificial neural network the second set the validation dataset consisting of 15 of the wind wave and acceleration data was used for providing an evaluation of the model fit while at the same time allowing fine tuning model hyperparameters the last set of data the testing dataset consisting of the final 15 of the complete dataset was used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model fit this final dataset which is neither used in training nor in validating the trained model is typically referred in literature as a holdout dataset accordingly from the total 51 444 feature samples 36 010 were used in training while 7717 and 7717 were retained for validation and testing respectively for the particular classification problem the number of hidden layers in the network and their corresponding neurons were selected iteratively it is noteworthy that when the number of hidden layers in the network exceed one the neural network is considered as a deep learning network sze et al 2017 still this paper distinguishes deep from shallow learning networks based on the ability of the first to derive their own features directly from data feature learning while the latter relies on handcrafted features based upon heuristics of the target problem to this end while the presented nn architecture of fig 3 contains a number of hidden layers exceeding 1 it still falls within the notion of shallow learning networks for finding the number of hidden layers a coarse optimization procedure was adopted in this respect 5 layers with neuron numbers ranging from 0 to 160 in 40 neuron bins were considered from this a total of 1364 unique combinations of nn architectures were developed with the following geometric progression of networks per layer single layer 4 network combinations double layer 16 network combinations triple layer 64 combinations quadruple layer 256 network combinations and quintuple layer 1024 network combinations for each of this 1364 unique nn architectures considered the crossentropy loss was calculated in accordance to 1 l o s s 1 n i 1 n j 1 c t i j log x i j 1 t i j log 1 x i j where n is the total number of observations x i j is the network response for a given category t i j is the target value of that category and c is the total number of categories it can be seen that crossentropy loss is calculated as the probability of a given observation being assigned to a given category summed over all categories and observations and normalized by the number of observations following standard nn training practice at each iteration the scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation method moller 1993 was used for minimizing the crossentropy loss through finding appropriate weight and bias values for each of the neurons in the network in this study the activation of each node was calculated with the sigmoid activation function for transforming the linear weight and bias combination to a nonlinear function allowing the application of the mentioned backpropagation method fig 4 exhibits the summary statistics of the coarse optimization procedure performed herein with reference to the same figure it is evident that for this particular problem case the developed nns show insensitivity to the addition of hidden layers rather the presence and extend of the whiskers indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles at increasing number of hidden layers and neuron combinations suggest that the nns are more likely to be sensitive to the variation of the number of neurons in each layer for this reason it was deemed appropriate that for computational efficiency purposes the nn architecture is limited to two hidden layers as shown in fig 3 and further fine tuning of the number of the neurons in each layer is to be performed in accordance to the 2 hidden layer architecture for the training of the second artificial neural network model the architecture presented in fig 3 was conservatively retained while the number of features extended to include the following structural monitoring parameters minute interval rms std and absolute signal energy ase extracted from the accelerometers placed on the jetty for all three orthogonal directions this corresponds to the following structural derived features namely rms accax rms accay rms accaz obtained from the accelerometer a located on deck 1 for all three orthogonal directions rms accbx rms accby rms accbz obtained from the accelerometer b on the t junction bridging elements for all three orthogonal directions similarly std and ase were used to extract the following structural features in the three orthogonal directions namely std accax std accay std accaz std accbx std accby std accbz ase accax ase accay ase accaz ase accbx ase accby ase accbz as a result the input matrix attained the size of n 22 with 18 features being attributed to structural data and 4 features being attributed to meteorological data for both cases the output classes remained 18 fig 5 presents the crossentropy loss calculated for the case of a neural networks trained only on meteorological features and b neural networks trained on both meteorological and structural acceleration derived features based on the 2 layer nn architecture described from these figures the point of minimum crossentropy loss was identified and the number of neurons at each hidden layer was noted for the two networks table 2 summarises the optimized number of hyperparameters selected for the developed artificial neural networks based on the minimum crossentropy loss development of the decision tree ensemble models for the next step following the same procedure as in the case of artificial neural networks tree ensemble classifiers were trained independently on i meteorological and ii a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features through the development of classification ensembles the objective was to use a combination ensemble of decision trees in an attempt to reduce variance while maintaining the low bias attributed single decision tree algorithms for the optimal hyperparameter selection in the ensemble e g finding the number of splits in each tree the number of trees in the ensemble and learning rate that minimize the loss function the following cross validation procedure was adopted 1 tree complexity level was increased from a single split tree stump or decision stump to a maximum n c 1 splits while also varying the learning rate for each ensemble of trees between 0 1 and 1 the resulting splitting sequence attained the form of 30 31 32 3m where 3 m n c 1 and the learning rate set attained the form of 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 n c is the number of observations in each cross validation fold of the k fold validation procedure adopted 2 the cross validated misclassification rate was estimated for each ensemble for a maximum of 150 boosted classification trees using 5 fold cross validation in this optimization procedure for each model a total of k 1 e g 4 different training attempts have been made during each training attempt the model was trained on the k 1 fold data while the first fold was treated as the validation set in doing so each sample was given the opportunity to be used in the holdout set 1 time while also used to train the model k 1 times for each attempt the misclassification rate was calculated and averaged over all attempts resulting theoretically to a less biased model 3 the cumulative cross validated misclassification rate of the ensembles was compared by plotting each ensemble s misclassification rate against the number of trees in the ensemble and different learning rates the results were then plotted on separate plots for varying tree complexity levels splits as seen in fig 4 4 the curve that achieved the minimum misclassification rate was identified and chosen while the corresponding learning cycle and learning rate was noted fig 6 demonstrates how the cross validated misclassification rate behaves at increasing number of trees learning rate and number of splits each curve in this figure contains a minimum cross validated misclassification rate occurring at the optimal number of trees in the ensemble the objective is to identify the maximum number of splits number of trees and learning rate that yields the lowest misclassification rate overall fig 7 and fig 8 complement the preceding figure by exhibiting values of the misclassification rate at varying splits and number of trees the optimal hyperparameter selection for i the tree ensemble trained only on features derived from meteorological data and ii the tree ensemble trained on a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features is summarized in table 3 below it is noteworthy that in the described methodology the adaboostm2 algorithm which extends adaboostm1 from binary to multi class classification is used for converting the set of weak learners into a strong one using this approach model predictions were made by calculating the weighted average of the predictions of each weak classifier accordingly the prediction of the ensemble model is taken as the sum of the weighted predictions it is important to highlight that despite the algorithm being widely considered flexible strong and in some cases better in avoiding model overfitting than other methods particular care should be given in the i quality of data ii presence of outliers and iii noisy data for these reasons the performance of the developed ensemble models should be thoroughly investigated as overfitting might naturally occur owing to the inherent complexity of the ensemble as well as the nature of the particular dataset this issue could be unsurprisingly amplified for the particular case examined herein as the additional features derived from structural acceleration data will naturally tend to overfit the model yielding one that does not generalize well in the following sections the relative performance of the developed models will be investigated thoroughly through the prism of comparative legitimacy overfitting and model generalization 4 classification performance evaluation despite the fact that the procedure adopted is similar to that of binary classification in the sense that each sample is assigned to a single label output class the classifiers developed for the particular problem described in the preceding sections are rather ambitious this is primarily attributed to the requirement of each classifier to distinguish between a total of 18 classes additionally with reference to fig 9 it is evident that the dataset is largely imbalanced for these reasons in order to correctly evaluate and make remarks on the performance of each classifier it is important to examine model performance for each individual class accordingly the sound evaluation of the trained classifier s performance in predicting the significant wave height entails the establishment of a set of multi class classification metrics based on the following four classifier response categories true positive tp the model correctly predicts the positive class true negative tn the model correctly predicts the negative class false positive fp the model incorrectly predicts the positive class false negative fn the model incorrectly predicts the negative class in the above the definition positive class is attributed to the particular class of interest e g if the objective is to identify class 1 this class attains the role of the positive class while the remaining classes e g class 2 18 are considered to be negative similarly when class 2 is to be detected class 2 becomes the positive class while the remaining classes e g 1 and 3 18 are considered the negative classes from these common multi class evaluation metrics for machine learning models are established and calculated according to the following accuracy number of observations identified to be either truly positive or truly negative out of the total number of observations 2 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n it is worth highlighting that since the classes are not equally represented fig 9 the accuracy metric might not be representative of the actual classifier s performance this can be exemplified by assuming a degenerate machine learning classifier that assigns class 2 to all the observations since class 2 represents approximately 25 of the observations the network attains an accuracy of 25 with no classification effort for this reason while the accuracy metric is retained other objective functions namely fscore and kappa statistic will be later defined as they are considered more appropriate measures of classification accuracy particularly for the cases of multi class classification problems with imbalanced datasets to calculate these objective functions the following expressions are defined true positive rate tpr sensitivity recall number of observations correctly identified as positive out of the total actual positives 3 t p r t p t p f n positive predictive values ppv precision number of observations correctly identified as positive out of the total items identified as positive 4 p p v t p t p f p true negative rate tnr specificity number of observations correctly identified as negative out of the total actual negatives 5 t n r t n t n f p fscore the harmonic average of the precision and recall it measures the effectiveness of identification when just as much importance is given to sensitivity as to precision 6 f s c o r e 2 t p r p p v t p r p p v table 4 indicatively summarises the classifier response and the extracted performance metrics for the developed e n s m s network as anticipated the accuracy index does a poor job in representing the true accuracy of the developed network to counter this sensitivity tpr precision ppv and their derivative fscore inarguably provide a better indicator of classification performance still it would be rather difficult to make accurate and concluding remarks on the classification performance if biases and corresponding identification of chance or base case level of the statistics are not taken into account it is therefore deemed important to establish further metrics that reflect the probability that the network s prediction is informed rather than being based on chance subsequently and for maintaining the fairness of the investigation of each individual network s classification performance as well as the comparison of the different networks this study makes use of the metrics presented by powers 2007 namely informedness markedness and kappa statistic cohen s kappa it is worth highlighting that each metric serves different purposes still consideration of a collection of metrics allows a more comprehensive study of classifier s performance the established metrics are calculated according to the following expressions informedness measures how informed is the network about both positives and negatives according to the following expression 7 i n f o r m e d n e s s t p r p f p r n in which r p t p f n is the total actual positives and r n t n f p represents the total actual negatives markedness measures the trustworthiness of positive and negative predictions by the network and is expressed by the following 8 m a r k e d n e s s t p p p f n p n where p p t p f p is the total number of observations identified as positives and p n f n t n represents the total number of observations identified as negatives from the expressions above it is evident that while recall precision and their derivative fscore are dependent only on t p f p f n r p p p they are also unaffected by the changes to t n r n and p n on the contrary informedness and markedness are dependent on all the above making these metrics sensitive to any change of these values and as a result more informative evaluation metrics kappa statistic compares the accuracy of the classifier to the accuracy of a random system 9 k a p p a p 0 p e 1 p e where p 0 is the total accuracy defined in equation 2 and p e is the random accuracy defined below 10 p e t n f p t n f n f n t p f p t p n 2 similarly since markedness measures how trustworthy the network s prediction are the higher the absolute value the higher the trust in the prediction a value of 1 would suggest that the network can be fully trusted for markedness positive polarity implies the trust is associated with the network s predictions being correct while negative polarity implies the trust is associated with the network s predictions being incorrect table 5 summarises the scores achieved by the four models on the training and validation dataset in descending order exhibiting the superiority of the tree ensemble models over the neural networks at the same time table 5 shows preliminarily a clear contribution of the structural features in elevating the performance of both the tree ensembles and the neural networks most importantly table 5 exhibits unrealistic classification performance gains from the inclusion of structural features in the e n s m s model this is most likely attributed to overfitting arising from the complexity of the algorithm and the inclusion of the additional structural features in the model s training on the contrary the nn model n n m s exhibits more realistic performance gains suggesting a less sensitive to overfitting network 5 unbiased performance evaluation in this study two different types of networks of increasing complexity have been investigated more specifically simple feedforward neural networks were developed and trained on both meteorological and a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features for establishing a benchmark performance metric as well as an influence indicator from the use of structural acceleration features as training inputs on the network s predictive capacity these simple to implement networks were succeeded by more complex networks namely decision tree ensemble classifiers developed to assist the validation of the initial hypothesis the notion behind using decision tree ensembles instead of a single decision tree algorithm is that an ensemble of decision trees can yield a strong learner that reduces variance while maintaining the low bias attributed to a single decision tree additionally the algorithmic nature of the decision tree allows the extraction of relative predictor importance assisting in proving the initial hypothesis still there exist cases where the increased network complexity generates overfitting as a matter of fact overfitting has always been considered a challenging problem in developing ensemble classifiers pourtaheri and zahiri 2016 therefore despite the fact that the use of classifiers of higher complexity naturally increases the success of the resulting learner this success does not always reflect on the test data in this study this issue is reflected in the results of table 5 in which the effects of overfitting are apparent to ensure that the developed algorithms have not learned too many of the nuances of the training data e g the algorithm describing the noise instead of the underlying unknown function to be approximated and as a result avoid model overfitting the so far adopted procedure included train test splits and cross validation for the case of neural networks and classification ensembles respectively as a final step in safeguarding the unbiased evaluation of the developed models a holdout set e g a dataset unseen by neither of the two types of networks was retained for the final model evaluation this holdout set was constructed by retaining 15 of random observations from the initial dataset the confusion matrices presented in fig 10 are used to summarize the prediction results of the wave characteristics classification problem by the different developed models on the holdout dataset the number of positive predictions is indicated by increasing shades of gray e g the higher the contrast the higher the predictive accuracy for the particular class table 6 complements the confusion matrices presented in fig 10 by summarising the average score achieved by each classification model on the unseen holdout dataset evidently there is an obvious drop in classification performance between the training validation results presented in table 5 and the results on the holdout set presented in table 6 this observation verifies the fact that the increased complexity and imbalance in the dataset could introduce unwanted overfitting of the models as anticipated despite the use of train test splits and cross validation in training overfitting is more profound in the case of decision tree ensembles owing to their inherent complexity nevertheless both the training validation and holdout dataset results are consistent in the sense that they exhibit an evident increase in classification performance when structural acceleration derived features are considered in the training of the algorithms despite literature prescribing methods to enhance the unbiased classification performance of both neural networks and decision tree ensembles with methods such as pruning early stopping regularization etc such an investigation deviates from the initial scope of this study however as the dataset in the particular case naturally expands over time the training of the networks on more data will certainly aid the development of less biased models at the same time another aspect that could drastically improve the classification accuracy of the network is improving the signal to noise ratio snr yet obviously this solely depends on the particular structure s dynamic response and sensitivity to the external perturbation i e the larger displacement of an offshore buoy or floating platform would yield a higher snr compared to the snr obtained in the case of the fixed bottom coastal jetty examined herein for this reason the results of the present study show great promise for the cases where a structure owing to its dynamics yields an enhanced snr as the classification accuracy is expected to be significantly improved complementing the above observations the nature of the decision tree algorithm is exploited for gaining insights into the relative importance of the features used in the development of the ensemble the idea is based on identifying the least relevant features in the dataset and removing them as they can be regarded as noise on which the model is being overfitted upon in order to identify and remove the least relevant features the gini impurity index which is the metric of determining how to split the data into smaller groups in decision tree algorithms is utilized the mathematical expression of the gini impurity index is presented below 11 g i 1 c p i 1 p i where c is the number of classes and p i is the probability of picking a data point with class i essentially the gini impurity index measures how often a random sample from a given dataset will be incorrectly labelled if it was randomly labelled according to the distribution of labels in the subset consequently this measure represents the probability of a new sample being incorrectly classified at a given node in a decision tree because a decision tree ensemble consists of multiple decision trees the gini index is leveraged to calculate mean decrease in gini which is a measure of variable importance for estimating a target variable in an ensemble mean decrease in gini is the mean value of a variable s total decrease in node impurity weighted by the proportion of samples reaching that node in each individual decision tree in the ensemble this is effectively a measure of how important a variable is for estimating the value of the target variable across all of the trees that make up the ensemble a higher mean decrease in gini indicates higher variable importance fig 11 illustrates the relative feature importance in the ensemble using this metric the most important variables to the model are indicated by the highest values of mean decrease in gini in the plot on the other hand the least important variables attain the lowest mean decrease in gini values in accordance to fig 11 the five most important features are ranked in the following order rms wind direction rms wind speed rms accax std wind speed and rms accbx it is evident that the signals from both the accelerometers are ranked within the five most prevalent features in the ensemble particularly the signals of both accelerometers in the x direction are shown to have a significant contribution in the ensemble s classification performance this might be the result of the directionality of the external perturbation e g both the wind and wave and the dynamic characteristics of the structure in that direction with the five most prevalent features being identified a final decision tree ensemble was trained based on the same training dataset used in the development of the previous networks this time retaining only the five features described above the resulting network namely the ens5f was evaluated on the unseen holdout dataset ensuring the unbiased evaluation of its performance fig 12 presents the confusion matrix of the ens5f network on the holdout dataset to maintain the fairness of the comparison the performance metrics described by equations 1 and 7 9 are also summarized on the same figure with reference to fig 12 an obvious increase in classification performance is observed over the networks developed on i meteorological and ii a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features this observation proves the concerns in regards to overfitting the models on features of low significance most of which are associated with the features extracted from structural data while at the same time suggesting that simple techniques for feature extraction like those presented herein can be leveraged to develop an improved model nevertheless this study has achieved its objective of proving that data obtained from structural monitoring equipment can be used in the development of machine learning models with enhanced predictive accuracy additionally the paper digs deeper into the development of the networks and identifies which of the features are worth retaining in an attempt to minimize the effects of overfitting and as a result improve the generalization of the models it would be thus more appropriate to conclude that while structural data obtained from monitoring equipment can significantly influence the network s performance the addition of irrelevant parameters can lead to overfitted models which overestimate the predictive capacity of a model therefore as in any network development case particular care should be given in the selection of the training features 6 conclusions this study proposes the use of structural acceleration data for improving the significant wave height prediction accuracy of multiclass classification models the paper is based on the idea that machine learning networks can pick up the intrinsic patterns in the acceleration signal and the underlying system s transfer function and under certain conditions can associate the structural response to a particular perturbation which for this case is characterized by the significant wave height the notion of using structural acceleration data allows a large pool of available data to be tapped by exploiting the structural monitoring equipment often installed on offshore and coastal infrastructure in examining this hypothesis data extracted from the structural monitoring equipment installed on the coastal jetty located in the southern coasts of cyprus along with data recorded from the meteorological station found onsite were used in the training of machine learning networks more specifically two machine learning networks of increasing complexity were trained independently on i meteorological and ii a combination of meteorological and structural acceleration derived features for the fairness of the investigation for both the training of artificial neural networks and decision tree ensembles measures were taken for the development of unbiased models using procedures such as train test splits and k fold validation at the same time conventional and less biased performance metrics have been established for reflecting the probability that the model s prediction is informed rather than being based on chance it has been shown that regardless the network choice the algorithms trained on a combination of structural acceleration and meteorological features outperformed their counterparts in every occasion additionally it has been demonstrated that despite the apparent contribution of structural features in improving prediction performance care should be taken in identifying the most important features to include in the training of the networks as redundancy of training parameters could inject unwanted overfitting in the generated model finally it is important to highlight the great promise of these results and the potential for future work to be undertaken in this direction either by testing the hypothesis on structures with a more profound dynamic footprint such as surface buoys and oil platforms which will naturally yield better classification accuracy attributed to the enhanced snr or by investigating deeper network methodologies that have the ability of deriving their own features funding this work was supported by the
