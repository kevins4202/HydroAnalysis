21765,the main purpose of this work is to shed light on the physics involved in the two distinct cavity cloud shedding mechanisms in cloud cavitating flows namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave propagation mechanism swm a compressible cavitating flow solver which considers the compressibility effects of both liquid and vapor is used to account for the wave dynamics in cavitating flows the compressible navier stokes equations coupling the mass momentum energy equations and phase fraction transport equation along with the thermodynamic equations of state for both liquid and vapor saito cavitation model and the sst sas turbulence model are solved numerical results are presented for the conditions of both the re entrant jet mechanism and shock wave mechanism around a naca66 mod hydrofoil leroux et al 2005 respectively with emphasis on the process of re entrant jet development and shock wave formation and propagation the results show that the re entrant jet can cause the attached cavity sheet breakup for both the two cavity cloud shedding mechanisms in both high and low angle of attack while the shock wave formation and propagation process only occurs under shock wave mechanism at low angles of attack pressure evolution illustrates that in the re entrant jet mechanism cavity cloud collapse will induce high pressure load while no shock wave and thus the corresponding rebound phenomenon are observed in shock wave mechanism during the whole process of the shock wave dynamics namely generation propagation and rebound process pressure fluctuations increase sharply along with the generation of the pressure peaks with large amplitude and short time interval further study on the compressible characteristics involved in the two cavity shedding mechanisms illustrates that vapor fraction and mass transfer have a significant effect in sonic speed and mach number characteristics the average and standard derivation of maximum mach number mamax in shock wave mechanism is lower than that in re entrant jet mechanism cavitating flows are characterized by low sonic speed value in the cavitation region and high sonic speed value in the pure liquid region and a sonic speed boundary layer exists between the two regions the thickness of which is about the size of the local attached cavity sheet on foil surface in the process of shock wave generation and rebound cavity volume and cavity volume rate experience large fluctuations showing strong cavitation instabilities in shock wave mechanism keywords cloud cavitation re entrant jet shock wave sonic speed mach number cavitation instabilities openfoam 1 introduction hydrodynamic cavitation is a phenomenon characterized by abrupt phase change between liquid and vapor at nearly constant temperature when local pressure drops below vapor pressure in high speed liquid flows brennen 1995 wang et al 2001 partial cavitation especially the cloud cavitation exhibits serious instabilities such as strong pressure fluctuations vibrations noise and material erosion seol 2013 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2015 wu et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2017a b and is responsible for the undesirable effects or even damage in hydrodynamic systems including pumps turbines propellers and underwater bodies experiments have identified two distinct mechanisms for the onset of cloud cavitation namely re entrant jet mechanism kawanami et al 1997 callenaere et al 2001 and shock wave propagation mechanism ganesh et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the re entrant jet generates at the rear part of the attached cavity and flows upstream along the wall beneath the cavity when this liquid jet arrives at the cavity leading edge and impinges with the cavity interface it will cut off the attached cavity and then under the shear force of the main flow the residual part of the attached cavity will be rolled up and shed downstream the re entrant jet dynamics in cloud cavitation have been verified and widely investigated by both experimental measurements and numerical simulations however the understanding of shock wave dynamics is limited it has been both experimentally and theoretically proved that high void fraction gas liquid flows experience a significant reduction in sonic speed wallis 1967 shamsborhan et al 2010 prosperetti 2015 the value of which is far lower than that of its constituents e g pure liquid and pure vapor moreover the mass transfer between liquid and vapor will further decrease the sonic speed franc and michel 2005 the low sonic speed in the liquid vapor mixture provides the cavitating flows the required conditions to reach supersonic state even when the inlet liquid flow velocity is not so high creating the relevant conditions susceptible to multiphase shock wave formation the explosive evaporation of liquid water in low pressure regions generates plenty of vapor significantly increasing the local flow compressibility and the subsequent implosions of cavity clusters and large scale cloud cavity are the important sources of large disturbances from time to time such as rarefaction wave and shock wave experiments by ganesh et al 2016 using x ray densitometry measurement in a convergent divergent channel shows that when the shock wave front impinges on the flow at the wedge apex the attached cavity sheet will break up and following a large cavity cloud is pinched off which is deemed as the shock wave propagation induced cloud cavity shedding mechanism swm the physics involved in the cloud cavitating flows in particular the coherent interactions between the shock wave dynamics and cavity structure are the important and challenging problem requiring intensive and extensive investigations the re entrant jet phenomenon and its role in the cavitation instabilities have been studied by several researchers foeth et al 2008 wang et al 2015 pelz et al 2017 liu et al 2017 2018 gopalan and katz 2000 applied the particle image velocimetry piv and high speed photography to measure the flow structures at the closure region and downstream of sheet cavity they found that the re entrant jet develops when the cavity closes at the region of strong adverse pressure callenaere et al 2001 carried out systematic experiments to study cavitation instabilities on a diverging step and mapped the flow regimes with no shedding periodic re entrant jet with no shedding and re entrant jet induced periodic shedding they identified the importance of adverse pressure gradient on the development of re entrant jet and thus periodic shedding on the other hand the pressure pulses measurement in cavitating flows indicates the possibility of the shock wave within cavitation region reisman 1996 experimentally investigated the pressure pulses emitted in the cavitaing flows using high speed video and unsteady pressure transducers they found that the pressure pulses were closely related with the sharp void fraction reduction phenomena which was just caused by the collapse of the cavity cluster pressure pulses in cavitating flows have also be captured by leroux et al 2004 on a naca66 mod hydrofoil arndt et al 2001 investigated the complex physics involved in the sheet cavitation and the transition to cloud cavitation around a naca0015 hydrofoil using a combined experimental numerical approach they mapped the cavitating flow patterns within the l c σ 2α plane and concluded that at high values of σ 2α the re entrant jet mechanism dominates the cavity shedding process and at low values of σ 2α the bubbly shock propagation mechanism dominates leroux et al 2005 employed a joint experimental and numerical method to investigate the partial cavity instabilities they experimentally observed two partial cavity instabilities with one characterized by higher strouhal number 0 3 and the other lower strouhal number 0 07 0 09 detailed study indicated that different from the re entrant jet mechanism in high strouhal number conditions the cavity dynamics with lower strouhal number is dominated by cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave formation and propagation li et al 2008 applied the high speed visualization and particle image velocity piv methods to investigate the multiphase structures in supercavitating flows around a tulin hydrofoil they observed the water vapor interface propagation phenomena within the supercavity and sharp change of vapor fraction distribution and strong momentum transfer exist at the moving water vapor interface recently ganesh et al 2016 conducted experiments to investigate the physical mechanisms involved in the transition from sheet to cloud cavitation by applying the high speed video and time resolved x ray densitometry in a venturi section the results showed that in the condition of the intermittent shedding process of smaller scale cavities a re circulating flow dominates and in the condition of the large scale cloud periodic shedding the bubbly shock propagation dominates the numerical simulation of cavitating flows can be mainly divided into two categories incompressible methodology and compressible methodology most research huang et al 2013 2014 ji et al 2014 2016 yu et al 2017 long et al 2017 chen et al 2017 has been proposed in the incompressible methodology scope which assumes the constant density for both liquid and vapor due to acceptable results at certain level however the accurate modeling of these complex unsteady multiphase flows poses some challenging problems that have just begun to be addressed such as wave dynamics in cavitating flows considering the physically high compressibility and the close relationship between shock wave phenomena and acoustic characteristics in the liquid vapor mixture it is required to adopt the compressible cavitation simulation methodology kunz et al 2001 zhang and khoo 2014 budich et al 2018 wang et al 2018a b in the compressible cavitation simulation there are mainly two methods namely barotropic state equation liu et al 2004 decaix and goncalvès 2012 and transport equation method based on the compressible governing equations due to the barotropic characteristics of the state equation the baroclinic torque which is important in the vorticity generation and modification in the cavitation region gopalan and katz 2000 wang et al 2019 is ignored considering that the cavitation region is characterized by multi scale vortex structures the barotropic equation state method cannot accurately predict the unsteady dynamics of cavitating flows the transport equation method has been adopted mostly venkateswaran et al 2002 developed a preconditioned time marching algorithm considering the finite acoustic speeds in the constituent phases for the computation of multiphase mixture flows the results showed that both the compressible and incompressible methods can predict the time averaged flow features well while the compressible method has better performance in capturing the unsteady characteristics saito et al 2007 solved the compressible two phase navier stokes equations to investigate the unsteady behaviors of cloud cavitation around a naca 0015 hydrofoil they found the u shape cloud cavities dynamics were well simulated by the compressible solver schnerr et al 2008 developed the compressible three dimensional multiphase simulation method with phase change to investigate cloud cavitation dynamics especially the cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave dynamics the results showed that the compressibility effects significantly influence the cloud cavity dynamics a maximum pressure pulse up to 230 bar was captured during the cavity cloud collapse gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 developed a predictor corrector approach for compressible cavitating flows simulation on the unstructured grids a good agreement with experiments data was demonstrated and the pressure wave was also captured by the compressible method egerer et al 2016 developed the compressible multiphase flow approach based on implicit subgrid scale model using four cell stencil the single bubble collapse bubble cloud collapse and the cavitating turbulent mixing layer are effectively simulated and the code is well validated however the cavitating flow compressibility and wave dynamics are not fully discussed and investigated openfoam is an open source software platform and has the cavitating flow solver based on transport equation cavitation model in the frame work of incompressible two phase model in recent years many researchers have employed openfoam to simulate cavitating flows bensow and bark 2010a b park and rhee 2015 shang et al 2012 victor et al 2015 yu et al 2017 based on the native incompressible cavitation solver to account for the wave dynamics within the cavitating flows developing compressible cavitation solver on the openfoam platform becomes necessary arabnejad et al 2016 implemented a density based compressible solver with equilibrium cavitation in the openfoam using the modified tait equation of state for pure liquid and ideal gas equation of state for vapor test results show good performance and capture the re entrant jet wang et al 2018a b implemented the phase change algorithm into the native compressible two phase flow solver in openfoam achieving the simulation of cavitating flow considering the compressibility of both water and vapor and accurately capture of wave dynamics in cavitating flows the numerical results of cavitating flows around a naca66 mod hydrofoil show that the implemented compressible cavitation solver predicts the cloud cavity collapse shock wave dynamics well in the present work the physics involved in the two distinct cavity cloud shedding mechanisms namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm are numerically investigated the simulation is conducted using a compressible cavitating flow solver implemented on the open source software openfoam platform wang et al 2018a

for the wave dynamics e g shock wave in cavitating flows the compressibility effects of both liquid and vapor must be considered in the physical model thus the equations of state for water and vapor

turbulence 2 4 solution procedure and discretization in the present study openfoam 4 0 x is used to solve the compressible cavitating flow governing equations openfoam is a set of open source c libraries jasak 1996 released under the gnu public license gpl the spatial discretization is performed using a cell centered co located finite volume method fvm with arbitrary cell shapes and a multi step scheme is used for the time derivatives the compressible cavitation solver is developed by implementing the phase change algorithm into the supplied compressible two phase flow solver miller et al 2013 to simulate cavitating flows with the compressibility of both water and vapor considered wang et al 2018a b it is worth nothing that in openfoam a interface compressed vof method is adopted to accurately predict the interface positions weller 2008 the cavitation solver algorithm is shown in fig 1 the piso algorithm is used to solve the coupling between the velocity and pressure a first order implicit time scheme euler is used for time discretization which has both the robustness and acceptable prediction abilities coutier delgosha et al 2002 zamansky and ham 2013 yakubov et al 2015 and a second order scheme is used for advective terms the time step is set fixed and small enough to ensure a maximum courant number to be less than 0 4 in the whole computational domain for cavitation simulation 3 numerical setup and validation in this paper a two dimensional foil of the naca series naca66 investigated by leroux et al 2005 is selected the geometry coordinates of the foil can be found in the reference leroux et al 2004 2005 more detailed description of the experiment configuration can be found in the references leroux et al 2004 2005 where two partial cavitation instabilities at α 6 and 8 respectively were observed and investigated the hydrofoil was instrumented with 10 pressure transducers along the foil chord on the suction side from x c 0 10 with a step of 0 10c to x c 0 90 and at x c 0 05 at the foil leading edge the simulations are performed using the implemented compressible cavitation solver wang et al 2018a b based on the open source software openfoam to solve the compressible navier stokes equations the computations are conducted using a 3d domain and the computation domain and the boundary conditions are given according to the experiment setup leroux et al 2004 2005 as shown in fig 2 the inlet is located about 2c upstream of the foil and outlet is located 6c downstream of the foil as shown in fig 2 a the foil chord length is c 0 150 m and width is d 0 192 m the relative maximum thickness is τ 12 at 45 c from the foil leading edge le and the relative maximum chamber is 2 at 50 c from foil the leading edge le as show in fig 2 b to reduce the computation cost the spanwise length is chosen as 0 3c instead of the real spanwise size of the experiment hydrofoil the same domain treatment as sagaut 2002 and ji et al 2015 considering that shock wave phenomenon is important for the cavitation dynamics as observed in the experiments by leroux et al 2004 the boundary conditions must be set up to satisfy the shock wave dynamics and its propagation to avoid the pressure wave reflection at the inlet and outlet boundaries and thus disturb the flow fields the non reflect boundary conditions are used for both inlet and outlet boundaries a non slip boundary condition is imposed on the hydrofoil surface top and bottom tunnel boundaries and symmetry boundaries on the front and back of the domain bensow 2011 to treat the turbulence structures near the walls kqrwallfunction wall model is used for turbulence kinematic k and nutkwallfunction wall model is used for turbulence viscosity μ t at wall boundaries the first order implicit bounded euler scheme is for time discretization and second order gauss linear upwind scheme for spatial discretization the hydrofoil was fixed at angle of attack aoa 6 or aoa 8 with the inlet velocity set as u 5 33 m s for all cases it should be noted that in the experiment the cavitation number is based on the inlet pressure while in the simulation the pressure at outlet boundary is determined and in the simulation the outlet pressure is alternated according to the cavitation number to ensure the inlet pressure at the experiment level leroux et al 2004 in the present study the influences of both mesh and time step are performed by monitoring the pressure coefficient and cavity cloud shedding frequency the main non dimensional parameters used are defined as s t f c u c p p ρ u 2 re u c ν and σ p p v 0 5 ρ u 2 where u is the inlet velocity c is the foil chord and d is the hydrofoil width the structured hexahedral mesh is used in the present simulation the grid generation is according to the previous study by ji et al 2015 in the x and y directions mesh are generated with sufficient refinement near the foil surface and downstream the hydrofoil where cavitation develops as shown in fig 3 a and 3 d view of the mesh details near the foil surface are shown in fig 3 b and the value of y at the first grid point within 1 2 on all the wall boundaries including hydrofoil up and down tunnel walls where the mesh resolution satisfies completely the requirement of the present hybrid rans les sst sas turbulence model bensow 2011 asnaghi et al 2018 ghahramani et al 2019 then the influence of spanwise nodes is performed with node number of 30 60 80 and 90 respectively considering the unsteady characteristics of cloud cavitating flows the frequency and strouhal number is important in the simulation accuracy the validation test simulation is conducted at the condition of α 6 σ 1 25 leroux et al 2004 which is characterized by alternate interactions of re entrant jet dynamics and shock wave dynamics four sets of computational meshes are firstly tested with the elements ranging from 977 500 to 281 2500 as shown in table 1 the power spectral density distribution of cavity volume is also shown in fig 3 it is indicated that the differences between the fine meshes of 2 500 000 and 2 812 500 can be neglected consequently along the foil spanwise direction 80 nodes distributed uniformly are used in the present simulation unsteady sheet cloud cavitating flows experience strong instabilities and to address the real transient behaviors of cloud cavitation flows the time step is set to keep the maximum courant number maxco below 0 4 in the whole computation domain which can ensure high computation accuracy according to the requirements of mules algorithm used in openfoam in the present study δt 1 10 5 s is used where as a results the maxco in the whole flow field is below 0 4 and furthermore this value is below the value t ref 200 1 41 10 4 t ref c u where u is the free stream velocity at the inlet as suggested by coutier delgosha et al 2003 which is derived based on flow physics the coutier delgosha s criterion about time step used form 2d simulation and since this value is derived from flow physics it can also guide our 3d simulation work it should be noted that the simulation of shock wave always requires very short time step even to nanosecond order schnerr et al 2008 in the cavitating flows the sonic speed within the cavitation region is relatively smaller than that in the pure liquid and vapor region and the time scale of shock wave propagation in cavitation region is in the convective scale o 100 and thus the present time step is able to address shock wave cavity interactions and also to capture the shock wave propagation in pure liquid upstream and downstream of the foil o 10 3 to reduce the simulation iteration error the solver tolerance for pressure and velocity residual convergence criterion in each iteration is set equal to 10 12 which has been used by asnaghi et al 2017 2018 in the simulation 60t ref are performed according to coutier delgosha et al 2003 where t ref is a reference time corresponding to the time required for the flow to pass through the foil length c 0 15 m with the speed u 5 33 m s 60t ref of simulation equals to 1 7s which is sufficient to resolve the cavitation characteristics during the data processing the data after 0 1s is used to show the performance of the chosen mesh in predicting the dynamics of cavitation the comparisons of experimentally measured and numerically predicted psd of pressure fluctuations with different meshes at x c 0 7 are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that good agreement between the predicted and measured psd contents of pressure evolution on the foil suction side at x c 0 7 is obtained it is observed that different meshes can predict both the spectral content of the cavitation induced pressure signals with little differences in dominant frequency and the chosen mesh is fine enough to predict the cavitation frequency furthermore it is suggested that the pressure spectrum in inertial subrange follows theoretically the batchelor s 7 3 power law batchelor 1951 fig 5 presents the monitored inlet pressure evolution and its psd distribution obtained by fast fourier transfer fft in several cavitation shedding cycles in the case of σ 1 25 α 6 the slop of the lines in the inertial subrange were measured to be equal to 7 3 indicating the accuracy of the present result 4 results and discussion the cloud cavitating flows under both the re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm around a naca66 mod hydrofoil is investigated numerically the comparisons of numerically predicted cavity evolution frequency with that experimentally measured by leroux et al 2005 are shown in fig 6 at u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 in the experiments by leroux et al 2005 the transient cavity behaviors is characterized by very low cavity shedding cycle ranging between 3 4 and 3 5 hz when the angle of attack is below 7 5 which is different from that at the angle of attack 8 indicating different cavity dynamics it can be found that the present numerical method predicts the cavity shedding frequency characteristics well in the present study the angle of attack aoa 6 and 8 are selected for the detailed discussion on the cavity dynamics of compressible cavitating flow involved in the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm respectively sec 4 1 is devoted to investigate the dynamics associated with shock wave propagation characterized by low cavity shedding frequency at the angle of attack 6 aoa 6 σ 1 0 sec 4 2 presents the cavity mechanism associated with the re entrant jet dynamics at the angle of attack 8 aoa 8 σ 1 28 and following in sec 4 3 some comparisons of flow characteristics between the two distinct cavity shedding dynamics are conducted 4 1 shock wave dominated cavity shedding mechanism aoa 6 swm in this section the shock wave dynamics dominated cavitation instabilities is investigated firstly where the cavity behaviors are characterized by periodic large scale vapor cloud shedding collapse and shock wave emission and propagation the cloud cavity shedding process along with cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave dynamics is investigated compared with experiment data leroux et al 2005 the cavity length predicted by the present compressible method is 0 78c with relative error 4 0 the dominant frequency of cavitation evolution is estimated to be 3 611 hz with relative error 3 17 and the strouhal number based on the foil chord length c is 0 102 with relative error 4 08 fig 7 shows the numerically predicted vapor fraction isosurface with absolute pressure on foil surface and symmetry plane during approximately one cavitation cycle at α 6 σ 1 00 u 5 33 m s to show the evolution of flow structures well the temporal spatial maps x t map of vapor fraction pressure coefficient c p c p p 0 5ρu 2 normalized streamwise velocity u x u and pressure gradient during one and a quarter cavity cycles are shown in fig 9 respectively the monitor positions used in fig 9 are shown in fig 8 which are 1 mm above the foil surface on suction side and extending downstream to 1 5c the detailed descriptions of cavitation evolution are discussed in the following the unsteady cavity presents quasi periodic behaviors the cavitation evolution can be divided into four stages 1 the attached cavity growth stage ãc 2 the re entrant jet development and attached cavity sheet breakup stage d 3 the cloud cavity shedding stage e and 4 the cloud cavity collapse stage f during the first stage at the beginning the attached cavity sheet forms at the foil leading edge as shown in fig 7 a with the attached cavity growth the length and thickness of the attached cavity sheet increase as shown by the transient cavity behaviors in fig 7 b c and vapor fraction evolution in x t map in fig 9 a during the second stage combined with the x t map of velocity u x u it can be found that the attached cavitation region in liquid vapor mixtures consists of a reverse flow region shown in fig 9 c and a high adverse pressure gradient region in fig 9 d when the attached cavity sheet grows to a certain length about 0 8c as shown in fig 9 c the reverse flow will be strong enough and re entrant jet generates at the rear part of the attached cavity sheet as indicated by the red arrow in fig 9 c combined with the water vapor fraction in fig 9 a it can be found that low vapor fraction exists in re entrant jet region showing that the re entrant jet mainly consists of pure liquid from the cavity behaviors in fig 7 d it can be observed that with the development of re entrant jet the cavity interface along the re entrant jet boundaries beneath the attached cavity sheet becomes unsteady when the re entrant jet arrives at the sheet cavity leading edge the interactions between the re entrant jet and cavity interface will cause the cavity breakup as shown in fig 7 d following during the third stage the residual broken cavity sheet will be rolled up under the convection of the main flow and shed downstream as a large scale cavity cloud as shown in fig 7 e which can also be seen in fig 9 a during the fourth stage when the large scale cavity cloud is transported into high pressure region downstream the high pressure differences between the cavity and liquid will cause the abrupt cavity collapse with shock wave emission as shown in fig 7 f it can be observed that the cavity cloud collapses before the instance at t t 0 0 77t ref combined with the pressure coefficient in x t map it can be found that after the cavity cloud collapses high pressure is generated and propagates to even the foil leading edge as shown in fig 9 b which is believed to be cavity collapse shock wave phenomenon following shock wave rebound phenomena is captured with the shock wave strength decrease in the next the physical mechanisms involved in the unsteady cavitating flows with emphasis on the compressibility characteristics and cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave emission and propagation process will be studied in detail shock wave dynamics is closely related to the compressibility characteristics which provide the required conditions for the shock wave formation to further investigate the physics involved in the shock wave dominated cavity cloud shedding process the acoustics characteristics including sound speed and mach number distributions in the transient cavitating flows are studied according to wallis equation the definition of sound speed and mach number in liquid vapor mixture is as follows 17 1 ρ c 2 α v ρ v t c v 2 1 α v ρ l t c l 2 18 c v d p d ρ r g t 19 c l d p d ρ p l s a t b n ρ l t ρ l t ρ l s a t n 20 m a u 2 v 2 w 2 c where the density variances of both liquid and vapor are considered to take into effects of compressibility on cavitation acoustics and the temperature variance effects are also considered the vapor fraction mass transfer sonic speed and mach number distributions which illustrate the compressibility characteristics of cavitation during four typical cavity evolution processes namely the attached cavity sheet growth the attached cavity breakup the cavity cloud shedding and the shock wave propagation are presented in fig 10 respectively the sonic speed lines are outlined to show both the subsonic and supersonic regions and water vapor fraction α v 0 001 and 0 1 are marked to show the low void fraction regions the reverse flow regions identified by u x 0 are illustrated in the attached cavity sheet growth process at t t 0 0 15t ref the cavity sheet length is about 0 55c and the cavity tightly attaches to the foil suction side as shown in fig 10 a the vapor fraction distribution presents low values at the cavity boundaries which mainly consists of vapor liquid interfaces and high values inside the attached cavity sheet the high void fraction region within the attached cavity is mainly low mass transfer and high sonic speed region it can be found that along the interface of reverse flow region low mass transfer high sonic speed and low mach number are seen high mass transfer rate appears at the cavity leading edge and trailing edge as indicated in fig 10 a considering that the cavity sheet continuously grows the mass transfer rate at the rear part of the cavity is higher than that at the leading edge the supersonic flow region mainly distributes along the cavity interface where weak mass transfer rates and low void fraction are found in low void fraction region between α v 0 001 0 01 although the sonic speed is high the mach number is this low void fraction region is relatively high in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 41t ref the cavity is characterized by the broken cavity sheet at the front part and the rolling up of the cavity sheet at the rear part abrupt mass transfer takes place in both the front part where cavity breaks up and the front and rear part of the rolling up cavity cloud low sonic speed and high mach number mainly appear in the cavity cloud which is in the rear part of the broken attached cavity sheet as shown in fig 10 b in supersonic flow region weak mass transfer rates are found as shown in fig 10 b in low void fraction regions between α v 0 001 0 01 high sonic speed and high mach number are observed along the boundaries of the reverse flow region high sonic speed and low mach number are found in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 53t ref the cavity behavior is characterized by large scale cavity cloud being shed downstream as shown in fig 10 c in this process abrupt mass transfer takes place in the outer part of the cavity cloud while in the inner part weak mass transfer rates are found showing that cavity cloud collapse from outer part to inner part the cavity cloud is characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number in the outer part which provides the condition for the shock wave formation much higher mass transfer exists at the front and rear part of the shedding cavity cloud indicating that the cloud collapse is not symmetric low void fraction is seen beneath the cavity cloud in the cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave propagation process at t t 0 0 77t ref it can be found that the cavity totally collapses and thus mass transfer takes place just near the foil surface and at foil wakes owing to the very low vapor fraction in the flow field the sonic speed is relatively high and mach number is small as shown in fig 10 d mass transfer mainly takes place at foil wakes at the foil wakes owing to the existence of low void fraction lower sonic speed and higher mach number is seen based on the analysis it can be concluded that in addition to the vapor fraction the mass transfer rate can highly effects the compressibility effects in cavitating flows the complex interactions between void fraction mass transfer sonic speed and mach number could significantly the acoustics characteristics in transient cavitating flows to further study compressible characteristics within cavitation region fig 11 shows the sonic speed contours on foil mid section plane at the instances in fig 10 seven contour lines are presented for 1 α v 0 1 2 α v 0 0 01 3 α v 0 001 4 α v 0 0001 5 α v 0 00001 6 α v 0 000001 7 α v 0 0000001 which represent the sonic speed c 5 87604 17 7158 55 734 175 058 521 775 1134 48 and 1432 43 as indicated by the band numbers 1 7 in fig 11 b respectively the α v 0 1 line sketches the contours of the cavity region as also shown in fig 10 it can be seen that low void fraction outside the cavity interface indicated by α v 0 1 is much larger and significantly alter the acoustics in foil wakes and outside the cavity interface where sound speed experiences large variance from 0 to 10 m s in cavitation liquid vapor mixtures to 1450 m s in pure liquid region it can be found that there exists a transitional region between the cavitation region where the sonic speed is only 0 10 m s and pour liquid where the sonic speed is about 1450 m s and the size of the transitional region is in the order of the cavity thickness the transitional region defined as the sonic speed boundary layer indicates that low sonic speed region is far larger than the cavitation region it can be indicated that when the cavity cloud collapses the emitted shock wave propagation has a buffer region to reduce the propagation speed from about 1450 m s to 0 10 m s to arrive at the cavitation region in the attached cavity sheet growth process at t t 0 0 15t ref in fig 11 a the cavity sheet attaches to the foil suction side it can be found that the low sonic speed region extends from the cavity sheet region to that in the bulk flow region and also the cavity sheet wake and the foil wake regions the thickness of the transition region is nearly the same as the cavity sheet thickness in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 41t ref compared with that in the cavity sheet growth process the cavity sheet thickness increases and the cavity sheet wake region enlarges as shown in fig 11 b the cavity wake and the foil wake begins to interact with each other in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 53t ref strong interactions between the shedding cavity cloud wake and the foil wake exist the low sonic speed region even enlarges with the size of the cavity cloud increase as shown in fig 11 c in the shock wave propagation process at t t 0 0 77t ref low sonic speed appears in the cavity cloud collapse region and the size of the low sonic speed region is larger than before during the cavity cloud shedding process as shown in fig 11 d indicating that the cavity cloud collapse will highly influence the wake compressibility characteristics the minimum sonic speed and maximum mach number in the flow fields are shown in table 2 it can be concluded that during the attached cavity sheet growth and the breakup process and the cavity cloud shedding and collapse process the minimum sonic speed is below 10 m s and the maximum mach number can be above 1 indicating supersonic flows in attached cavity growth re entrant jet development and cavity cloud shedding process compared with that in the re entrant jet development process the mach number is smaller in the shock wave propagation process where cavity is fully collapsed and low void fraction is found in the flow field considering that the sonic boundary layer plays an important role in acoustics exchange between compressible cavitation region and outside incompressible liquid region more details on sonic boundary layer should be conducted 4 2 re entrant jet dominated cavity shedding mechanism aoa 8 rjm the cavity cloud shedding mechanism dominated by re entrant jet is investigated in this section fig 12 shows the time evolution of the numerically predicted vapor fraction isosurface with the pressure contour on the foil surface and the symmetry plane during one cavity shedding cycle the flow direction is from right to left as indicated by the red arrow in fig 12 a the isosurface of u x u 0 is also shown in fig 12 to indicate the reverse flow region to better illustrate the unsteady cavitation evolution process the temporal spatial map of vapor fraction pressure coefficient normalized streamwise velocity u x u and absolute pressure gradient during one and a quarter cycles are presented in fig 13 respectively the dash vertical lines in fig 13 indicate the instances in fig 12 compared with experiment data leroux et al 2005 the cavity length predicted by the present compressible method is 0 8c with relative error 6 7 the dominant frequency of cavitation evolution is estimated to be 18 621 hz with relative error 3 45 compared to the experiment data leroux et al 2005 and the strouhal number based on foil chord length c is 0 524 with relative error 3 35 following the unsteady cavity behaviors will be discussed in detail different from that in the shock wave propagation dominated cloud cavitation shedding mechanism swm at angle of attack 6 the cavitation evolution at the angle of attack 8 is dominated by re entrant jet dynamics rjm where no cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave propagation process is observed the cavitation evolution can be divided into three stages 1 the attached cavity growth stage a b f 2 the re entrant jet development and attached cavity sheet breakup stage c d and 3 the cloud cavity shedding stage e firstly the attached cavity sheet grows near the foil leading edge and continuously extends downstream as shown in both the numerically predicted results in fig 12 and the experimental observations by leroux et al 2005 when the attached cavity length arrives at certain length the re entrant jet generates at the rear of the sheet cavity as shown in fig 12 b combined with the pressure gradient evolution in fig 13 d it can be concluded that during the re entrant jet development high negative adverse pressure gradient exists in the attached cavity sheet region the research callenaere et al 2001 pelz et al 2017 on re entrant jet dynamics has been conducted and mainly attributes the formation of re entrant jet to high adverse pressure gradient at the closure region of the cavity sheet as illustrated in fig 13 c it can be found that with the re entrant jet development the magnitude of reverse velocity decreases along its moving path showing that the re entrant jet strength attenuates considering that the re entrant jet consists of mainly liquid it will carry the liquid into the local cavity and lift up the relatively thin attached cavity sheet resulting in the vapor fraction decrease as indicated in fig 13 a at the same time the pressure on the foil suction side increases as shown in fig 13 b it should be noted that from the numerical results the large scale cavity cloud collapse will influence the new attached cavity sheet growth with the attached cavity sheet length decreases during the cavity cloud collapse as shown in figs 12 f and fig 13 a the detailed study on the large cloud cavity collapse process will be presented below to investigate the compressible characteristics in the re entrant jet dominated cloud cavity shedding mechanism rjm fig 14 presents the vapor fraction mass transfer sonic speed and mach number contours at three typical cavitation evolution instances namely the re entrant jet development the attached cavity breakup and the cavity cloud shedding in the process which attached cavity grows re entrant jet develops and cavity cloud sheds downstream respectively in the re entrant jet development process at t t 0 0 40t ref an attached cavity sheet attaches tightly to the foil suction side as shown in fig 14 a low vapor fraction can be found in cavitation region near the foil surface where the re entrant jet develops from the mass transfer contour it can be found that the large mass transfer rate mainly occurs across the cavity liquid interface the cavity rear and front part where the vapor fraction is relatively low it is known that the vapor liquid mixture can experience an abrupt sonic speed reduction to even several meters per second shamsborhan et al 2010 and thus the cavitation region is highly compressible from the sonic speed contour it can be seen that the sonic speed distribution is characterized by the high value in the core of the attached cavity sheet where high vapor fraction exists and low value at the vapor liquid interface where relatively low vapor fraction and abrupt phase change exist the high mach number appears at the vapor liquid interface and in supersonic region along the cavity liquid interface weak mass transfer rate can be found the reverse flow region is also characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number along the boundaries of the reverse flow region low void fraction weak mass transfer rate and low mach number are observed in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 60t ref the front part of the cavity near the foil nose is broken and the residual cavity begins to be rolled up the rear part of the cavity is not so dense with low void fraction abrupt phase change takes places at the cavity breakup region and along the vapor liquid interface of the shedding cavity cloud low sonic speed and high mach number distribute in the rear part of the cavity especially the vapor liquid interface it can be found that within the inner part of the rolling cavity cloud high void fraction low mass transfer rate high sonic speed and low mach number can be seen while the outer part of the cavity cloud is characterized by high mass transfer rate supersonic region exist in the outer part of the cavity cloud low void fraction region along the cavity liquid interface and at foil wakes is characterized by high sonic speed and high mach number in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 86t ref cavity cloud is shed downstream and new attached cavity sheet begins to grow large mass transfer rate takes place within the attached cavity sheet region at the foil leading edge and the shedding cavity cloud at foil wakes cavity cloud is characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number high mach number is also seen in the low void fraction region along the cavity cloud interface where the sonic speed is relatively high from above it can be found that the vapor fraction and mass transfer have great effects on cavitation compressibility characteristics moreover to quantitatively measure the compressibility in cavitating flows the minimum sonic speed and maximum mach number at these typical cavitation flow fields are shown in table 3 it can be concluded that accompanying with the attached cavity sheet breakup and cavity cloud shedding the minimum sonic speed keeps almost constant while the maximum mach number increases indicating the compressibility in the flow increases the maximum mach number in the field exceeds sonic speed showing the supersonic state within cavitation region considering that sonic speed is an essential parameter for the disturbance propagation the sonic characteristics in cavitating flows are studied fig 15 shows the sonic speed contours on foil mid section planes at the instances in fig 14 the region outlined by these contours lines can be shown and the sonic speed distributions vary from several meters per second in cavitation region to thousand meters per second in pure water which is defined as sonic speed boundary layer compared with the vapor fraction contour in fig 14 it can be found that the α v 0 1 line sketches the contours of the cavity region the sonic speed gradually increases from low sonic speed in cavitation region to pure liquid sonic speed outside the cavity and the size of the buffer region sonic speed boundary is in the order of the cavity in the re entrant jet development process at t t 0 0 40t ref the cavity sheet attaches to the foil suction side and re entrant jet beneath the attached cavity sheet is moving upstream the low sonic speed region distributes mainly around the cavity sheet and the foil wake the sonic speed buffer region from 1450 m s to 0 10 m s is about the cavity sheet thickness as shown in fig 15 a the re entrant jet region is also a low sonic speed region which is caused by the vapor entrained by the re entrant jet in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 60t ref the residual cavity sheet begins to be rolled up and the sonic speed transition region enlarges in the cavity sheet region and foil wakes as shown in fig 15 b in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 86t ref the cavity cloud is transported into the foil trailing edge and the sonic speed transition region further enlarges at foil wakes as presented in fig 15 c the foil cavity wakes and the cavity cloud region closely interact indicating the high compressibility effects region increases in addition a thin layer of low sonic speed region is observed on the foil suction side around the newly growing attached cavity sheet at the foil leading edge 4 3 comparisons of flow characteristics under rjm and swm to better understand the unsteady flow characteristics involved in the re entrant jet dominated cavity shedding mechanism rjm and the shock wave mechanism swm fig 16 presents the time evolution of cavity volume v c cavity volume rate v c d v c dt and v c d v c 2 dt 2 for a α 8 σ 1 28 u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 and at b α 6 σ 1 00 u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 respectively the open symbols indicate the instances in figs 7 and 12 respectively the schematic of typical cavity patterns is also inserted in fig 16 to illustrate the unsteady cavity behaviors it can be observed that the two distinct cavity shedding processes under rjm and swm show different flow characteristics the cavity volume and volume rate evolution presents quasi periodic characteristics following more detailed discussions in the two distinct cavity cloud shedding mechanisms will be given table 4 lists the period characteristics of cavity volume increase t increase t ref which shows the cavity growth rate and cavity decrease t decrease t ref which shows the cavity collapse rate in cavity cycles it can be illustrated that the average period of cavity volume increase in rjm is smaller than that of cavity volume decrease while in swm the period of cavity volume increase is larger than that of the cavity volume decreases indicating the strength of cavity collapse in swm is stronger than that in rjm in re entrant jet mechanism rjm as shown in fig 16 a during the attached cavity growth stage a d f the cavity volume increases with the cavity volume rate v c continuously increase it can be found that the cavity volume rate v c keeps almost constant in this stage with a bit of fluctuations during the re entrant jet development stage c d the cavity volume reaches its maximum value and then decreases while the cavity volume rate experiences an abrupt reduction to a minus value as marked by blue circles in fig 16 a indicating the global condensation rate in the flow field larger than the evaporation rate in this process the cavity volume rate v c fluctuations increase during the cavity cloud shedding stage e cavity cloud will collapse when transported into high pressure region downstream and the cavity volume decreases sharply and the cavity volume rate both v c and v c experiences huge fluctuations in the unsteady cavitating flows dominated by re entrant jet dynamics the period occupied by cavity volume increases is about 0 4t ref while by cavity volume decrease 0 6t ref in the shock wave mechanism swm as shown in fig 16 b in the process of attached cavity growth ãc the cavity volume increases and the cavity volume rate v c continuously increases compared to the rjm v c in swm is a bit slower and furthermore cavity volume rate v c fluctuations is smaller in the process of re entrant jet development d cavity volume reaches its maximum value and during the interactions between the re entrant jet and the attached cavity on the foil suction side the cavity volume rate drops sharply to zero as indicated by blue circles at the same time cavity volume rate v c experiences an increasing fluctuation following during the cavity cloud shedding process the cavity volume continuously decreases while the cavity volume rate v c experiences an increase when the cavity cloud being shed to high pressure region the abrupt cavity collapse will generate shock wave following which the rebound process begins in this stage the cavity volume decreases to its minimum value in a short period the cavity volume rate of both v c and v c experiences a large fluctuations in the shock wave propagation process as shown in fig 16 b compared with that during the cavity cloud collapse in rjm the cavity volume rate is much higher in swm the period of cavity volume increases is about 0 6t ref while the period of cavity volume decrease 0 4t ref as the cavity volume fluctuations is highly related with cavitation instabilities ji et al 2015 chen et al 2015 it can be indicated that shock wave phenomena is an important source of cavitation instabilities to study the compressibility characteristics in the two distinct cavity shedding process the time evolution of maximum mach number mamax in the flow field during one cavity shedding cycle is presented in fig 17 it should be noted that the present averaged process is based on one typical cavity cycle and considering the good periodicity this processing can present the characteristics in a reasonable level the average value ave and standard deviation std of maximum mach number mamax in the flow field during the selected cavity cycle are also shown it can be found that the maximum mach number mamax in both the re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm are above unit indicating the supersonic state in the cavitating flows both the average value and standard derivation of maximum mach number mamax in rjm are higher than that in swm it can be observed that in rjm during the re entrant jet development stage the maximum mach number drops a lot and experiences huge fluctuations the in deep relationship between the local mach number evolution and the cavity shedding mechanism is still an open problem it is supposed that supersonic flow in0 56 the cavitation region presents the condition required for the multiphase shock wave generation the cavity collapse induced shock wave formation is regarded as the cavity collapse characteristics however the interactions between the supersonic flow and the cavity collapse process are still needed to be further discussed to further investigate the compressibility characteristics in the two distinct cloud cavitation mechanisms the time averaged sonic speed and mach number distribution during the selected cavity cycle is presented in fig 18 it can be found that the time averaged sonic speed distributes mainly along the foil surface on foil suction side compared with that in rjm the thickness of low sonic speed region is relatively large in swm the time averaged mach number in rjm is higher than that in swm it can be illustrated that the high mach number distributes along the cavity interface and maximum mach number appears at the foil leading edge to better illustrate the physical mechanisms in the large scale cavity cloud collapse process in the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms rjm and swm fig 19 gives time evolution of pressure signals on foil suction side at x c 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 along with the transient cavity structures with vapor fraction isofurface α v 0 15 at four instances during the large scale cavity cloud collapse process for a re entrant jet mechanism condition and b shock wave mechanism condition it can be found that under the condition of re entrant jet dominated cavity cloud shedding mechanism rjm as shown in fig 19 a the shedding cavity cloud collapse will cause high pressure fluctuations at x c 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 however the pressure signals at x c 0 2 keeps almost constant indicating the collapse induced high pressure fluctuations attenuates fast and does not influence the flow field a the foil leading edge combined with the cavity structures it can be found that with the cavity cloud being shed the new attached cavity sheet begins to grow in the process of the cavity cloud collapse cloud collapsed induced high pressure can be observed while this high pressure does not impact attached cavity sheet at the foil leading edge a lot different from that in the re entrant jet mechanism condition the cloud cavity collapse process in the shock wave mechanism condition is governed by the shock wave dynamics as shown in fig 19 b combined with the pressure coefficient evolution and the corresponding vapor fraction isosurface it can be found that the cavity cloud collapse will induce high pressure in the field and the shock wave propagation on the foil will cause the attached cavity sheet collapse as shown in fig 19 b2 the shedding cavity cloud takes the topology of the u shape structure the u shape cavity cloud head collapse first as shown in fig 19 b2 and then the u shape cavity cloud legs when the cavity cloud totally collapses shock wave is emitted originating from the collapse position the magnitude of the pressure coefficient can reach up to 4 as shown in fig 19 b following shock wave rebound phenomena is captured as shown in fig 19 b3 and b4 it can be concluded that shock wave propagation and rebound process has a great role in cavitation dynamics which can inhibit the new attached cavity sheet growth and thus results in the cavity evolution cycle increase fig 20 shows the attenuation rate of shock wave defined as p 1 p 2 δt during its propagation and rebound it can be seen that the shock wave attenuation quickly during its rebound process 5 conclusions the purpose of the paper is to investigate the physics involved in the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm considering that the shock wave dynamics is closely related with compressibility a compressible cavitating flow solver developed on the open source software openfoam platform is applied to account for the compressibility and thus to solve the wave dynamics in the cavitating flows the compressible navier stokes equations along with the energy equation closed by the thermodynamic equations of state of both liquid and vapor are solved the saito cavitation model is applied to account for the transient mass transfer between liquid and vapor and the sst sas turbulence model adopting the von karman length scale as the transition function between rans and les is used to model the cavitating turbulence effects two cloud cavity shedding mechanisms are carefully analyzed around a naca66 mod hydrofoil fixed at α 8 σ 1 28 σ 2 α α 0 3 529 and α 6 σ 1 00 σ 2 α α 0 3 431 respectively at u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 the main findings are as the following 1 the re entrant jet mechanism rjm is characterized by the periodic formation and development of re entrant jet and the attached cavity breakup resulting from the interaction between re entrant jet and cavity liquid interface the cloud cavity collapse will induce high pressure in the flow field at foil wakes and the high pressure will attenuate quickly in the flow field without rebound phenomena during the re entrant jet development process the re entrant jet front will cause small pressure fluctuations increase in the shock wave mechanism swm the cavitating flow is characterized by the alternate interactions between cavity re entrant jet and shock wave respectively when the attached cavity sheet grows to a certain length the re entrant jet generates at the rear of cavity the interactions between the re entrant jet and the cavity liquid interface will cause the attached cavity sheet breakup and the residual cavity sheet will be rolled up and shed downstream when transported into high pressure region downstream the cloud cavity will be collapsed and large pressure peaks are captured in the flow field which is supposed to be the shock wave phenomenon the shock wave propagation will cause the attached cavity sheet near the foil leading edge totally collapse following the shock wave rebound phenomenon is observed with the shock wave strength attenuation during the rebound process the attached cavity sheet growth is inhibited it can be concluded that the shock wave propagation and rebound process delays the cavitation evolution cycle compared with the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms it can be found that the cavity cloud collapse rate in shock wave mechanism is faster than that in re entrant process 2 the joint interactions between the vapor fraction and mass transfer has a significant effects on the compressibility characteristics in the cavitating flows which is characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number with the cavitation evolution the minimum sonic speed in the whole flow fields keeps almost constant while the maximum mach number varies the average and standard derivation of mach number in the shock wave mechanism swm is smaller than that in the re entrant jet mechanism rjm the differences in minimum sonic speed and maximum mach number between the two cavity cloud mechanisms indicate the different compressibility characteristics in the cavitating flows at α 8 and 6 considering the close relationship between the compressibility effects and wave dynamics it can be concluded that the cavitation compressibility characteristics have an important influence on the cavity dynamics complex interactions between the compressibility and the cavitation evolution is still an open problem and needs more detailed investigations 3 the sonic speed distribution in the cavitating flow is characterized by the low sonic speed value 3 10 m s in the cavitation region and high sonic speed value 1450 m s in the main liquid flow region outside the cavitation region thus a sonic speed boundary layer exists between the cavitation region and the pure liquid region where the disturbance from the bulk flow has a buffer region to reach the cavitation region which indicates the interactions between the compressible cavitation region and the outside incompressible liquid region the thickness of the sonic speed boundary is in the same order as the thickness of the local attached cavity sheet 4 in the cloud cavity collapse process collapse induced high pressure is captured in the cavitating flow at both α 8 and 6 while collapse shock wave generation and rebound phenomena is only captured at α 6 in the shock wave formation and rebound process cavity volume and pressure evolution experience an abrupt fluctuations which are larger than that in the re entrant jet development process indicating that the shock wave is an important sources of cavity instabilities regarding the future work further investigations on the coherent interactions between the turbulence structures and the cavity evolution is still needed the shedding cavity cloud is composed of strong vortices and it is supposed that the vortex dynamics will have significant effects on the cavity cloud collapse process both the euler view point and lagrange view point can aid to shed light on the cloud cavity collapse characteristics especially the coherent interactions between the turbulence and cavitation in the shock wave dynamics furthermore to capture more detailed flow structures the large eddy simulation les approach will be employed to investigate the physics governing the cloud cavitation shedding mechanisms detailed experiment in water tunnel will be conducted along with sophisticated measurements it is worth nothing that the compressibility effects in cavitating flows originates from cavitation process where cavitation region is highly compressible and outside liquid flow experiences weak compressibility in the present work it is shown that sonic boundary layer plays an important role between compressible cavitation region and outside incompressible liquid flow we recommend future works to conduct the study on the interactions between the high compressible cavitation region and weak compressible pure liquid in cavitating flows since these two distinct region exchanges a lot with the cavitation evolution in addition our current study is limited in a typical shock wave induced cloud cavitation shedding mechanism and recent experiment work wu et al 2019 shows there exists different type of shock wave mechanisms which is needed to be further investigated acknowledge the

21765,the main purpose of this work is to shed light on the physics involved in the two distinct cavity cloud shedding mechanisms in cloud cavitating flows namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave propagation mechanism swm a compressible cavitating flow solver which considers the compressibility effects of both liquid and vapor is used to account for the wave dynamics in cavitating flows the compressible navier stokes equations coupling the mass momentum energy equations and phase fraction transport equation along with the thermodynamic equations of state for both liquid and vapor saito cavitation model and the sst sas turbulence model are solved numerical results are presented for the conditions of both the re entrant jet mechanism and shock wave mechanism around a naca66 mod hydrofoil leroux et al 2005 respectively with emphasis on the process of re entrant jet development and shock wave formation and propagation the results show that the re entrant jet can cause the attached cavity sheet breakup for both the two cavity cloud shedding mechanisms in both high and low angle of attack while the shock wave formation and propagation process only occurs under shock wave mechanism at low angles of attack pressure evolution illustrates that in the re entrant jet mechanism cavity cloud collapse will induce high pressure load while no shock wave and thus the corresponding rebound phenomenon are observed in shock wave mechanism during the whole process of the shock wave dynamics namely generation propagation and rebound process pressure fluctuations increase sharply along with the generation of the pressure peaks with large amplitude and short time interval further study on the compressible characteristics involved in the two cavity shedding mechanisms illustrates that vapor fraction and mass transfer have a significant effect in sonic speed and mach number characteristics the average and standard derivation of maximum mach number mamax in shock wave mechanism is lower than that in re entrant jet mechanism cavitating flows are characterized by low sonic speed value in the cavitation region and high sonic speed value in the pure liquid region and a sonic speed boundary layer exists between the two regions the thickness of which is about the size of the local attached cavity sheet on foil surface in the process of shock wave generation and rebound cavity volume and cavity volume rate experience large fluctuations showing strong cavitation instabilities in shock wave mechanism keywords cloud cavitation re entrant jet shock wave sonic speed mach number cavitation instabilities openfoam 1 introduction hydrodynamic cavitation is a phenomenon characterized by abrupt phase change between liquid and vapor at nearly constant temperature when local pressure drops below vapor pressure in high speed liquid flows brennen 1995 wang et al 2001 partial cavitation especially the cloud cavitation exhibits serious instabilities such as strong pressure fluctuations vibrations noise and material erosion seol 2013 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2015 wu et al 2015 2017 wang et al 2017a b and is responsible for the undesirable effects or even damage in hydrodynamic systems including pumps turbines propellers and underwater bodies experiments have identified two distinct mechanisms for the onset of cloud cavitation namely re entrant jet mechanism kawanami et al 1997 callenaere et al 2001 and shock wave propagation mechanism ganesh et al 2016 wu et al 2019 the re entrant jet generates at the rear part of the attached cavity and flows upstream along the wall beneath the cavity when this liquid jet arrives at the cavity leading edge and impinges with the cavity interface it will cut off the attached cavity and then under the shear force of the main flow the residual part of the attached cavity will be rolled up and shed downstream the re entrant jet dynamics in cloud cavitation have been verified and widely investigated by both experimental measurements and numerical simulations however the understanding of shock wave dynamics is limited it has been both experimentally and theoretically proved that high void fraction gas liquid flows experience a significant reduction in sonic speed wallis 1967 shamsborhan et al 2010 prosperetti 2015 the value of which is far lower than that of its constituents e g pure liquid and pure vapor moreover the mass transfer between liquid and vapor will further decrease the sonic speed franc and michel 2005 the low sonic speed in the liquid vapor mixture provides the cavitating flows the required conditions to reach supersonic state even when the inlet liquid flow velocity is not so high creating the relevant conditions susceptible to multiphase shock wave formation the explosive evaporation of liquid water in low pressure regions generates plenty of vapor significantly increasing the local flow compressibility and the subsequent implosions of cavity clusters and large scale cloud cavity are the important sources of large disturbances from time to time such as rarefaction wave and shock wave experiments by ganesh et al 2016 using x ray densitometry measurement in a convergent divergent channel shows that when the shock wave front impinges on the flow at the wedge apex the attached cavity sheet will break up and following a large cavity cloud is pinched off which is deemed as the shock wave propagation induced cloud cavity shedding mechanism swm the physics involved in the cloud cavitating flows in particular the coherent interactions between the shock wave dynamics and cavity structure are the important and challenging problem requiring intensive and extensive investigations the re entrant jet phenomenon and its role in the cavitation instabilities have been studied by several researchers foeth et al 2008 wang et al 2015 pelz et al 2017 liu et al 2017 2018 gopalan and katz 2000 applied the particle image velocimetry piv and high speed photography to measure the flow structures at the closure region and downstream of sheet cavity they found that the re entrant jet develops when the cavity closes at the region of strong adverse pressure callenaere et al 2001 carried out systematic experiments to study cavitation instabilities on a diverging step and mapped the flow regimes with no shedding periodic re entrant jet with no shedding and re entrant jet induced periodic shedding they identified the importance of adverse pressure gradient on the development of re entrant jet and thus periodic shedding on the other hand the pressure pulses measurement in cavitating flows indicates the possibility of the shock wave within cavitation region reisman 1996 experimentally investigated the pressure pulses emitted in the cavitaing flows using high speed video and unsteady pressure transducers they found that the pressure pulses were closely related with the sharp void fraction reduction phenomena which was just caused by the collapse of the cavity cluster pressure pulses in cavitating flows have also be captured by leroux et al 2004 on a naca66 mod hydrofoil arndt et al 2001 investigated the complex physics involved in the sheet cavitation and the transition to cloud cavitation around a naca0015 hydrofoil using a combined experimental numerical approach they mapped the cavitating flow patterns within the l c σ 2α plane and concluded that at high values of σ 2α the re entrant jet mechanism dominates the cavity shedding process and at low values of σ 2α the bubbly shock propagation mechanism dominates leroux et al 2005 employed a joint experimental and numerical method to investigate the partial cavity instabilities they experimentally observed two partial cavity instabilities with one characterized by higher strouhal number 0 3 and the other lower strouhal number 0 07 0 09 detailed study indicated that different from the re entrant jet mechanism in high strouhal number conditions the cavity dynamics with lower strouhal number is dominated by cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave formation and propagation li et al 2008 applied the high speed visualization and particle image velocity piv methods to investigate the multiphase structures in supercavitating flows around a tulin hydrofoil they observed the water vapor interface propagation phenomena within the supercavity and sharp change of vapor fraction distribution and strong momentum transfer exist at the moving water vapor interface recently ganesh et al 2016 conducted experiments to investigate the physical mechanisms involved in the transition from sheet to cloud cavitation by applying the high speed video and time resolved x ray densitometry in a venturi section the results showed that in the condition of the intermittent shedding process of smaller scale cavities a re circulating flow dominates and in the condition of the large scale cloud periodic shedding the bubbly shock propagation dominates the numerical simulation of cavitating flows can be mainly divided into two categories incompressible methodology and compressible methodology most research huang et al 2013 2014 ji et al 2014 2016 yu et al 2017 long et al 2017 chen et al 2017 has been proposed in the incompressible methodology scope which assumes the constant density for both liquid and vapor due to acceptable results at certain level however the accurate modeling of these complex unsteady multiphase flows poses some challenging problems that have just begun to be addressed such as wave dynamics in cavitating flows considering the physically high compressibility and the close relationship between shock wave phenomena and acoustic characteristics in the liquid vapor mixture it is required to adopt the compressible cavitation simulation methodology kunz et al 2001 zhang and khoo 2014 budich et al 2018 wang et al 2018a b in the compressible cavitation simulation there are mainly two methods namely barotropic state equation liu et al 2004 decaix and goncalvès 2012 and transport equation method based on the compressible governing equations due to the barotropic characteristics of the state equation the baroclinic torque which is important in the vorticity generation and modification in the cavitation region gopalan and katz 2000 wang et al 2019 is ignored considering that the cavitation region is characterized by multi scale vortex structures the barotropic equation state method cannot accurately predict the unsteady dynamics of cavitating flows the transport equation method has been adopted mostly venkateswaran et al 2002 developed a preconditioned time marching algorithm considering the finite acoustic speeds in the constituent phases for the computation of multiphase mixture flows the results showed that both the compressible and incompressible methods can predict the time averaged flow features well while the compressible method has better performance in capturing the unsteady characteristics saito et al 2007 solved the compressible two phase navier stokes equations to investigate the unsteady behaviors of cloud cavitation around a naca 0015 hydrofoil they found the u shape cloud cavities dynamics were well simulated by the compressible solver schnerr et al 2008 developed the compressible three dimensional multiphase simulation method with phase change to investigate cloud cavitation dynamics especially the cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave dynamics the results showed that the compressibility effects significantly influence the cloud cavity dynamics a maximum pressure pulse up to 230 bar was captured during the cavity cloud collapse gnanaskandan and mahesh 2016 developed a predictor corrector approach for compressible cavitating flows simulation on the unstructured grids a good agreement with experiments data was demonstrated and the pressure wave was also captured by the compressible method egerer et al 2016 developed the compressible multiphase flow approach based on implicit subgrid scale model using four cell stencil the single bubble collapse bubble cloud collapse and the cavitating turbulent mixing layer are effectively simulated and the code is well validated however the cavitating flow compressibility and wave dynamics are not fully discussed and investigated openfoam is an open source software platform and has the cavitating flow solver based on transport equation cavitation model in the frame work of incompressible two phase model in recent years many researchers have employed openfoam to simulate cavitating flows bensow and bark 2010a b park and rhee 2015 shang et al 2012 victor et al 2015 yu et al 2017 based on the native incompressible cavitation solver to account for the wave dynamics within the cavitating flows developing compressible cavitation solver on the openfoam platform becomes necessary arabnejad et al 2016 implemented a density based compressible solver with equilibrium

al 2018a b implemented the phase change algorithm into the native compressible two phase flow solver in openfoam achieving the simulation of cavitating flow considering the compressibility of both water and vapor and accurately capture of wave dynamics in cavitating flows the numerical results of cavitating flows around a naca66 mod hydrofoil show that the implemented compressible cavitation solver predicts the cloud cavity collapse shock wave dynamics well in the present work the physics involved in the two distinct cavity cloud shedding mechanisms namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm are numerically investigated the simulation is conducted using a compressible cavitating flow solver implemented on the open source software openfoam platform wang et al 2018a

turbulence 2 4 solution procedure and discretization in the present study openfoam 4 0 x is used to solve the compressible cavitating flow governing equations openfoam is a set of open source c libraries jasak 1996 released under the gnu public license gpl the spatial discretization is performed using a cell centered co located finite volume method fvm with arbitrary cell shapes and a multi step scheme is used for the time derivatives the compressible cavitation solver is developed by implementing the phase change algorithm into the supplied compressible two phase flow solver miller et al 2013 to simulate cavitating flows with the compressibility of both water and vapor considered wang et al 2018a b it is worth nothing that in openfoam a interface compressed vof method is adopted to accurately predict the interface positions weller 2008 the cavitation solver algorithm is shown in fig 1 the piso algorithm is used to solve the coupling between the velocity and pressure a first order implicit time scheme euler is used for time discretization which has both the robustness and acceptable prediction abilities coutier delgosha et al 2002 zamansky and ham 2013 yakubov et al 2015 and a second order scheme is used for advective terms the time step is set fixed and small enough to ensure a maximum courant number to be less than 0 4 in the whole computational domain for cavitation simulation 3 numerical setup and validation in this paper a two dimensional foil of the naca series naca66 investigated by leroux et al 2005 is selected the geometry coordinates of the foil can be found in the reference leroux et al 2004 2005 more detailed description of the experiment configuration can be found in the references leroux et al 2004 2005 where two partial cavitation instabilities at α 6 and 8 respectively were observed and investigated the hydrofoil was instrumented with 10 pressure transducers along the foil chord on the suction side from x c 0 10 with a step of 0 10c to x c 0 90 and at x c 0 05 at the foil leading edge the simulations are performed using the implemented compressible cavitation solver wang et al 2018a b based on the open source software openfoam to solve the compressible navier stokes equations the computations are conducted using a 3d domain and the computation domain and the boundary conditions are given according to the experiment setup leroux et al 2004 2005 as shown in fig 2 the inlet is located about 2c upstream of the foil and outlet is located 6c downstream of the foil as shown in fig 2 a the foil chord length is c 0 150 m and width is d 0 192 m the relative maximum thickness is τ 12 at 45 c from the foil leading edge le and the relative maximum chamber is 2 at 50 c from foil the leading edge le as show in fig 2 b to reduce the computation cost the spanwise length is chosen as 0 3c instead of the real spanwise size of the experiment hydrofoil the same domain treatment as sagaut 2002 and ji et al 2015 considering that shock wave phenomenon is important for the cavitation dynamics as observed in the experiments by leroux et al 2004 the boundary conditions must be set up to satisfy the shock wave dynamics and its propagation to avoid the pressure wave reflection at the inlet and outlet boundaries and thus disturb the flow fields the non reflect boundary conditions are used for both inlet and outlet boundaries a non slip boundary condition is imposed on the hydrofoil surface top and bottom tunnel boundaries and symmetry boundaries on the front and back of the domain bensow 2011 to treat the turbulence structures near the walls kqrwallfunction wall model is used for turbulence kinematic k and nutkwallfunction wall model is used for turbulence viscosity μ t at wall boundaries the first order implicit bounded euler scheme is for time discretization and second order gauss linear upwind scheme for spatial discretization the hydrofoil was fixed at angle of attack aoa 6 or aoa 8 with the inlet velocity set as u 5 33 m s for all cases it should be noted that in the experiment the cavitation number is based on the inlet pressure while in the simulation the pressure at outlet boundary is determined and in the simulation the outlet pressure is alternated according to the cavitation number to ensure the inlet pressure at the experiment level leroux et al 2004 in the present study the influences of both mesh and time step are performed by monitoring the pressure coefficient and cavity cloud shedding frequency the main non dimensional parameters used are defined as s t f c u c p p ρ u 2 re u c ν and σ p p v 0 5 ρ u 2 where u is the inlet velocity c is the foil chord and d is the hydrofoil width the structured hexahedral mesh is used in the present simulation the grid generation is according to the previous study by ji et al 2015 in the x and y directions mesh are generated with sufficient refinement near the foil surface and downstream the hydrofoil where cavitation develops as shown in fig 3 a and 3 d view of the mesh details near the foil surface are shown in fig 3 b and the value of y at the first grid point within 1 2 on all the wall boundaries including hydrofoil up and down tunnel walls where the mesh resolution satisfies completely the requirement of the present hybrid rans les sst sas turbulence model bensow 2011 asnaghi et al 2018 ghahramani et al 2019 then the influence of spanwise nodes is performed with node number of 30 60 80 and 90 respectively considering the unsteady characteristics of cloud cavitating flows the frequency and strouhal number is important in the simulation accuracy the validation test simulation is conducted at the condition of α 6 σ 1 25 leroux et al 2004 which is characterized by alternate interactions of re entrant jet dynamics and shock wave dynamics four sets of computational meshes are firstly tested with the elements ranging from 977 500 to 281 2500 as shown in table 1 the power spectral density distribution of cavity volume is also shown in fig 3 it is indicated that the differences between the fine meshes of 2 500 000 and 2 812 500 can be neglected consequently along the foil spanwise direction 80 nodes distributed uniformly are used in the present simulation unsteady sheet cloud cavitating flows experience strong instabilities and to address the real transient behaviors of cloud cavitation flows the time step is set to keep the maximum courant number maxco below 0 4 in the whole computation domain which can ensure high computation accuracy according to the requirements of mules algorithm used in openfoam in the present study δt 1 10 5 s is used where as a results the maxco in the whole flow field is below 0 4 and furthermore this value is below the value t ref 200 1 41 10 4 t ref c u where u is the free stream velocity at the inlet as suggested by coutier delgosha et al 2003 which is derived based on flow physics the coutier delgosha s criterion about time step used form 2d simulation and since this value is derived from flow physics it can also guide our 3d simulation work it should be noted that the simulation of shock wave always requires very short time step even to nanosecond order schnerr et al 2008 in the cavitating flows the sonic speed within the cavitation region is relatively smaller than that in the pure liquid and vapor region and the time scale of shock wave propagation in cavitation region is in the convective scale o 100 and thus the present time step is able to address shock wave cavity interactions and also to capture the shock wave propagation in pure liquid upstream and downstream of the foil o 10 3 to reduce the simulation iteration error the solver tolerance for pressure and velocity residual convergence criterion in each iteration is set equal to 10 12 which has been used by asnaghi et al 2017 2018 in the simulation 60t ref are performed according to coutier delgosha et al 2003 where t ref is a reference time corresponding to the time required for the flow to pass through the foil length c 0 15 m with the speed u 5 33 m s 60t ref of simulation equals to 1 7s which is sufficient to resolve the cavitation characteristics during the data processing the data after 0 1s is used to show the performance of the chosen mesh in predicting the dynamics of cavitation the comparisons of experimentally measured and numerically predicted psd of pressure fluctuations with different meshes at x c 0 7 are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that good agreement between the predicted and measured psd contents of pressure evolution on the foil suction side at x c 0 7 is obtained it is observed that different meshes can predict both the spectral content of the cavitation induced pressure signals with little differences in dominant frequency and the chosen mesh is fine enough to predict the cavitation frequency furthermore it is suggested that the pressure spectrum in inertial subrange follows theoretically the batchelor s 7 3 power law batchelor 1951 fig 5 presents the monitored inlet pressure evolution and its psd distribution obtained by fast fourier transfer fft in several cavitation shedding cycles in the case of σ 1 25 α 6 the slop of the lines in the inertial subrange were measured to be equal to 7 3 indicating the accuracy of the present result 4 results and discussion the cloud cavitating flows under both the re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm around a naca66 mod hydrofoil is investigated numerically the comparisons of numerically predicted cavity evolution frequency with that experimentally measured by leroux et al 2005 are shown in fig 6 at u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 in the experiments by leroux et al 2005 the transient cavity behaviors is characterized by very low cavity shedding cycle ranging between 3 4 and 3 5 hz when the angle of attack is below 7 5 which is different from that at the angle of attack 8 indicating different cavity dynamics it can be found that the present numerical method predicts the cavity shedding frequency characteristics well in the present study the angle of attack aoa 6 and 8 are selected for the detailed discussion on the cavity dynamics of compressible cavitating flow involved in the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm respectively sec 4 1 is devoted to investigate the dynamics associated with shock wave propagation characterized by low cavity shedding frequency at the angle of attack 6 aoa 6 σ 1 0 sec 4 2 presents the cavity mechanism associated with the re entrant jet dynamics at the angle of attack 8 aoa 8 σ 1 28 and following in sec 4 3 some comparisons of flow characteristics between the two distinct cavity shedding dynamics are conducted 4 1 shock wave dominated cavity shedding mechanism aoa 6 swm in this section the shock wave dynamics dominated cavitation instabilities is investigated firstly where the cavity behaviors are characterized by periodic large scale vapor cloud shedding collapse and shock wave emission and propagation the cloud cavity shedding process along with cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave dynamics is investigated compared with experiment data leroux et al 2005 the cavity length predicted by the present compressible method is 0 78c with relative error 4 0 the dominant frequency of cavitation evolution is estimated to be 3 611 hz with relative error 3 17 and the strouhal number based on the foil chord length c is 0 102 with relative error 4 08 fig 7 shows the numerically predicted vapor fraction isosurface with absolute pressure on foil surface and symmetry plane during approximately one cavitation cycle at α 6 σ 1 00 u 5 33 m s to show the evolution of flow structures well the temporal spatial maps x t map of vapor fraction pressure coefficient c p c p p 0 5ρu 2 normalized streamwise velocity u x u and pressure gradient during one and a quarter cavity cycles are shown in fig 9 respectively the monitor positions used in fig 9 are shown in fig 8 which are 1 mm above the foil surface on suction side and extending downstream to 1 5c the detailed descriptions of cavitation evolution are discussed in the following the unsteady cavity presents quasi periodic behaviors the cavitation evolution can be divided into four stages 1 the attached cavity growth stage ãc 2 the re entrant jet development and attached cavity sheet breakup stage d 3 the cloud cavity shedding stage e and 4 the cloud cavity collapse stage f during the first stage at the beginning the attached cavity sheet forms at the foil leading edge as shown in fig 7 a with the attached cavity growth the length and thickness of the attached cavity sheet increase as shown by the transient cavity behaviors in fig 7 b c and vapor fraction evolution in x t map in fig 9 a during the second stage combined with the x t map of velocity u x u it can be found that the attached cavitation region in liquid vapor mixtures consists of a reverse flow region shown in fig 9 c and a high adverse pressure gradient region in fig 9 d when the attached cavity sheet grows to a certain length about 0 8c as shown in fig 9 c the reverse flow will be strong enough and re entrant jet generates at the rear part of the attached cavity sheet as indicated by the red arrow in fig 9 c combined with the water vapor fraction in fig 9 a it can be found that low vapor fraction exists in re entrant jet region showing that the re entrant jet mainly consists of pure liquid from the cavity behaviors in fig 7 d it can be observed that with the development of re entrant jet the cavity interface along the re entrant jet boundaries beneath the attached cavity sheet becomes unsteady when the re entrant jet arrives at the sheet cavity leading edge the interactions between the re entrant jet and cavity interface will cause the cavity breakup as shown in fig 7 d following during the third stage the residual broken cavity sheet will be rolled up under the convection of the main flow and shed downstream as a large scale cavity cloud as shown in fig 7 e which can also be seen in fig 9 a during the fourth stage when the large scale cavity cloud is transported into high pressure region downstream the high pressure differences between the cavity and liquid will cause the abrupt cavity collapse with shock wave emission as shown in fig 7 f it can be observed that the cavity cloud collapses before the instance at t t 0 0 77t ref combined with the pressure coefficient in x t map it can be found that after the cavity cloud collapses high pressure is generated and propagates to even the foil leading edge as shown in fig 9 b which is believed to be cavity collapse shock wave phenomenon following shock wave rebound phenomena is captured with the shock wave strength decrease in the next the physical mechanisms involved in the unsteady cavitating flows with emphasis on the compressibility characteristics and cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave emission and propagation process will be studied in detail shock wave dynamics is closely related to the compressibility characteristics which provide the required conditions for the shock wave formation to further investigate the physics involved in the shock wave dominated cavity cloud shedding process the acoustics characteristics including sound speed and mach number distributions in the transient cavitating flows are studied according to wallis equation the definition of sound speed and mach number in liquid vapor mixture is as follows 17 1 ρ c 2 α v ρ v t c v 2 1 α v ρ l t c l 2 18 c v d p d ρ r g t 19 c l d p d ρ p l s a t b n ρ l t ρ l t ρ l s a t n 20 m a u 2 v 2 w 2 c where the density variances of both liquid and vapor are considered to take into effects of compressibility on cavitation acoustics and the temperature variance effects are also considered the vapor fraction mass transfer sonic speed and mach number distributions which illustrate the compressibility characteristics of cavitation during four typical cavity evolution processes namely the attached cavity sheet growth the attached cavity breakup the cavity cloud shedding and the shock wave propagation are presented in fig 10 respectively the sonic speed lines are outlined to show both the subsonic and supersonic regions and water vapor fraction α v 0 001 and 0 1 are marked to show the low void fraction regions the reverse flow regions identified by u x 0 are illustrated in the attached cavity sheet growth process at t t 0 0 15t ref the cavity sheet length is about 0 55c and the cavity tightly attaches to the foil suction side as shown in fig 10 a the vapor fraction distribution presents low values at the cavity boundaries which mainly consists of vapor liquid interfaces and high values inside the attached cavity sheet the high void fraction region within the attached cavity is mainly low mass transfer and high sonic speed region it can be found that along the interface of reverse flow region low mass transfer high sonic speed and low mach number are seen high mass transfer rate appears at the cavity leading edge and trailing edge as indicated in fig 10 a considering that the cavity sheet continuously grows the mass transfer rate at the rear part of the cavity is higher than that at the leading edge the supersonic flow region mainly distributes along the cavity interface where weak mass transfer rates and low void fraction are found in low void fraction region between α v 0 001 0 01 although the sonic speed is high the mach number is this low void fraction region is relatively high in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 41t ref the cavity is characterized by the broken cavity sheet at the front part and the rolling up of the cavity sheet at the rear part abrupt mass transfer takes place in both the front part where cavity breaks up and the front and rear part of the rolling up cavity cloud low sonic speed and high mach number mainly appear in the cavity cloud which is in the rear part of the broken attached cavity sheet as shown in fig 10 b in supersonic flow region weak mass transfer rates are found as shown in fig 10 b in low void fraction regions between α v 0 001 0 01 high sonic speed and high mach number are observed along the boundaries of the reverse flow region high sonic speed and low mach number are found in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 53t ref the cavity behavior is characterized by large scale cavity cloud being shed downstream as shown in fig 10 c in this process abrupt mass transfer takes place in the outer part of the cavity cloud while in the inner part weak mass transfer rates are found showing that cavity cloud collapse from outer part to inner part the cavity cloud is characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number in the outer part which provides the condition for the shock wave formation much higher mass transfer exists at the front and rear part of the shedding cavity cloud indicating that the cloud collapse is not symmetric low void fraction is seen beneath the cavity cloud in the cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave propagation process at t t 0 0 77t ref it can be found that the cavity totally collapses and thus mass transfer takes place just near the foil surface and at foil wakes owing to the very low vapor fraction in the flow field the sonic speed is relatively high and mach number is small as shown in fig 10 d mass transfer mainly takes place at foil wakes at the foil wakes owing to the existence of low void fraction lower sonic speed and higher mach number is seen based on the analysis it can be concluded that in addition to the vapor fraction the mass transfer rate can highly effects the compressibility effects in cavitating flows the complex interactions between void fraction mass transfer sonic speed and mach number could significantly the acoustics characteristics in transient cavitating flows to further study compressible characteristics within cavitation region fig 11 shows the sonic speed contours on foil mid section plane at the instances in fig 10 seven contour lines are presented for 1 α v 0 1 2 α v 0 0 01 3 α v 0 001 4 α v 0 0001 5 α v 0 00001 6 α v 0 000001 7 α v 0 0000001 which represent the sonic speed c 5 87604 17 7158 55 734 175 058 521 775 1134 48 and 1432 43 as indicated by the band numbers 1 7 in fig 11 b respectively the α v 0 1 line sketches the contours of the cavity region as also shown in fig 10 it can be seen that low void fraction outside the cavity interface indicated by α v 0 1 is much larger and significantly alter the acoustics in foil wakes and outside the cavity interface where sound speed experiences large variance from 0 to 10 m s in cavitation liquid vapor mixtures to 1450 m s in pure liquid region it can be found that there exists a transitional region between the cavitation region where the sonic speed is only 0 10 m s and pour liquid where the sonic speed is about 1450 m s and the size of the transitional region is in the order of the cavity thickness the transitional region defined as the sonic speed boundary layer indicates that low sonic speed region is far larger than the cavitation region it can be indicated that when the cavity cloud collapses the emitted shock wave propagation has a buffer region to reduce the propagation speed from about 1450 m s to 0 10 m s to arrive at the cavitation region in the attached cavity sheet growth process at t t 0 0 15t ref in fig 11 a the cavity sheet attaches to the foil suction side it can be found that the low sonic speed region extends from the cavity sheet region to that in the bulk flow region and also the cavity sheet wake and the foil wake regions the thickness of the transition region is nearly the same as the cavity sheet thickness in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 41t ref compared with that in the cavity sheet growth process the cavity sheet thickness increases and the cavity sheet wake region enlarges as shown in fig 11 b the cavity wake and the foil wake begins to interact with each other in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 53t ref strong interactions between the shedding cavity cloud wake and the foil wake exist the low sonic speed region even enlarges with the size of the cavity cloud increase as shown in fig 11 c in the shock wave propagation process at t t 0 0 77t ref low sonic speed appears in the cavity cloud collapse region and the size of the low sonic speed region is larger than before during the cavity cloud shedding process as shown in fig 11 d indicating that the cavity cloud collapse will highly influence the wake compressibility characteristics the minimum sonic speed and maximum mach number in the flow fields are shown in table 2 it can be concluded that during the attached cavity sheet growth and the breakup process and the cavity cloud shedding and collapse process the minimum sonic speed is below 10 m s and the maximum mach number can be above 1 indicating supersonic flows in attached cavity growth re entrant jet development and cavity cloud shedding process compared with that in the re entrant jet development process the mach number is smaller in the shock wave propagation process where cavity is fully collapsed and low void fraction is found in the flow field considering that the sonic boundary layer plays an important role in acoustics exchange between compressible cavitation region and outside incompressible liquid region more details on sonic boundary layer should be conducted 4 2 re entrant jet dominated cavity shedding mechanism aoa 8 rjm the cavity cloud shedding mechanism dominated by re entrant jet is investigated in this section fig 12 shows the time evolution of the numerically predicted vapor fraction isosurface with the pressure contour on the foil surface and the symmetry plane during one cavity shedding cycle the flow direction is from right to left as indicated by the red arrow in fig 12 a the isosurface of u x u 0 is also shown in fig 12 to indicate the reverse flow region to better illustrate the unsteady cavitation evolution process the temporal spatial map of vapor fraction pressure coefficient normalized streamwise velocity u x u and absolute pressure gradient during one and a quarter cycles are presented in fig 13 respectively the dash vertical lines in fig 13 indicate the instances in fig 12 compared with experiment data leroux et al 2005 the cavity length predicted by the present compressible method is 0 8c with relative error 6 7 the dominant frequency of cavitation evolution is estimated to be 18 621 hz with relative error 3 45 compared to the experiment data leroux et al 2005 and the strouhal number based on foil chord length c is 0 524 with relative error 3 35 following the unsteady cavity behaviors will be discussed in detail different from that in the shock wave propagation dominated cloud cavitation shedding mechanism swm at angle of attack 6 the cavitation evolution at the angle of attack 8 is dominated by re entrant jet dynamics rjm where no cavity cloud collapse induced shock wave propagation process is observed the cavitation evolution can be divided into three stages 1 the attached cavity growth stage a b f 2 the re entrant jet development and attached cavity sheet breakup stage c d and 3 the cloud cavity shedding stage e firstly the attached cavity sheet grows near the foil leading edge and continuously extends downstream as shown in both the numerically predicted results in fig 12 and the experimental observations by leroux et al 2005 when the attached cavity length arrives at certain length the re entrant jet generates at the rear of the sheet cavity as shown in fig 12 b combined with the pressure gradient evolution in fig 13 d it can be concluded that during the re entrant jet development high negative adverse pressure gradient exists in the attached cavity sheet region the research callenaere et al 2001 pelz et al 2017 on re entrant jet dynamics has been conducted and mainly attributes the formation of re entrant jet to high adverse pressure gradient at the closure region of the cavity sheet as illustrated in fig 13 c it can be found that with the re entrant jet development the magnitude of reverse velocity decreases along its moving path showing that the re entrant jet strength attenuates considering that the re entrant jet consists of mainly liquid it will carry the liquid into the local cavity and lift up the relatively thin attached cavity sheet resulting in the vapor fraction decrease as indicated in fig 13 a at the same time the pressure on the foil suction side increases as shown in fig 13 b it should be noted that from the numerical results the large scale cavity cloud collapse will influence the new attached cavity sheet growth with the attached cavity sheet length decreases during the cavity cloud collapse as shown in figs 12 f and fig 13 a the detailed study on the large cloud cavity collapse process will be presented below to investigate the compressible characteristics in the re entrant jet dominated cloud cavity shedding mechanism rjm fig 14 presents the vapor fraction mass transfer sonic speed and mach number contours at three typical cavitation evolution instances namely the re entrant jet development the attached cavity breakup and the cavity cloud shedding in the process which attached cavity grows re entrant jet develops and cavity cloud sheds downstream respectively in the re entrant jet development process at t t 0 0 40t ref an attached cavity sheet attaches tightly to the foil suction side as shown in fig 14 a low vapor fraction can be found in cavitation region near the foil surface where the re entrant jet develops from the mass transfer contour it can be found that the large mass transfer rate mainly occurs across the cavity liquid interface the cavity rear and front part where the vapor fraction is relatively low it is known that the vapor liquid mixture can experience an abrupt sonic speed reduction to even several meters per second shamsborhan et al 2010 and thus the cavitation region is highly compressible from the sonic speed contour it can be seen that the sonic speed distribution is characterized by the high value in the core of the attached cavity sheet where high vapor fraction exists and low value at the vapor liquid interface where relatively low vapor fraction and abrupt phase change exist the high mach number appears at the vapor liquid interface and in supersonic region along the cavity liquid interface weak mass transfer rate can be found the reverse flow region is also characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number along the boundaries of the reverse flow region low void fraction weak mass transfer rate and low mach number are observed in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 60t ref the front part of the cavity near the foil nose is broken and the residual cavity begins to be rolled up the rear part of the cavity is not so dense with low void fraction abrupt phase change takes places at the cavity breakup region and along the vapor liquid interface of the shedding cavity cloud low sonic speed and high mach number distribute in the rear part of the cavity especially the vapor liquid interface it can be found that within the inner part of the rolling cavity cloud high void fraction low mass transfer rate high sonic speed and low mach number can be seen while the outer part of the cavity cloud is characterized by high mass transfer rate supersonic region exist in the outer part of the cavity cloud low void fraction region along the cavity liquid interface and at foil wakes is characterized by high sonic speed and high mach number in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 86t ref cavity cloud is shed downstream and new attached cavity sheet begins to grow large mass transfer rate takes place within the attached cavity sheet region at the foil leading edge and the shedding cavity cloud at foil wakes cavity cloud is characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number high mach number is also seen in the low void fraction region along the cavity cloud interface where the sonic speed is relatively high from above it can be found that the vapor fraction and mass transfer have great effects on cavitation compressibility characteristics moreover to quantitatively measure the compressibility in cavitating flows the minimum sonic speed and maximum mach number at these typical cavitation flow fields are shown in table 3 it can be concluded that accompanying with the attached cavity sheet breakup and cavity cloud shedding the minimum sonic speed keeps almost constant while the maximum mach number increases indicating the compressibility in the flow increases the maximum mach number in the field exceeds sonic speed showing the supersonic state within cavitation region considering that sonic speed is an essential parameter for the disturbance propagation the sonic characteristics in cavitating flows are studied fig 15 shows the sonic speed contours on foil mid section planes at the instances in fig 14 the region outlined by these contours lines can be shown and the sonic speed distributions vary from several meters per second in cavitation region to thousand meters per second in pure water which is defined as sonic speed boundary layer compared with the vapor fraction contour in fig 14 it can be found that the α v 0 1 line sketches the contours of the cavity region the sonic speed gradually increases from low sonic speed in cavitation region to pure liquid sonic speed outside the cavity and the size of the buffer region sonic speed boundary is in the order of the cavity in the re entrant jet development process at t t 0 0 40t ref the cavity sheet attaches to the foil suction side and re entrant jet beneath the attached cavity sheet is moving upstream the low sonic speed region distributes mainly around the cavity sheet and the foil wake the sonic speed buffer region from 1450 m s to 0 10 m s is about the cavity sheet thickness as shown in fig 15 a the re entrant jet region is also a low sonic speed region which is caused by the vapor entrained by the re entrant jet in the attached cavity sheet breakup process at t t 0 0 60t ref the residual cavity sheet begins to be rolled up and the sonic speed transition region enlarges in the cavity sheet region and foil wakes as shown in fig 15 b in the cavity cloud shedding process at t t 0 0 86t ref the cavity cloud is transported into the foil trailing edge and the sonic speed transition region further enlarges at foil wakes as presented in fig 15 c the foil cavity wakes and the cavity cloud region closely interact indicating the high compressibility effects region increases in addition a thin layer of low sonic speed region is observed on the foil suction side around the newly growing attached cavity sheet at the foil leading edge 4 3 comparisons of flow characteristics under rjm and swm to better understand the unsteady flow characteristics involved in the re entrant jet dominated cavity shedding mechanism rjm and the shock wave mechanism swm fig 16 presents the time evolution of cavity volume v c cavity volume rate v c d v c dt and v c d v c 2 dt 2 for a α 8 σ 1 28 u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 and at b α 6 σ 1 00 u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 respectively the open symbols indicate the instances in figs 7 and 12 respectively the schematic of typical cavity patterns is also inserted in fig 16 to illustrate the unsteady cavity behaviors it can be observed that the two distinct cavity shedding processes under rjm and swm show different flow characteristics the cavity volume and volume rate evolution presents quasi periodic characteristics following more detailed discussions in the two distinct cavity cloud shedding mechanisms will be given table 4 lists the period characteristics of cavity volume increase t increase t ref which shows the cavity growth rate and cavity decrease t decrease t ref which shows the cavity collapse rate in cavity cycles it can be illustrated that the average period of cavity volume increase in rjm is smaller than that of cavity volume decrease while in swm the period of cavity volume increase is larger than that of the cavity volume decreases indicating the strength of cavity collapse in swm is stronger than that in rjm in re entrant jet mechanism rjm as shown in fig 16 a during the attached cavity growth stage a d f the cavity volume increases with the cavity volume rate v c continuously increase it can be found that the cavity volume rate v c keeps almost constant in this stage with a bit of fluctuations during the re entrant jet development stage c d the cavity volume reaches its maximum value and then decreases while the cavity volume rate experiences an abrupt reduction to a minus value as marked by blue circles in fig 16 a indicating the global condensation rate in the flow field larger than the evaporation rate in this process the cavity volume rate v c fluctuations increase during the cavity cloud shedding stage e cavity cloud will collapse when transported into high pressure region downstream and the cavity volume decreases sharply and the cavity volume rate both v c and v c experiences huge fluctuations in the unsteady cavitating flows dominated by re entrant jet dynamics the period occupied by cavity volume increases is about 0 4t ref while by cavity volume decrease 0 6t ref in the shock wave mechanism swm as shown in fig 16 b in the process of attached cavity growth ãc the cavity volume increases and the cavity volume rate v c continuously increases compared to the rjm v c in swm is a bit slower and furthermore cavity volume rate v c fluctuations is smaller in the process of re entrant jet development d cavity volume reaches its maximum value and during the interactions between the re entrant jet and the attached cavity on the foil suction side the cavity volume rate drops sharply to zero as indicated by blue circles at the same time cavity volume rate v c experiences an increasing fluctuation following during the cavity cloud shedding process the cavity volume continuously decreases while the cavity volume rate v c experiences an increase when the cavity cloud being shed to high pressure region the abrupt cavity collapse will generate shock wave following which the rebound process begins in this stage the cavity volume decreases to its minimum value in a short period the cavity volume rate of both v c and v c experiences a large fluctuations in the shock wave propagation process as shown in fig 16 b compared with that during the cavity cloud collapse in rjm the cavity volume rate is much higher in swm the period of cavity volume increases is about 0 6t ref while the period of cavity volume decrease 0 4t ref as the cavity volume fluctuations is highly related with cavitation instabilities ji et al 2015 chen et al 2015 it can be indicated that shock wave phenomena is an important source of cavitation instabilities to study the compressibility characteristics in the two distinct cavity shedding process the time evolution of maximum mach number mamax in the flow field during one cavity shedding cycle is presented in fig 17 it should be noted that the present averaged process is based on one typical cavity cycle and considering the good periodicity this processing can present the characteristics in a reasonable level the average value ave and standard deviation std of maximum mach number mamax in the flow field during the selected cavity cycle are also shown it can be found that the maximum mach number mamax in both the re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm are above unit indicating the supersonic state in the cavitating flows both the average value and standard derivation of maximum mach number mamax in rjm are higher than that in swm it can be observed that in rjm during the re entrant jet development stage the maximum mach number drops a lot and experiences huge fluctuations the in deep relationship between the local mach number evolution and the cavity shedding mechanism is still an open problem it is supposed that supersonic flow in0 56 the cavitation region presents the condition required for the multiphase shock wave generation the cavity collapse induced shock wave formation is regarded as the cavity collapse characteristics however the interactions between the supersonic flow and the cavity collapse process are still needed to be further discussed to further investigate the compressibility characteristics in the two distinct cloud cavitation mechanisms the time averaged sonic speed and mach number distribution during the selected cavity cycle is presented in fig 18 it can be found that the time averaged sonic speed distributes mainly along the foil surface on foil suction side compared with that in rjm the thickness of low sonic speed region is relatively large in swm the time averaged mach number in rjm is higher than that in swm it can be illustrated that the high mach number distributes along the cavity interface and maximum mach number appears at the foil leading edge to better illustrate the physical mechanisms in the large scale cavity cloud collapse process in the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms rjm and swm fig 19 gives time evolution of pressure signals on foil suction side at x c 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 along with the transient cavity structures with vapor fraction isofurface α v 0 15 at four instances during the large scale cavity cloud collapse process for a re entrant jet mechanism condition and b shock wave mechanism condition it can be found that under the condition of re entrant jet dominated cavity cloud shedding mechanism rjm as shown in fig 19 a the shedding cavity cloud collapse will cause high pressure fluctuations at x c 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 however the pressure signals at x c 0 2 keeps almost constant indicating the collapse induced high pressure fluctuations attenuates fast and does not influence the flow field a the foil leading edge combined with the cavity structures it can be found that with the cavity cloud being shed the new attached cavity sheet begins to grow in the process of the cavity cloud collapse cloud collapsed induced high pressure can be observed while this high pressure does not impact attached cavity sheet at the foil leading edge a lot different from that in the re entrant jet mechanism condition the cloud cavity collapse process in the shock wave mechanism condition is governed by the shock wave dynamics as shown in fig 19 b combined with the pressure coefficient evolution and the corresponding vapor fraction isosurface it can be found that the cavity cloud collapse will induce high pressure in the field and the shock wave propagation on the foil will cause the attached cavity sheet collapse as shown in fig 19 b2 the shedding cavity cloud takes the topology of the u shape structure the u shape cavity cloud head collapse first as shown in fig 19 b2 and then the u shape cavity cloud legs when the cavity cloud totally collapses shock wave is emitted originating from the collapse position the magnitude of the pressure coefficient can reach up to 4 as shown in fig 19 b following shock wave rebound phenomena is captured as shown in fig 19 b3 and b4 it can be concluded that shock wave propagation and rebound process has a great role in cavitation dynamics which can inhibit the new attached cavity sheet growth and thus results in the cavity evolution cycle increase fig 20 shows the attenuation rate of shock wave defined as p 1 p 2 δt during its propagation and rebound it can be seen that the shock wave attenuation quickly during its rebound process 5 conclusions the purpose of the paper is to investigate the physics involved in the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms namely re entrant jet mechanism rjm and shock wave mechanism swm considering that the shock wave dynamics is closely related with compressibility a compressible cavitating flow solver developed on the open source software openfoam platform is applied to account for the compressibility and thus to solve the wave dynamics in the cavitating flows the compressible navier stokes equations along with the energy equation closed by the thermodynamic equations of state of both liquid and vapor are solved the saito cavitation model is applied to account for the transient mass transfer between liquid and vapor and the sst sas turbulence model adopting the von karman length scale as the transition function between rans and les is used to model the cavitating turbulence effects two cloud cavity shedding mechanisms are carefully analyzed around a naca66 mod hydrofoil fixed at α 8 σ 1 28 σ 2 α α 0 3 529 and α 6 σ 1 00 σ 2 α α 0 3 431 respectively at u 5 33 m s re 0 8 106 the main findings are as the following 1 the re entrant jet mechanism rjm is characterized by the periodic formation and development of re entrant jet and the attached cavity breakup resulting from the interaction between re entrant jet and cavity liquid interface the cloud cavity collapse will induce high pressure in the flow field at foil wakes and the high pressure will attenuate quickly in the flow field without rebound phenomena during the re entrant jet development process the re entrant jet front will cause small pressure fluctuations increase in the shock wave mechanism swm the cavitating flow is characterized by the alternate interactions between cavity re entrant jet and shock wave respectively when the attached cavity sheet grows to a certain length the re entrant jet generates at the rear of cavity the interactions between the re entrant jet and the cavity liquid interface will cause the attached cavity sheet breakup and the residual cavity sheet will be rolled up and shed downstream when transported into high pressure region downstream the cloud cavity will be collapsed and large pressure peaks are captured in the flow field which is supposed to be the shock wave phenomenon the shock wave propagation will cause the attached cavity sheet near the foil leading edge totally collapse following the shock wave rebound phenomenon is observed with the shock wave strength attenuation during the rebound process the attached cavity sheet growth is inhibited it can be concluded that the shock wave propagation and rebound process delays the cavitation evolution cycle compared with the two distinct cavity shedding mechanisms it can be found that the cavity cloud collapse rate in shock wave mechanism is faster than that in re entrant process 2 the joint interactions between the vapor fraction and mass transfer has a significant effects on the compressibility characteristics in the cavitating flows which is characterized by low sonic speed and high mach number with the cavitation evolution the minimum sonic speed in the whole flow fields keeps almost constant while the maximum mach number varies the average and standard derivation of mach number in the shock wave mechanism swm is smaller than that in the re entrant jet mechanism rjm the differences in minimum sonic speed and maximum mach number between the two cavity cloud mechanisms indicate the different compressibility characteristics in the cavitating flows at α 8 and 6 considering the close relationship between the compressibility effects and wave dynamics it can be concluded that the cavitation compressibility characteristics have an important influence on the cavity dynamics complex interactions between the compressibility and the cavitation evolution is still an open problem and needs more detailed investigations 3 the sonic speed distribution in the cavitating flow is characterized by the low sonic speed value 3 10 m s in the cavitation region and high sonic speed value 1450 m s in the main liquid flow region outside the cavitation region thus a sonic speed boundary layer exists between the cavitation region and the pure liquid region where the disturbance from the bulk flow has a buffer region to reach the cavitation region which indicates the interactions between the compressible cavitation region and the outside incompressible liquid region the thickness of the sonic speed boundary is in the same order as the thickness of the local attached cavity sheet 4 in the cloud cavity collapse process collapse induced high pressure is captured in the cavitating flow at both α 8 and 6 while collapse shock wave generation and rebound phenomena is only captured at α 6 in the shock wave formation and rebound process cavity volume and pressure evolution experience an abrupt fluctuations which are larger than that in the re entrant jet development process indicating that the shock wave is an important sources of cavity instabilities regarding the future work further investigations on the coherent interactions between the turbulence structures and the cavity evolution is still needed the shedding cavity cloud is composed of strong vortices and it is supposed that the vortex dynamics will have significant effects on the cavity cloud collapse process both the euler view point and lagrange view point can aid to shed light on the cloud cavity collapse characteristics especially the coherent interactions between the turbulence and cavitation in the shock wave dynamics furthermore to capture more detailed flow structures the large eddy simulation les approach will be employed to investigate the physics governing the cloud cavitation shedding mechanisms detailed experiment in water tunnel will be conducted along with sophisticated measurements it is worth nothing that the compressibility effects in cavitating flows originates from cavitation process where cavitation region is highly compressible and outside liquid flow experiences weak compressibility in the present work it is shown that sonic boundary layer plays an important role between compressible cavitation region and outside incompressible liquid flow we recommend future works to conduct the study on the interactions between the high compressible cavitation region and weak compressible pure liquid in cavitating flows since these two distinct region exchanges a lot with the cavitation evolution in addition our current study is limited in a typical shock wave induced cloud cavitation shedding mechanism and recent experiment work wu et al 2019 shows there exists different type of shock wave mechanisms which is needed to be further investigated acknowledge the

21766,the paper presents the results of experimental study on the interaction between the bow thrusters understood as the flow field changes generated by bow tunnel thruster in deep water conditions operated as a single and twin units the research was limited to zero speed case for the ship dead in the water the influence of the hull form and jet spread between the neighbouring thrusters for several combinations of the applied bow thruster propeller revolutions has been discussed the results of the flow field measurements velocity field volume of fluid rate mean velocity and thrust have been compared with the measurements of hydrodynamic forces generated by the bow thrusters on the hull both experiments were conducted at zero speed using the same large physical man manned model of a car passenger ferry in 1 16 scale graphical abstract image 1 keywords bow thruster interaction effects flow field hydrodynamic forces scale model test 1 introduction the paper is related to the problem of experimental investigations of bow thruster performance in the aspect of generated flow field and hydrodynamic forces generated on the ship hull these problems are of high importance during the berthing manoeuvres taking into account the ship motion ship safety and impacts of bow thruster jets on the quay wall structure the identification of those impacts is difficult from both the theoretical computational and experimental point of view to investigate the physical phenomena it has been decided to start from the experiment which should be followed in the future by the computer simulation the next step of research may enable to propose a new methodology supported by the improved method and modelling the interaction effects having impact on the bow thruster performance are mainly related to the ship speed water depth and influence of neighbouring devices in the case of multiple thrusters they concern bow thruster geometry position in the hull and operational parameters pitch and revolutions of the thruster propeller ship motion parameters and external conditions deter 1997 the multiple bow tunnel thrusters are widely used to provide the required turning moment when the hull is not able to accommodate a single device of the necessary dimensions the various bow thrusters of different parameters can be installed within a large power range the choice of multiple bow thrusters despite the technical reasons can also be related to economic decisions and industry practice over a dozen percent difference between the thrusts obtained from the same installed power can be expected mainly due to the hull form bow thruster tunnel and inlet cone geometry the design values of the thrust to power rates presented by vendors are 0 12 0 15 kn kw in dependence on the installation the research presented in the paper concentrates on the interaction effects between two neighbouring bow thrusters at different revolution settings and is limited to the zero speed case this experiment using the captive ship model can be considered as the first phase of parallel berthing manoeuvre when the ship is dead in the water several studies on bow thrusters performance have already identified and explained the selected phenomena influencing their efficiency cheng chenjun 2016 nienhuis 1992 terry 2015 cheng chenjun 2016 presented the numerical analysis of the generated flow field including a mechanism of the force generation on the hull and contribution of the propeller hub in the total propeller thrust the rans equations with the sst turbulence model were applied to simulate the bow thruster performance the free surface effect was included using the flow symmetry condition the studied flow features were the flow near the tunnel entrance evolution of the propeller induced flow along the tunnel and tip leakage vortices terry 2015 concentrated on the interaction effects of the multiple bow thrusters in deep water conditions describing the possible causes of interactions mainly in terms of the distance between the thrusters the observations based on the model tests and cfd calculations presented by terry 2015 allowed to determine the distance at which the interaction phenomena change in the studied cases the transition from the unified flow to flow separation and recirculation causing the oscillations occurred at the distance of 1 75 diameter of the tunnel the research was done using the simplified hull form with the flat plated model of the ship side the recirculation dominant at the higher distances between the thrusters was confirmed however the cfd simulation did not explain all the cases with different frequencies martinussen 1996 discussed the influence of the shallow water effect on the performance of the tunnel thruster and described 28 drop of the lateral force in the shallow water conditions at the water depth to draft ratio h t 1 1 yoo et al 2006 presented a parametric study on the influence of the ship distance to the berth and water depth to ship draft ratio on the forces generated on the hull by a single bow thruster with its outflow stream directed to the wall this captive model tests were carried out using the physical model in 1 30 scale the significant influence of water depth and distance to the berth on the mean sway force was indicated however no measurements of flow field were presented the new approach presented in this paper is different from the tests where the simplified bow thruster models were used without a possibility to indicate the hull form influence the first phase of parallel berthing to the quay was modelled using a stationary ship model to eliminate the flow changes due to the vessel motions it enabled to measure the values of hull generated hydrodynamic forces related to the thrusters performance the experiment was carried out on the large scale 1 16 geometrical scale physical man manned model and allowed to observe the influence of the ship hull form on the flow field generated by the bow thrusters operated as a single and two devices in deep water conditions it was possible to compare the values of volumetric flow calculated over the bow thruster tunnel opening for the different combinations of bow thrusters settings determine the produced thrust and mean jet velocity the conclusions have been drawn from the comparison of test results with the hydrodynamic sway force previously measured on the same model and empirical formulae for the jet velocity used in the berth structure design practice 2 experimental setup the l shaped model of the quay with an adjustable water depth was used both for the measurements of the flow velocity field generated by bow thrusters and measurements of forces generated by the bow thrusters on the hull the dimensions of the quay model were length 12 m breadth 5 m maximum depth 1 25 m the quay model was constructed on the shore of silm lake in the ship handling research and training centre of foundation for safety of navigation and environment protection in ilawa kamionka poland the large man manned model of a car passenger ferry in 1 16 scale was used for the tests the stationary captive model was positioned at a ship breadth from the quay wall the depth to draft ratio assumed for deep water conditions was h t 3 0 the main particulars of the ship model are presented in table 1 the main parameters of bow thrusters installed on the model fig 1 are presented in table 2 both the bt1 and bt2 bow thrusters have the same power inner tunnel diameter and propeller characteristics the revolutions per minute rpm of the propellers used during the experiments related to the bow thruster settings n bt are presented in table 3 2 1 experimental setup for measurements of the velocity field generated by bow thrusters the velocity field generated by the bow thruster was measured using a method adopted from the method used for the wake measurements by towing tanks the experiment using the large ro pax ferry model allowed to observe the generated flow field with the influence of ship hull and neighbouring bow thruster in the conditions similar to the real ship operation the presented approach was not previously described in the available literature the wake measuring device was constructed by the ship research and design centre in gdansk cto the scheme of device with the measuring probe used during the experiments 5 hole pitot tube with a spherical head is presented in fig 2 the diameter of the probe is 8 10 3 m the diameters of the holes are 8 10 4 m during the measurement the probe moves over the square measuring area fig 7 with dimensions 0 304 m 0 304 m horizontally and vertically horizontally it moves with the constant speed of 8 10 3 m s on the distance

about 750 hz the wake velocity at each data point saved to the measurement file is calculated as the mean value averaged over 100 10 times 10 points measurements the 3d velocity components should satisfy the condition of containment of determined angles in the range of calibration determined after the analysis of calibration dependent on the assumed level of measuring uncertainty the measuring head used during the measurements of the 3d velocity field of the bow thruster is presented in fig 3 where the l g p d and c signs concern the positions of the head measuring holes the methodology of the measurement is based on the assumption that the values of wake velocity vector and it s angles in the cartesian coordinate system associated with the probe axis and spherically distributed

the assumed uncertainty level of measurement is equal to 0 95 in this case it can be assumed that for the particular angle of velocity vector the measurement uncertainty is constant from the

level the relationship between the pressure and stream velocity was calibrated experimentally in the towing tank of ship design and research centre in gdansk cto the limits of the measurements were in the range of velocity angles 45 the measurement uncertainty at the significance level 0 05 was estimated at 3 of maximum values the experimental setup for the measurements of velocity field generated by the bow thrusters is presented in fig 4 and fig 5 the measuring device placed on the rigid construction is presented in fig 4 the rigid support construction of the model at bow and stern is presented in fig 5 the three dimensional clockwise coordinate systems related to the bow thrusters bt1 01x1y1z1 and bt2 02x2y2z2 were applied for the outflow stream definition the coordinate systems are fixed in with the plane defined by the bt1 propeller plane parallel to the centreline fig 6 the x 1 and x 2 axes coincide with the bow thrusters axes and outflow direction z 1 and z2 axes are directed vertically down the three dimensional velocity field was measured at two distances x 1 x 2 d p and 3 d p from the bt1 propeller disk the distances were determined by the possibly closest position of the measurement surface to the upper edge of the bt1 outlet the positions of measurement areas in front of the bt1 and bt2 outlets are presented in fig 7 2 2 experimental setup for measurements of forces generated on the hull by bow thrusters the experimental setup for the measurements of forces generated on the hull by bow thrusters is presented in fig 8 the pantographs holding the ship model in a constant position were connected with the dynamometers measuring the fore surge and sway reaction forces fx1 fy1 respectively and aft surge and sway reaction forces fx2 fy2 the model was free to heave pitch and roll the measuring system consisted of two tensometer type dynamometers amti mc3 100 located at the bow and aft indicated by arrows in fig 8 amti amplifiers and a d converter before measurements the measuring system was calibrated the measuring range was 220 n the sampling frequency 2 hz was determined experimentally for the dynamometers the non linearity error was 0 2 of the measuring range hysteresis error was 0 2 of the measuring range an analog to digital converter was used the quantization error was 220 12 bit 0 05 n the measurement time of about 3 min was determined on the basis of the observed changes in the measured values the bow thrusters settings and measured forces were registered using the software developed for the data collection and processing abramowicz gerigk 2008 the ship fixed coordinate system in the horizontal plane for the ship in 3 degrees of freedom used for the description of forces measured on the hull is presented in fig 9 the origin of the ship fixed system is located amidships according to the static waterline corresponding to the full loading condition in the longitudinal ship s symmetry plane the program of model tests included different settings of the bow thrusters the non dimensional distance b between the ship centre line and quay wall is defined by equation 7 7 b b a 0 5 b b where b a m is the distance between the ship centre line and quay wall b is the ship breadth 3 results of model tests both the flow field and hull forces measurements were taken separately the force measurements were taken on the model free to roll pitch and heave the flow field measurements were collected on the model fixed with a rigid structure 3 1 velocity field measurement results the velocity fields generated by the bt1 bow thruster and both bt1 and bt2 bow thrusters working together measured over 0 304 m 0 304 m square measuring area at the distances x 1 x 2 d p and 3d p for the bow thruster settings n bt equal to 100 75 and 50 in deep water conditions are presented in fig 10 the measurements were carried out in the order shown in fig 10 the measurement area was positioned at first in front of the bt1 when only bt1 was operated the next measurement was carried out in front of bt1 when both the thrusters were operated simultaneously with the same settings the wake maps of bt1 bow thruster in the conditions described above are presented in fig 11 4 processing of flow measurement flow to thrust conversion the actuator disc theory applied in most computational methods assumes the submerged free jet is in the infinite fluid the real propeller jet have a rotational velocity and swirl at the blade tips resulting in higher turbulence level shorter flow establishment zone and wider radial spread compared to the free jet pianc 2015 johnston et al 2013 szantyr et al 2009 verheij et al 2010 it discharges into the passing flow field the free surface and seabed inhibit the jet spreading the phenomena mentioned above were observed during the model tests in deep water at x 1 d p the outflow stream from bt1 was formed as a vortex with its core slightly shifted astern and towards the free surface due to the hull form geometry in this area the area of higher velocities was in its lower part the jet section had a form of a disk with internal tunnel in the case when both thrusters were working together the outflow stream from bt1 was attracted by the stream from the neighbouring bow thruster it was more concentrated and moved forward the volume of flow rate v f integrated over the tunnel opening area was about 20 greater at the distance x 1 3d p the area of higher velocities was in the lower part of measuring area and both the jets were attracted by each other the results of the presented tests confirm the conclusion of the investigations presented by terry 2015 with respect to the influence of the distance between the bow thrusters axes on their performance the dominant phenomena expected at the distances over 1 75 tunnel diameter is the flow recirculation in the tested case the distance equal to 2d p was in this range the volume of flow rate

berthing manoeuvres as well as from the impacts of generated bow thruster jets on the quay wall structure point of view 5 1 hydrodynamic forces and trust produced by bow thruster the fluctuations of the hydrodynamic forces are related to the periodically variable turbulent flow field with large eddies periodically forming and flowing away from the hull the usual time of use of a bow thruster during the berthing and unberthing manoeuvres takes about 30 s to generate the sway force moving the bow towards or away from the quay and then control the ship motion under the developed flow field abramowicz gerigk et al 2018 according to the form of time series of the sway force the average sway force may be calculated this value compared with the doubled thrust value of bt1 calculated from 10

21766,the paper presents the results of experimental study on the interaction between the bow thrusters understood as the flow field changes generated by bow tunnel thruster in deep water conditions operated as a single and twin units the research was limited to zero speed case for the ship dead in the water the influence of the hull form and jet spread between the neighbouring thrusters for several combinations of the applied bow thruster propeller revolutions has been discussed the results of the flow field measurements velocity field volume of fluid rate mean velocity and thrust have been compared with the measurements of hydrodynamic forces generated by the bow thrusters on the hull both experiments were conducted at zero speed using the same large physical man manned model of a car passenger ferry in 1 16 scale graphical abstract image 1 keywords bow thruster interaction effects flow field hydrodynamic forces scale model test 1 introduction the paper is related to the problem of experimental investigations of bow thruster performance in the aspect of generated flow field and hydrodynamic forces generated on the ship hull these problems are of high importance during the berthing manoeuvres taking into account the ship motion ship safety and impacts of bow thruster jets on the quay wall structure the identification of those impacts is difficult from both the theoretical computational and experimental point of view to investigate the physical phenomena it has been decided to start from the experiment which should be followed in the future by the computer simulation the next step of research may enable to propose a new methodology supported by the improved method and modelling the interaction effects having impact on the bow thruster performance are mainly related to the ship speed water depth and influence of neighbouring devices in the case of multiple thrusters they concern bow thruster geometry position in the hull and operational parameters pitch and revolutions of the thruster propeller ship motion parameters and external conditions deter 1997 the multiple bow tunnel thrusters are widely used to provide the required turning moment when the hull is not able to accommodate a single device of the necessary dimensions the various bow thrusters of different parameters can be installed within a large power range the choice of multiple bow thrusters despite the technical reasons can also be related to economic decisions and industry practice over a dozen percent difference between the thrusts obtained from the same installed power can be expected mainly due to the hull form bow thruster tunnel and inlet cone geometry the design values of the thrust to power rates presented by vendors are 0 12 0 15 kn kw in dependence on the installation the research presented in the paper concentrates on the interaction effects between two neighbouring bow thrusters at different revolution settings and is limited to the zero speed case this experiment using the captive ship model can be considered as the first phase of parallel berthing manoeuvre when the ship is dead in the water several studies on bow thrusters performance have already identified and explained the selected phenomena influencing their efficiency cheng chenjun 2016 nienhuis 1992 terry 2015 cheng chenjun 2016 presented the numerical analysis of the generated flow field including a mechanism of the force generation on the hull and contribution of the propeller hub in the total propeller thrust the rans equations with the sst turbulence model were applied to simulate the bow thruster performance the free surface effect was included using the flow symmetry condition the studied flow features were the flow near the tunnel entrance evolution of the propeller induced flow along the tunnel and tip leakage vortices terry 2015 concentrated on the interaction effects of the multiple bow thrusters in deep water conditions describing the possible causes of interactions mainly in terms of the distance between the thrusters the observations based on the model tests and cfd calculations presented by terry 2015 allowed to determine the distance at which the interaction phenomena change in the studied cases the transition from the unified flow to flow separation and recirculation causing the oscillations occurred at the distance of 1 75 diameter of the tunnel the research was done using the simplified hull form with the flat plated model of the ship side the recirculation dominant at the higher distances between the thrusters was confirmed however the cfd simulation did not explain all the cases with different frequencies martinussen 1996 discussed the influence of the shallow water effect on the performance of the tunnel thruster and described 28 drop of the lateral force in the shallow water conditions at the water depth to draft ratio h t 1 1 yoo et al 2006 presented a parametric study on the influence of the ship distance to the berth and water depth to ship draft ratio on the forces generated on the hull by a single bow thruster with its outflow stream directed to the wall this captive model tests were carried out using the physical model in 1 30 scale the significant influence of water depth and distance to the berth on the mean sway force was indicated however no measurements of flow field were presented the new approach presented in this paper is different from the tests where the simplified bow thruster models were used without a possibility to indicate the hull form influence the first phase of parallel berthing to the quay was modelled using a stationary ship model to eliminate the flow changes due to the vessel motions it enabled to measure the values of hull generated hydrodynamic forces related to the thrusters performance the experiment was carried out on the large scale 1 16 geometrical scale physical man manned model and allowed to observe the influence of the ship hull form on the flow field generated by the bow thrusters operated as a single and two devices in deep water conditions it was possible to compare the values of volumetric flow calculated over the bow thruster tunnel opening for the different combinations of bow thrusters settings determine the produced thrust and mean jet velocity the conclusions have been drawn from the comparison of test results with the hydrodynamic sway force previously measured on the same model and empirical formulae for the jet velocity used in the berth structure design practice 2 experimental setup the l shaped model of the quay with an adjustable water depth was used both for the measurements of the flow velocity field generated by bow thrusters and measurements of forces generated by the bow thrusters on the hull the dimensions of the quay model were length 12 m breadth 5 m maximum depth 1 25 m the quay model was constructed on the shore of silm lake in the ship handling research and training centre of foundation for safety of navigation and environment protection in ilawa kamionka poland the large man manned model of a car passenger ferry in 1 16 scale was used for the tests the stationary captive model was positioned at a ship breadth from the quay wall the depth to draft ratio assumed for deep water conditions was h t 3 0 the main particulars of the ship model are presented in table 1 the main parameters of bow thrusters installed on the model fig 1 are presented in table 2 both the bt1 and bt2 bow thrusters have the same power inner tunnel diameter and propeller characteristics the revolutions per minute rpm of the propellers used during the experiments related to the bow thruster settings n bt are presented in table 3 2 1 experimental setup for measurements of the velocity field generated by bow thrusters the velocity field generated by the bow thruster was measured using a method adopted from the method used for the wake measurements by towing tanks the experiment using the large ro pax ferry model allowed to observe the generated flow field with the influence of ship hull and neighbouring bow thruster in the conditions similar to the real ship operation the presented approach was not previously described in the available literature the wake measuring device was constructed by the ship research and design centre in gdansk cto the scheme of device with the measuring probe used during the experiments 5 hole pitot tube with a spherical head is presented in fig 2 the diameter of the probe is 8 10 3 m the diameters of the holes are 8 10 4 m during the measurement the probe moves over the square measuring area fig 7 with dimensions 0 304 m 0 304 m horizontally and vertically horizontally it moves with the constant speed of 8 10 3 m s on the distance of 0 304 m then moves vertically to the next row of the measuring matrix the vertical probe velocity is equal to 10 2 m s the positioning accuracy is equal to 10 4 m the sampling frequency is equal to about 750 hz the wake velocity at each data point saved to the measurement file is calculated as the mean value averaged over 100 10 times 10 points measurements the 3d velocity components should satisfy the condition of containment of determined angles in the range of calibration determined after the analysis of calibration dependent on the assumed level of measuring uncertainty the measuring head used during the measurements of the 3d velocity field of the bow thruster is presented in fig 3 where the l g p d and c signs concern the positions of the head measuring holes the methodology of the measurement is based on the assumption that the values of wake velocity vector and it s angles in the cartesian coordinate system associated with the probe axis and spherically distributed

the assumed uncertainty level of measurement is equal to 0 95 in this case it can be assumed that for the particular angle of velocity vector the measurement uncertainty is constant from the

presented in fig 5 the three dimensional clockwise coordinate systems related to the bow thrusters bt1 01x1y1z1 and bt2 02x2y2z2 were applied for the outflow stream definition the coordinate systems are fixed in with the plane defined by the bt1 propeller plane parallel to the centreline fig 6 the x 1 and x 2 axes coincide with the bow thrusters axes and outflow direction z 1 and z2 axes are directed vertically down the three dimensional velocity field was measured at two distances x 1 x 2 d p and 3 d p from the bt1 propeller disk the distances were determined by the possibly closest position of the measurement surface to the upper edge of the bt1 outlet the positions of measurement areas in front of the bt1 and bt2 outlets are presented in fig 7 2 2 experimental setup for measurements of forces generated on the hull by bow thrusters the experimental setup for the measurements of forces generated on the hull by bow thrusters is presented in fig 8 the pantographs holding

was determined on the basis of the observed changes in the measured values the bow thrusters settings and measured forces were registered using the software developed for the data collection and processing abramowicz gerigk 2008 the ship fixed coordinate system in the horizontal plane for the ship in 3 degrees of freedom used for the description of forces measured on the hull is presented in fig 9 the origin of the ship fixed system is located amidships according to the static waterline corresponding to the full loading condition in the longitudinal ship s symmetry plane the program of model tests included different settings of the bow thrusters the non dimensional distance b between the ship centre line and quay wall is defined by equation 7 7 b b a 0 5 b b where b a m is the distance between the ship centre line and quay wall b is the ship breadth 3 results of model tests both the flow field and hull forces measurements were taken separately the force measurements were

front of the bt1 when only bt1 was operated the next measurement was carried out in front of bt1 when both the thrusters were operated simultaneously with the same settings the wake maps of bt1 bow thruster in the conditions described above are presented in fig 11 4 processing of flow measurement flow to thrust conversion the actuator disc theory applied in most computational methods assumes the submerged free jet is in the infinite fluid the real propeller jet have a rotational velocity and swirl at the blade tips resulting in higher turbulence level shorter flow establishment zone and wider radial spread compared to the free jet pianc 2015 johnston et al 2013 szantyr et al 2009 verheij et al 2010 it discharges into the passing flow field the free surface and seabed inhibit the jet spreading the phenomena mentioned above were observed during the model tests in deep water at x 1 d p the outflow stream from bt1 was formed as a vortex with its core slightly shifted astern and towards the free surface due to the hull form geometry in this area the area of higher velocities was in its lower part the jet section had a form of a disk with internal tunnel in the case when both thrusters were working together the outflow stream from bt1 was attracted by the stream from the neighbouring bow thruster it was more concentrated and moved forward the volume of flow rate v f integrated over the tunnel opening area was about 20 greater at the distance x 1 3d p the area of higher velocities was in the lower part of measuring area and both the jets were attracted by each other the results of the presented tests confirm the conclusion of the investigations presented by terry 2015 with respect to the influence of the distance between the bow thrusters axes on their performance the dominant phenomena expected at the distances over 1 75 tunnel diameter is the flow recirculation in the tested case the distance equal to 2d p was in this range the volume of flow rate

planing craft maneuvers planing transition 1 introduction and objectives amphibious vehicles have increasing application in industry defense search and rescue recreation and coastal research incoul et al 2014 the common functions of amphibians and the weight associated with two propulsion systems dictate that such multi mode craft are often heavy vehicles that operate like traditional displacement vessels a small subset of amphibians operate as planing craft though the size and mass of these vehicles remain large compared to conventional planing craft heavier vehicles can be expected to transition to planing mode at higher froude numbers than lighter weight craft as higher pressures and therefore higher speeds are needed to provide the necessary lift thus incurring a larger resistance before transitioning to planing this work examines through concurrent experiments and high fidelity computations the full scale hydrodynamic performance of an amphibious planing craft in calm water despite a growing body of studies on ships and boats that operate in displacement and planing modes there is limited literature on the behavior of small amphibious vehicles this article presents an investigation of the hydrodynamics of a self propelled amphibious craft gibbs sports amphibians inc 2016 with the following objectives 1 study the hydrodynamic response and validate the global thrust and attitude of a small high speed amphibian at self propulsion conditions across its operational speed range 2 study the flow structures and validate the vessel motions in response to periodic steering nozzle deflections zigzag and 3 validate the transient response of the vessel during transition from displacement mode to planing mode in all cases validation data are taken from full scale experiments this work serves as a valuable benchmarking study for a complex vehicle in challenging conditions and it augments a sparse body of literature containing full scale measurements of small planing craft 2 background planing is a mode of operation in which mainly hydrodynamic lift rather than buoyancy supports an object steady displacement and planing behaviors can be generally explained through the language of statics what follows is a description of attitude hull pressure and resultant forces as a planing craft s speed is steadily incremented intended to serve as a touchstone for the results presented later values of interest are underlined at low speeds a typical craft operates in a displacement mode with nearly even keel the bow acting as the leading face experiences the maximum pressure resulting in a growing resistance and trimming moment most of the hull surface remains nearly parallel to the relative flow imparting a small but initially strengthening suction on the region the transom as the trailing face becomes fully ventilated at speeds corresponding to f r 0 25 in accordance with the dynamic boundary condition of the free surface here the volumetric froude number is defined as f r u 0 g 1 3 with u 0 the characteristic vehicle velocity g the acceleration of gravity and the volumetric displacement at rest the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressures come into equilibrium through sinkage and the forward bias of the hydrodynamic distribution is balanced by an aft biased hydrostatic distribution resulting from a small positive change in pitch the speed of maximum sinkage occurs typically for f r 0 5 savitski 1964 the hydrodynamic pressure bias increases alongside pitch through increasing speeds in the displacement mode that is to say the angle between the keel and the relative upstream flow congruent with the angle between the thrust vector and the horizontal plane widens increasing net hull bottom pressure and consequently resistance and dynamic lift the vehicle will continue to trim by the bow and the center of gravity will rise as displacement shrinks one refers to the vehicle as semi planing when the dynamic lift becomes positive the transition from displacement to semi planing is typically unspectacular but the corresponding speed of semi planing transition nonetheless serves as a point of comparison among planing craft the vessel transitions to planing upon hitting a critical pitch value that nearly coincides with bow emergence the relief of pressure at the bow accompanies a fall off of resistance and substantial decrease of the hydrodynamic trimming moment while the dynamic pressure on the inclined hull remains high enough to maintain lift as vehicle speed increases past the transition point were the vessel to maintain its attitude the strengthening pressure on the inclined wetted surface of the hull would impart an unbalanced moment therefore if there exists a stable static trim angle the vessel pitch gradually decreases initially lowering resistance hydrodynamic lift and displacement commonly approach asymptotes corresponding to a minimum resistance in the practical case a craft that has just transitioned to planing will accelerate through this unstable portion of the speed resistance curve past the minimum resistance point and to a self propulsion condition of higher speed within the planing regime in independent numerical studies mousaviraad et al 2015 and sukas et al 2017 used fridsma s prismatic geometry fridsma 1969 to study the hydrodynamics of planing hulls and to test current computational tools capabilities they observed that the trim of the hull increases with froude number until the quantity peaks at the threshold of the transition to planing mode experiments show that the resistance increases with froude number in displacement mode before dropping slightly upon transition from displacement to planing mode producing a local maximum followed by an unstable speed range while sukas et al 2017 predicted this behavior mousaviraad et al 2015 show a monotonically increasing resistance trend both groups predicted trim and rise satisfactorily it is of interest to understand the hydrodynamic response of waterjet propelled craft with nozzle steering for performing safe and effective maneuvering operations lin et al 2010 proposed a physics based analytical model for predicting the ship maneuvering performance in calm water as well as in waves kim and kim 2017 observed an increase in speed reduction ratio of a waterjet propelled ship as the tactical diameter increased for values below 7 ship lengths for tactical diameters greater than 7 ship lengths the speed reduction ratio approaches unity kim and kim 2017 showed that waterjet propelled planing crafts turn through low tactical diameters and experience lower speed reductions compared to the planing vessels with rudders and propellers they also observed that at the beginning of the turn the waterjet propelled vessel experiences maximum roll angle though this behavior is dependent on the vessel s hydrostatic properties and the line of action of the waterjet nozzle with respect to the center of gravity during the turn the authors found the expected result that the direction of the roll angle depends on nozzle angle and boat turning speed as these two effects produce the main rolling moments in the present work simulations were carried out at constant speeds in the range of 4 18 knots experiments were also conducted for speeds of 0 18 knots the dynamics of pitch thrust and roll during steady operation and transient maneuvers are discussed in detail the paper is organized as follows 3 and 4 present the particulars of the amphibious craft the experimental methodology details of the numerical techniques and the simulation grids respectively in 5 comparisons between cfd and experimental thrust craft attitude and flow fields are presented 6 shows the characteristics of zigzag motions of the craft respectively and conclusions are presented in 7 3 experimental method 3 1 test vehicle the test vehicle is a self propelled single seat variant of the gibbs quadski gibbs sports amphibians inc 2016 shown in fig 1 retrofitted for remote control and data acquisition the remote control system drive by wire dbw consists of communication devices and actuators for powering system monitoring steering driving and wheel retraction this system enables rider less operation eliminating the complexity of a shifting mass the amphibious vehicle particulars were determined in a commercial vehicle inertia measurement facility in land configuration wheels deployed and recalculated for the water configuration wheels retracted additionally the static trim and waterline were determined in an indoor pool to consider small changes due to additional instrumentation the total mass mass centroid location and moments of inertia are given in table 1 it is important to note that given the relatively small dimensions of the vehicle small changes in its configuration can greatly affect its mass distribution and thus its hydrodynamic behavior for instance approximately 5 of the weight corresponds to fuel when the tank is full similarly during tests water became trapped in the cowling and hull or pooled in the footwells the presence of this unconfined liquid as part of the system not only modifies the weight and its distribution in an unexpected fashion but also can produce sloshing and produce dynamic effects on the vehicle motions that are extremely difficult to assess and thus to incorporate into a computational model 3 2 instrumentation and data acquisition the vehicle mounted data acquisition system is illustrated in fig 2 the data acquisition device national instruments crio 9045 was programmed to digitally log and time stamp data from the three sensing sub systems comprised of the can bus serial connections and analog sensor network these data are logged at the rates provided in table 2 the salient can bus data are throttle position steering angle steady vehicle speed fuel level engine and shaft speeds and estimated crankshaft torque all signals were measured with the vehicle s native sensors and recorded using a ni 9862 can module added instrumentation included an impeller thrust sensor and a gnss ins sensor unit for accurate measurement of vessel kinematics over a wide range of time scales the thrust sensor is a compact honeywell piezoresistive transducer that measures the pressure in a hydraulic floating bearing supporting the pump impeller the calibration of this device was derived experimentally by simulating the impeller s reaction force with a hydraulic press and measuring the force through a pre calibrated load cell the calibration uses a linear fit with r 2 0 999 and an estimated calibration error of 170 n 1 9 fs at a 95 confidence level thrust data were recorded using a ni 9239 module with 24 bit a d resolution the gnss ins unit is a spatial dual manufactured by advanced navigation the ins is equipped with triaxial accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer and augmented by two gps antennas during tests the differential gps locations are stored at approximately 20 hz while inertial and magnetometry data are stored at a higher data rate data from the ins were streamed to the crio over an rs 232 bus at a rate of 921 6 kbaud and stored in a raw binary format to minimize on line processing approximately 24 h after data are recorded when historical ephemeris data became available the ins data were post processed to correct for systematic gps errors and a sensor fusion filter was used to assimilate the corrected gps data with inertial records for high accuracy 6 dof motion records gnss pulse per second data from this unit was also recorded as both timestamps and waveform for the purpose of rigorous post synchronization which is illustrated in fig 2 by a second digital output line and an analog output experiments were conducted on a placid reservoir on a morning with observably low wind and no other boat traffic remote control of the vehicle was performed manually for all tests straight ahead runs were executed with a constant throttle command and minimal steering inputs to maintain course a necessity given the outfitted vehicle s bias to the port side these runs were analyzed over a timeframe of steady vehicle velocity the test of the dynamic transition was executed by throttling up to approximately 70 of maximum throttle and after approximately 20 s abruptly returning the throttle to zero this test was performed for analysis of the transient behavior zigzag maneuvers were performed by issuing steering commands to the tempo of a metronome while maintaining throttle position steering commands consisted of alternating port and starboard deflections of the nozzle to 20 from centerline with periodicity of 4 and 8 s 4 numerical approach the computations are carried out using rex a general purpose naval hydrodynamics software package developed at the university of iowa the free surface is modeled using a single phase level set approach carrica et al 2007a equations are solved in the water phase with appropriate boundary conditions imposed at the free surface the navier stokes equations are solved using finite difference schemes on curvilinear coordinates in body fitted structured multiblock grids overset connectivity is used to link the grids and to move grids following the predicted body evolution carrica et al 2007b carrica et al 2010b the convective and viscous terms are discretized employing fourth order upwind biased and second order central schemes respectively whereas the second order backward euler scheme is used for performing the time integration a projection method which provides strong pressure velocity coupling is employed to satisfy the incompressibility condition li and carrica 2018 the dynamic overset domain connectivity information is obtained at run time employing suggar noack et al 2009 in the present self propulsion simulations the target speed is achieved using a proportional integral pi speed controller actuating on the propeller rotational speed as described by carrica et al 2010a and mofidi and carrica 2014 and a body force implementation is used to impose the water jet thrust as discussed in the next section a predictor corrector six degrees of freedom 6dof solver included in rex is used to compute the vehicle motions complete details of the numerical methods used in rex can be obtained found in li and carrica 2018 li et al 2019 and references therein 4 1 grids and conditions the amphibious craft is discretized with structured overset grids the cowling and suspension components are neglected fig 3 shows a view of the surface grid table 3 presents the resolution of the grid system a refinement block is added around the vehicle to better resolve the flow near the craft and to improve the overset connectivity in the composite grid fig 4 the background grid is adequately refined near z 0 the plane of the static free surface all grids except the background grid form a dynamic group with the vehicle moving rigidly in six degrees of freedom the background grid translates in the horizontal plane and rotates about the vertical axis only in order to maintain alignment with the horizontal free surface and thus is not coupled to the vehicle s orientation the waterjet nozzle is a 1dof sub system of the amphibious vehicle a child of the main body in overset nomenclature and pivots around its axis of rotation for steering quantities are non dimensionalized using the amphibious vehicle length l and characteristic forward speed u 0 the reynolds number and displacement froude number for the simulations are then defined respectively as r e u 0 l ν and f r u 0 1 3 g where ν represents the kinematic viscosity of the water for all the simulations the nondimensional time step is set to δ t u 0 l 0 0025 the impeller and stator of the water jet are not included in the present model due to the excessive computational cost of solving the fast rotation of the impeller which would severely reduce the possible time step used in the computation alternatively a body force is imposed to the fluid in a cylindrical region inside the waterjet approximately in the same location where the impeller is located the body force is uniformly distributed and no swirl is imposed to the fluid this approximates the effect of the stator regarding the induced rotation of the fluid the resulting thrust force is also considered in the 6dof equations of the vehicle the body force is represented in the model by a thrust coefficient distribution as a function of the advance ratio the nominal rotational speed n of the impeller can then be fixed or used as a control input for self propulsion a pi controller is used such that where p and i respectively represent the proportional and integral constants of the controller and e u is the error between the target speed and the speed of the craft at time t for the two maneuvers presented thrust is imposed as well as the nozzle deflection history self propulsion and acceleration deceleration maneuvers are solved with the craft free to sink and trim only while the zig zag maneuver is solved using the full free body 5 results 5 1 self propulsion fig 5 shows the dynamic lift ratio as a fraction of the vehicle weight as a function of speed panel a and the rise of the vehicle s center of gravity with respect to speed panel b the lifting effect of the thrust is also included as it can support up to 14 of weight during the semi planing mode when pitch angle and thrust are largest for speeds under 5 5 knots fr 0 5 the craft experiences an increasing downward hydrodynamic force due to suction on the hull s bottom surface see also fig 6 a consequently the vehicle experiences increasing sinkage over this range as seen in fig 5b this dynamic sinkage agrees with the observations of sukas et al 2017 who reported that as the froude number increases up to fr 0 67 displacement increases the hydrodynamic sinkage force reaches zero at approximately 6 5 knots as the speed is further increased the dynamic ratio increases monotonically the vertical rise in the center of gravity replicates the behavior across the entire speed range fig 6 illustrates the instantaneous pressure distribution on the hull s bottom surface and the free surface deformation in the displacement and planing regimes fig 6a reveals that this wetted surface experiences suction resulting in the hydrodynamic sinkage force shown in fig 5 fig 6b and c are examples of semi planing and planing conditions at a relatively low speed and high pitch angle panel b 8 knots and low pitch panel c 18 knots notice the strong moment caused by the pressure distribution resulting in a large bow up pitching moment at 18 knots the pressure on the stern side recovers considerably leading to decrease in the pressure difference between the bow and stern ends and decreasing the pitching moment at higher speeds su et al 2012 argued that the recovery of pressure at the stern is due to the increase in the distance between the stern and rooster tail for increasing speeds which is observed in the present simulations while moving with a steady displacement speed a vehicle induces a kelvin wake pattern delimited by an angle with measure independent of speed body length and gravitational acceleration however it has been observed that for f r 0 7 the angle of maximum wave height narrows and no longer coincides with the delimiting angle rabaud and moisy 2013 darmon et al 2014 the components of the wake demonstrate at least one other related speed dependent behavior diverging waves amplify with increasing froude number while transverse waves attenuate lighthill 1978 the wake comparison of fig 7 demonstrates a narrowing angle amplifying diverging waves and attenuating transverse waves as well as bow emergence and transom ventilation in the high speed cases a rooster tail and breakers at the still submerged footwells are clearly observed at the intermediate speed fig 7b at the highest speed considered converging flow does not occur near the transom eliminating the rooster tail and reducing resistance similar conclusions can be made based on the flow sections presented in the right columns of fig 7 which show an increase in the streamlining of the flow and consequently reduced form drag notice areas of negative velocity near the bow at the low and intermediate speeds negative velocities in the waterjet inlet at 18 knots as well as areas high pressure see fig 6c are likely to result in reduced efficiency at this and higher speeds ultimately contributing to limiting the maximum speed achievable in fig 8 a pitch measured from the hydrostatic attitude predicted by the present simulations as a function of craft speed is compared to experimental values good overall agreement is observed in the displacement and fully planing modes however the maximum pitch angle is underpredicted near the point of transition to planing the increasing and decreasing behavior of the pitch angle in fig 8a previously described with regards to the observed flow at different froude numbers is consistent with the analytical prediction of trim by savitski 1964 and the results reported by lotfi et al 2015 and sukas et al 2017 who showed that the dynamic trim increases in the displacement regime before decreasing in the planing regime multiple possible reasons exist that can affect the underprediction of the critical pitch angle some possibly related to modeling errors but also to uncertainty in the actual conditions of the experimental run small variations of less than 1 in static trim for the vehicle during different experiments suggest that variability in the mass properties specifically those due to fuel consumption or a small amount of water in the bilge exist which are difficult to replicate numerically other simulation parameters that have large effect on pitch such as the waterjet action line are subject to uncertainty thrust is also compared between experimental and numerical results in fig 8b the agreement is good across the range of speeds tested in self propulsion thrust less propulsion losses is in equilibrium with resistance tahara et al 2006 as a result measured thrust is proportional to the resistance and can be used as a surrogate for the latter results are consistent with those of lotfi et al 2015 mousaviraad et al 2015 and sukas et al 2017 as well as profiles proposed by savitski 1964 as referred to by sukas et al 2017 for a planing hull via an analytical approach the curve is characterized by a steep increase in resistance experienced by a vessel as fr increases in displacement mode followed by a slight decrease at intermediate velocities and finally an increase with further increase in fr as described previously the intermediate range of speeds between 6 5 and 16 knots is unstable and it was not possible to maintain steady operation at these speeds during experiments steady state simulations at these speeds were made possible by the introduction of the speed controller it is interesting to further analyze the different components of the resistance from the cfd results fig 9 separates the contributions of hydrodynamic pressure hydrostatic pressure and friction as well as presenting the evolution of wetted area with craft speed the latter evolves consistently with the rise of the center of gravity increasing to a maximum at about 6 5 knots and decreasing monotonically afterwards friction forces are as expected small compared to form drag and increase monotonically with speed the dynamic pressure force increases steeply in the displacement and semi planing regimes but remains approximately constant at high speed at least in the range evaluated a distinct peak in resistance is attributable to the hydrostatic pressure which increases sharply as the transom ventilates and decreases again as the craft cg rises and the transom draft decreases notice that immediately before this peak the hydrostatic component is negative effectively contributing to the propulsion of the craft this is a result of the upwelling of the fluid at the transom past typical water levels at these fr values in a displacement craft due to the large pitch angle of the vehicle fluctuations of all drag components shown in fig 9 by their standard deviations magnified by a factor of 20 is larger in the displacement regime and during transition but in all cases they remain relatively small with the exception of the hydrostatic component at low speeds variability for this quantity is associated with splashing and unsteadiness of the free surface and it is of little consequence to the dynamics of the craft forces and area fluctuations are similar particularly in the planing regime less than 1 of the mean values while in the displacement regime forces fluctuate in the order of 2 4 of the mean values indicating more complex dynamics that cannot be explained by a change in wetted area alone 5 2 transition from displacement to planing at constant thrust the previous section focused on the analysis of the flow at constant speed however a large range of speeds could not be explored experimentally due to the unstable characteristics of the resistance curve in the range 10 16 knots as shown these intermediate speeds in the planing regime can be simulated using a controller alternatively the transient behavior between displacement and planing regimes can be studied by impulsively increasing the thrust and observing the evolution of the system to a new equilibrium point fig 10 presents the evolution of the craft s thrust velocity and pitch following a step increase in the thrust the craft began in the displacement regime moving steadily at 5 5 knots before the thrust was increased by approximately 50 for 20 s at which point the throttle was reduced to a near zero value a video of the experiment and an animation of the cfd results are shown in the accompanying video1 note that spraying and bubbly flow in the wake clearly observed in the experiment are not modeled in the present simulations and while the current results suggest their effect on the overall craft dynamics to be small further investigation on these phenomena might be of interest the simulation was initialized by matching the experimental speed in displacement mode as a result there exists a small discrepancy in thrust and pitch angle between the experimental and numerical cases consistent with differences discussed in 5 1 where it was shown that small changes in speed at the higher end of the displacement regime result in large changes in resistance and craft pitch these differences have little effect on the evolution of the system once the thrust is increased the excess or net thrust results in an acceleration of the craft as well as an increase in pitch the instantaneous resistance r estimated from thrust t and the craft mass m and acceleration a as r m a t is shown in fig 11 the net thrust is smallest at the beginning of the transition and speed increases slowly while pitch changes more rapidly consistent with the steady state results shown previously after the maximum pitch angle is reached resistance drops causing a more rapid acceleration of the craft until thrust and resistance are again in equilibrium at a higher speed the differences in predicted versus measured pitch near the quasi steady states at the beginning and end of the acceleration are consistent with the steady state cases discussed in the previous section the transient evolution shows slightly better agreement experiments show peak pitch value of about 14 in both steady and transient cases but cfd predictions are approximately 2 higher in the transient case than in the self propulsion tests the peak speed is overpredicted by cfd consistent with a larger pitch smaller wetted area in the simulation in the fully planing regime the deceleration of the system once power to the waterjet is cut off is also very well reproduced by the simulation pitch again reaches similar albeit slightly smaller values than those observed in the steady state while transitioning from planing to displacement mode comparison of peak pitch values in fig 12 shows that the maximum occurs at higher speed when accelerating and lower speed when decelerating relative to the steady self propulsion results this is consistent with the differences in pitch moment due to excess and absence respectively of applied thrust just as for the steady case shown in 5 1 the contribution to the total force of the different fluid force sources can be analyzed from the cfd results as shown in fig 13 when comparing the accelerating decelerating portions of the maneuver as a function of craft speed the relatively small pitch angle differences have little effect in skin friction and hydrostatic longitudinal components of the force up to about 8 knots that is the range for which both conditions are firmly in the planing regime the dynamic pressure is approximately uniform in the range 8 18 knots just as for the steady however its level varies with imposed thrust reflecting the effect of the waterjet on the vehicle resistance thrust deduction secondary peaks in pitch as the vehicle approaches zero velocity are likely related to interactions of the craft with its own wake this interaction makes the deceleration evolution during the displacement regime more difficult to analyze including cycles of increasing and decreasing speed as shown by circular trajectories in figs 11 and 12 however the good agreement of the cfd simulations to this simple dynamic test at higher speeds is encouraging in regards to the simulation of maneuvers for which forces acting on the craft are also in non equilibrium conditions 6 zigzag maneuvers a variation on the standard zigzag maneuver was studied next in this test the waterjet nozzle was turned alternately 20 to port and starboard at its maximum rate every 4 s a constant waterjet speed was maintained corresponding to a nominal self propulsion speed of 4 knots fig 14 shows the time histories of heading yaw rate and speed for the craft during the zigzag motion while fig 15 presents pitch roll and roll rate only the portion of the computational and experimental runs that reaches periodic response is shown note that the heading starts with 60 to the port side and oscillates between 30 and 90 approximately with the mean being close to 60 as can be seen in fig 14 because the craft s center of gravity is located a small distance to port of the centerplane see table 1 the craft drifts slightly to port as shown by both experiments and computations in general the computational results are in good agreement with the experimental data in particular for heading and yaw rate which determine the maneuvering performance the quadski shows to be a very maneuverable vehicle with yaw rates in excess of 25 deg s likely to reach over 35 deg s if the nozzle was kept longer at 20 deflection at the maximum yaw rate immediately before the nozzle is reversed the yaw acceleration is still 4 5 deg s2 fig 14 shows fluctuations in speed with cfd maxima around the times when the waterjet nozzle is straight at zero degrees efd exhibits larger fluctuations in speed with maxima that appear to correlate with the minimum yaw rate while the craft performs turns towards port and starboard sides periodically the yaw changes with time the roll and pitch excursions during the maneuver are larger in efd than in cfd but the overall trends are consistent see fig 15 the minimum pitch occurs slightly after each steering change after heading reaches maxima and minima the experimental roll shows short overshoot peaks every time the yaw rate changes sign these not observed in cfd a possible explanation for this difference could be sloshing in the fuel tank a phenomenon not included in the cfd model despite of this the roll rate shows very good qualitative agreement with the experiments fig 16 presents vortical structures obtained as isosurfaces of q the second invariant of the velocity gradient a video of the experiment and an animation of the cfd results are shown in the accompanying video2 during the maneuver and as the vehicle drifts strong vortices are generated from the chine spray rails and bow keel indicating some degree of stabilization against drift and a role in determining the maneuvering performance the bow and rail vortices are periodically entrained into the waterjet duct potentially causing noise and vibration issues see video2 7 discussion and conclusions self propulsion and simple maneuvers of a waterjet propelled amphibious craft were investigated numerically and experimentally the results contribute to a sparse body of literature concerning full scale validation of planing simulations as well as that concerning non traditional or hybrid vehicle types the vehicle studied is distinct both from similarly sized but lighter personal watercraft and from larger craft that not only exceed the present craft dimensions but also typically possess a smaller beam to length ratio additionally the craft studied in this work possesses an uncommonly complex geometry that poses a significant challenge to high fidelity simulation especially in displacement and semi displacement modes these differences do not seem to affect the occurrence of the peak or critical pitch angle which can be used to identify transition to planing mode occurring slightly above a displacement froude number of roughly unity which for this vehicle corresponds to 5 9 knots this is consistent with expected values for a craft with small length to beam ratio however it should be noted that propulsion provides approximately 10 of the lift at the transition point suggesting that in towed conditions which are the standard conditions used for testing planing hulls transition will occur at higher fr it is also worth noticing from fig 5 that planing occurs at lower lift ratios than typical planing craft manen and oossanen 1988 this is consistent with the use of an uncommonly wide hull to counteract the large weight of the craft the numerical method performs satisfactorily in both the displacement and fully planing cases for self propulsion and acceleration deceleration tests and overall during the zigzag maneuver that is conducted at low fr results are poorer in the prediction of craft trim near the transition possible reasons are uncertainty in parametric values mass distribution including dynamic changes due to gas tank and trapped water levels and sloshing changes to thrust line action due to compliance of the waterjet drive as well as numerical and modeling errors a formal verification and validation analysis was not conducted to determine those errors due to the high computational cost of such study the complexity of the geometry precludes using a much coarser discretization than the one presented therefore systematic refinement results in extremely large computational grids the good agreement with experimental data over multiple conditions suggests that cfd does not produce unacceptably large errors so as to prevent the discussion of general trends nor does it furnish systematically biased results similar response motions for the numerical and experimental cases during the acceleration maneuver also support the validity of cfd furthermore model discrepancies specifically the lower speed associated with critical pitch and the large pitching angles in the deceleration phase at low speeds indicate that the uncertainty in the numerical results is dominated by the rigid body solver component of the simulation as it is very sensitive to the accuracy of the inertia properties the use of a body force model can also affect the pressure distribution inside the water jet and potentially affect the dynamics of the craft however it is difficult to validate or improve this simple model given the cost of a fully discretized simulation of the propulsion system the presented results of the zigzag maneuver illustrate the complex nature of the case considered and the difficulties in analysis and improving this type of simulation while the results are overall consistent with the experiments the different model data studied replicate experimental results to varying degrees in particular peak roll is underpredicted and speed variations are out of phase between the two cases both appear related to an underprediction of pitch near maximum yaw rate this can originate in deficiencies in the inertia properties of the model of the craft as previously discussed but also in the numerical model itself it is clear that further investigation of this discrepancies is required in our future work in summary the results presented support the validity of the numerical approach while some of its shortcomings have also been discussed the study also introduces a complete set of experimental results for a small full scale free running planing craft a valuable dataset which to the authors knowledge is of a brand new type in the open literature credit authorship contribution

21767,the hydrodynamic characteristics of a waterjet propelled amphibious craft traveling in displacement and planing modes are studied via full scale experiments and numerical simulations in three ways first variations of pitch resistance and vertical rise for speeds from 2 to 18 knots are investigated as speed is incrementally increased pitch and resistance increase geometrically before maximizing in the transition region in this region the computations underpredict pitch yet resistance matches the steady state thrust measurements well second maneuverability in displacement mode at 4 knots is investigated with a zigzag maneuver time variations of heading pitch yaw rate roll and roll rate predicted by computational fluid dynamics cfd for the zigzag maneuver are in good agreement with the experimental results third the dynamic transition from displacement to planing mode is investigated by abruptly increasing the thrust beyond the craft s peak resistance beyond the resistance maximum the vehicle experiences a sharp increase in speed and drop in pitch angle experiment and simulation conclude similarly with an abrupt cut to propulsion resulting in a quick deceleration which is overcome by its own wake simulated kinematics of the deceleration are remarkably accurate suggesting valid computations of the transient drag wake generation and vehicle response to waves keywords planing craft maneuvers planing transition 1 introduction and objectives amphibious vehicles have increasing application in industry defense search and rescue recreation and coastal research incoul et al 2014 the common functions of amphibians and the weight associated with two propulsion systems dictate that such multi mode craft are often heavy vehicles that operate like traditional displacement vessels a small subset of amphibians operate as planing craft though the size and mass of these vehicles remain large compared to conventional planing craft heavier vehicles can be expected to transition to planing mode at higher froude numbers than lighter weight craft as higher pressures and therefore higher speeds are needed to provide the necessary lift thus incurring a larger resistance before transitioning to planing this work examines through concurrent experiments and high fidelity computations the full scale hydrodynamic performance of an amphibious planing craft in calm water despite a growing body of studies on ships and boats that operate in displacement and planing modes there is limited literature on the behavior of small amphibious vehicles this article

explained through the language of statics what follows is a description of attitude hull pressure and resultant forces as a planing craft s speed is steadily incremented intended to serve as a touchstone for the results presented later values of interest are underlined at low speeds a typical craft operates in a displacement mode with nearly even keel the bow acting as the leading face experiences the maximum pressure resulting in a growing resistance and trimming moment most of the hull surface remains nearly parallel to the relative flow imparting a small but initially strengthening suction on the region the transom as the trailing face becomes fully ventilated at speeds corresponding to f r 0 25 in accordance with the dynamic boundary condition of the free surface here the volumetric froude number is defined as f r u 0 g 1 3 with u 0 the characteristic vehicle velocity g the acceleration of gravity and the volumetric displacement at rest the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic pressures come into equilibrium through sinkage and the forward bias of the hydrodynamic distribution is balanced by an aft biased hydrostatic distribution resulting from a small positive change in pitch the speed of maximum sinkage occurs typically for f r 0 5 savitski 1964 the hydrodynamic pressure bias increases alongside pitch through increasing speeds in the displacement mode that is to say the angle between the keel and the relative upstream flow congruent with the angle between the thrust vector and the horizontal plane widens increasing net hull bottom pressure and consequently resistance and dynamic lift the vehicle will continue to trim by the bow and the center of gravity will rise as displacement shrinks one refers to the vehicle as semi planing when the dynamic lift becomes positive the transition from displacement to semi planing is typically unspectacular but the corresponding speed of semi planing transition nonetheless serves as a point of comparison among planing craft the vessel transitions to planing upon hitting a critical pitch value that nearly coincides with bow emergence the relief of pressure at the bow accompanies a fall off of resistance and substantial decrease of the hydrodynamic trimming moment while the dynamic pressure on the inclined hull remains high enough to maintain lift as vehicle speed increases past the transition point were the vessel to maintain its attitude the strengthening pressure on the inclined wetted surface of the hull would impart an unbalanced moment therefore if there exists a stable static trim angle the vessel pitch gradually decreases initially lowering resistance hydrodynamic lift and displacement commonly approach asymptotes corresponding to a minimum resistance in the practical case a craft that has just transitioned to planing will accelerate through this unstable portion of the speed resistance curve past the minimum resistance point and to a self propulsion condition of higher speed within the planing regime in independent numerical studies mousaviraad et al 2015 and sukas et al 2017 used fridsma s prismatic geometry fridsma 1969 to study the hydrodynamics of planing hulls and to test current computational tools capabilities they observed that the trim of the hull increases with froude number until the quantity peaks at the threshold of the transition to planing mode experiments show that the resistance increases with froude number in displacement mode before dropping slightly upon transition from displacement to planing mode producing a local maximum followed by an unstable speed range while sukas et al 2017 predicted this behavior mousaviraad et al 2015 show a monotonically increasing resistance trend both groups predicted trim and rise satisfactorily it is of interest to understand the hydrodynamic response of waterjet propelled craft with nozzle steering for performing safe and effective maneuvering operations lin et al 2010 proposed a physics based analytical model for predicting the ship maneuvering performance in calm water as well as in waves kim and kim 2017 observed an increase in speed reduction ratio of a waterjet propelled ship as the tactical diameter increased for values below 7 ship lengths for tactical diameters greater than 7 ship lengths the speed reduction ratio approaches unity kim and kim 2017 showed that waterjet propelled planing crafts turn through low tactical diameters and experience lower speed reductions compared to the planing vessels with rudders and propellers they also observed that at the beginning of the turn the waterjet propelled vessel experiences maximum roll angle though this behavior is dependent on the vessel s hydrostatic properties and the line of action of the waterjet nozzle with respect to the center of gravity during the turn the authors found the expected result that the direction of the roll angle depends on nozzle angle and boat turning speed as these two effects produce the main rolling moments in the present work simulations were carried out at constant speeds in the range of 4 18 knots experiments were also conducted for speeds of 0 18 knots the dynamics of pitch thrust and roll during steady operation and transient maneuvers are discussed in detail the paper is organized as follows 3 and 4 present the particulars of the amphibious craft the experimental methodology details of the numerical techniques and the simulation grids respectively in 5 comparisons between cfd and experimental thrust craft attitude and flow fields are presented 6 shows the characteristics of zigzag motions of the craft respectively and conclusions are presented in 7 3 experimental method 3 1 test vehicle the test vehicle is a self propelled single seat variant of the gibbs quadski gibbs sports amphibians inc 2016 shown in fig 1 retrofitted for remote control and data acquisition the remote control system drive by wire dbw consists of communication devices and actuators for powering system monitoring steering driving and wheel retraction this system enables rider less operation eliminating the complexity of a shifting mass the amphibious vehicle particulars were determined in a commercial vehicle inertia measurement facility in land configuration wheels deployed and recalculated for the water configuration wheels retracted additionally the static trim and waterline were determined in an indoor pool to consider small changes due to additional instrumentation the total mass mass centroid location and moments of inertia are given in table 1 it is important to note that given the relatively small dimensions of the vehicle small changes in its configuration can greatly affect its mass distribution and thus its hydrodynamic behavior for instance approximately 5 of the weight corresponds to fuel when the tank is full similarly during tests water became trapped in the cowling and hull or pooled in the footwells the presence of this unconfined liquid as part of the system not only modifies the weight and its distribution in an unexpected fashion but also can produce sloshing and produce dynamic effects on the vehicle motions that are extremely difficult to assess and thus to incorporate into a computational model 3 2 instrumentation and data acquisition the vehicle mounted data acquisition system is illustrated in fig 2 the data acquisition device national instruments crio 9045 was programmed to digitally log and time stamp data from the three sensing sub systems comprised of the can bus serial connections and analog sensor network these data are logged at the rates provided in table 2 the salient can bus data are throttle position steering angle steady vehicle speed fuel level engine and shaft speeds and estimated crankshaft torque all signals were measured with the vehicle s native sensors and recorded using a ni 9862 can module added instrumentation included an impeller thrust sensor and a gnss ins sensor unit for accurate measurement of vessel kinematics over a wide range of time scales the thrust sensor is a compact honeywell piezoresistive transducer that measures the pressure in a hydraulic floating bearing supporting the pump impeller the calibration of this device was derived experimentally by simulating the impeller s reaction force with a hydraulic press and measuring the force through a pre calibrated load cell the calibration uses a linear fit with r 2 0 999 and an estimated calibration error of 170 n 1 9 fs at a 95 confidence level thrust data were recorded using a ni 9239 module with 24 bit a d resolution the gnss ins unit is a spatial dual manufactured by advanced navigation the ins is equipped with triaxial accelerometer gyroscope and magnetometer and augmented by two gps antennas during tests the differential gps locations are stored at approximately 20 hz while inertial and magnetometry data are stored at a higher data rate data from the ins were streamed to the crio over an rs 232 bus at a rate of 921 6 kbaud and stored in a raw binary format to minimize on line processing approximately 24 h after data are recorded when historical ephemeris data became available the ins data were post processed to correct for systematic gps errors and a sensor fusion filter was used to assimilate the corrected gps data with inertial records for high accuracy 6 dof motion records gnss pulse per second data from this unit was also recorded as both timestamps and waveform for the purpose of rigorous post synchronization which is illustrated in fig 2 by a second digital output line and an analog output experiments were conducted on a placid reservoir on a morning with observably low wind and no other boat traffic remote control of the vehicle was performed manually for all tests straight ahead runs were executed with a constant throttle command and minimal steering inputs to maintain course a necessity given the outfitted vehicle s bias to the port side these runs were analyzed over a timeframe of steady vehicle velocity the test of the dynamic transition was executed by throttling up to approximately 70 of maximum throttle and after approximately 20 s abruptly returning the throttle to zero this test was performed for analysis of the transient behavior zigzag maneuvers were performed by issuing steering commands to the tempo of a metronome while maintaining throttle position steering commands consisted of alternating port and starboard deflections of the nozzle to 20 from centerline with periodicity of 4 and 8 s 4 numerical approach the computations are carried out using rex a general purpose naval hydrodynamics software package developed at the university of iowa the free surface is modeled using a single phase level set approach carrica et al 2007a equations are solved in the water phase with appropriate boundary conditions imposed at the free surface the navier stokes equations are solved using finite difference schemes on curvilinear coordinates in body fitted structured multiblock grids overset connectivity is used to link the grids and to move grids following the predicted body evolution carrica et al 2007b carrica et al 2010b the convective and viscous terms are discretized employing fourth order upwind biased and second order central schemes respectively whereas the second order backward euler scheme is used for performing the time integration a projection method which provides strong pressure velocity coupling is employed to satisfy the incompressibility condition li and carrica 2018 the dynamic overset domain connectivity information is obtained at run time employing suggar noack et al 2009 in the present self propulsion simulations the target speed is achieved using a proportional integral pi speed controller actuating on the propeller rotational speed as described by carrica et al 2010a and mofidi and carrica 2014 and a body force implementation is used to impose the water jet thrust as discussed in the next section a predictor corrector six degrees of freedom 6dof solver included in rex is used to compute the vehicle motions complete details of the numerical methods used in rex can be obtained found in li and carrica 2018 li et al 2019 and references therein 4 1 grids and conditions the amphibious craft is discretized with structured overset grids the cowling and suspension components are neglected fig 3 shows a view of the surface grid table 3 presents the resolution of the grid system a refinement block is added around the vehicle to better resolve the flow near the craft and to improve the overset connectivity in the composite grid fig 4 the background grid is adequately refined near z 0 the plane of the static free surface all grids except the background grid form a dynamic group with the vehicle moving rigidly in six degrees of freedom the background grid translates in the horizontal plane and rotates about the vertical axis only in order to maintain alignment with the horizontal free surface and thus is not coupled to the vehicle s orientation the waterjet nozzle is a 1dof sub system of the amphibious vehicle a child of the main body in overset nomenclature and pivots around its axis of rotation for steering quantities are non dimensionalized using the amphibious vehicle length l and characteristic forward speed u 0 the reynolds number and displacement froude number for the simulations are then defined respectively as r e u 0 l ν and f r u 0 1 3 g where ν represents the kinematic viscosity of the water for all the simulations the nondimensional time step is set to δ t u 0 l 0 0025 the impeller and stator of the water jet are not included in the present model due to the excessive computational cost of solving the fast rotation of the impeller which would severely reduce the possible time step used in the computation alternatively a body force is imposed to the fluid in a cylindrical region inside the waterjet approximately in the same location where the impeller is located the body force is uniformly distributed and no swirl is imposed to the fluid this approximates the effect of the stator regarding the induced rotation of the fluid the resulting thrust force is also considered in the 6dof equations of the vehicle the body force is represented in the model by a thrust coefficient distribution as a function of the advance ratio the nominal rotational speed n of the impeller can then be fixed or used as a control input for self propulsion a pi controller is used such that where p and i respectively represent the proportional and integral constants of the controller and e u is the error between the target speed and the speed of the craft at time t for the two maneuvers presented thrust is imposed as well as the nozzle deflection history self propulsion and acceleration deceleration maneuvers are solved with the craft free to sink and trim only while the zig zag maneuver is solved using the full free body 5 results 5 1 self propulsion fig 5 shows the dynamic lift ratio as a fraction of the vehicle weight as a function of speed panel a and the rise of the vehicle s center of gravity with respect to speed panel b the lifting effect of the thrust is also included as it can support up to 14 of weight during the semi planing mode when pitch angle and thrust are largest for speeds under 5 5 knots fr 0 5 the craft experiences an increasing downward hydrodynamic force due to suction on the hull s bottom surface see also fig 6 a consequently the vehicle experiences increasing sinkage over this range as seen in fig 5b this dynamic sinkage agrees with the observations of sukas et al 2017 who reported that as the froude number increases up to fr 0 67 displacement increases the hydrodynamic sinkage force reaches zero at approximately 6 5 knots as the speed is further increased the dynamic ratio increases monotonically the vertical rise in the center of gravity replicates the behavior across the entire speed range fig 6 illustrates the instantaneous pressure distribution on the hull s bottom surface and the free surface deformation in the displacement and planing regimes fig 6a reveals that this wetted surface experiences suction resulting in the hydrodynamic sinkage force shown in fig 5 fig 6b and c are examples of semi planing and planing conditions at a relatively low speed and high pitch angle panel b 8 knots and low pitch panel c 18 knots notice the strong moment caused by the pressure distribution resulting in a large bow up pitching moment at 18 knots the pressure on the stern side recovers considerably leading to decrease in the pressure difference between the bow and stern ends and decreasing the pitching moment at higher speeds su et al 2012 argued that the recovery of pressure at the stern is due to the increase in the distance between the stern and rooster tail for increasing speeds which is observed in the present simulations while moving with a steady displacement speed a vehicle induces a kelvin wake pattern delimited by an angle with measure independent of speed body length and gravitational acceleration however it has been observed that for f r 0 7 the angle of maximum wave height narrows and no longer coincides with the delimiting angle rabaud and moisy 2013 darmon et al 2014 the components of the wake demonstrate at least one other related speed dependent behavior diverging waves amplify with increasing froude number while transverse waves attenuate lighthill 1978 the wake comparison of fig 7 demonstrates a narrowing angle amplifying diverging waves and attenuating transverse waves as well as bow emergence and transom ventilation in the high speed cases a rooster tail and breakers at the still submerged footwells are clearly observed at the intermediate speed fig 7b at the highest speed considered converging flow does not occur near the transom eliminating the rooster tail and reducing resistance similar conclusions can be made based on the flow sections presented in the right columns of fig 7 which show an increase in the streamlining of the flow and consequently reduced form drag notice areas of negative velocity near the bow at the low and intermediate speeds negative velocities in the waterjet inlet at 18 knots as well as areas high pressure see fig 6c are likely to result in reduced efficiency at this and higher speeds ultimately contributing to limiting the maximum speed achievable in fig 8 a pitch measured from the hydrostatic attitude predicted by the present simulations as a function of craft speed is compared to experimental values good overall agreement is observed in the displacement and fully planing modes however the maximum pitch angle is underpredicted near the point of transition to planing the increasing and decreasing behavior of the pitch angle in fig 8a previously described with regards to the observed flow at different froude numbers is consistent with the analytical prediction of trim by savitski 1964 and the results reported by lotfi et al 2015 and sukas et al 2017 who showed that the dynamic trim increases in the displacement regime before decreasing in the planing regime multiple possible reasons exist that can affect the underprediction of the critical pitch angle some possibly related to modeling errors but also to uncertainty in the actual conditions of the experimental run small variations of less than 1 in static trim for the vehicle during different experiments suggest that variability in the mass properties specifically those due to fuel consumption or a small amount of water in the bilge exist which are difficult to replicate numerically other simulation parameters that have large effect on pitch such as the waterjet action line are subject to uncertainty thrust is also compared between experimental and numerical results in fig 8b the agreement is good across the range of speeds tested in self propulsion thrust less propulsion losses is in equilibrium with resistance tahara et al 2006 as a result measured thrust is proportional to the resistance and can be used as a surrogate for the latter results are consistent with those of lotfi et al 2015 mousaviraad et al 2015 and sukas et al 2017 as well as profiles proposed by savitski 1964 as referred to by sukas et al 2017 for a planing hull via an analytical approach the curve is characterized by a steep increase in resistance experienced by a vessel as fr increases in displacement mode followed by a slight decrease at intermediate velocities and finally an increase with further increase in fr as described previously the intermediate range of speeds between 6 5 and 16 knots is unstable and it was not possible to maintain steady operation at these speeds during experiments steady state simulations at these speeds were made possible by the introduction of the speed controller it is interesting to further analyze the different components of the resistance from the cfd results fig 9 separates the contributions of hydrodynamic pressure hydrostatic pressure and friction as well as presenting the evolution of wetted area with craft speed the latter evolves consistently with the rise of the center of gravity increasing to a maximum at about 6 5 knots and decreasing monotonically afterwards friction forces are as expected small compared to form drag and increase monotonically with speed the dynamic pressure force increases steeply in the displacement and semi planing regimes but remains approximately constant at high speed at least in the range evaluated a distinct peak in resistance is attributable to the hydrostatic pressure which increases sharply as the transom ventilates and decreases again as the craft cg rises and the transom draft decreases notice that immediately before this peak the hydrostatic component is negative effectively contributing to the propulsion of the craft this is a result of the upwelling of the fluid at the transom past typical water levels at these fr values in a displacement craft due to the large pitch angle of the vehicle fluctuations of all drag components shown in fig 9 by their standard deviations magnified by a factor of 20 is larger in the displacement regime and during transition but in all cases they remain relatively small with the exception of the hydrostatic component at low speeds variability for this quantity is associated with splashing and unsteadiness of the free surface and it is of little consequence to the dynamics of the craft forces and area fluctuations are similar particularly in the planing regime less than 1 of the mean values while in the displacement regime forces fluctuate in the order of 2 4 of the mean values indicating more complex dynamics that cannot be explained by a change in wetted area alone 5 2 transition from displacement to planing at constant thrust the previous section focused on the analysis of the flow at constant speed however a large range of speeds could not be explored experimentally due to the unstable characteristics of the resistance curve in the range 10 16 knots as shown these intermediate speeds in the planing regime can be simulated using a controller alternatively the transient behavior between displacement and planing regimes can be studied by impulsively increasing the thrust and observing the evolution of the system to a new equilibrium point fig 10 presents the evolution of the craft s thrust velocity and pitch following a step increase in the thrust the craft began in the displacement regime moving steadily at 5 5 knots before the thrust was increased by approximately 50 for 20 s at which point the throttle was reduced to a near zero value a video of the experiment and an animation of the cfd results are shown in the accompanying video1 note that spraying and bubbly flow in the wake clearly observed in the experiment are not modeled in the present simulations and while the current results suggest their effect on the overall craft dynamics to be small further investigation on these phenomena might be of interest the simulation was initialized by matching the experimental speed in displacement mode as a result there exists a small discrepancy in thrust and pitch angle between the experimental and numerical cases consistent with differences discussed in 5 1 where it was shown that small changes in speed at the higher end of the displacement regime result in large changes in resistance and craft pitch these differences have little effect on the evolution of the system once the thrust is increased the excess or net thrust results in an acceleration of the craft as well as an increase in pitch the instantaneous resistance r estimated from thrust t and the craft mass m and acceleration a as r m a t is shown in fig 11 the net thrust is smallest at the beginning of the transition and speed increases slowly while pitch changes more rapidly consistent with the steady state results shown previously after the maximum pitch angle is reached resistance drops causing a more rapid acceleration of the craft until thrust and resistance are again in equilibrium at a higher speed the differences in predicted versus measured pitch near the quasi steady states at the beginning and end of the acceleration are consistent with the steady state cases discussed in the previous section the transient evolution shows slightly better agreement experiments show peak pitch value of about 14 in both steady and transient cases but cfd predictions are approximately 2 higher in the transient case than in the self propulsion tests the peak speed is overpredicted by cfd consistent with a larger pitch smaller wetted area in the simulation in the fully planing regime the deceleration of the system once power to the waterjet is cut off is also very well reproduced by the simulation pitch again reaches similar albeit slightly smaller values than those observed in the steady state while transitioning from planing to displacement mode comparison of peak pitch values in fig 12 shows that the maximum occurs at higher speed when accelerating and lower speed when decelerating relative to the steady self propulsion results this is consistent with the differences in pitch moment due to excess and absence respectively of applied thrust just as for the steady case shown in 5 1 the contribution to the total force of the different fluid force sources can be analyzed from the cfd results as shown in fig 13 when comparing the accelerating decelerating portions of the maneuver as a function of craft speed the relatively small pitch angle differences have little effect in skin friction and hydrostatic longitudinal components of the force up to about 8 knots that is the range for which both conditions are firmly in the planing regime the dynamic pressure is approximately uniform in the range 8 18 knots just as for the steady however its level varies with imposed thrust reflecting the effect of the waterjet on the vehicle resistance thrust deduction secondary peaks in pitch as the vehicle approaches zero velocity are likely related to interactions of the craft with its own wake this interaction makes the deceleration evolution during the displacement regime more difficult to analyze including cycles of increasing and decreasing speed as shown by circular trajectories in figs 11 and 12 however the good agreement of the cfd simulations to this simple dynamic test at higher speeds is encouraging in regards to the simulation of maneuvers for which forces acting on the craft are also in non equilibrium conditions 6 zigzag maneuvers a variation on the standard zigzag maneuver was studied next in this test the waterjet nozzle was turned alternately 20 to port and starboard at its maximum rate every 4 s a constant waterjet speed was maintained corresponding to a nominal self propulsion speed of 4 knots fig 14 shows the time histories of heading yaw rate and speed for the craft during the zigzag motion while fig 15 presents pitch roll and roll rate only the portion of the computational and experimental runs that reaches periodic response is shown note that the heading starts with 60 to the port side and oscillates between 30 and 90 approximately with the mean being close to 60 as can be seen in fig 14 because the craft s center of gravity is located a small distance to port of the centerplane see table 1 the craft drifts slightly to port as shown by both experiments and computations in general the computational results are in good agreement with the experimental data in particular for heading and yaw rate which determine the maneuvering performance the quadski shows to be a very maneuverable vehicle with yaw rates in excess of 25 deg s likely to reach over 35 deg s if the nozzle was kept longer at 20 deflection at the maximum yaw rate immediately before the nozzle is reversed the yaw acceleration is still 4 5 deg s2 fig 14 shows fluctuations in speed with cfd maxima around the times when the waterjet nozzle is straight at zero degrees efd exhibits larger fluctuations in speed with maxima that appear to correlate with the minimum yaw rate while the craft performs turns towards port and starboard sides periodically the yaw changes with time the roll and pitch excursions during the maneuver are larger in efd than in cfd but the overall trends are consistent see fig 15 the minimum pitch occurs slightly after each steering change after heading reaches maxima and minima the experimental roll shows short overshoot peaks every time the yaw rate changes sign these not observed in cfd a possible explanation for this difference could be sloshing in the fuel tank a phenomenon not included in the cfd model despite of this the roll rate shows very good qualitative agreement with the experiments fig 16 presents vortical structures obtained as isosurfaces of q the second invariant of the velocity gradient a video of the experiment and an animation of the cfd results are shown in the accompanying video2 during the maneuver and as the vehicle drifts strong vortices are generated from the chine spray rails and bow keel indicating some degree of stabilization against drift and a role in determining the maneuvering performance the bow and rail vortices are periodically entrained into the waterjet duct potentially causing noise and vibration issues see video2 7 discussion and conclusions self propulsion and simple maneuvers of a waterjet propelled amphibious craft were investigated numerically and experimentally the results contribute to a sparse body of literature concerning full scale validation of planing simulations as well as that concerning non traditional or hybrid vehicle types the vehicle studied is distinct both from similarly sized but lighter personal watercraft and from larger craft that not only exceed the present craft dimensions but also typically possess a smaller beam to length ratio additionally the craft studied in this work possesses an uncommonly complex geometry that poses a significant challenge to high fidelity simulation especially in displacement and semi displacement modes these differences do not seem to affect the occurrence of the peak or critical pitch angle which can be used to identify transition to planing mode occurring slightly above a displacement froude number of roughly unity which for this vehicle corresponds to 5 9 knots this is consistent with expected values for a craft with small length to beam ratio however it should be noted that propulsion provides approximately 10 of the lift at the transition point suggesting that in towed conditions which are the standard conditions used for testing planing hulls transition will occur at higher fr it is also worth noticing from fig 5 that planing occurs at lower lift ratios than typical planing craft manen and oossanen 1988 this is consistent with the use of an uncommonly wide hull to counteract the large weight of the craft the numerical method performs satisfactorily in both the displacement and fully planing cases for self propulsion and acceleration deceleration tests and overall during the zigzag maneuver that is conducted at low fr results are poorer in the prediction of craft trim near the transition possible reasons are uncertainty in parametric values mass distribution including dynamic changes due to gas tank and trapped water levels and sloshing changes to thrust line action due to compliance of the waterjet drive as well as numerical and modeling errors a formal verification and validation analysis was not conducted to determine those errors due to the high computational cost of such study the complexity of the geometry precludes using a much coarser discretization than the one presented therefore systematic refinement results in extremely large computational grids the good agreement with experimental data over multiple conditions suggests that cfd does not produce unacceptably large errors so as to prevent the discussion of general trends nor does it furnish systematically biased results similar response motions for the numerical and experimental cases during the acceleration maneuver also support the validity of cfd furthermore model discrepancies specifically the lower speed associated with critical pitch and the large pitching angles in the deceleration phase at low speeds indicate that the uncertainty in the numerical results is dominated by the rigid body solver component of the simulation as it is very sensitive to the accuracy of the inertia properties the use of a body force model can also affect the pressure distribution inside the water jet and potentially affect the dynamics of the craft however it is difficult to validate or improve this simple model given the cost of a fully discretized simulation of the propulsion system the presented results of the zigzag maneuver illustrate the complex nature of the case considered and the difficulties in analysis and improving this type of simulation while the results are overall consistent with the experiments the different model data studied replicate experimental results to varying degrees in particular peak roll is underpredicted and speed variations are out of phase between the two cases both appear related to an underprediction of pitch near maximum yaw rate this can originate in deficiencies in the inertia properties of the model of the craft as previously discussed but also in the numerical model itself it is clear that further investigation of this discrepancies is required in our future work in summary the results presented support the validity of the numerical approach while some of its shortcomings have also been discussed the study also introduces a complete set of experimental results for a small full scale free running planing craft a valuable dataset which to the authors knowledge is of a brand new type in the open literature credit authorship contribution

21768,flow patterns downstream of the hollow square cylinder with slots are experimentally investigated to show effect of the slot ratio on the wake flow characteristics and turbulence statistics at reynolds number of re 6000 using the particle image velocimetry piv technique proper orthogonal decomposition pod analyses indicate that the self issuing jet dramatically changes the mechanism of vortex shedding interaction penetration of the self issuing jet into the wake region leads to increasing of the vortex formation length for low slot ratios on the other hand the self issuing jet penetrates further downstream due to increasing momentum coefficient of the jet and splits the wake region in half for high slot ratios strouhal number increases with the increasing slot ratio and it attains approximately the twofold of the solid cylinder case since the self issuing jet accelerates the vortex shedding process however turbulence statistics are significantly reduced for all slot ratios distributions of the spectral density in the wake region of the cylinder indicate that the vortex shedding instability could be reduced considerably by the slotted cylinder drag coefficient which is estimated from piv data reduces up to 42 in comparison with the solid cylinder model keywords decomposition of the spectral analysis estimated drag coefficient flow topology piv pod slotted hollow square cylinder 1 introduction the investigation of flow behind a bluff body has a considerable importance for revealing the flow and aerodynamic characteristics such as flow separation vortex shedding drag coefficient etc due to their direct effect on engineering designs in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects of flow over the bluff bodies such as vibration acoustic nose and drag force etc flow control techniques have been employed as a bluff body square section cylinder has recently been drawing attention of researchers bahrami and hacışevki 2019 ikhennicheu et al 2019 lou et al 2017 ozgoren 2006 in order to control flow around the square cylinder it is aimed to alternate directly incoming flow or wake flow since flow separation of the square cylinder occurs at sharp corners several researchers have conducted different methods to control the flow downstream of the square cylinder and to decrease the drag coefficient hangan and kim 2003 numerically studied the flow over square cylinder with slot it was found that for slotted case mean drag coefficient is reduced by 10 in comparison with the solid square cylinder planer jet injection from the rear surface of the square cylinder was studied both experimentally and numerically at re 8400 by koutmos et al 2004 they observed that the jet does not split the wake region for injection rate of ir 0 75 and four recirculation regions occur downstream of the square cylinder for ir 1 54 jet splits the wake region and leads to formation of two small wake in the near wake region of the square cylinder sarioglu et al 2005 demonstrated that the drag coefficient of the square cylinder could be reduced up to 30 when a small rod was placed upstream of the square cylinder at re 34 000 zhang et al 2005 stated that significant drag reduction could be achieved by locating the control rod in upstream of the square cylinder since the rod leads to an increase in the base suction pressure zhou et al 2005 performed a numerical study in order to control flow over the square cylinder at re 250 using control plate in the upstream they reported that the control plate reduces not only the drag coefficient of the square cylinder but also total drag coefficient of the square cylinder and the control plate the effect of the cross section geometry of control element on the flow control of the square cylinder was studied by shao and wei 2008 they show that the thin strip and square cross sectional elements are more favorable than the circular cross sectional element to suppress the vortex shedding and reduce the drag coefficient at reynolds number in the range of 11 200 102 000 akansu and firat 2010 experimentally examined the effect of jet injection from the rear surface of the square cylinder on the flow characteristics they observed that the recirculation region elongates downstream direction and the shedding frequency decreases at low flow injection rates whereas the near wake region is divided into two narrow regions by blowing flow and the shedding frequency increases at high flow injection rates yu et al 2010 numerically investigated the flow structure around porous square cylinder it is found that wake formation length of the square cylinder decreases with the increasing permeability of the square cylinder at re 20 aydin et al 2010 experimentally investigated flow the patterns of the square cylinder with holes in the reynolds number range of 200 1000 it was observed that the self issuing jet flow emanating from hole leads to elongation of the wake formation trough downstream direction at re 400 and 500 whereas it causes reduction of the wake formation length at re 750 and 1000 he et al 2014 investigated flow over a square cylinder having cut corners at the front edge they found that with the increasing cut corner size the wake region width and the drag coefficient reduce however the strohual number increases firat et al 2015 numerically observed that using of rod in the upstream of the square cylinder causes the occurrence of different flow topologies and a significant reduce in the drag coefficient of the square cylinder hsu et al 2016 showed that the jet injection from the front surface of the square cylinder reduces the drag coefficient up to 27 at re 8000 since the jet flow diminishes impingement effect of freestream sarioglu 2017 depicted that using of splitter plate downstream of the square cylinder diminishes drag coefficient up to 21 depending on the angle of incidence at re 30 000 huang et al 2017 experimentally investigated wake flow affected by jet injection from the rear surface of the square cylinder at reynolds number in the range of 1500 4500 it is demonstrated that four different wake flow regimes occur depending on the injection rate the effect of excitation frequency of synthetic jet on the wake flow characteristics of the square cylinder was investigated by qu et al 2017 they indicated that the drag coefficient diminishes up to 46 1 however strouhal number of the square cylinder is increased by the synthetic jet since interaction of the shear layer with the synthetic jet vortices expedites the vortex shedding proses wu et al 2018 numerically demonstrated that twisted square cylinder is remarkably effective on the suppression of the vortex induced vibration it is obtained that the reduction of the vortex induced vibration is approximately 74 at a twisted angle of 30 flow around porous square cylinder was studied numerically at low reynolds numbers by anirudh and dhinakaran 2018 it is found that flow characteristics changes abruptly with the increasing permeability value and the vortex shedding frequency is reduced at high permeability value chauhan et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the flow around the square cylinder with splitter plate they reported that the minimum strouhal number is obtained for the plate length of l 2d however the suppression of the vortex shedding is achieved for plate length l 6d gupta and saha 2019 numerically studied on flow control around the square cylinder using a small control cylinder they showed that the vortex shedding is suppressed completely and the drag reduction is achieved up to 15 when control cylinder is placed in the near wake region of the square cylinder at re 100 chauhan et al 2019 conducted an experimental study in order to investigate the effect of control cylinder located downstream on the wake flow characteristics of the square cylinder they observed that drag coefficient of the square cylinder and strouhal number could be reduced approximately 22 and 30 respectively depending on the position of the control cylinder sharma and dutta 2020 conducted an experimental study to examine the effect of flexible splitter plate on the wake flow of the square cylinder at re 600 1000 and 2000 they demonstrated that the drag coefficient and strohual number of the square cylinder could be reduced up to 47 61 and 79 41 respectively rastan et al 2020 experimentally studied the jet injection from the front face of the square cylinder to alternate flow characteristics at re 12 000 and 31 000 they examined both wavy jet and continuous jet and reported that wavy jet injection is more effective than continuous jet injection it is reported that drag coefficient of the square cylinder is reduced up to 29 and vortex shedding is suppressed by means of wavy jet injection 1 1 motivations of the present study most of the study in the literature concentrates on using of the splitter plate control rod and synthetic jet in order to control the flow around the square cylinder however the study on the flow around slotted square cylinder self issuing jet is very limited this paper presents a detailed investigation on the flow pattern downstream of the hollow square cylinder with slots and provides an insight on the effect of slots on the flow control in this study the effects of the slot ratio on the flow characteristics and turbulent statistics were determined using the piv technique at a reynolds number of re 6000 pod analyses were performed to depict the dominant flow structure downstream of the slotted square cylinder distributions of spectral density of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations were presented to show the instability of the dominant vortex shedding finally drag coefficients were estimated from piv data for each test model in order to determine the effect of the slot ratio on aerodynamic characteristics 2 experiment 2 1 experimental facility and test model experiments were performed in a close loop open water channel with a test section that has a cross section of 1 0 75 m2 in the department of mechanical engineering at cukurova university test models were fabricated by a hollow square prism made of chrome nickel steel which has a side width of d 40 mm and wall thickness of t 2 mm test models have a length of 10 25d while slots on the cylinder surface have a length of 10d slots on the test model surfaces were machined along the centerline of the front and rear surfaces slot ratio ws d was defined as the slot width ws to the cylinder width d and the experiments were conducted for five different slot ratios which were ws d 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 in order to show the effect of slot ratios on the flow patterns prominently experiments were also carried out for the solid cylinder that is ws d 0 free stream velocity was set as u 150 mm s and experiments were carried out at a reynolds number of re 6000 which was based on the cylinder width d turbulence intensity of free stream was less than 1 for the current experimental setup 2 2 particle image velocimetry measurement a dantec piv image acquisition system consisted of laser source ccd camera and timer box was used to obtain two dimensional instantaneous velocity vector maps the water channel was seeded with silver coated particles of 10 μm in diameter the measurement zone was illuminated by double pulsed nd yag laser source new wave maxima power of 120 mj at 532 nm wavelength and the movement of particles were captured by 8 bit ccd camera flowsense 2m 1600 1200 pixel at a frequency of 15 hz all measurements were performed in plain view the laser sheet having 2 mm thickness was located mid span of the test model in order to avoid the effects of bottom surface and free surface measurement zone had approximately 4 4d 3 3d in the size origin of coordinate system was revised as the center of the square cylinder a schematic illustration of test model and experimental setup are presented in fig 1 each image pairs in the measurements was captured in the time interval of 1 75 ms between laser pulses for each experiment a total of 1000 image pairs were acquired in order to ensure a good time averaged data the raw displacement vectors were determined by employing cross correlation algorithm with refinement steps from an initial integration window areas 128 128 pixels to a final integration window areas 32 32 pixels during the integration process vertical and horizontal overlaps of 50 were applied the raw velocity vectors were calculated from this displacement raw vectors using the time interval pulses by employing central difference scheme each instantaneous velocity vector map had effective grid size of 1 77 mm 1 77 mm corresponding to 99 74 vectors erroneous vectors due to shadow and reflection of laser sheet were detected by employing local median filter technique westerweel 1994 and then they were replaced with vectors calculated by local interpolation of surrounding vectors applying a bilinear least squares fit method in addition velocity vector maps were smoothed by employing gaussian smoothing method in order to prevent distinct changes in the flow fields the precision of the velocity measurement was about 2 finally flow quantities such as vorticity reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy etc were calculated 2 3 proper orthogonal decomposition analysis proper orthogonal decomposition pod analysis was performed using the snapshot pod method which was introduced by sirovich 1987 in order to reveal dominant flow structure downstream of the square cylinder the snapshot pod method have been commonly preferred by many researchers new et al 2013 shi et al 2010 wang et al 2014 wei et al 2016 zang and new 2015 in order to reveal the dominant flow structure for each test case instantaneous piv velocity maps were considered to be a snapshots thus pod analyses were carried out on 1000 snapshots at the first stage of analysis the mean velocity map was determined then the analysis was operated on the fluctuating parts of the velocity components u u v which can be expressed as 1 u u 1 u 2 u n the autocovarince matrix was created as 2 c u t and solved the eigenvalue problem 3 c a i λ i a i the solutions were ordered according to the size of the eigenvalues 4 λ 1 λ 2 λ n 0 the eigenvectors of equation 4 constituted a basis for constructing the pod modes φ i 5 φ i n 1 n a n i u n n 1 n a n i u n i 1 n the reconstruction of any original snapshots can be determined as 6 u n i 1 n a i n φ i where a i was the coefficient of each pod modes and it can be expressed as 7 a n i 1 n u i n φ i t the procedure of snapshot pod analysis was reported in detail by yin et al 2019 the snapshot pod analyses in the present study were carried out using dantec dynamicstudio version 4 0 software the first ten modes determined as most energetic modes were reconstructed since the first few mods enough to describe the dominant flow structures as that reported by meyer et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the slot ratio on the self issuing jet the variation of time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of the cylinder in downstream is shown in fig 2 a for all test cases the negative velocity profiles indicate the formation of the recirculation zones downstream of the cylinder it is observed that the recirculation zone occurs in the near wake region of the solid cylinder and streamwise velocity values significantly increase downstream direction after that zone streamwise velocities having high magnitude indicate that the flow through the slot causes a self issuing jet for the slotted cylinders penetration length of the self issuing jet could be defined as where the velocity profile reaches zero at the streamwise location it is observed that the penetration of the self issuing jet into the near wake region leads to move the recirculation zone the further location of downstream of the cylinder for ws d 0 15 on the other hand the velocity profiles of ws d 0 2 depict that the effect of recirculation zone disappears in the wake centerline since streamwise velocity decreases up to certain distance downstream of the cylinder and then it recovers before the velocity value reaches zero in order to determine the effect of the self issuing jet on the wake flow field of the cylinder non dimensional momentum coefficient is determined as 8 c μ 2 w s d u j m a x 2 u 2 where ujmax is the maximum velocity of the self issuing jet and u is the free stream velocity fig 2b presents the variation of the momentum coefficient of the self issuing jet with the slot ratio it is observed that the momentum coefficient gradually increases up to ws d 0 15 however its value suddenly increases at ws d 0 2 since the momentum of jet becomes higher than the momentum of wake 3 2 influence of the slot ratio on flow characteristics time averaged flow structures downstream of the square cylinder are demonstrated in fig 3 for all test cases each column in fig 3 presents distributions of vorticity r m s of the streamwise velocity fluctuation u r m s and reynolds shear stress u v respectively while each row shows different slot ratio it is clearly seen that vorticity clusters concentrate in the near wake region for the solid cylinder in addition high magnitudes in the contours of streamwise velocity fluctuation and reynolds shear stress indicate that strong vortex shedding occurs downstream of the solid cylinder for the slotted cylinders it is observed that the self issuing jet leads to formation of vorticity pairs with the increasing slot ratio the peak magnitudes of these vortices increase and also they extend to streamwise direction shear layers on both sides of the cylinder gradually extend up to ws d 0 1 in the streamwise direction and then they contract with the increasing slot ratio in addition the self issuing jet penetrates further downstream and splits the wake region in half especially for ws d 0 2 however the peak magnitude of vortices on both sides of the cylinder are nearly the same for all test models since flow separation of the square cylinder always occurs at sharp corners of the cylinder on the other hand distributions of u r m s and u v are remarkably affected by the slot ratio the peak magnitudes of u r m s and u v significantly decrease in comparison with the solid cylinder also the locations of the peak magnitude of u r m s and u v are moved downstream direction for ws d 0 1 for ws d 0 15 the peak magnitudes of u r m s and u v on the shear layers gradually decrease whereas the peak magnitudes of u r m s and u v stemmed from the self issuing jet increase with the increasing slot ratio however their peak magnitudes are still lower than the one obtained from the solid cylinder case 3 3 flow structures obtained by pod analysis fig 4 displays instantaneous vorticity contour and streamline topology of most energetic ten modes for all test models it is clearly seen that the shear layer rolls up into the near wake region and interact with the shear layer on the opposite side of the square cylinder this interaction leads to shedding of vortex into the wake region named as karman vortex shedding in addition large recirculation region occurs and the wake flow oscillates strongly in the vertical direction on the other hand two different vortex shedding mechanisms are detected depending on the slot ratio for slot ratio of ws d 0 1 penetration of the self issuing jet enhances the momentum transfer into the wake region and delays rolling up of the shear layers thus shear layers elongate in the streamwise direction and interaction of shear layers occurs in the far wake region for ws d 0 15 the strength of the vorticity pairs stemmed from the self issuing jet increases and they elongate in the streamwise direction with the increasing slot ratio due to increasing momentum coefficient of the self issuing jet strengthened vorticity interacts with the opposite sign shear layer on the one side of the cylinder this interaction causes the shedding of the vortex before the vorticity of the slotted cylinder grows as much as the solid cylinder therefore the size of recirculation zone downstream of the cylinder decreases with the increasing slot ratio 3 4 influence of the slot ratio on turbulence statistics in the wake region the variations of the peak magnitude of u r m s and its location in the streamwise direction with the slot ratio are presented in fig 5 a determination of the location of the peak magnitude of u r m s is important since it also indicates the vortex formation length the peak magnitude of u r m s value significantly decreases at ws d 0 05 the maximum reduction approximately 32 is obtained for ws d 0 1 after this slot ratio variation of the peak magnitude of u r m s is slightly on the other hand the vortex formation length of the solid cylinder u r m s is found as 1 3d it is observed that the formation length rapidly increases to 2 9d for ws d 0 05 and it is obtained as 2 7d for ws d 0 1 however it is found that the formation length suddenly decreases for ws d 0 15 in addition the formation length values of ws d 0 15 are almost the same with the solid cylinder case the effect of the slot ratio on the peak magnitude of turbulent kinetic energy of the cylinder and its location in the streamwise direction are demonstrated in fig 5b it is found that the peak magnitude of turbulent kinetic energy is significantly reduced also its location shifts up to 3 75d in the streamwise direction for ws d 0 1 after that slot ratio the variation of the peak magnitude of t k e slightly decreases with the increasing slot ratio whereas its location alters significantly when compared to the solid cylinder model the maximum reduction of the peak magnitude of t k e value approximately 73 is obtained for ws d 0 2 according to the obtained peak magnitudes of u r m s and t k e and their locations in the wake region it can be concluded that the slot ratio of ws d 0 1 is the most effective case for the flow control in order to obtain more quantitative information about the effect of the slot ratio on turbulence statistics variations of streamwise reynolds normal stress transverse reynolds normal stress and turbulent kinetic energy along the vertical line in the flow field are presented in fig 6 for all test models at different streamwise locations the streamwise reynolds normal stress u u profiles of the solid cylinder up to x d 2 depict that double peaks occur on both sides of the cylinder since rolling up of the shear layers into the wake region leads to an increase in the velocity gradient it is observed that the peak value of u u increases up to x d 1 5 and then they gradually decrease with the increasing streamwise location on the other hand transverse reynolds normal stress v v profiles of the solid cylinder show formation of single peak since the interaction of shedding of vortices occurs near the centerline the peak value of v v increases up to x d 2 and then gradually decreases at further locations in the streamwise for the solid cylinder double peaks of turbulent kinetic energy t k e demonstrate that u u is more dominant on production of t k e up to x d 1 5 after that location t k e profile indicates the formation of the single peak since the effect of v v on the production of t k e increases on the other hand when the turbulence statistics profiles of slotted cylinders are compared with the solid cylinder case it is clearly seen that the slotted cylinder remarkably suppresses turbulence statistics in the near wake region for ws d 0 1 triple peaks observed in the profile of u u at x d 1 due to the self issuing jet in addition turbulence statistic values gradually increase with the increasing streamwise location since the rolling up of shear layers and shedding of vortices are shifted to far wake of the cylinder by the self issuing jet for ws d 0 15 quart peaks appear in the profile of u u since the penetration of the self issuing jet divides wake region in half and the mechanism of the vortex shedding changes as discussed in section 3 3 similarly the self issuing jet leads to appearance of double peaks in the profile of v v at x d 2 3 5 spectral analysis of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations 3 5 1 strouhal number spectral analyses of velocity fluctuations were performed to determine the dominant frequency of vortex shedding for all test cases and corresponding strouhal numbers as a function of the slot ratio are presented in fig 7 the st value of the solid cylinder is found as 0 12 which is nearly the same with that one measured by yen and yang 2011 for ws d 0 1 the st value slightly increases in comparison with the solid cylinder case although vortex formation length increases significantly however the st value suddenly increases at ws d 0 15 since the self issuing jet gets dominant on the flow structure and accelerates the vortex shedding process the st value of ws d 0 2 is obtained same with the ws d 0 15 on the other hand there is an increase observed for ws d 0 25 it should be noted that variation of the st value with the slot ratio exhibits noteworthy similarity with the synthetic jet studies akansu and firat 2010 huang et al 2017 they reported that the st value of the cylinder increases with the increasing injection rate of the synthetic jet and it attains approximately the twofold of the solid cylinder case 3 5 2 distribution of the spectral density in order to obtain more information about unsteady flow field spectral densities of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations corresponding to the dominant frequency of each test case were determined at 4015 different locations in the wake region then contours were drawn to depict distribution of spectral density of velocity fluctuations in the wake region ekmekci and rockwell 2010 emphasized that the peak magnitudes of these contours could be given insight into coherence and strength of the dominant vortex shedding each column in fig 8 shows the distributions of spectral density of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations respectively while each row presents different test case for the solid cylinder distributions of the spectral density indicate that the dominant vortex shedding leads to intensify unsteadiness in the near wake region on the other hand it is observed that unsteadiness is remarkably affected by the slot ratio the contours of ws d 0 05 depict that strong vortex shedding occurs in the wake region however instabilities of dominant vortex shedding congregate further downstream of the cylinder for ws d 0 1 the decreasing of peak magnitudes of spectral density indicates that the coherence and strength of the dominant vortex shedding are reduced it is observed that the self issuing jet leads to enhancing of vortex shedding instability in the near wake region for ws d 0 15 however it significantly decreases for ws d 0 2 on the other hand the frequency of the dominant vortex shedding increases for ws d 0 25 although the instability of the dominant vortex shedding decreases significantly it can be concluded that although the frequency of dominant vortex shedding increases with the increasing slot ratio instability of the dominant vortex shedding could be significantly reduced by the self issuing jet 3 6 estimated drag coefficient drag coefficients for all test cases were estimated from piv data using momentum integral theorem that is modified with considering components of velocity fluctuation by bohl and koochesfahani 2009 the expression is given as 9 c d 2 d h h u u 1 u u v r m s 2 u r m s 2 u 2 1 2 u f 2 u 2 1 d y where u is the mean streamwise velocity u is freestream velocity uf is maximum velocity outside of the wake region u r m s and v r m s are streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations respectively fig 9 presents that the variation of drag coefficient of the square cylinder with the slot ratio estimated drag coefficient of the solid cylinder is found as 1 87 which is in good agreement with the experimental result of yen and yang 2011 it is found that drag coefficient decreases up to 1 08 for ws d 0 05 after that the drag coefficient slightly increases up to ws d 0 15 however its value is still 38 lower than that obtained for the solid cylinder case similar to the increase in the drag coefficient is also observed by gao et al 2017 who studied flow around the circular cylinder with slot they reported that this situation could be related to a flip flop flow it is observed that the drag coefficient gradually decreases for ws d 0 2 4 conclusions flow patterns downstream of the slotted hollow square cylinder are investigated experimentally at re 6000 in order to determine the influence of the slot ratio on the wake flow five different slot ratios ws d 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 are tested using the particle image velocimetry piv technique and the obtained results are compared with the solid square cylinder case it is found that flow through slot causes the self issuing jet and it affects wake flow characteristics and turbulence statistics remarkably two different vortex shedding mechanisms are detected downstream of the cylinder depending on the slot ratio for ws d 0 1 the penetration of the self issuing jet into the wake region delays interaction of the shear layers on both sides of the cylinder therefore the vortex formation length increases however vortex shedding frequency is nearly the same with the solid cylinder case momentum coefficient of the self issuing jet increases and the jet penetrates further downstream of the cylinder with the increasing slot ratio for ws d 0 15 vorticity stemmed from the self issuing jet interacts with the shear layer and accelerates the vortex shedding process therefore the vortex shedding frequency increases significantly while the vortex formation length decreases on the other hand turbulence statistics such as r m s of streamwise velocity fluctuations u r m s turbulent kinetic energy t k e and reynolds shear stress u v are considerably suppressed for all slot ratios in comparison with the solid cylinder case for ws d 0 1 the peak magnitudes of u r m s t k e and u v are reduced by 32 67 and 61 respectively also their locations in the streamwise move further downstream with respect to the solid cylinder case in addition distributions of the spectral density depict that vortex shedding instability is significantly reduced for ws d 0 1 0 2 and 0 25 although the frequency of the vortex shedding increases it is also observed that the slotted square cylinder reduces the drag coefficient for all slot ratios the maximum reduction of drag coefficient approximately 42 is obtained for ws d 0 05 credit authorship

21768,flow patterns downstream of the hollow square cylinder with slots are experimentally investigated to show effect of the slot ratio on the wake flow characteristics and turbulence statistics at reynolds number of re 6000 using the particle image velocimetry piv technique proper orthogonal decomposition pod analyses indicate that the self issuing jet dramatically changes the mechanism of vortex shedding interaction penetration of the self issuing jet into the wake region leads to increasing of the vortex formation length for low slot ratios on the other hand the self issuing jet penetrates further downstream due to increasing momentum coefficient of the jet and splits the wake region in half for high slot ratios strouhal number increases with the increasing slot ratio and it attains approximately the twofold of the solid cylinder case since the self issuing jet accelerates the vortex shedding process however turbulence statistics are significantly reduced for all slot ratios distributions of the spectral density in the wake region of the cylinder indicate that the vortex shedding instability could be reduced considerably by the slotted cylinder drag coefficient

hollow square cylinder 1 introduction the investigation of flow behind a bluff body has a considerable importance for revealing the flow and aerodynamic characteristics such as flow separation vortex shedding drag coefficient etc due to their direct effect on engineering designs in order to avoid or minimize adverse effects of flow over the bluff bodies such as vibration acoustic nose and drag force etc flow control techniques have been employed as a bluff body square section cylinder has recently been drawing attention of researchers bahrami and hacışevki 2019 ikhennicheu et al 2019 lou et al 2017 ozgoren 2006 in order to control flow around the square cylinder it is aimed to alternate directly incoming flow or wake flow since flow separation of the square cylinder occurs at sharp corners several researchers have conducted different methods to control the flow downstream of the square cylinder and to decrease the drag coefficient hangan and kim 2003 numerically studied the flow over square cylinder with slot it was found that for slotted case mean drag coefficient is reduced by 10 in comparison with the solid square cylinder planer jet injection from the rear surface of the square cylinder was studied both experimentally and numerically at re 8400 by koutmos et al 2004 they observed that the jet does not split the wake region for injection rate of ir 0 75 and four recirculation regions occur downstream of the square cylinder for ir 1 54 jet splits the wake region and leads to formation of two small wake in the near wake region of the square cylinder sarioglu et al 2005 demonstrated that the drag coefficient of the square cylinder could be reduced up to 30 when a small rod was placed upstream of the square cylinder at re 34 000 zhang et al 2005 stated that significant drag reduction could be achieved by locating the control rod in upstream of the square cylinder since the rod leads to an increase in the base suction pressure zhou et al 2005 performed a numerical study in order to control flow over the square cylinder at re 250 using control plate in the upstream they reported that the control plate reduces not only the drag coefficient of the square cylinder but also total drag coefficient of the square cylinder and the control plate the effect of the cross section geometry of control element on the flow control of the square cylinder was studied by shao and wei 2008 they show that the thin strip and square cross sectional elements are more favorable than the circular cross sectional element to suppress the vortex shedding and reduce the drag coefficient at reynolds number in the range of 11 200 102 000 akansu and firat 2010 experimentally examined the effect of jet injection from the rear surface of the square cylinder on the flow characteristics they observed that the recirculation region elongates downstream direction and the shedding frequency decreases at low flow injection rates whereas the near wake region is divided into two narrow regions by blowing flow and the shedding frequency increases at high flow injection rates yu et al 2010 numerically investigated the flow structure around porous square cylinder it is found that wake formation length of the square cylinder decreases with the increasing permeability of the square cylinder at re 20 aydin et al 2010 experimentally investigated flow the patterns of the square cylinder with holes in the reynolds number range of 200 1000 it was observed that the self issuing jet flow emanating from hole leads to elongation of the wake formation trough downstream direction at re 400 and 500 whereas it causes reduction of the wake formation length at re 750 and 1000 he et al 2014 investigated flow over a square cylinder having cut corners at the front edge they found that with the increasing cut corner size the wake region width and the drag coefficient reduce however the strohual number increases firat et al 2015 numerically observed that using of rod in the upstream of the square cylinder causes the occurrence of different flow topologies and a significant reduce in the drag coefficient of the square cylinder hsu et al 2016 showed that the jet injection from the front surface of the square cylinder reduces the drag coefficient up to 27 at re 8000 since the jet flow diminishes impingement effect of freestream sarioglu 2017 depicted that using of splitter plate downstream of the square cylinder diminishes drag coefficient up to 21 depending on the angle of incidence at re 30 000 huang et al 2017 experimentally investigated wake flow affected by jet injection from the rear surface of the square cylinder at reynolds number in the range of 1500 4500 it is demonstrated that four different wake flow regimes occur depending on the injection rate the effect of excitation frequency of synthetic jet on the wake flow characteristics of the square cylinder was investigated by qu et al 2017 they indicated that the drag coefficient diminishes up to 46 1 however strouhal number of the square cylinder is increased by the synthetic jet since interaction of the shear layer with the synthetic jet vortices expedites the vortex shedding proses wu et al 2018 numerically demonstrated that twisted square cylinder is remarkably effective on the suppression of the vortex induced vibration it is obtained that the reduction of the vortex induced vibration is approximately 74 at a twisted angle of 30 flow around porous square cylinder was studied numerically at low reynolds numbers by anirudh and dhinakaran 2018 it is found that flow characteristics changes abruptly with the increasing permeability value and the vortex shedding frequency is reduced at high permeability value chauhan et al 2018 carried out an experimental study on the flow around the square cylinder with splitter plate they reported that the minimum strouhal number is obtained for the plate length of l 2d however the suppression of the vortex shedding is achieved for plate length l 6d gupta and saha 2019 numerically studied on flow control around the square cylinder using a small control cylinder they showed that the vortex shedding is suppressed completely and the drag reduction is achieved up to 15 when control cylinder is placed in the near wake region of the square cylinder at re 100 chauhan et al 2019 conducted an experimental study in order to investigate the effect of control cylinder located downstream on the wake flow characteristics of the square cylinder they observed that drag coefficient of the square cylinder and strouhal number could be reduced approximately 22 and 30 respectively depending on the position of the control cylinder sharma and dutta 2020 conducted an experimental study to examine the effect of flexible splitter plate on the wake flow of the square cylinder at re 600 1000 and 2000 they demonstrated that the drag coefficient and strohual number of the square cylinder could be reduced up to 47 61 and 79 41 respectively rastan et al 2020 experimentally studied the jet injection from the front face of the square cylinder to alternate flow characteristics at re 12 000 and 31 000 they examined both wavy jet and continuous jet and reported that wavy jet injection is more effective than continuous jet injection it is reported that drag coefficient of the square cylinder is reduced up to 29 and vortex shedding is suppressed by means of wavy jet injection 1 1 motivations of the present study most of the study in the literature concentrates on using of the splitter plate control rod and synthetic jet in order to control the flow around the square cylinder however the study on the flow around slotted square cylinder self issuing jet is very limited this paper presents a detailed investigation on the flow pattern downstream of the hollow square cylinder with slots and provides an insight on the effect of slots on the flow control in this study the effects of the slot ratio on the flow characteristics and turbulent statistics were determined using the piv technique at a reynolds number of re 6000 pod analyses were performed to depict the dominant flow structure downstream of the slotted square cylinder distributions of spectral density of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations were presented to show the instability of the dominant vortex shedding finally drag coefficients were estimated from piv data for each test model in order to determine the effect of the slot ratio on aerodynamic characteristics 2 experiment 2 1 experimental facility and test model experiments were performed in a close loop open water channel with a test section that has a cross section of 1 0 75 m2 in the department of mechanical engineering at cukurova university test models were fabricated by a hollow square prism made of chrome nickel steel which has a side width of d 40 mm and wall thickness of t 2 mm test models have a length of 10 25d while slots on the cylinder surface have a length of 10d slots on the test model surfaces were machined along the centerline of the front and rear surfaces slot ratio ws d was defined as the slot width ws to the cylinder width d and the experiments were conducted for five different slot ratios which were ws d 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 in order to show the effect of slot ratios on the flow patterns prominently experiments

99 74 vectors erroneous vectors due to shadow and reflection of laser sheet were detected by employing local median filter technique westerweel 1994 and then they were replaced with vectors calculated by local interpolation of surrounding vectors applying a bilinear least squares fit method in addition velocity vector maps were smoothed by employing gaussian smoothing method in order to prevent distinct changes in the flow fields the precision of the velocity measurement was about 2 finally flow quantities such as vorticity reynolds shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy etc were calculated 2 3 proper orthogonal decomposition analysis proper orthogonal decomposition pod analysis was performed using the snapshot pod method which was introduced by sirovich 1987 in order to reveal dominant flow structure downstream of the square cylinder the snapshot pod method have been commonly preferred by many researchers new et al 2013 shi et al 2010 wang et al 2014 wei et al 2016 zang and new 2015 in order to reveal the dominant flow structure for each test case instantaneous piv velocity maps were considered to be a snapshots thus pod analyses were carried out on 1000 snapshots at the first stage of analysis the mean velocity map was determined then the analysis was operated on the fluctuating parts of the velocity components u u v which can be expressed as 1 u u 1 u 2 u n the autocovarince matrix was created as 2 c u t and solved the eigenvalue problem 3 c a i λ i a i the solutions were ordered according to the size of the eigenvalues 4 λ 1 λ 2 λ n 0 the eigenvectors of equation 4 constituted a basis for constructing the pod modes φ i 5 φ i n 1 n a n i u n n 1 n a n i u n i 1 n the reconstruction of any original snapshots can be determined as 6 u n i 1 n a i n φ i where a i was the coefficient of each pod modes and it can be expressed as 7 a n i 1 n u i n φ i t the procedure of snapshot pod analysis was reported in detail by yin et al 2019 the snapshot pod analyses in the present study were carried out using dantec dynamicstudio version 4 0 software the first ten modes determined as most energetic modes were reconstructed since the first few mods enough to describe the dominant flow structures as that reported by meyer et al 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of the slot ratio on the self issuing jet the variation of time averaged streamwise velocity along the centerline of the cylinder in downstream is shown in fig 2 a for all test cases the negative velocity profiles indicate the formation of the recirculation zones downstream of the cylinder it is observed that the recirculation zone occurs in the near wake region of the solid cylinder and streamwise velocity values significantly increase downstream direction after that zone streamwise velocities having high magnitude indicate that the flow through the slot causes a self issuing jet for the slotted cylinders penetration length of the self issuing jet could be defined as where the velocity profile reaches zero at the streamwise location it is observed that the penetration of the self issuing jet into the near wake region leads to move the recirculation zone the further location of downstream of the cylinder for ws d 0 15 on the other hand the velocity profiles of ws d 0 2 depict that the effect of recirculation zone disappears in the wake centerline since streamwise velocity decreases up to certain distance downstream of the cylinder and then it recovers before the velocity value reaches zero in order to determine the effect of the self issuing jet on the wake flow field of the cylinder non dimensional momentum coefficient is determined as 8 c μ 2 w s d u j m a x 2 u 2 where ujmax is the maximum velocity of the self issuing jet and u is the free stream velocity fig 2b presents the variation of the momentum coefficient of the self issuing jet with the slot ratio it is observed that the momentum coefficient gradually increases up to ws d 0 15 however its value suddenly increases at ws d 0 2 since the momentum of jet becomes higher than the momentum of wake 3 2 influence of the slot ratio on flow characteristics time averaged flow structures downstream of the square cylinder are demonstrated in fig 3 for all test cases each column in fig 3 presents distributions of vorticity r m s of the streamwise velocity fluctuation u r m s and reynolds shear stress u v respectively while each row shows different slot ratio it is clearly seen that vorticity clusters concentrate in the near wake region for the solid cylinder in addition high magnitudes in the contours of streamwise velocity fluctuation and reynolds shear stress indicate that strong vortex shedding occurs downstream of the solid cylinder for the slotted cylinders it is observed that the self issuing jet leads to formation of vorticity pairs with the increasing slot ratio the peak magnitudes of these vortices increase and also they extend to streamwise direction shear layers on both sides of the cylinder gradually extend up to ws d 0 1 in the streamwise direction and then they contract with the increasing slot ratio in addition the self issuing jet penetrates further downstream and splits the wake region in half especially for ws d 0 2 however the peak magnitude of vortices on both sides of the cylinder are nearly the same for all test models since flow separation of the square cylinder always occurs at sharp corners of the cylinder on the other hand distributions of u r m s and u v are remarkably affected by the slot ratio the peak magnitudes of u r m s and u v significantly decrease in comparison with the solid cylinder also the locations of the peak magnitude of u r m s and u v are moved downstream direction for ws d 0 1 for ws d 0 15 the peak magnitudes of u r m s and u v on the shear layers gradually decrease whereas the peak magnitudes of u r m s and u v stemmed from the self issuing jet increase with the increasing slot ratio however their peak magnitudes are still lower than the one obtained from the solid cylinder case 3 3 flow structures obtained by pod analysis fig 4 displays instantaneous vorticity contour and streamline topology of most energetic ten modes for all test models it is clearly seen that the shear layer rolls up into the near wake region and interact with the shear layer on the opposite side of the square cylinder this interaction leads to shedding of vortex into the wake region named as karman vortex shedding in addition large recirculation region occurs and the wake flow oscillates strongly in the vertical direction on the other hand two different vortex shedding mechanisms are detected depending on the slot ratio for slot ratio of ws d 0 1 penetration of the self issuing jet enhances the momentum transfer into the wake region and delays rolling up of the shear layers thus shear layers elongate in the streamwise direction and interaction of shear layers occurs in the far wake region for ws d 0 15 the strength of the vorticity pairs stemmed from the self issuing jet increases and they elongate in the streamwise direction with the increasing slot ratio due to increasing momentum coefficient of the self issuing jet strengthened vorticity interacts with the opposite sign shear layer on the one side of the cylinder this interaction causes the shedding of the vortex before the vorticity of the slotted cylinder grows as much as the solid cylinder therefore the size of recirculation zone downstream of the cylinder decreases with the increasing slot ratio 3 4 influence of the slot ratio on turbulence statistics in the wake region the variations of the peak magnitude of u r m s and its location in the streamwise direction with the slot ratio are presented in fig 5 a determination of the location of the peak magnitude of u r m s is important since it also indicates the vortex formation length the peak magnitude of u r m s value significantly decreases at ws d 0 05 the maximum reduction approximately 32 is obtained for ws d 0 1 after this slot ratio variation of the peak magnitude of u r m s is slightly on the other hand the vortex formation length of the solid cylinder u r m s is found as 1 3d it is observed that the formation length rapidly increases to 2 9d for ws d 0 05 and it is obtained as 2 7d for ws d 0 1 however it is found that the formation length suddenly decreases for ws d 0 15 in addition the formation length values of ws d 0 15 are almost the same with the solid cylinder case the effect of the slot ratio on the peak magnitude of turbulent kinetic energy of the cylinder and its location in the streamwise direction are demonstrated in fig 5b it is found that the peak magnitude of turbulent kinetic energy is significantly reduced also its location shifts up to 3 75d in the streamwise direction for ws d 0 1 after that slot ratio the variation of the peak magnitude of t k e slightly decreases with the increasing slot ratio whereas its location alters significantly when compared to the solid cylinder model the maximum reduction of the peak magnitude of t k e value approximately 73 is obtained for ws d 0 2 according to the obtained peak magnitudes of u r m s and t k e and their locations in the wake region it can be concluded that the slot ratio of ws d 0 1 is the most effective case for the flow control in order to obtain more quantitative information about the effect of the slot ratio on turbulence statistics variations of streamwise reynolds normal stress transverse reynolds normal stress and turbulent kinetic energy along the vertical line in the flow field are presented in fig 6 for all test models at different streamwise locations the streamwise reynolds normal stress u u profiles of the solid cylinder up to x d 2 depict that double peaks occur on both sides of the cylinder since rolling up of the shear layers into the wake region leads to an increase in the velocity gradient it is observed that the peak value of u u increases up to x d 1 5 and then they gradually decrease with the increasing streamwise location on the other hand transverse reynolds normal stress v v profiles of the solid cylinder show formation of single peak since the interaction of shedding of vortices occurs near the centerline the peak value of v v increases up to x d 2 and then gradually decreases at further locations in the streamwise for the solid cylinder double peaks of turbulent kinetic energy t k e demonstrate that u u is more dominant on production of t k e up to x d 1 5 after that location t k e profile indicates the formation of the single peak since the effect of v v on the production of t k e increases on the other hand when the turbulence statistics profiles of slotted cylinders are compared with the solid cylinder case it is clearly seen that the slotted cylinder remarkably suppresses turbulence statistics in the near wake region for ws d 0 1 triple peaks observed in the profile of u u at x d 1 due to the self issuing jet in addition turbulence statistic values gradually increase with the increasing streamwise location since the rolling up of shear layers and shedding of vortices are shifted to far wake of the cylinder by the self issuing jet for ws d 0 15 quart peaks appear in the profile of u u since the penetration of the self issuing jet divides wake region in half and the mechanism of the vortex shedding changes as discussed in section 3 3 similarly the self issuing jet leads to appearance of double peaks in the profile of v v at x d 2 3 5 spectral analysis of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations 3 5 1 strouhal number spectral analyses of velocity fluctuations were performed to determine the dominant frequency of vortex shedding for all test cases and corresponding strouhal numbers as a function of the slot ratio are presented in fig 7 the st value of the solid cylinder is found as 0 12 which is nearly the same with that one measured by yen and yang 2011 for ws d 0 1 the st value slightly increases in comparison with the solid cylinder case although vortex formation length increases significantly however the st value suddenly increases at ws d 0 15 since the self issuing jet gets dominant on the flow structure and accelerates the vortex shedding process the st value of ws d 0 2 is obtained same with the ws d 0 15 on the other hand there is an increase observed for ws d 0 25 it should be noted that variation of the st value with the slot ratio exhibits noteworthy similarity with the synthetic jet studies akansu and firat 2010 huang et al 2017 they reported that the st value of the cylinder increases with the increasing injection rate of the synthetic jet and it attains approximately the twofold of the solid cylinder case 3 5 2 distribution of the spectral density in order to obtain more information about unsteady flow field spectral densities of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations corresponding to the dominant frequency of each test case were determined at 4015 different locations in the wake region then contours were drawn to depict distribution of spectral density of velocity fluctuations in the wake region ekmekci and rockwell 2010 emphasized that the peak magnitudes of these contours could be given insight into coherence and strength of the dominant vortex shedding each column in fig 8 shows the distributions of spectral density of streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations respectively while each row presents different test case for the solid cylinder distributions of the spectral density indicate that the dominant vortex shedding leads to intensify unsteadiness in the near wake region on the other hand it is observed that unsteadiness is remarkably affected by the slot ratio the contours of ws d 0 05 depict that strong vortex shedding occurs in the wake region however instabilities of dominant vortex shedding congregate further downstream of the cylinder for ws d 0 1 the decreasing of peak magnitudes of spectral density indicates that the coherence and strength of the dominant vortex shedding are reduced it is observed that the self issuing jet leads to enhancing of vortex shedding instability in the near wake region for ws d 0 15 however it significantly decreases for ws d 0 2 on the other hand the frequency of the dominant vortex shedding increases for ws d 0 25 although the instability of the dominant vortex shedding decreases significantly it can be concluded that although the frequency of dominant vortex shedding increases with the increasing slot ratio instability of the dominant vortex shedding could be significantly reduced by the self issuing jet 3 6 estimated drag coefficient drag coefficients for all test cases were estimated from piv data using momentum integral theorem that is modified with considering components of velocity fluctuation by bohl and koochesfahani 2009 the expression is given as 9 c d 2 d h h u u 1 u u v r m s 2 u r m s 2 u 2 1 2 u f 2 u 2 1 d y where u is the mean streamwise velocity u is freestream velocity uf is maximum velocity outside of the wake region u r m s and v r m s are streamwise and transverse velocity fluctuations respectively fig 9 presents that the variation of drag coefficient of the square cylinder with the slot ratio estimated drag coefficient of the solid cylinder is found as 1 87 which is in good agreement with the experimental result of yen and yang 2011 it is found that drag coefficient decreases up to 1 08 for ws d 0 05 after that the drag coefficient slightly increases up to ws d 0 15 however its value is still 38 lower than that obtained for the solid cylinder case similar to the increase in the drag coefficient is also observed by gao et al 2017 who studied flow around the circular cylinder with slot they reported that this situation could be related to a flip flop flow it is observed that the drag coefficient gradually decreases for ws d 0 2 4 conclusions flow patterns downstream of the slotted hollow square cylinder are investigated experimentally at re 6000 in order to determine the influence of the slot ratio on the wake flow five different slot ratios ws d 0 05 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 are tested using the particle image velocimetry piv technique and the obtained results are compared with the solid square cylinder case it is found that flow through slot causes the self issuing jet and it affects wake flow characteristics and turbulence statistics remarkably two different vortex shedding mechanisms are detected downstream of the cylinder depending on the slot ratio for ws d 0 1 the penetration of the self issuing jet into the wake region delays interaction of the shear layers on both sides of the cylinder therefore the vortex formation length increases however vortex shedding frequency is nearly the same with the solid cylinder case momentum coefficient of the self issuing jet increases and the jet penetrates further downstream of the cylinder with the increasing slot ratio for ws d 0 15 vorticity stemmed from the self issuing jet interacts with the shear layer and accelerates the vortex shedding process therefore the vortex shedding frequency increases significantly while the vortex formation length decreases on the other hand turbulence statistics such as r m s of streamwise velocity fluctuations u r m s turbulent kinetic energy t k e and reynolds shear stress u v are considerably suppressed for all slot ratios in comparison with the solid cylinder case for ws d 0 1 the peak magnitudes of u r m s t k e and u v are reduced by 32 67 and 61 respectively also their locations in the streamwise move further downstream with respect to the solid cylinder case in addition distributions of the spectral density depict that vortex shedding instability is significantly reduced for ws d 0 1 0 2 and 0 25 although the frequency of the vortex shedding increases it is also observed that the slotted square cylinder reduces the drag coefficient for all slot ratios the maximum reduction of drag coefficient approximately 42 is obtained for ws d 0 05 credit authorship

21769,marine propeller ventilation which can occur in extreme seas reduces energy efficiency of the ship and can result in significant safety hazards during navigation a major maritime challenge is to predict water levels during extreme seas and manage an appropriate control strategy for the propulsion system with fast response times here we report application of an evidence reasoning er rule based adaboost m1 approach to rapidly estimate propeller ventilation levels thereby improving propulsion management the er rule was used as the weak learner of adaboost m1 to extract torque signal from the propulsion motor and current signal from the propulsion inverter first k means clustering was used to select the reference value sets of each weak learner second the extracted signals were transformed into multiple pieces of identification evidence which were combined through er to estimate the ventilation level by present weak learner parameters of the weak learner were then updated according to the estimation results finally the weak learners that had completed training were combined into a strong learner to estimate final ventilation levels experimental results showed that the estimation accuracy of the weak learner provided by the er rule for adaboost m1 approach was more than 50 which resulted in the accurate estimation by the strong learner this approach provides an important

introduction marine electric propulsion systems are increasingly used in a wide variety of ship types due to their low fuel consumption high safety and reliability and provision of superior maneuverability geertsma et al 2017 skjong et al 2016 chai et al 2018 when a ship is navigating the control strategy of the electric propulsion system must be able to adapt to the local sea conditions to ensure the stability and safety of the ship under normal or ideal sea conditions the propeller is fully submerged and supplies thrust to the vessel however in extreme seas the propeller or propellers may periodically exit the sea surface causing ventilation on the propeller blade and leading to a loss of thrust and transient changes of load kozlowska and steen 2017 the speed torque and power of the propulsion system can subsequently oscillate violently which may cause significant damage to the propulsion system of the ship yari and ghassemi 2016 koushan 2004 propulsion control strategies in normal conditions mainly include control of shaft speed torque power and combined power torque and which work well in calm seas yoerger et al 1990 whitcomb and yoerger 1999 fossen and blanke 2000 smogeli et al 2004a however many ocean going vessels must also be able to perform in rough seas sorensen et al proposed an anti spin thruster control strategy sørensen et al 1997 inspired by the anti spin control system of a car haskara et al 2000 this can maintain propeller thrust during propeller ventilation in extreme seas propeller ventilation can occur repeatedly which leads to repeated switching of control strategies which is far from ideal improvements in the accurate estimation of propeller ventilation and the subsequent fast switching to the most appropriate control strategy are urgently needed and are the focus of this research propeller ventilation incidents have been studied from the perspective of numerical simulation and ventilation analysis of a fully immersed propeller and clarification of the mechanism of ventilation and its influence on the propeller califano and steen 2011a 2011b smogeli et al performed a series of propeller ventilation experiments in extreme seas and established detailed mathematical models propulsion control strategies and estimation methods for extreme seas smogeli 2006 smogeli et al 2003 2004b 2008 however this method only estimates propeller torque loss by fitting the empirical formula to estimated ventilation levels and its accuracy depends on the operation parameters of the propeller for example the friction coefficient will change with different working conditions which is difficult to accurately predict an experimental map interpolation method was proposed to address this issue dou 2015 the propeller thrust loss coefficient model was obtained by analysis of experimental results obtained in extreme seas in order to estimate ventilation incidents the principle of the method is simple however the relative submergence depth of the propeller needs to be measured under real operating conditions especially in rough seas submerged propeller parameters are difficult to measure and a large amount of experimental analysis is needed for each specific propeller to provide a reliable propeller thrust loss coefficient model this method is therefore difficult to apply in practice the health monitoring system hemos developed by rolls royce collects marine propulsion system status and dynamic positioning data then a fuzzy logic inference system toolbox is used to estimate ventilation luca and steen 2012 however one major drawback of this approach is that a lot of manual operations are required making it unsuitable for the input of large quantities of continuous monitoring data other approaches are based on data driven methods for example a single state kalman filter was used to estimate the propeller loss coefficient after obtaining the motor torque signal and a high estimation accuracy was obtained wang et al 2016 however most studies only deal with ventilation or non ventilation conditions in extreme seas the timely switching of propulsion control strategies is a critical factor in improving the ship safety performance and reducing mechanical wear when propeller ventilation is detected by the estimator the propeller is completely out of water and the propulsion system suffers from a huge thrust loss at this moment application of the switching control strategy is already too late since the propeller can move from full immersion to fully exposed in seconds smogeli et al 2008 therefore a more appropriate strategy is to detect partial ventilation in advance which is the transition state between full ventilation and non ventilation this allows the control system vital extra time to switch control strategy thereby improving energy use by optimizing propulsion efficiency in extreme seas it is difficult to detect the state of the propeller in real time however ventilation levels in extreme seas can be estimated by monitoring and analyzing the running parameters of the motor in this work we categorized propeller ventilation levels into non ventilation partial ventilation and full ventilation smogeli 2006 at the same time based on the data driven principle yin et al 2014 we present a propeller ventilation estimator using an er rule based adaboost m1 approach this method uses the er rule as weak learners of adaboost m1 defines multiple er rule weak leaners for training and finally combines weak learners to form a strong learner to deliver a significantly improved ventilation estimator which also has advantages in dealing with irregular data samples 2 simulation of propeller ventilation due to the significant challenges of directly measuring propeller ventilation while at sea simulation methods and modeling are commonly used to analyze the impact of extreme seas on electric propulsion systems the model adopted in this work is outlined below 2 1 mathematical model of a marine electric propulsion system marine electric propulsion systems are composed of two parts a propulsion unit and a control unit as shown in fig 1 the propulsion unit consists of the propulsion motor transmission shaft and propeller the control unit consists of the controller which is a set of equipment with an embedded control algorithm which can generate propulsion motor commanded torque q c according to target thrust t d then q c is fed to the propulsion unit to generate propeller actual thrust t a and actual torque q a 2 1 1 a dynamic mathematical model of the motor since the electric time constant of the marine electric propulsion system is much smaller than the mechanical time constant the first order equation shown in equation 1 can be used to simplify the motor dynamic equation blanke et al 2000 1 q m 1 t m q c q m here q c is saturated commanded torque given by the controller q m is the output torque of the propulsion motor and t m is the motor time constant 2 1 2 dynamic mathematical model of transmission shaft the torque balance equation of the transmission shaft can be obtained as follows 2 i s ω q m q a k ω ω here i s is rotational inertia k ω is linear shaft friction coefficient ω is propeller angular velocity q m is motor torque q a is propeller torque the friction coefficient is used to simplify the friction problem k ω ω in equation 2 2 1 3 mathematical model of the propeller characteristics according to the dynamic analysis of the propeller the formulae for thrust and torque generated by the propeller are as shown in 3 and 4 3 t a s g n n k t ρ d 4 n 2 4 q a s g n n k q ρ d 5 n 2 here ρ 1025 seawater density d is propeller diameter n is propeller speed k t is actual

is as follows 6 j a h p d v a n d here h p is propeller advance v a is the propeller advance inflow velocity the relationship between advance number j a actual thrust coefficient k t and actual torque coefficient k q can be seen from the wageningen b series propeller characteristic curve shown in fig 2 oosterveld and van oossanen 1975 the open water efficiency η 0 corresponding to the propeller is shown in 7 7 η 0 v a t a 2 π n q a v a k t 2 π n k q d j a k t 2 π k q the three curves in fig 2 represent the time averages of the propeller parameters k t k q and η 0 for different j a the x axis is

actual total thrust t a actual propeller torque q a and actual propeller power p a are expressed as propeller nominal thrust t n nominal torque q n and nominal power p n the formulae are as follows 8 t n s g n n k t 0 ρ d 4 n 2 9 q n s g n n k q 0 ρ d 5 n 2 10 p n s g n n 2 π k q 0 ρ d 5 n 3 2 1 4 shaft speed control strategy the shaft speed control process is shown in fig 3 the idea of a shaft speed control strategy is to always keep the actual speed of the propeller following the target value the method of calculating the propeller shaft speed reference value is shown in 11 11 n r g n t r s g n t r t r ρ d 4 k t 0 here t r is the thrust reference value it can be seen from fig 3 that having the propeller speed follow the target value is realized by using a proportional integral differential pid regulator the deviation between propeller target speed n r and actual speed n is inputted to the pid regulator and commanded propeller torque q c n is outputted as shown in 12 smogeli et al 2008 12 q c n k p e k i o t e τ d τ k d e here the deviation between target speed and actual speed is e n r n k p 0 is proportional gain k i 0 is integral gain k d 0 is derivative gain for the shaft speed control strategy the unsaturated commanded torque q c 0 q c n and saturated commanded torque seen from propeller q c is given by the torque limit module 2 2 impact of extreme seas on the propulsion system in extreme seas due to the influence of wind and waves the displacement amplitude of the propeller in the vertical direction will increase resulting in thrust and torque losses which are mainly caused by propeller ventilation kozlowska et al 2009 when the propeller is near to or exposed to the water surface if the propeller load is large at this time the low pressure air above the propeller blade will form an air funnel thereby sucking air onto the water surface causing the water surface to be distorted eventually forming a vortex huse 1972 this phenomenon is called a ventilation incident and 70 80 of thrust and torque may be lost during severe ventilation koushan 2006 as shown in fig 4 according to advance number j a and relative submergence h r ratio of the propeller shaft submergence h to propeller radius r the degree of ventilation can be divided into three regimes smogeli 2006 1 non ventilated regime propeller is deeply submerged in water or load is low when water is shallow 2 partially ventilated regime an air cavity is not present on all propeller blades and the position of the air cavity is constantly changing when advance number j a is high this state is persistent but when j a is low this regime is unstable 3 fully ventilated regime each blade of the propeller is covered by an air cavity which means that pressure at the suction side of the propeller is almost equal to the atmospheric pressure which is relatively stable 2 3 propeller thrust and torque loss model a simplified propeller thrust and torque loss model for simulation of the propulsion characteristics of the propeller in extreme seas was developed here the thrust factor β t is considered to be related only to h r and relative shaft speed n n b p where n b p is the bollard pull shaft speed of the propeller as shown in fig 5 the thrust loss model can be parameterized by two relative shaft speed values two shaft submergences and two loss factors respectively as n 1 n 2 h 1 h 2 b 1 b 2 when h r h 2 the propeller is immersed in deep water and no thrust loss occurs at this time β t 1 when h r 1 the propeller is completely out of the water and no thrust is generated at this time β t 0 when h 1 h r h 2 and n n b p n 1 the propeller is in a light load state the total thrust factor β t decreases with h r thus almost no thrust loss occurs and when n n b p n 2 the propeller is in a heavy load state at this moment the reduction of h r will lead to instantaneous reduction of thrust when 1 h r h 1 and h r n 1 the propeller is in a light load state and β t gradually decreases as h r decreases when n n b p n 2 the propeller is in a heavy load state and most of the thrust is lost and it gradually decreases with the decrease of h r the remaining regime is a transition regime 1 h r h 2 n 1 n n b p n 2 where ventilation is generated and eliminated the point b 1 h r h 1 n n b p n 2 is the operating point when ventilation is completely generated the point b 2 h r h 1 n n b p 1 is the operating point at which ventilation occurs at the maximum speed of the propeller in fig 5 n 1 0 2 n 2 0 5 h 1 1 1 h 2 1 3 b 1 0 3 b 2 0 1 smogeli 2006 the relationship between total thrust factor β t and total torque factor is given as follows 13 β q β t m here 0 m 1 and the value of m in open propeller is 0 8 0 85 and in ducted propeller m is 0 65 karlsen et al 1986 2 4 simulation of propeller ventilation based on the above analysis we established a marine electric propulsion simulation model using the ship china railway bohai no 1 this ship is a railway ferry running between yantai shandong province and dalian in liaoning province it is the first train ro ro passenger ship in china to adopt podded electric propulsion the main parameters of the ship propeller system are shown in table 1 using the above parameters a set of marine electric propulsion system simulation models were developed in the matlab simulink environment to simulate propeller ventilation the root mean square rms value of electric current and the instantaneous torque value of the propulsion motor were collected with a sampling frequency of 1 khz and a total of 15 s was required for a complete ventilation period the obtained torque signals and current signals were normalized from 0 to 1 which characterizes the change trend of the torque and current the normalized data were input to the ventilation estimator combined with the propeller torque factor to obtain the ventilation level the input and output of the ventilation estimator is shown in fig 6 in this figure ventilation level 1 represents the non ventilated regime level 2 represents a partially ventilated regime and level 3 represents a fully ventilated regime 3 a ventilation estimator using an er rule based adaboost m1 this section details the identification process used for developing the propeller ventilation estimator 3 1 adaboost m1 adaboost short for adaptive boosting is an integrated machine learning meta algorithm proposed by freund and schapire 1997 which has been widely used and validated in many fields wang et al 2017 tan et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 martin diaz et al 2017 this method constructs a strong learner using a linear combination of weak learners according to the given training data multiple weak learners are trained and after the estimation results of present weak learners are obtained the learning coefficient of present weak learners and the sampling weight of the next weak learner are updated according to estimated results finally the output of every weak learner is weighted and summed to obtain the final estimation result adaboost m1 was proposed as a derivative form of adaboost to solve the problem of multi classification recognition freund and schapire 1997 the original adaboost algorithm was designed to solve the two classification problem if it is simply extended to the multi classification problem the following problem occurs the accuracy of weak learners in adaboost can be accepted as long as it is better than a random guess 1 2 however in multi classification problems the accuracy rate of the random guess is low generally 1 q here q is the number of types of objects to be identified so that the performance of the strong learner is unsatisfactory we therefore used adaboost m1 which uses higher requirements for the performance of a single weak learner 3 2 the evidence reasoning er rule approach use of the er rule was proposed by yang et al yang and xu 2002 2013 this method successfully solved the problem of the inability to distinguish the importance and reliability of evidence in dempster shafer ds evidence theory and inherited its processing of multi source uncertainty the ability to integrate information in this way has been applied in many fields si et al 2011 kong et al 2015 ngan 2015 for the er rule θ h 1 h 2 h n is a set of n pairs of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive hypotheses which contain all possible propositions or hypotheses called the identification framework a set class consisting of θ and its subset is called a power set which is denoted as p θ or 2 θ whereby one piece of evidence can be expressed as follows xu et al 2017 14 θ p θ j θ θ θ θ p θ i 1 here p θ j indicates that the evidence e j supports the degree of confidence in the proposition θ and the proposition θ can be any element of p θ except for the empty set when p θ i 0 θ p θ j is called the focus element of e j the reliability factor r j and the weighting factor w j of evidence e j are defined here r j indicates reliability of the information source which is usually reflected by input data and while having multiple pieces of evidence w j indicates the relative importance of the multiple pieces of evidence therefore when multiple pieces of evidence are combined reliability and weight need to be taken into account together to obtain more accurate results 15 m j θ m θ j θ θ p θ m p θ j here m θ j represents the supporting degree of e j to θ after introducing r j and w j m θ j is defined by following 16 m θ j 0 θ c r w j m θ j θ θ θ c r w j 1 r j θ p θ here m θ j w j p θ j c r w j 1 1 w j r j θ

finally used to jointly support θ s reliability function p θ e 2 17 m ˆ θ c 2 1 r 2 m θ 1 1 r 1 m θ 2 b c θ m b 1 m c 2 θ θ 18 p θ c 2 0 θ m ˆ θ c 2 d θ m ˆ d c 2 θ θ θ here e 1 and e 2 are two sets of independent evidence 3 3 an er rule based adaboost m1 algorithm when combining the er rule with adaboost m1 the er rule provides high diagnostic accuracy and thus the problem of insufficient accuracy with adaboost m1 due to a weak number of weak learners is overcome and a strong classifier is obtained the specific modeling process is shown in fig 7 3 3 1 data sampling and parameters initialization as obtained in 2 4 the propulsion motor torque and electric current data are used as model inputs f 1 t and f 2 t f 1 t s 1 1 s 2 1 f 2 t s 1 2 s 2 2 here s 1 1 s 2 1 s 1 2 s 2 2 are respectively the minimum and maximum values of input signals f 1 t and f 2 t we define the level of ventilation as y t y t l 1 l 2 here l 1 and l 2 are respectively the minimum and maximum value of y t f 1 t f 2 t and y t are expressed as a sample set s f 1 t f 2 t y t t 1 2 t and f 1 t f 2 t y t is a sample vector after setting the number of weak learners of adaboost m1 to g and initializing the weight of each weak learner to ω g 1 g the initial weight set of a weak learner m ω g g 1 2 g is formed for each single weak learner h g the k means clustering method is used to select the reference value of the er rule because it can extract data features and reflect variation of data samples celebi et al 2013 in training sample data 1 2 of the total sample is randomly selected as the cluster data of the present weak learner and the number of clusters is set to 3 which corresponds to the data features of torque and current signals under the three different ventilation regimes after obtaining three cluster centers together with s 1 1 s 2 1 s 1 2 s 2 2 the reference value set a i a j i j 1 j i i 1 2 of input signals f 1 t and f 2 t are obtained j i 5 is the number of reference values of input signal f i at the same time we set the reference value set of output y t d d q q 1 q q 3 the reference values contained in d are for the three different ventilation regimes 3 3 2 training process of a single weak learner according to the data sample set s and the input reference value set a i sample pairs f i t y t in all sample vectors f 1 t f 2 t y t are respectively

table 3 the reliability factor r i of the evidence is defined which characterizes the ability of input information sources to reflect the value of the ventilation level in the definition process the relative change of f i t and y t is calculated as follows xu et al 2016 23 c f i t f i t max t t 1 2 t s y t 24 c y t y t max t t 1 2 t s y t according to the relative change an evaluation factor

the evidence e j i and e j 1 i corresponding to a j i and a j 1 i are activated the evidence corresponding to f i t can be obtained by weighting two evidences 27a e i d q p q i q 1 q 27b p q i α i j β

combine evidence the final output value y ˆ t is estimated according to the combined result so far a weak learner based on the er rule has been trained 3 3 3 training process of improved adaboost m1

t 15000 to construct sample set s f 1 t f 2 t y t t 1 2 t in section 3 3 in which there are 8918 samples for ventilation level 1 1170 samples for ventilation level 2 and 4912 samples for ventilation level 3 the number of weak learners of er rule based adaboost m1 is set to g 10 and strong learner estimation accuracy is obtained after completing all the weak learners training as shown in fig 8 and table 4 in order to demonstrate the improved performance of the combined use of the er rule and adaboost m1 we have adopted the traditional er rule and have used the same data sample for training the estimation results are shown in fig 9 and table 5 comparing figs 8 and 9 tables 4 and 5 it can be seen that er rule based adaboost m1 performs better than using the er rule alone which is mainly shown in the first 5 s at this time the propeller is in a stable state but use of the traditional er approach is prone to misjudgment which causes the controller to frequently switch control strategies leading to inefficient and unnecessary action the accuracy of the traditional er approach is largely influenced by the initial reference value setting process and many attempts are often made to use an optimal set of reference values in adaboost m1 this problem is avoided since it combines all weak learners based on er rule results with different sets of reference values to obtain a strong learner with more comprehensive performance in order to illustrate the improved combination of the er rule with adaboost m1 we selected the back propagation bp neural network with three layers as a weak learner of adaboost m1 for comparison the learning rate of a single bp neural network weak learner is set to 0 1 the target minimum mean square error is 1 10 5 and the maximum training epoch is 200 the number of weak learners g is set to 10 using the same sample for training and the resulting estimation performance is shown in fig 10 and table 6 it can be seen from the dataset that the number of samples corresponding to ventilation level 2 is much smaller than the number of samples corresponding to other levels and there is a problem of sample imbalance according to table 7 the whole estimation accuracy of er rule based adaboost m1 is 96 12 the whole estimation accuracy of bp based adaboost m1 is 95 72 and the difference between the two estimation algorithms is not large but the former is more accurate in the estimation of ventilation level 2 which is important for more effective propulsion control the propeller ventilation is an irregular sample which means the sample size of each ventilation level is different in every ventilation period er rule can be used to learn the low frequency samples ventilation level 2 well since the weightings and deviations of the bp neural network are random in the experiment a single experiment may have an accidental situation in order to avoid this situation a 10 fold cross validation method was introduced to test the accuracy of the model krstajic et al 2014 jung 2018 all the samples were divided into 10 parts one of which was selected as the test set each time and the remaining 9 were used as the training set and substituted into the model table 7 comparing adaboost m1 based on the bp and er rule it can be seen from table 7 that estimation using the er approach with the unbalanced sample is more accurate in particular with estimation of ventilation level 2 the accuracy is much higher this is because bp neural networks only tend to learn high frequency samples while ignoring learning of low frequency samples xu et al 2016 in practical applications low frequency samples are often of great significance hong 2002 yan bin et al 2008 for marine power system control units estimation accuracy of partial ventilation is important because it is in an unstable period when the propeller is both in and out of the water it is difficult to estimate the ventilation levels for the control unit but it is also the best time to switch the propulsion control strategy the estimation accuracy of ventilation level 2 is important for navigation safety because it is the transition state between non ventilation and full ventilation the arrival of full ventilation by monitoring ventilation level 2 can be successfully predicted and this allows enough time for implementation of the switching control strategy of the controller however due to the complicated movement of ships in rough sea conditions the situation of the propeller becoming non ventilated after being partially ventilated may also occur in order to ensure navigational safety the control strategy of the controller will be switched once partial ventilation is detected er rule based adaboost m1 adopted the likelihood normalization method to produce identification evidence the low frequency level has higher reliability compared with the bp approach making ventilation level 2 more accurate this new approach provides good reference information to the controller allowing improved shaft control of the electric propulsion system unit and allows the control system to effectively limit the propeller speed to a reasonable range which can prevent overspeed while at the same time ensure enough thrust is provided and ameliorating mechanical wear and damage other benefits include suppressing power fluctuation of the motor reducing the impulsion impact on the generator set allowing the power plant to run more smoothly all of which contribute to overall improvement in propulsion system stability and thereby ship safety in the case of the computer hardware configuration intel r core i5 5200u cpu 2 2 ghz ram 4 gb gpu nvidia geforce 920m the algorithm proposed here performs offline training when the number of iterations is set to 100 the average training time is 49 s when the trained weak learner is used for online detection the detection time of each sample vector can be controlled within 1 05 10 3 ms on average which is much shorter than the data sample collection time of 1 ms so that the controller has sufficient response time er rule based adaboost m1 also demonstrates superior performance in comparison with existing methods that can detect and switch control strategies smogeli estimated the loss coefficient of propeller torque by the actual motor speed and motor torque so as to detect the propeller ventilation smogeli and sørensen 2009 the advantages of this method are its simplicity and practicality but there are also disadvantages the applicability of this method which uses empirical formula may be limited because it is difficult to set the friction coefficient accurately for different ships in contrast the approach proposed in this paper takes multi source information fusion theory into full consideration and selects two different information sources the mechanical signal and the electrical signal which are treated as a whole and integrated so as to obtain a better result than a single information source in addition the intelligent identification method does not require different empirical estimation formulas and it is easier to generalize for more ships in practice only loading of the trained estimator into the control system is required for the on line identification of propeller ventilation and periodic updating of the estimator model parameters by offline training and refining 5 conclusions the first marine propeller ventilation estimator using er rule based adaboost m1 is proposed the torque and current signals of the electric propulsion motor are collected as data inputs of the estimator and the corresponding ventilation level is estimated the main features of the estimator are 1 constructing weak learners of er rule based adaboost m1 with high estimation accuracy 2 for different weak learners the k means clustering method is used to reasonably determine the different reference value sets which solves the problem whereby the accuracy of the traditional use of the er rule is greatly affected by a single set of reference values 3 adaboost m1 combines all results of the weak learners to provide the final estimation results of the strong learners the experimental results showed that 1 use of the er rule ensures that the estimation accuracy of each weak learner is higher than 50 and that the strong learner has a sufficient number of weak learners to provide a reference this gives estimation results that are more accurate than traditional er rule approach 2 by comparing bp based adaboost m1 and er rule based adaboost m1 it was found that the er rule gives better performance during integration with adaboost m1 which leads to improved final estimation results the approach presented in this work overcomes the problem that the general estimator has low estimation accuracy with low frequency samples due to sample imbalance at the same time the method is based on data driven outcomes such that it can be flexibly applied to pattern recognition problems in other fields using this approach ship power control and efficiency can be improved resulting is more effective use of on board energy and an optimization of engine use and overall ship

21769,marine propeller ventilation which can occur in extreme seas reduces energy efficiency of the ship and can result in significant safety hazards during navigation a major maritime challenge is to predict water levels during extreme seas and manage an appropriate control strategy for the propulsion system with fast response times here we report application of an evidence reasoning er rule based adaboost m1 approach to rapidly estimate propeller ventilation levels thereby improving propulsion management the er rule was used as the weak learner of adaboost m1 to extract torque signal from the propulsion motor and current signal from the propulsion inverter first k means clustering was used to select the reference value sets of each weak learner second the extracted signals were transformed into multiple pieces of identification evidence which were combined through er to estimate the ventilation level by present weak learner parameters of the weak learner were then updated according to the estimation results finally the weak learners that had completed training were combined into a strong learner to estimate final ventilation levels experimental results showed that the estimation accuracy of the weak learner provided by the er rule for adaboost m1 approach was more than 50 which resulted in the accurate estimation by the strong learner this approach provides an important

introduction marine electric propulsion systems are increasingly used in a wide variety of ship types due to their low fuel consumption high safety and reliability and provision of superior maneuverability geertsma et al 2017 skjong et al 2016 chai et al 2018 when a ship is navigating the control strategy of the electric propulsion system must be able to adapt to the local sea conditions to ensure the stability and safety of the ship under normal or ideal sea conditions the propeller is fully submerged and supplies thrust to the vessel however in extreme seas the propeller or propellers may periodically exit the sea surface causing ventilation on the propeller blade and leading to a loss of thrust and transient changes of load kozlowska and steen 2017 the speed torque and power of the propulsion system can subsequently oscillate violently which may cause significant damage to the propulsion system of the ship yari and ghassemi 2016 koushan 2004 propulsion control strategies in normal conditions mainly include control of shaft speed torque power and combined power torque and which work well in calm seas yoerger et al 1990 whitcomb and yoerger 1999 fossen and blanke 2000 smogeli et al 2004a however many ocean going vessels must also be able to perform in rough seas sorensen et al proposed an anti spin thruster control strategy sørensen et al 1997 inspired by the anti spin control system of a car haskara et al 2000 this can maintain propeller thrust during propeller ventilation in extreme seas propeller ventilation can occur repeatedly which leads to repeated switching of control strategies which is far from ideal improvements in the accurate estimation of propeller ventilation and the subsequent fast switching to the most appropriate control strategy are urgently needed and are the focus of this research propeller ventilation incidents have been studied from the perspective of numerical simulation and ventilation analysis of a fully immersed propeller and clarification of the mechanism of ventilation and its influence on the propeller califano and steen 2011a 2011b smogeli et al performed a series of propeller ventilation experiments in extreme seas and established detailed mathematical models propulsion control strategies and estimation methods for extreme seas smogeli 2006 smogeli et al 2003 2004b 2008 however this method only estimates propeller torque loss by fitting the empirical formula to estimated ventilation levels and its accuracy depends on the operation parameters of the propeller for example the friction coefficient will change with different working conditions which is difficult to accurately predict an experimental map interpolation method was proposed to address this issue dou 2015 the propeller thrust loss coefficient model was obtained by analysis of experimental results obtained in extreme seas in order to estimate ventilation incidents the principle of the method is simple however the relative submergence depth of the propeller needs to be measured under real operating conditions especially in rough seas submerged propeller parameters are difficult to measure and a large amount of experimental analysis is needed for each specific propeller to provide a reliable propeller thrust loss coefficient model this method is therefore difficult to apply in practice the health monitoring system hemos developed by rolls royce collects marine propulsion system status and dynamic positioning data then a fuzzy logic inference system toolbox is used to estimate ventilation luca and steen 2012 however one major drawback of this approach is that a lot of manual operations are required making it unsuitable for the input of large quantities of continuous monitoring data other approaches are based on data driven methods for example a single state kalman filter was used to estimate the propeller loss coefficient after obtaining the motor torque signal and a high estimation accuracy was obtained wang et al 2016 however most studies only deal with ventilation or non ventilation conditions in extreme seas the timely switching of propulsion control strategies is a critical factor in improving the ship safety performance and reducing mechanical wear when propeller ventilation is detected by the estimator the propeller is completely out of water and the propulsion system suffers from a huge thrust loss at this moment application of the switching control strategy is already too late since the propeller can move from full immersion to fully exposed in seconds smogeli et al 2008 therefore a more appropriate strategy is to detect partial ventilation in advance which is the transition state between full ventilation and non ventilation this allows the control system vital extra time to switch control strategy thereby improving energy use by optimizing propulsion efficiency in extreme seas it is difficult to detect the state of the propeller in real time however ventilation levels in extreme seas can be estimated by monitoring and analyzing the running parameters of the motor in this work we categorized propeller ventilation levels into non ventilation partial ventilation and full ventilation smogeli 2006 at the same time based on the data driven principle yin et al 2014 we present a propeller ventilation estimator using an er rule based adaboost m1 approach this method uses the er rule as weak learners of adaboost m1 defines multiple er rule weak leaners for training and finally combines weak learners to form a strong learner to deliver a significantly improved ventilation estimator which also has advantages in dealing with irregular data samples 2 simulation of propeller ventilation due to the significant challenges of directly measuring propeller ventilation while at sea simulation methods and modeling are commonly used to analyze the impact of extreme seas on electric propulsion systems the model adopted in this work is outlined below 2 1 mathematical model of a marine electric propulsion system marine electric propulsion systems are composed of two parts a propulsion unit and a control unit as shown in fig 1 the propulsion unit consists of the propulsion motor transmission shaft and propeller the control unit consists of the controller which is a set of equipment with an embedded control algorithm which can generate propulsion motor commanded torque q c according to target thrust t d then q c is fed to the propulsion unit to generate propeller actual thrust t a and actual torque q a 2 1 1 a dynamic mathematical model of the motor since the electric time constant of the marine electric propulsion system is much smaller than the mechanical time constant the first order equation shown in equation 1 can be used to simplify the motor dynamic equation blanke et al 2000 1 q m 1 t m q c q m here q c is saturated commanded torque given by the controller q m is the output torque of the propulsion motor and t m is the motor time constant 2 1 2 dynamic mathematical model of transmission shaft the torque balance equation of the transmission shaft can be obtained as follows 2 i s ω q m q a k ω ω here i s is rotational inertia k ω is linear shaft friction coefficient ω is propeller angular velocity q m is motor torque q a is propeller torque the friction coefficient is used to simplify the friction problem k ω ω in equation 2 2 1 3 mathematical model of the propeller characteristics according to the dynamic analysis of the propeller the formulae for thrust and torque generated by the propeller are as shown in 3 and 4 3 t a s g n n k t ρ d 4 n 2 4 q a s g n n k q ρ d 5 n 2 here ρ 1025 seawater density d is propeller diameter n is propeller speed k t is actual

is as follows 6 j a h p d v a n d here h p is propeller advance v a is the propeller advance inflow velocity the relationship between advance number j a actual thrust coefficient k t and actual torque coefficient k q can be seen from the wageningen b series propeller characteristic curve shown in fig 2 oosterveld and van oossanen 1975 the open water efficiency η 0 corresponding to the propeller is shown in 7 7 η 0 v a t a 2 π n q a v a k t 2 π n k q d j a k t 2 π k q the three curves in fig 2 represent the time averages of the propeller parameters k t k q and η 0 for different j a the x axis is

actual total thrust t a actual propeller torque q a and actual propeller power p a are expressed as propeller nominal thrust t n nominal torque q n and nominal power p n the formulae are as follows 8

speed control strategy is to always keep the actual speed of the propeller following the target value the method of calculating the propeller shaft speed reference value is shown in 11 11 n r g n t r s g n t r t r ρ d 4 k t 0 here t r is the thrust reference value it can be seen from fig 3 that having the propeller speed follow the target value is realized by using a proportional integral differential pid regulator the deviation between propeller target speed n r and actual speed n is inputted to the pid regulator and commanded propeller torque q c n is outputted as shown in 12 smogeli

shaft speed control strategy the unsaturated commanded torque q c 0 q c n and saturated commanded torque seen from propeller q c is given by the torque limit module 2 2 impact of extreme seas on the propulsion system in extreme seas due to the influence of wind and waves the displacement amplitude of the propeller in the vertical direction will increase resulting in thrust and torque losses which are mainly caused by propeller ventilation kozlowska et al 2009 when the propeller is near to or exposed to the water surface if the propeller load is large at this time the low pressure air above the propeller blade will form an air funnel thereby sucking air onto the water surface causing the water surface to be distorted eventually forming a vortex huse 1972 this phenomenon is called a ventilation incident and 70 80 of thrust and torque may be lost during severe ventilation koushan 2006 as shown in fig 4 according to advance number j a and relative submergence h r ratio of the propeller shaft submergence h to propeller radius r the degree of ventilation can be divided into three regimes smogeli 2006 1 non ventilated regime propeller is deeply submerged in water or load is low when water is shallow 2 partially ventilated regime an air cavity is not present on all propeller blades and the position of the air cavity is constantly changing when advance number j a is high this state is persistent but when j a is low this regime is unstable 3 fully ventilated regime each blade of the propeller is covered by an air cavity which means that pressure at the suction side of the propeller is almost equal to the atmospheric pressure which is relatively stable 2 3 propeller thrust and torque loss model a simplified propeller thrust and torque loss model for simulation of the propulsion characteristics of the propeller in extreme seas was developed here the thrust factor β t is considered to be related only to h r and relative shaft speed n n b p where n b p is the bollard pull shaft speed of the propeller as shown in fig 5 the thrust loss model can be parameterized by two relative shaft speed values two shaft submergences and two loss factors respectively as n 1 n 2 h 1 h 2 b 1 b 2 when h r h 2 the propeller is immersed in deep water and no thrust loss occurs at this time β t 1 when h r 1 the propeller is completely out of the water and no thrust is generated at this time β t 0 when h 1 h r h 2 and n n b p n 1 the propeller is in a light load state the total thrust factor β t decreases with h r thus almost no thrust loss occurs and when n n b p n 2 the propeller is in a heavy load state at this moment the reduction of h r will lead to instantaneous reduction of thrust when 1 h r h 1 and h r n 1 the propeller is in a light load state and β t gradually decreases as h r decreases when n n b p n 2 the propeller is in a heavy load state and most of the thrust is lost and it gradually decreases with the decrease of h r the remaining regime is a transition regime 1 h r h 2 n 1 n n b p n 2 where ventilation is generated and eliminated the point b 1 h r h 1 n n b p n 2 is the operating point when ventilation is completely generated the point b 2 h r h 1 n n b p 1 is the operating point at which ventilation occurs at the maximum speed of the propeller in fig 5 n 1 0 2 n 2 0 5 h 1 1 1 h 2 1 3 b 1 0 3 b 2 0 1 smogeli 2006 the relationship between total thrust factor β t and total torque factor is given as follows 13 β q β t m here 0 m 1 and the value of m in open propeller is 0 8 0 85 and in ducted propeller m is 0 65 karlsen et al 1986 2 4 simulation of propeller ventilation based on the above analysis we established a marine electric propulsion simulation model using the ship china railway bohai no 1 this ship is a railway ferry running between yantai shandong province and dalian in liaoning province it is the first train ro ro passenger ship in china to adopt podded electric propulsion the main parameters of the ship propeller system are shown in table 1 using the above parameters a set of marine electric propulsion system simulation models were developed in the matlab simulink environment to simulate propeller ventilation the root mean square rms value of electric current and the instantaneous torque value of the propulsion motor were collected with a sampling frequency of 1 khz and a total of 15 s was required for a complete ventilation period the obtained torque signals and current signals were normalized from 0 to 1 which characterizes the change trend of the torque and current the normalized data were input to the ventilation estimator combined with the propeller torque factor to obtain the ventilation level the input and output of the ventilation estimator is shown in fig 6 in this figure ventilation level 1 represents the non ventilated regime level 2 represents a partially ventilated regime and level 3 represents a fully ventilated regime 3 a ventilation estimator using an er rule based adaboost m1 this section details the identification process used for developing the propeller ventilation estimator 3 1 adaboost m1 adaboost short for adaptive boosting is an integrated machine learning meta algorithm proposed by freund and schapire 1997 which has been widely used and validated in many fields wang et al 2017 tan et al 2009 zhou et al 2019 martin diaz et al 2017 this method constructs a strong learner using a linear combination of weak learners according to the given training data multiple weak learners are trained and after the estimation results of present weak learners are obtained the learning coefficient of present weak learners and the sampling weight of the next weak learner are updated according to estimated results finally the output of every weak learner is weighted and summed to obtain the final estimation result adaboost m1 was proposed as a derivative form of adaboost to solve the problem of multi classification recognition freund and schapire 1997 the original adaboost algorithm was designed to solve the two classification problem if it is simply extended to the multi classification problem the following problem occurs the accuracy of weak learners in adaboost can be accepted as long as it is better than a random guess 1 2 however in multi classification problems the accuracy rate of the random guess is low generally 1 q here q is the number of types of objects to be identified so that the performance of the strong learner is unsatisfactory we therefore used adaboost m1 which uses higher requirements for the performance of a single weak learner 3 2 the evidence reasoning er rule approach use of the er rule was proposed by yang et al yang and xu 2002 2013 this method successfully solved the problem of the inability to distinguish the importance and reliability of evidence in dempster shafer ds evidence theory and inherited its processing of multi source uncertainty the ability to integrate information in this way has been applied in many fields si et al 2011 kong et al 2015 ngan 2015 for the er rule θ h 1 h 2 h n is a set of n pairs of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive hypotheses which contain all possible propositions or hypotheses called the identification framework a set class consisting of θ and its subset is called a power set which is denoted as p θ or 2 θ whereby one piece of evidence can be expressed as follows xu et al 2017 14 θ p θ j θ θ θ θ p θ i 1 here p θ j indicates that the evidence e j supports the degree of confidence in the proposition θ and the proposition θ can be any element of p θ except for the empty set when p θ i 0 θ p θ j is called the focus element of e j the reliability factor r j and the weighting factor w j of evidence e j are defined here r j indicates reliability of the information source which is usually reflected by input data and while having multiple pieces of evidence w j indicates the relative importance of the multiple pieces of evidence therefore when multiple pieces of evidence are combined reliability and weight need to be taken into account together to obtain more accurate results 15 m j θ m θ j θ θ p θ m p θ j here m θ j represents the supporting degree of e j to θ after introducing r j and w j m θ j is defined by following 16 m θ j 0 θ c r w j m θ j θ θ θ c r w j 1 r j θ p θ here m θ j w j p θ j c r w j 1 1 w j r j θ θ m θ j m p θ j 1 1 is determined by the normalization factor c r w j and θ θ p θ j 1 after having two sets of independent evidence the er rule is used to combine two sets of evidence which are finally used to jointly support θ s reliability function p θ e 2 17 m ˆ θ c 2 1 r 2 m θ 1 1 r 1 m θ 2 b c θ m b 1 m c 2 θ θ 18 p θ c 2 0 θ m ˆ θ c 2 d θ m ˆ d c 2 θ θ θ here e 1 and e 2 are two sets of independent evidence 3 3 an er rule based adaboost m1 algorithm when combining the er rule with adaboost m1 the er rule provides high diagnostic accuracy and thus the problem of insufficient accuracy with adaboost m1 due to a weak number of weak learners is overcome and a strong classifier is obtained the specific modeling process is shown in fig 7 3 3 1 data sampling and parameters initialization as obtained in 2 4 the propulsion motor torque and electric current data are used as model inputs f 1 t and f 2 t f 1 t s 1 1 s 2 1 f 2 t s 1 2 s 2 2 here s 1 1 s 2 1 s 1 2 s 2 2 are respectively the minimum and maximum values of input signals f 1 t and f 2 t we define the level of ventilation as y t y t l 1 l 2 here l 1 and l 2 are respectively the minimum and maximum value of y t f 1 t f 2 t and y t are expressed as a sample set s f 1 t f 2 t y t t 1 2 t and f 1 t f 2 t y t is a sample vector after setting the number of weak learners of adaboost m1 to g and initializing the weight of each weak learner to ω g 1 g the initial weight set of a weak learner m ω g g 1 2 g is formed for each single weak learner h g the k means clustering method is used to select the reference value of the er rule because it can extract data features and reflect variation of data samples celebi et al 2013 in training sample data 1 2 of the total sample is randomly selected as the cluster data of the present weak learner and the number of clusters is set to 3 which corresponds to the data features of torque and current signals under the three different ventilation regimes after obtaining three cluster centers together with s 1 1 s 2 1 s 1 2 s 2 2 the reference value set a i a j i j 1 j i i 1 2 of input signals f 1 t and f 2 t are obtained j i 5 is the number of reference values of input signal f i at the same time we set the reference value set of output y t d d q q 1 q q 3 the reference values contained in d are for the three different ventilation regimes 3 3 2 training process of a single weak learner according to the data sample set s and the input reference value set a i sample pairs f i t y t in all sample vectors f 1 t f 2 t y t are respectively converted into similarity distributions about reference values 19a s i f i t α i j j 1 j i i 1 2 19b α i j a j 1 i f i t a j 1 i a j i α i j 1 1 α i j a j i f i t a j 1 i 19c a i j 0 j 1 j i j j j 1 here α i j is the similarity degree of the input value f t matching reference value a j i similarly the similarity distribution of y t about the reference value d n can be obtained 20a s 0 y t d q γ q

the form α i j γ q α i j 1 γ q α i j γ q 1 α i j 1 γ q 1 of similarity distribution by 19 and 20 and α i j γ q is the similarity of f t matching a j i and y t matching d q in sample pair f i t y t according to the obtained comprehensive similarity a casting result table between a j i and d q is established as shown in table 2 in table 2 a q j is the sum of similarity degree of input values f i

table 3 the reliability factor r i of the evidence is defined which characterizes the ability of input information sources to reflect the value of the ventilation level in the definition process the relative change of f i t and y t is calculated as follows xu et al 2016 23 c f i t f i t max t t 1 2 t s y t 24 c y t y t max t t 1 2 t s y t according to the relative change an evaluation factor

the evidence e j i and e j 1 i corresponding to a j i and a j 1 i are activated the evidence corresponding to f i t can be obtained by weighting two evidences 27a e i d q p q i q 1 q 27b p q i α i j β

combine evidence the final output value y ˆ t is estimated according to the combined result so far a weak learner based on the er rule has been trained 3 3 3 training process of improved adaboost m1

t 15000 to construct sample set s f 1 t f 2 t y t t 1 2 t in section 3 3 in which there are 8918 samples for ventilation level 1 1170 samples for ventilation level 2 and 4912 samples for ventilation level 3 the number of weak learners of er rule based adaboost m1 is set to g 10 and strong learner estimation accuracy is obtained after completing all the weak learners training as shown in fig 8 and table 4 in order to demonstrate the improved performance of the combined use of the er rule and adaboost m1 we have adopted the traditional er rule and have used the same data sample for training the estimation results are shown in fig 9 and table 5 comparing figs 8 and 9 tables 4 and 5 it can be seen that er rule based adaboost m1 performs better than using the er rule alone which is mainly shown in the first 5 s at this time the propeller is in a stable state but use of the traditional er approach is prone to misjudgment which causes the controller to frequently switch control strategies leading to inefficient and unnecessary action the accuracy of the traditional er approach is largely influenced by the initial reference value setting process and many attempts are often made to use an optimal set of reference values in adaboost m1 this problem is avoided since it combines all weak learners based on er rule results with different sets of reference values to obtain a strong learner with more comprehensive performance in order to illustrate the improved combination of the er rule with adaboost m1 we selected the back propagation bp neural network with three layers as a weak learner of adaboost m1 for comparison the learning rate of a single bp neural network weak learner is set to 0 1 the target minimum mean square error is 1 10 5 and the maximum training epoch is 200 the number of weak learners g is set to 10 using the same sample for training and the resulting estimation performance is shown in fig 10 and table 6 it can be seen from the dataset that the number of samples corresponding to ventilation level 2 is much smaller than the number of samples corresponding to other levels and there is a problem of sample imbalance according to table 7 the whole estimation accuracy of er rule based adaboost m1 is 96 12 the whole estimation accuracy of bp based adaboost m1 is 95 72 and the difference between the two estimation algorithms is not large but the former is more accurate in the estimation of ventilation level 2 which is important for more effective propulsion control the propeller ventilation is an irregular sample which means the sample size of each ventilation level is different in every ventilation period er rule can be used to learn the low frequency samples ventilation level 2 well since the weightings and deviations of the bp neural network are random in the experiment a single experiment may have an accidental situation in order to avoid this situation a 10 fold cross validation method was introduced to test the accuracy of the model krstajic et al 2014 jung 2018 all the samples were divided into 10 parts one of which was selected as the test set each time and the remaining 9 were used as the training set and substituted into the model table 7 comparing adaboost m1 based on the bp and er rule it can be seen from table 7 that estimation using the er approach with the unbalanced sample is more accurate in particular with estimation of ventilation level 2 the accuracy is much higher this is because bp neural networks only tend to learn high frequency samples while ignoring learning of low frequency samples xu et al 2016 in practical applications low frequency samples are often of great significance hong 2002 yan bin et al 2008 for marine power system control units estimation accuracy of partial ventilation is important because it is in an unstable period when the propeller is both in and out of the water it is difficult to estimate the ventilation levels for the control unit but it is also the best time to switch the propulsion control strategy the estimation accuracy of ventilation level 2 is important for navigation safety because it is the transition state between non ventilation and full ventilation the arrival of full ventilation by monitoring ventilation level 2 can be successfully predicted and this allows enough time for implementation of the switching control strategy of the controller however due to the complicated movement of ships in rough sea conditions the situation of the propeller becoming non ventilated after being partially ventilated may also occur in order to ensure navigational safety the control strategy of the controller will be switched once partial ventilation is detected er rule based adaboost m1 adopted the likelihood normalization method to produce identification evidence the low frequency level has higher reliability compared with the bp approach making ventilation level 2 more accurate this new approach provides good reference information to the controller allowing improved shaft control of the electric propulsion system unit and allows the control system to effectively limit the propeller speed to a reasonable range which can prevent overspeed while at the same time ensure enough thrust is provided and ameliorating mechanical wear and damage other benefits include suppressing power fluctuation of the motor reducing the impulsion impact on the generator set allowing the power plant to run more smoothly all of which contribute to overall improvement in propulsion system stability and thereby ship safety in the case of the computer hardware configuration intel r core i5 5200u cpu 2 2 ghz ram 4 gb gpu nvidia geforce 920m the algorithm proposed here performs offline training when the number of iterations is set to 100 the average training time is 49 s when the trained weak learner is used for online detection the detection time of each sample vector can be controlled within 1 05 10 3 ms on average which is much shorter than the data sample collection time of 1 ms so that the controller has sufficient response time er rule based adaboost m1 also demonstrates superior performance in comparison with existing methods that can detect and switch control strategies smogeli estimated the loss coefficient of propeller torque by the actual motor speed and motor torque so as to detect the propeller ventilation smogeli and sørensen 2009 the advantages of this method are its simplicity and practicality but there are also disadvantages the applicability of this method which uses empirical formula may be limited because it is difficult to set the friction coefficient accurately for different ships in contrast the approach proposed in this paper takes multi source information fusion theory into full consideration and selects two different information sources the mechanical signal and the electrical signal which are treated as a whole and integrated so as to obtain a better result than a single information source in addition the intelligent identification method does not require different empirical estimation formulas and it is easier to generalize for more ships in practice only loading of the trained estimator into the control system is required for the on line identification of propeller ventilation and periodic updating of the estimator model parameters by offline training and refining 5 conclusions the first marine propeller ventilation estimator using er rule based adaboost m1 is proposed the torque and current signals of the electric propulsion motor are collected as data inputs of the estimator and the corresponding ventilation level is estimated the main features of the estimator are 1 constructing weak learners of er rule based adaboost m1 with high estimation accuracy 2 for different weak learners the k means clustering method is used to reasonably determine the different reference value sets which solves the problem whereby the accuracy of the traditional use of the er rule is greatly affected by a single set of reference values 3 adaboost m1 combines all results of the weak learners to provide the final estimation results of the strong learners the experimental results showed that 1 use of the er rule ensures that the estimation accuracy of each weak learner is higher than 50 and that the strong learner has a sufficient number of weak learners to provide a reference this gives estimation results that are more accurate than traditional er rule approach 2 by comparing bp based adaboost m1 and er rule based adaboost m1 it was found that the er rule gives better performance during integration with adaboost m1 which leads to improved final estimation results the approach presented in this work overcomes the problem that the general estimator has low estimation accuracy with low frequency samples due to sample imbalance at the same time the method is based on data driven outcomes such that it can be flexibly applied to pattern recognition problems in other fields using this approach ship power control and efficiency can be improved resulting is more effective use of on board energy and an optimization of engine use and overall ship
