5115,quantifying and understanding recharge behavior of aquifers in complex hydrogeological systems is challenging which limits our ability to manage water resources in karstic areas in this study we analyzed the seasonal recharge sources and processes of a stream an intermittent spring and a perennial spring in a small dolomitic catchment weekly monitoring of stable isotopes and chemical characteristics and daily hydrological data of these waters was performed in 2017 and 2018 there were broad seasonal variations in rainfall isotopes with more negative values observed in the wet season and more positive values observed in the dry season while narrow ranges were observed in spring and stream waters such values plotting on a lmwl represented a homogeneous mixing of rainfall without the effective evaporation effect hydrograph separation showed that the mean proportion of old water was approximately 94 for the springs and stream which indicated a mixing mechanism in recharge processes the mean residence time was approximately 23 weeks for spring 1 201 weeks for spring 2 and 43 weeks for stream the significant difference between springs was attributed to the combined effects of relatively higher proportions of rocky outcrops thinner soil epikarst and better karstic development in the aquifer of spring 1 which enhanced the sensitivity to rainfall the stream was recharged by waters from hillslopes which mixed extensively in the depression accompanied by soil epikarst interaction however only approximately 1 5 of total stream flow was recharged by springs annually and most of the stream was recharged by water through underground paths based on the discharge analyses moreover stream was recharged by subsurface flows which were considerably affected by soil leading to the fluctuating stream discharge characteristics during the wet season the results suggest that greater attention should be paid to the roles of near surface soil epikarst architecture in hydrological processes keywords karst aquifer water resource epikarst groundwater recharge surface water stream hydrology 1 introduction karstic regions comprise approximately 7 12 of the earth s continental surface chen et al 2017 hartmann et al 2017 statistically approximately 15 25 of the world s population relies on karst freshwater resources stevanovic 2018 however surface water is relatively scarce and groundwater extraction is challenging in these regions because of their unique hydrogeological structure de giglio et al 2018 white 2002 yu et al 2015 moreover the permeable formations of karst systems contribute to the mosaic distribution of surface waters which frequently exchange with groundwater bailly comte et al 2009 barberá and andreo 2015 rendering it difficult to establish the interactions among various water types a better understanding of the hydrological processes of karst aquifers is therefore critical for groundwater development and for the sustainable management of karst water resources most of the water derived from rainfall reaches groundwater systems through conduit fissure networks rather than hillslope surface runoff mcdonnell 2003 peng and wang 2012 thus more studies focusing on the recharge processes of subsurface runoff are needed however such studies are challenging because of the geological complexity of karstic systems uneven distribution of groundwater frequent interactions between surface and groundwaters and intense hydrological variability chu et al 2017 musgrove et al 2010 several classical methods such as cave surveys water equilibrium analyses and discharge hydrographs and models have been used to explore hydrological processes in karst aquifers bakalowicz 2005 chang et al 2015 however these methods cannot be extended to an entire aquifer which limits our understanding of karstic systems by masking water sources and flow paths moore et al 2009 ambient tracers such as deuterium d and 18o and hydrochemical characteristics e g total organic carbon toc no3 ca2 mg2 and hco3 are affected by unique processes in different types of water brenot et al 2015 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 wang et al 2018 such that they may be used for hydrograph separation and water transit times li et al 2017a liu et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016 paces and wurster 2014 sprenger et al 2019 tweed et al 2015 some hydrochemical tracers e g toc and no3 have been used to reflect the effects of soil layers wexler et al 2011 while others e g ca2 mg2 and hco3 have provided evidence of water rock interactions bicalho et al 2012 such that they were used to trace the flow paths therefore the employment of ambient tracers has provided effective information about runoff mechanisms and the functions of aquifers and catchments iván and mádl szőnyi 2017 mudarra et al 2019 pavlovskiy and selle 2015 springs are important discharge points and the majority of groundwater is eventually supplied through an extensive network of groundwater conduits or matrices in karstic aquifers li et al 2017b therefore the characteristics of spring water can reflect groundwater recharge and the variability in groundwater storage throughout hillslopes several previous studies have shown that rapid flow through subsurface fractures and conduits exerts spatial control over the spring recharge process hartmann et al 2017 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 for example yang et al 2019b reported that although conduits and fracture zones accounted for 2 22 of the cross sectional area of the aquifer they contributed between 75 and 96 of the total groundwater flow at silver springs in florida usa other studies have shown similar results such as those of liu et al 2011 in southwest china and geyer et al 2008 in the mediterranean however these studies were dependent upon the scale of rainfall events recently bicalho et al 2017 found that multiple hydrological components were recharging spring waters which interacted through a network of fractures and faults and contributed 92 6 of the groundwater flow at lez spring in france during a two year observation period adji et al 2016 suggested that matrix flow predominantly controlled spring recharge during the dry season while the proportion of diffuse flow decreased drastically during the wet season despite a predominance of flow through conduits and fractures in the petoyan spring of indonesia similar results were also reported by zhang and li 2019 who found mixed effects in the groundwater recharge of springs in southwest china these differences might be attributable to varying geological backgrounds and climatic conditions filippini et al 2018 noticed that even adjacent karstic springs which appear to drain the same mountain can exhibit different behaviors mudarra and andreo 2011 suggested that the degree of aquifer karstification controlled the differences observed in hydrogeological function for three springs with similar geological and climatic contexts as recharge processes are influenced by multiple factors such as soil distribution lithology epikarst vegetation and precipitation küry et al 2017 luo et al 2018 a more detailed consideration of the factors that affect seasonal spring recharge accounting for the heterogeneity of karstic media is warranted additionally adequate investigations are needed to inform the sustainable management and protection of groundwater karst areas in general spring water flows out at a footslope which contributes to stream waters through a depression unit hydrological hydrochemistry and stable isotopes data from such observation sites springs and streams enable us to analyze hydrological behaviors of different hydrological units or media parise et al 2018 bailly comte et al 2008 2009 reported that the hydrodynamic behavior of the hydrological system reveals the dynamics of storage and of the release and contribution of surface waters which was outlined by applying auto and cross correlation analyses for regional rainfall fluvial discharge spring flow and water level data from caves and boreholes herman et al 2009 reported that specific karstic water resources in pennsylvania usa exhibit widely varying inertia with lag times that overlap with those of groundwater and surface water however they did not identify the origin or seasonal variability of the water the comparison of isotopic and chemical compositions between spring and stream waters should reflect the hydrological interactions between slopes and depressions hu et al 2015 compared the mean residence times between spring and stream waters and found that a poorly developed conduit system and deep soil layer in a depression would buffer the recharge process of the stream from rainfall and spring water however with limited isotopic data hu et al 2015 have only speculated on the possible functions of soil layers in depressions while largely ignoring the role of the epikarst layer although the soil layer in depressions is deeper than that on slopes its composition mainly consists of clay which results in a lower drainage efficiency yang et al 2016 therefore it is inconsistent with the general understanding of karstic systems i e that they are highly permeable fu et al 2016 showed that the volume of water drained by conduits was 25 43 despite their poor development effective porosity 0 07 however they described the relationships among different water sources and the function of epikarst without quantifying the recharge processes for chinese karst yuan 1994 described the dual spatial structure of upstairs is soil downstairs is water rain spring and stream waters serve as the sole sources of domestic water for 1 7 million inhabitants of southwest china jiang et al 2014 li et al 2016 cockpit karst is the dominant landscape in this area and is characterized by similar dimensions of enclosed depressions surrounded by steep hillslopes markedly differing from other karstic areas many researchers have worked in this area obtaining important information on the functions of aquifers and predicting water resources by applying numerous karst specific methodologies e g chang et al 2015 fu et al 2016 hu et al 2015 however the relationships among rain spring and stream waters such as how rainwater recharges springs and streams and how spring waters recharge streams remain uncertain these gaps in the knowledge necessitate more detailed studies in relatively closed catchments with typical underground flow basins in this study our aim is to advance our understanding of the hydrogeological dynamics of karstic landscapes by combining hydrochemical and isotopic analyses and quantifying recharge therefore herein we 1 characterized the seasonal variations of discharge and multiple tracers e g d 18o toc no3 ca2 mg2 and hco3 for rain spring and stream waters in a small scale dolomitic catchment in southwest china this allowed us to reveal the recharge sources of springs and streams and discuss the effects of karstic hydrogeology on their recharge processes 2 compared the springs and streams to define the relationships among them and to discuss the correlation of hydrological components and their storage functions for water resources our findings establish foundational data and methods for future assessments of water supplies and modeling studies in karstic landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study catchment 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e 272 647 m is a typical cockpit karst catchment that spans 1 14 km2 it is located in huanjiang county in the northwest of guangxi province china fig 1 a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate dominates with a mean annual air temperature of 18 5 and mean annual rainfall of 1461 mm from 2006 to 2018 in general the wet season lasts from late april until the end of september and provides 60 of the total annual rainfall yang et al 2019a this catchment experienced severe deforestation from 1958 until the mid 1980 s and has undergone natural restoration for over 30 years depression has been partly rezoned as cultivated land since 2004 at present shrubbery and shrub grass dominate most areas while secondary forests are only found on continuous rocky outcrops in the eastern hills and at the footslope nie et al 2011 the lithology is mainly comprised of middle late carboniferous dolomite underlain by an early carboniferous sandstone aquifer which is a relatively impermeable layer fig 1a approximately 28 of the total catchment area is a flat depression surrounded by mountains for which 60 of the slopes have a gradient 25 except for an outlet in the northeast superficial deposits 0 50 cm are loose and rocky with high hydraulic conductivity along hillslopes however the soil depth was 20 160 cm in the depression except for an area of continuous rocky outcrops 0 11 km2 in the south isolated rocky outcrops without superficial deposits are also widespread in the catchment area there are two epikarstic springs and a stream in the catchment the springs are at the bases of hillslopes spring 1 is an intermittent spring that flows during the wet season and spring 2 is a perennial spring the perennial stream originates from the southwest corner of the catchment and flows into a water reservoir in the northeast fig 1b spring 2 can freely flow into the depression however spring 1 flows into a stream with an excavated channel which is linked through cultivated lands via planning controls based on the contour lines and groundwater flow paths the study catchment is closed to both surface and groundwater and water in the aquifer is only drained by the stream fu et al 2016 therefore stream discharge processes may reflect the overall characteristics of the aquifer including the soil layer epikarst layer and the underlying massive compact dolomite fu et al 2016 2 2 water sampling and data measurement the discharge of the springs and stream were obtained using manta 2 eureka usa at daily intervals from january 2017 to december 2018 and water samples for hydrochemistry stable isotope analyses were collected weekly three samples were collected per site the first sample was collected in a 2 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottle which was sealed for isotopic measurements and stored at 4 c the second sample which was used for ions ca2 mg2 and no3 and toc measurements was collected in a 100 ml hdpe bottle that was sealed after being mixed with 2 ml of 85 h3po4 and stored at 20 c the third sample was used for hco3 and co3 2 measurements and was collected in a 100 ml hdpe bottle which was taken directly to the laboratory for measurement cations ca2 mg2 were measured via ion chromatography mp aes42100 agilent technologies usa while no3 concentrations were analyzed with a flow injection analyzer aa3 seal analytical uk total organic carbon was determined with a toc vwp analyzer shimazdu corp japan anions hco3 and co3 2 were measured using a titrimetric analytical method with hydrochloric acid stable isotopic compositions of hydrogen and oxygen i e d and 18o were analyzed with a liquid water isotope laser spectrometer dlt 100 los gatos research inc usa and are reported using the standard delta notation relative to the v smow standard of 0 we measured precipitation with a hobo rain gauge bhw pro cd and pendant event logger ua 003 64 onset computer corp usa at meteorological stations in the catchment at a 0 2 mm resolution fig 1b precipitation samples were immediately collected from passive collectors located at each station after a precipitation event one mixed rainwater sample was collected during each precipitation event sample preservation and analytical methods were similar for springs and stream 2 3 methodology although some studies have reported that multiple components rain soil epikarst and ground waters have been separated by a multi end member equation with multi tracers lee and krothe 2001a 2001b the spatial heterogeneity of interactions among multiple water sources present challenges for collecting a representative sample which could identify different sources thus in our study we assumed a simple mixture of two end members new water and old water to quantify the mixing proportions of rainwater recharging the springs and stream for assessing the storage and transit function of the aquifer we used the weighted mean of the rainfall samples within a week as new water c new and the isotope of stream samples of the week before as the old water c old their contributions were calculated using the following equations 1 x new c new x old c old c event 2 x new x old 1 where xnew and xold are the proportions of water discharge by new water and old water principal component analysis pca was applied to corroborate the qualitative description from temporal evolution and to interpret the hydrochemical data and their relevant sources and processes bicalho et al 2012 doctor et al 2006 mudarra and andreo 2011 the two dimensional diagrams no3 and toc mg2 of these chemical components of the water contribute to the understanding of the characteristics of the groundwater flow on the one hand no3 and toc were derived from soil important component in the unsaturated zone and they could assess the transit time of water through the unsaturated zone barberá and andreo 2015 batiot et al 2003 on the other hand mg2 concentrations are a better indicator of water residence times than ca2 in dolomite watersheds because the dissolution rate of mg2 is lower than that of ca2 barberá and andreo 2015 batiot et al 2003 thus mg2 was used to assess the residence time and contribution of water from the saturated zone with the weekly resolution basic data of deuterium the sine wave method was used to fit the seasonal variation in isotopes in rainfall spring and stream waters which estimated the transit time of rain water through aquifers using the exponential model rusjan et al 2019 the sine wave model and mean residence time mrt equations were defined as follows 3 δ d δ d mean a s i n c t θ 4 mrt c 1 a s a p 2 1 0 5 where δd and δdmean are the modelled and the mean annual measured δd values respectively ap or as are the calculated fitted annual amplitudes of precipitation and of stream spring water respectively c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period and θ is the phase lag 3 results 3 1 precipitation characteristics and variation of springs and stream discharge the total amount of precipitation in 2017 was 1504 mm with 81 5 falling during the wet season in 2017 whereas 68 3 of the total rainfall 1440 mm occurred during the wet season in 2018 fig 2 however there were significant differences in the annual distribution of rainfall more heavy rainfall events occurred from march to july in 2017 while there was a relatively even distribution of rainfall from march to october in 2018 during the 2017 wet season eight storm events occurred that yielded precipitation amounts 50 mm however only four events had exceeded 50 mm in rainfall and were 55 mm during the 2018 wet season the mean discharge of stream flow was 20 8 l s and significantly greater than spring 1 0 3 l s and spring 2 0 3 l s the hydrographs for the springs and stream discharge exhibit that there were various periods of increased water flow in response to the rainfall events fig 2 there were sharp rises and falls in discharge at monitoring sites and the maximum discharge reached up to 364 9 l s stream 3 2 l s spring 1 and 0 9 l s spring 2 the global hydrograph fig 2 also indicates that the discharge of spring 1 and stream were more sensitive than spring 2 in which the discharge variation was smaller 3 2 isotopic characteristics of rain spring and stream waters the δd and δ18o values of precipitation samples from 2017 and 2018 showed pronounced seasonal variability figs 2 and 3 maximum values typically occurred between spring and winter while minima occurred between summer and autumn the variations in δd 93 5 to 4 1 and δ18o 13 to 0 1 were large throughout the two year study period rainfall samples during the wet season were more enriched than those in the dry season corroborating the findings of guo et al 2015 the regression coefficient and intercept of the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 8 1 δ18o 13 9 r 2 0 94 was larger than that of the global meteoric water line fig 3 the isotopic compositions of spring and stream waters were relatively stable when compared to those of rainwater fig 3 variations in the isotopic compositions in spring 1 δd 55 3 to 31 7 δ18o 8 8 to 6 1 spring 2 δd 50 6 to 39 2 δ18o 8 2 to 6 7 and stream waters δd 61 6 to 33 2 δ18o 8 8 to 5 1 were significantly lower than those of rainwater fig 2 the δd and δ18o values of stream water samples showed pronounced seasonal variability while there was no significant difference between dry and wet season in springs fig 4 exhibits that the mean isotopic values of stream water during the wet season δd 47 9 δ18o 7 4 were more negative than those in the dry season δd 42 3 δ18o 7 1 the mean isotopic values of spring 2 water during the wet season δd 45 7 δ18o 7 3 were more negative than those in the dry season δd 45 5 δ18o 7 4 but without significant difference in addition there was no significant difference between stream and spring water in dry season while stable isotope d of spring 1 was significantly more positive than stream water during wet season 3 3 hydrochemical characteristics of spring and stream waters solute concentrations hco3 ca2 and mg2 were controlled by water rock interactions in which no significant differences existed between spring and stream waters for hco3 and ca2 while the mean mg2 value of the stream was significantly higher than the springs fig 4 such ions were lower during the wet season than in the dry season without being significantly different however they were significantly higher during the dry season than that during the wet season at spring 1 at spring 2 only mg2 exhibited significant difference between seasons chemical indices such as toc and no3 were affected by the soil layer the toc in the stream water during the dry season was significantly lower than that during the wet season and was significantly greater than that in the spring waters where there was no obvious seasonal variation in terms of no3 concentrations there were significant differences among three sites during the wet season magnitude of difference in order of stream spring 2 spring 1 while there was no significant difference between the stream and spring 2 and they were significantly higher than spring 1 during the dry season the seasonal variation trend was similar to toc except for spring 2 where no3 concentration was significantly higher during dry season than wet season 4 interpretation and discussion 4 1 recharge mechanism in springs spring waters were recharged by a relatively constant pool in the karstic study area although rainwater the input water source displayed significant seasonal variations in isotopic values those of the springs had a narrow range and undifferentiated values between seasons fig 2 and fig 3 the same characteristics were reported by guo et al 2015 and were attributed to homogenization via the mixing of meteoric waters in the unsaturated zone in our study the isotopic values of spring waters were plotted on the lmwl fig 3 which revealed that rainwater was their only source bahir et al 2018 bicalho et al 2017 thus the two end member mass balance calculation was used weekly to estimate the proportion of new water rain water and old water pre event water existing in the reservoir before estimating period during the whole study period jeelani et al 2013 the results of hydrographic separation inferred from variation characteristics of d isotope indicates that the mean proportions of old water were 93 9 spring 1 and 94 4 spring 2 however the mean proportions of old water were 89 5 spring 1 and 93 4 spring 2 during the wet season fig 5 therefore old water controlled the recharging of spring water during the whole study period the same results were reported by poulain et al 2018 who found that quick flow accounted for 34 of the recharge of springs such that springs were mainly recharged by diffuse flow hydrograph separation also exhibits that the proportion of new water could be up to 83 3 spring 1 and 54 8 spring 2 during several periods of heavy precipitation events adji et al 2016 found that the diffuse flow dominates spring discharge during non flooding and flooding recession periods and the diffuse proportion decreased drastically due to the conduit flow supply during the rising limb period therefore we suggest that the spring aquifers in this study could provide good storage for the diffuse flow even though a conduit might be developed although the recharge sources were relatively constant in the two springs spring 1 displayed more seasonality than spring 2 the more rapid rises falls in discharge and higher peak discharge of spring 1 indicates that the recharging of spring 1 was more sensitive to the variations in rainfall which means that the aquifer presented a relatively highly developed conduit system iacurto et al 2020 kresic and panday 2018 fig 2 in addition according to the comparison for the mean residence time between springs based on the displacement method fig 6 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 we found that the mean residence time of spring 1 22 9 weeks was significantly smaller than spring 2 200 9 weeks which indicates the obvious hysteresis effect of spring 2 spring 1 is an intermittent spring that discharges after a heavy rainfall event or sustained rainfall but dries up with short term drought in the study area the mean thickness of the spring 2 epikarst 15 5 m was greater than spring 1 8 7 m which resulted in a greater water storage capacity rusjan et al 2019 suggested that the shorter mean residence time could be expected for karst aquifers without extensive deep groundwater storage conversely the longer mean residence time indicates a larger groundwater storage and the intensive mixing and homogenization of water sources rain water and groundwater brkić et al 2018 kogovšek and petrič 2014 in the karstic study area the aquifer was composed of a network of regularly distributed fractures which resulted in sufficient mixing of different groundwater flows despite the existence of rapid flow channels these would account for the dampening of seasonal variations between rainwater and spring water isotopic compositions at spring 2 moreover the percentage of outcrop coverage at spring 1 39 5 was significantly greater than at spring 2 6 8 wang et al 2016 reported on the hydrological role of rock outcrops in which water received by soil patches from rock runoff will equal the precipitation when the outcrop area reaches 70 of the ground surface therefore greater outcrop coverage at spring 1 area may have resulted in more and faster infiltration thereby increasing the contribution and influence of recent rainwater the seasonal variation of hydrochemistry underlines the important roles of the saturated zone dominated by mineralization and the unsaturated zone dominated by soil biochemistry in the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers pca of all samples showed that spring 1 was more enriched in mineralized parameters ca2 mg2 and hco3 and the distribution of various parameters in spring 2 was relatively balanced fig 7 this indicates that generate flow of spring 1 was controlled by the saturated zone and spring 2 was affected by the coaction of unsaturated and saturated zones during whole study period mudarra and andreo 2011 toc mg2 diagram shows that springs had constant toc independent of mg2 which showed higher variability fig 8 as fig 8 shows similar trends for no3 mg2 were observed for spring 1 however a weak inverse relation between no3 and mg2 was observed for spring 2 fig 8 therefore we suggest that no3 was the typical parameter for tracing the effect of unsaturated zone for the mineralized effect of karstic bedrock on toc the variability of no3 mg2 raised from the facts that the unsaturated zone in spring 2 was more important than spring 1 in recharge processes batiot et al 2003 in our study sites a more continuous soil layer with a mean thickness of 0 57 m around spring 2 area covered an epikarst system which indicates that most of rain water must infiltrate through the soil to recharge groundwater this could account for the higher effect of the unsaturated zone at spring 2 than spring 1 in addition all mineralized parameters exhibited a decreasing trend from dry season to wet season and they were negatively correlated to no3 and toc which were the indicators of soil biochemistry in spring 2 fig 4 and fig 9 they indicate that the effect of the unsaturated zone increased from the wet season to the dry season bicalho et al 2012 conversely the relatively discrete distribution of all the parameters indicates a similar role of the unsaturated and saturated zones with a high karstic degree which could account for the rapid response to rainfall in spring 1 moreover fig 8 also exhibits that water samples of spring 2 contained high mg2 values while the no3 values were low which indicates that the flow discharged during dry season remained longer in the saturated zone than during the wet season emblanch et al 2003 4 2 recharge mechanism of the stream stream flow was generated from the mixing of rain water and the recharge sources showed no measurable effect of evaporation on the isotopic composition as inferred through the comparison of lmwl and stream water line fig 2 and fig 3 similarly riechelmann et al 2017 also reported that evaporation in the soil epikarst and cave generated no significant imprint on drip water isotopic signature which suggested a draining of a karst reservoir with meteoric recharge origin wassenaar et al 2011 in addition the hydrograph separation results suggested that stream discharge was still dominated by pre event water old water 93 3 despite the proportion of new water up to 57 6 during certain period with heavy rainfall fig 5 rainwater might be sufficiently mixed with the old water or there was a relatively large volume of water in the subsurface storage that rain water did not substantially displace which led to the negligible variability of isotopic values the no3 and toc contents plotted against the mg2 corroborate the high variability of these natural tracers of the stream water which is in line with the findings of batiot et al 2003 fig 8 this indicates that the saturated and unsaturated zones participated in the functioning of the catchment system furthermore recharge sources exhibited seasonal variation fig 9 namely that recharge source from unsaturated zone dominated the hydrochemical characteristic of stream water during the wet season conversely a relatively constant water source from the saturated zone recharge stream was apparent doctor et al 2006 previous work has shown that soil was the source of toc and no3 emblanch et al 2003 however although soil layer in the depression is deeper than that on slopes its composition mainly consists of clay which results in a lower drainage efficiency and lower hydraulic conductivity fu et al 2015a 2015b yang et al 2016 two paths were assumed to supply the water sources with high toc and no3 contents one was the erosion from surface soil by water flow and rainfall and the other was the subsurface flow generated from hillslope to depression similarly wu et al 2018 have found that the erosion processes and amount of soil nutrients would be enhanced during heavy rainfall and flood events and such recharge events occur over short time periods thus the variations of toc and no3 were unstable during the wet season whereas rainfall frequency and amount decreased with the onset of the dry season causing the mean level of groundwater to decline therefore without surface erosion and subsurface leaching the mean concentration of toc and no3 tends to decline significantly in the dry season paces and wurster 2014 although soil layers influenced the rechanging of the stream in the wet season the hydrological function of the epikarst was also important the lack of significant variation in the mean concentrations of mg2 ca2 and hco3 between the dry and wet seasons fig 4 indicates that these tracers were controlled by water rock interactions without significant dilution by new water other studies such as those of moore et al 2009 and zhao et al 2018 previously revealed that the dilution effect of precipitation is largely due to the pronounced development of conduit and fissure networks in our study catchment the conduit network was poorly developed fu et al 2016 and the rainwater sufficiently mixed with pre event water in the epikarst accompanying water rock interactions even during the high flux period in the study catchment waters from intermittent spring and perennial spring were not the main recharge sources of stream according to data from the discharge monitoring the mean contribution proportions were 0 2 and 2 6 during the whole study period despite the contribution proportion reaching up to 21 4 spring 2 during the late dry season fig 2 most of water sources generated from a hillslope would recharge a stream through underground flow most studies have suggested that the variation of spring flow represents the recharge process of hillslope groundwater vardanjani et al 2017 winston and criss 2004 however high spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeological conditions of karst aquifers present the challenge for identifying the recharge area of springs iacurto et al 2020 moreover there were significant differences in the dynamics and hydrochemistry of spring waters under different hydrogeological conditions even for the adjacent springs filippini et al 2018 moreover hu et al 2015 and zhang et al 2020 found evidence for a damping effect from depression storage deficits and from depression soil components between hillslope flow to stream flow therefore it was challenging to quantify the multiple water sources in the catchment in our study the mean residence time of stream water 42 8 weeks was higher than spring 1 and significantly lower than spring 2 fig 6 therefore the stream water was mainly recharged by the water sources which experienced the similar hydrological processes of spring 1 5 conclusions in this study we used weekly collected isotope and hydrochemistry data combined with daily collected hydrological data of waters from precipitation two springs and a stream in a dolomite karst catchment to investigate the spring and stream recharge mechanisms to discuss the recharge relationship between springs and stream we observed distinct seasonal variations in the 18o and d isotopes of rainwater ranging from 13 4 to 0 5 for δ18o and 108 5 to 16 6 for δd however the variations in the springs δd 57 9 to 31 7 δ18o 12 to 3 3 and stream δd 61 6 to 28 7 δ18o 8 8 to 5 1 isotopic compositions were relatively stable compared to the lmwl springs and stream waters were generated from the mixing of rainfall water without a significant evaporation effect the weekly hydrograph separation exhibited that the mean recharge proportions of old water were 93 9 spring 1 94 4 spring 2 and 93 3 stream which is indicative of the homogeneous mixing processes of rainfall and groundwater for recharging springs and stream the mean residence time of spring 1 22 8 weeks was significantly lower than spring 2 200 9 weeks based on the sine wave fitting model on the seasonal variation of d isotope combined with pca on hydrochemistry and no3 mg2 distribution analysis we found the rapid response of spring 1 flow to rainfall was attributed to the smaller storage and the well developed karstification of spring 1 aquifer moreover a continuous and relatively thick soil layer covered the epikarst in spring 2 area which resulted in the seasonal variation of the recharge function between the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone thus spring 2 maintained a continuous flow pca of stream hydrochemistry indicated that the dominant recharge processes of stream water exhibit seasonal variation the unsaturated zone influenced by the soil layer dominated the recharging processes with surface and subsurface flow during the wet season on the contrary water from the saturated zone dominated by weathered bedrock or epikarst was the main sources recharging stream during the dry season based on the hydrological monitoring most of water sources were recharged through underground rather than springs given the damping effect of depression on water flow transit the mean residence time of stream water 42 8 weeks was higher than spring 1 but significantly lower than spring 2 thus we suggest that water like spring 1 was the dominant water sources from the hillslope through depression to recharge stream 6 data availability the data that support the findings of this

5115,quantifying and understanding recharge behavior of aquifers in complex hydrogeological systems is challenging which limits our ability to manage water resources in karstic areas in this study we analyzed the seasonal recharge sources and processes of a stream an intermittent spring and a perennial spring in a small dolomitic catchment weekly monitoring of stable isotopes and chemical characteristics and daily hydrological data of these waters was performed in 2017 and 2018 there were broad seasonal variations in rainfall isotopes with more negative values observed in the wet season and more positive values observed in the dry season while narrow ranges were observed in spring and stream waters such values plotting on a lmwl represented a homogeneous mixing of rainfall without the effective evaporation effect hydrograph separation showed that the mean proportion of old water was approximately 94 for the springs and stream which indicated a mixing mechanism in recharge processes the mean residence time was approximately 23 weeks for spring 1 201 weeks for spring 2 and 43 weeks for stream the significant difference between springs was attributed to the combined effects of relatively higher proportions of rocky outcrops thinner soil epikarst and better karstic development in the aquifer of spring 1 which enhanced the sensitivity to rainfall the stream was recharged by waters from hillslopes which mixed extensively in the depression accompanied by soil epikarst interaction however only approximately 1 5 of total stream flow was recharged by springs annually and most of the stream was recharged by water through underground paths based on the discharge analyses moreover stream was recharged by subsurface flows which were considerably affected by soil leading to the fluctuating stream discharge characteristics during the wet season the results suggest that greater attention should be paid to the roles of near surface soil epikarst architecture in hydrological processes keywords karst aquifer water resource epikarst groundwater recharge surface water stream hydrology 1 introduction karstic regions comprise approximately 7 12 of the earth s continental surface chen et al 2017 hartmann et al 2017 statistically approximately 15 25 of the world s population relies on karst freshwater resources stevanovic 2018 however surface water is relatively scarce and groundwater extraction is challenging in these regions because of their unique hydrogeological structure de giglio et al 2018 white 2002 yu et al 2015 moreover the permeable formations of karst systems contribute to the mosaic distribution of surface waters which frequently exchange with groundwater bailly comte et al 2009 barberá and andreo 2015 rendering it difficult to establish the interactions among various water types a better understanding of the hydrological processes of karst aquifers is therefore critical for groundwater development and for the sustainable management of karst water resources most of the water derived from rainfall reaches groundwater systems through conduit fissure networks rather than hillslope surface runoff mcdonnell 2003 peng and wang 2012 thus more studies focusing on the recharge processes of subsurface runoff are needed however such studies are challenging because of the geological complexity of karstic systems uneven distribution of groundwater frequent interactions between surface and groundwaters and intense hydrological variability chu et al 2017 musgrove et al 2010 several classical methods such as cave surveys water equilibrium analyses and discharge hydrographs and models have been used to explore hydrological processes in karst aquifers bakalowicz 2005 chang et al 2015 however these methods cannot be extended to an entire aquifer which limits our understanding of karstic systems by masking water sources and flow paths moore et al 2009 ambient tracers such as deuterium d and 18o and hydrochemical characteristics e g total organic carbon toc no3 ca2 mg2 and hco3 are affected by unique processes in different types of water brenot et al 2015 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 wang et al 2018 such that they may be used for hydrograph separation and water transit times li et al 2017a liu et al 2017 mosquera et al 2016 paces and wurster 2014 sprenger et al 2019 tweed et al 2015 some hydrochemical tracers e g toc and no3 have been used to reflect the effects of soil layers wexler et al 2011 while others e g ca2 mg2 and hco3 have provided evidence of water rock interactions bicalho et al 2012 such that they were used to trace the flow paths therefore the employment of ambient tracers has provided effective information about runoff mechanisms and the functions of aquifers and catchments iván and mádl szőnyi 2017 mudarra et al 2019 pavlovskiy and selle 2015 springs are important discharge points and the majority of groundwater is eventually supplied through an extensive network of groundwater conduits or matrices in karstic aquifers li et al 2017b therefore the characteristics of spring water can reflect groundwater recharge and the variability in groundwater storage throughout hillslopes several previous studies have shown that rapid flow through subsurface fractures and conduits exerts spatial control over the spring recharge process hartmann et al 2017 rosenberry and labaugh 2008 for example yang et al 2019b reported that although conduits and fracture zones accounted for 2 22 of the cross sectional area of the aquifer they contributed between 75 and 96 of the total groundwater flow at silver springs in florida usa other studies have shown similar results such as those of liu et al 2011 in southwest china and geyer et al 2008 in the mediterranean however these studies were dependent upon the scale of rainfall events recently bicalho et al 2017 found that multiple hydrological components were recharging spring waters which interacted through a network of fractures and faults and contributed 92 6 of the groundwater flow at lez spring in france during a two year observation period adji et al 2016 suggested that matrix flow predominantly controlled spring recharge during the dry season while the proportion of diffuse flow decreased drastically during the wet season despite a predominance of flow through conduits and fractures in the petoyan spring of indonesia similar results were also reported by zhang and li 2019 who found mixed effects in the groundwater recharge of springs in southwest china these differences might be attributable to varying geological backgrounds and climatic conditions filippini et al 2018 noticed that even adjacent karstic springs which appear to drain the same mountain can exhibit different behaviors mudarra and andreo 2011 suggested that the degree of aquifer karstification controlled the differences observed in hydrogeological function for three springs with similar geological and climatic contexts as recharge processes are influenced by multiple factors such as soil distribution lithology epikarst vegetation and precipitation küry et al 2017 luo et al 2018 a more detailed consideration of the factors that affect seasonal spring recharge accounting for the heterogeneity of karstic media is warranted additionally adequate investigations are needed to inform the sustainable management and protection of groundwater karst areas in general spring water flows out at a footslope which contributes to stream waters through a depression unit hydrological hydrochemistry and stable isotopes data from such observation sites springs and streams enable us to analyze hydrological behaviors of different hydrological units or media parise et al 2018 bailly comte et al 2008 2009 reported that the hydrodynamic behavior of the hydrological system reveals the dynamics of storage and of the release and contribution of surface waters which was outlined by applying auto and cross correlation analyses for regional rainfall fluvial discharge spring flow and water level data from caves and boreholes herman et al 2009 reported that specific karstic water resources in pennsylvania usa exhibit widely varying inertia with lag times that overlap with those of groundwater and surface water however they did not identify the origin or seasonal variability of the water the comparison of isotopic and chemical compositions between spring and stream waters should reflect the hydrological interactions between slopes and depressions hu et al 2015 compared the mean residence times between spring and stream waters and found that a poorly developed conduit system and deep soil layer in a depression would buffer the recharge process of the stream from rainfall and spring water however with limited isotopic data hu et al 2015 have only speculated on the possible functions of soil layers in depressions while largely ignoring the role of the epikarst layer although the soil layer in depressions is deeper than that on slopes its composition mainly consists of clay which results in a lower drainage efficiency yang et al 2016 therefore it is inconsistent with the general understanding of karstic systems i e that they are highly permeable fu et al 2016 showed that the volume of water drained by conduits was 25 43 despite their poor development effective porosity 0 07 however they described the relationships among different water sources and the function of epikarst without quantifying the recharge processes for chinese karst yuan 1994 described the dual spatial structure of upstairs is soil downstairs is water rain spring and stream waters serve as the sole sources of domestic water for 1 7 million inhabitants of southwest china jiang et al 2014 li et al 2016 cockpit karst is the dominant landscape in this area and is characterized by similar dimensions of enclosed depressions surrounded by steep hillslopes markedly differing from other karstic areas many researchers have worked in this area obtaining important information on the functions of aquifers and predicting water resources by applying numerous karst specific methodologies e g chang et al 2015 fu et al 2016 hu et al 2015 however the relationships among rain spring and stream waters such as how rainwater recharges springs and streams and how spring waters recharge streams remain uncertain these gaps in the knowledge necessitate more detailed studies in relatively closed catchments with typical underground flow basins in this study our aim is to advance our understanding of the hydrogeological dynamics of karstic landscapes by combining hydrochemical and isotopic analyses and quantifying recharge therefore herein we 1 characterized the seasonal variations of discharge and multiple tracers e g d 18o toc no3 ca2 mg2 and hco3 for rain spring and stream waters in a small scale dolomitic catchment in southwest china this allowed us to reveal the recharge sources of springs and streams and discuss the effects of karstic hydrogeology on their recharge processes 2 compared the springs and streams to define the relationships among them and to discuss the correlation of hydrological components and their storage functions for water resources our findings establish foundational data and methods for future assessments of water supplies and modeling studies in karstic landscapes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study catchment 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e 272 647 m is a typical cockpit karst catchment that spans 1 14 km2 it is located in huanjiang county in the northwest of guangxi province china fig 1 a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate dominates with a mean annual air temperature of 18 5 and mean annual rainfall of 1461 mm from 2006 to 2018 in general the wet season lasts from late april until the end of september and provides 60 of the total annual rainfall yang et al 2019a this catchment experienced severe deforestation from 1958 until the mid 1980 s and has undergone natural restoration for over 30 years depression has been partly rezoned as cultivated land since 2004 at present shrubbery and shrub grass dominate most areas while secondary forests are only found on continuous rocky outcrops in the eastern hills and at the footslope nie et al 2011 the lithology is mainly comprised of middle late carboniferous dolomite underlain by an early carboniferous sandstone aquifer which is a relatively impermeable layer fig 1a approximately 28 of the total catchment area is a flat depression surrounded by mountains for which 60 of the slopes have a gradient 25 except for an outlet in the northeast superficial deposits 0 50 cm are loose and rocky with high hydraulic conductivity along hillslopes however the soil depth was 20 160 cm in the depression except for an area of continuous rocky outcrops 0 11 km2 in the south isolated rocky outcrops without superficial deposits are also widespread in the catchment area there are two epikarstic springs and a stream in the catchment the springs are at the bases of hillslopes spring 1 is an intermittent spring that flows during the wet season and spring 2 is a perennial spring the perennial stream originates from the southwest corner of the catchment and flows into a water reservoir in the northeast fig 1b spring 2 can freely flow into the depression however spring 1 flows into a stream with an excavated channel which is linked through cultivated lands via planning controls based on the contour lines and groundwater flow paths the study catchment is closed to both surface and groundwater and water in the aquifer is only drained by the stream fu et al 2016 therefore stream discharge processes may reflect the overall characteristics of the aquifer including the soil layer epikarst layer and the underlying massive compact dolomite fu et al 2016 2 2 water sampling and data measurement the discharge of the springs and stream were obtained using manta 2 eureka usa at daily intervals from january 2017 to december 2018 and water samples for hydrochemistry stable isotope analyses were collected weekly three samples were collected per site the first sample was collected in a 2 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottle which was sealed for isotopic measurements and stored at 4 c the second sample which was used for ions ca2 mg2 and no3 and toc measurements was collected in a 100 ml hdpe bottle that was sealed after being mixed with 2 ml of 85 h3po4 and stored at 20 c the third sample was used for hco3 and co3 2 measurements and was collected in a 100 ml hdpe bottle which was taken directly to the laboratory for measurement cations ca2 mg2 were measured via ion chromatography mp aes42100 agilent technologies usa while no3 concentrations were analyzed with a flow injection analyzer aa3 seal analytical uk total organic carbon was determined with a toc vwp analyzer shimazdu corp japan anions hco3 and co3 2 were measured using a titrimetric analytical method with hydrochloric acid stable isotopic compositions of hydrogen and oxygen i e d and 18o were analyzed with a liquid water isotope laser spectrometer dlt 100 los gatos research inc usa and are reported using the standard delta notation relative to the v smow standard of 0 we measured precipitation with a hobo rain gauge bhw pro cd and pendant event logger ua 003 64 onset computer corp usa at meteorological stations in the catchment at a 0 2 mm resolution fig 1b precipitation samples were immediately collected from passive collectors located at each station after a precipitation event one mixed rainwater sample was collected during each precipitation event sample preservation and analytical methods were similar for springs and stream 2 3 methodology although some studies have reported that multiple components rain soil epikarst and ground waters have been separated by a multi end member equation with multi tracers lee and krothe 2001a 2001b the spatial heterogeneity of interactions among multiple water sources present challenges for collecting a representative sample which could identify different sources thus in our study we assumed a simple mixture of two end members new water and old water to quantify the mixing proportions of rainwater recharging the springs and stream for assessing the storage and transit function of the aquifer we used the weighted mean of the rainfall samples within a week as new water c new and the isotope of stream samples of the week before as the old water c old their contributions were calculated using the following equations 1 x new c new x old c old c event 2 x new x old 1 where xnew and xold are the proportions of water discharge by new water and old water principal component analysis pca was applied to corroborate the qualitative description from temporal evolution and to interpret the hydrochemical data and their relevant sources and processes bicalho et al 2012 doctor et al 2006 mudarra and andreo 2011 the two dimensional diagrams no3 and toc mg2 of these chemical components of the water contribute to the understanding of the characteristics of the groundwater flow on the one hand no3 and toc were derived from soil important component in the unsaturated zone and they could assess the transit time of water through the unsaturated zone barberá and andreo 2015 batiot et al 2003 on the other hand mg2 concentrations are a better indicator of water residence times than ca2 in dolomite watersheds because the dissolution rate of mg2 is lower than that of ca2 barberá and andreo 2015 batiot et al 2003 thus mg2 was used to assess the residence time and contribution of water from the saturated zone with the weekly resolution basic data of deuterium the sine wave method was used to fit the seasonal variation in isotopes in rainfall spring and stream waters which estimated the transit time of rain water through aquifers using the exponential model rusjan et al 2019 the sine wave model and mean residence time mrt equations were defined as follows 3 δ d δ d mean a s i n c t θ 4 mrt c 1 a s a p 2 1 0 5 where δd and δdmean are the modelled and the mean annual measured δd values respectively ap or as are the calculated fitted annual amplitudes of precipitation and of stream spring water respectively c is the radial frequency of annual fluctuations t is the time in days after the start of the sampling period and θ is the phase lag 3 results 3 1 precipitation characteristics and variation of springs and stream discharge the total amount of precipitation in 2017 was 1504 mm with 81 5 falling during the wet season in 2017 whereas 68 3 of the total rainfall 1440 mm occurred during the wet season in 2018 fig 2 however there were significant differences in the annual distribution of rainfall more heavy rainfall events occurred from march to july in 2017 while there was a relatively even distribution of rainfall from march to october in 2018 during the 2017 wet season eight storm events occurred that yielded precipitation amounts 50 mm however only four events had exceeded 50 mm in rainfall and were 55 mm during the 2018 wet season the mean discharge of stream flow was 20 8 l s and significantly greater than spring 1 0 3 l s and spring 2 0 3 l s the hydrographs for the springs and stream discharge exhibit that there were various periods of increased water flow in response to the rainfall events fig 2 there were sharp rises and falls in discharge at monitoring sites and the maximum discharge reached up to 364 9 l s stream 3 2 l s spring 1 and 0 9 l s spring 2 the global hydrograph fig 2 also indicates that the discharge of spring 1 and stream were more sensitive than spring 2 in which the discharge variation was smaller 3 2 isotopic characteristics of rain spring and stream waters the δd and δ18o values of precipitation samples from 2017 and 2018 showed pronounced seasonal variability figs 2 and 3 maximum values typically occurred between spring and winter while minima occurred between summer and autumn the variations in δd 93 5 to 4 1 and δ18o 13 to 0 1 were large throughout the two year study period rainfall samples during the wet season were more enriched than those in the dry season corroborating the findings of guo et al 2015 the regression coefficient and intercept of the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 8 1 δ18o 13 9 r 2 0 94 was larger than that of the global meteoric water line fig 3 the isotopic compositions of spring and stream waters were relatively stable when compared to those of rainwater fig 3 variations in the isotopic compositions in spring 1 δd 55 3 to 31 7 δ18o 8 8 to 6 1 spring 2 δd 50 6 to 39 2 δ18o 8 2 to 6 7 and stream waters δd 61 6 to 33 2 δ18o 8 8 to 5 1 were significantly lower than those of rainwater fig 2 the δd and δ18o values of stream water samples showed pronounced seasonal variability while there was no significant difference between dry and wet season in springs fig 4 exhibits that the mean isotopic values of stream water during the wet season δd 47 9 δ18o 7 4 were more negative than those in the dry season δd 42 3 δ18o 7 1 the mean isotopic values of spring 2 water during the wet season δd 45 7 δ18o 7 3 were more negative than those in the dry season δd 45 5 δ18o 7 4 but without significant difference in addition there was no significant difference between stream and spring water in dry season while stable isotope d of spring 1 was significantly more positive than stream water during wet season 3 3 hydrochemical characteristics of spring and stream waters solute concentrations hco3 ca2 and mg2 were controlled by water rock interactions in which no significant differences existed between spring and stream waters for hco3 and ca2 while the mean mg2 value of the stream was significantly higher than the springs fig 4 such ions were lower during the wet season than in the dry season without being significantly different however they were significantly higher during the dry season than that during the wet season at spring 1 at spring 2 only mg2 exhibited significant difference between seasons chemical indices such as toc and no3 were affected by the soil layer the toc in the stream water during the dry season was significantly lower than that during the wet season and was significantly greater than that in the spring waters where there was no obvious seasonal variation in terms of no3 concentrations there were significant differences among three sites during the wet season magnitude of difference in order of stream spring 2 spring 1 while there was no significant difference between the stream and spring 2 and they were significantly higher than spring 1 during the dry season the seasonal variation trend was similar to toc except for spring 2 where no3 concentration was significantly higher during dry season than wet season 4 interpretation and discussion 4 1 recharge mechanism in springs spring waters were recharged by a relatively constant pool in the karstic study area although rainwater the input water source displayed significant seasonal variations in isotopic values those of the springs had a narrow range and undifferentiated values between seasons fig 2 and fig 3 the same characteristics were reported by guo et al 2015 and were attributed to homogenization via the mixing of meteoric waters in the unsaturated zone in our study the isotopic values of spring waters were plotted on the lmwl fig 3 which revealed that rainwater was their only source bahir et al 2018 bicalho et al 2017 thus the two end member mass balance calculation was used weekly to estimate the proportion of new water rain water and old water pre event water existing in the reservoir before estimating period during the whole study period jeelani et al 2013 the results of hydrographic separation inferred from variation characteristics of d isotope indicates that the mean proportions of old water were 93 9 spring 1 and 94 4 spring 2 however the mean proportions of old water were 89 5 spring 1 and 93 4 spring 2 during the wet season fig 5 therefore old water controlled the recharging of spring water during the whole study period the same results were reported by poulain et al 2018 who found that quick flow accounted for 34 of the recharge of springs such that springs were mainly recharged by diffuse flow hydrograph separation also exhibits that the proportion of new water could be up to 83 3 spring 1 and 54 8 spring 2 during several periods of heavy precipitation events adji et al 2016 found that the diffuse flow dominates spring discharge during non flooding and flooding recession periods and the diffuse proportion decreased drastically due to the conduit flow supply during the rising limb period therefore we suggest that the spring aquifers in this study could provide good storage for the diffuse flow even though a conduit might be developed although the recharge sources were relatively constant in the two springs spring 1 displayed more seasonality than spring 2 the more rapid rises falls in discharge and higher peak discharge of spring 1 indicates that the recharging of spring 1 was more sensitive to the variations in rainfall which means that the aquifer presented a relatively highly developed conduit system iacurto et al 2020 kresic and panday 2018 fig 2 in addition according to the comparison for the mean residence time between springs based on the displacement method fig 6 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 we found that the mean residence time of spring 1 22 9 weeks was significantly smaller than spring 2 200 9 weeks which indicates the obvious hysteresis effect of spring 2 spring 1 is an intermittent spring that discharges after a heavy rainfall event or sustained rainfall but dries up with short term drought in the study area the mean thickness of the spring 2 epikarst 15 5 m was greater than spring 1 8 7 m which resulted in a greater water storage capacity rusjan et al 2019 suggested that the shorter mean residence time could be expected for karst aquifers without extensive deep groundwater storage conversely the longer mean residence time indicates a larger groundwater storage and the intensive mixing and homogenization of water sources rain water and groundwater brkić et al 2018 kogovšek and petrič 2014 in the karstic study area the aquifer was composed of a network of regularly distributed fractures which resulted in sufficient mixing of different groundwater flows despite the existence of rapid flow channels these would account for the dampening of seasonal variations between rainwater and spring water isotopic compositions at spring 2 moreover the percentage of outcrop coverage at spring 1 39 5 was significantly greater than at spring 2 6 8 wang et al 2016 reported on the hydrological role of rock outcrops in which water received by soil patches from rock runoff will equal the precipitation when the outcrop area reaches 70 of the ground surface therefore greater outcrop coverage at spring 1 area may have resulted in more and faster infiltration thereby increasing the contribution and influence of recent rainwater the seasonal variation of hydrochemistry underlines the important roles of the saturated zone dominated by mineralization and the unsaturated zone dominated by soil biochemistry in the hydrogeological functioning of karst aquifers pca of all samples showed that spring 1 was more enriched in mineralized parameters ca2 mg2 and hco3 and the distribution of various parameters in spring 2 was relatively balanced fig 7 this indicates that generate flow of spring 1 was controlled by the saturated zone and spring 2 was affected by the coaction of unsaturated and saturated zones during whole study period mudarra and andreo 2011 toc mg2 diagram shows that springs had constant toc independent of mg2 which showed higher variability fig 8 as fig 8 shows similar trends for no3 mg2 were observed for spring 1 however a weak inverse relation between no3 and mg2 was observed for spring 2 fig 8 therefore we suggest that no3 was the typical parameter for tracing the effect of unsaturated zone for the mineralized effect of karstic bedrock on toc the variability of no3 mg2 raised from the facts that the unsaturated zone in spring 2 was more important than spring 1 in recharge processes batiot et al 2003 in our study sites a more continuous soil layer with a mean thickness of 0 57 m around spring 2 area covered an epikarst system which indicates that most of rain water must infiltrate through the soil to recharge groundwater this could account for the higher effect of the unsaturated zone at spring 2 than spring 1 in addition all mineralized parameters exhibited a decreasing trend from dry season to wet season and they were negatively correlated to no3 and toc which were the indicators of soil biochemistry in spring 2 fig 4 and fig 9 they indicate that the effect of the unsaturated zone increased from the wet season to the dry season bicalho et al 2012 conversely the relatively discrete distribution of all the parameters indicates a similar role of the unsaturated and saturated zones with a high karstic degree which could account for the rapid response to rainfall in spring 1 moreover fig 8 also exhibits that water samples of spring 2 contained high mg2 values while the no3 values were low which indicates that the flow discharged during dry season remained longer in the saturated zone than during the wet season emblanch et al 2003 4 2 recharge mechanism of the stream stream flow was generated from the mixing of rain water and the recharge sources showed no measurable effect of evaporation on the isotopic composition as inferred through the comparison of lmwl and stream water line fig 2 and fig 3 similarly riechelmann et al 2017 also reported that evaporation in the soil epikarst and cave generated no significant imprint on drip water isotopic signature which suggested a draining of a karst reservoir with meteoric recharge origin wassenaar et al 2011 in addition the hydrograph separation results suggested that stream discharge was still dominated by pre event water old water 93 3 despite the proportion of new water up to 57 6 during certain period with heavy rainfall fig 5 rainwater might be sufficiently mixed with the old water or there was a relatively large volume of water in the subsurface storage that rain water did not substantially displace which led to the negligible variability of isotopic values the no3 and toc contents plotted against the mg2 corroborate the high variability of these natural tracers of the stream water which is in line with the findings of batiot et al 2003 fig 8 this indicates that the saturated and unsaturated zones participated in the functioning of the catchment system furthermore recharge sources exhibited seasonal variation fig 9 namely that recharge source from unsaturated zone dominated the hydrochemical characteristic of stream water during the wet season conversely a relatively constant water source from the saturated zone recharge stream was apparent doctor et al 2006 previous work has shown that soil was the source of toc and no3 emblanch et al 2003 however although soil layer in the depression is deeper than that on slopes its composition mainly consists of clay which results in a lower drainage efficiency and lower hydraulic conductivity fu et al 2015a 2015b yang et al 2016 two paths were assumed to supply the water sources with high toc and no3 contents one was the erosion from surface soil by water flow and rainfall and the other was the subsurface flow generated from hillslope to depression similarly wu et al 2018 have found that the erosion processes and amount of soil nutrients would be enhanced during heavy rainfall and flood events and such recharge events occur over short time periods thus the variations of toc and no3 were unstable during the wet season whereas rainfall frequency and amount decreased with the onset of the dry season causing the mean level of groundwater to decline therefore without surface erosion and subsurface leaching the mean concentration of toc and no3 tends to decline significantly in the dry season paces and wurster 2014 although soil layers influenced the rechanging of the stream in the wet season the hydrological function of the epikarst was also important the lack of significant variation in the mean concentrations of mg2 ca2 and hco3 between the dry and wet seasons fig 4 indicates that these tracers were controlled by water rock interactions without significant dilution by new water other studies such as those of moore et al 2009 and zhao et al 2018 previously revealed that the dilution effect of precipitation is largely due to the pronounced development of conduit and fissure networks in our study catchment the conduit network was poorly developed fu et al 2016 and the rainwater sufficiently mixed with pre event water in the epikarst accompanying water rock interactions even during the high flux period in the study catchment waters from intermittent spring and perennial spring were not the main recharge sources of stream according to data from the discharge monitoring the mean contribution proportions were 0 2 and 2 6 during the whole study period despite the contribution proportion reaching up to 21 4 spring 2 during the late dry season fig 2 most of water sources generated from a hillslope would recharge a stream through underground flow most studies have suggested that the variation of spring flow represents the recharge process of hillslope groundwater vardanjani et al 2017 winston and criss 2004 however high spatial heterogeneity of hydrogeological conditions of karst aquifers present the challenge for identifying the recharge area of springs iacurto et al 2020 moreover there were significant differences in the dynamics and hydrochemistry of spring waters under different hydrogeological conditions even for the adjacent springs filippini et al 2018 moreover hu et al 2015 and zhang et al 2020 found evidence for a damping effect from depression storage deficits and from depression soil components between hillslope flow to stream flow therefore it was challenging to quantify the multiple water sources in the catchment in our study the mean residence time of stream water 42 8 weeks was higher than spring 1 and significantly lower than spring 2 fig 6 therefore the stream water was mainly recharged by the water sources which experienced the similar hydrological processes of spring 1 5 conclusions in this study we used weekly collected isotope and hydrochemistry data combined with daily collected hydrological data of waters from precipitation two springs and a stream in a dolomite karst catchment to investigate the spring and stream recharge mechanisms to discuss the recharge relationship between springs and stream we observed distinct seasonal variations in the 18o and d isotopes of rainwater ranging from 13 4 to 0 5 for δ18o and 108 5 to 16 6 for δd however the variations in the springs δd 57 9 to 31 7 δ18o 12 to 3 3 and stream δd 61 6 to 28 7 δ18o 8 8 to 5 1 isotopic compositions were relatively stable compared to the lmwl springs and stream waters were generated from the mixing of rainfall water without a significant evaporation effect the weekly hydrograph separation exhibited that the mean recharge proportions of old water were 93 9 spring 1 94 4 spring 2 and 93 3 stream which is indicative of the homogeneous mixing processes of rainfall and groundwater for recharging springs and stream the mean residence time of spring 1 22 8 weeks was significantly lower than spring 2 200 9 weeks based on the sine wave fitting model on the seasonal variation of d isotope combined with pca on hydrochemistry and no3 mg2 distribution analysis we found the rapid response of spring 1 flow to rainfall was attributed to the smaller storage and the well developed karstification of spring 1 aquifer moreover a continuous and relatively thick soil layer covered the epikarst in spring 2 area which resulted in the seasonal variation of the recharge function between the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone thus spring 2 maintained a continuous flow pca of stream hydrochemistry indicated that the dominant recharge processes of stream water exhibit seasonal variation the unsaturated zone influenced by the soil layer dominated the recharging processes with surface and subsurface flow during the wet season on the contrary water from the saturated zone dominated by weathered bedrock or epikarst was the main sources recharging stream during the dry season based on the hydrological monitoring most of water sources were recharged through underground rather than springs given the damping effect of depression on water flow transit the mean residence time of stream water 42 8 weeks was higher than spring 1 but significantly lower than spring 2 thus we suggest that water like spring 1 was the dominant water sources from the hillslope through depression to recharge stream 6 data availability the data that support the findings of this

5116,tides are one of the main factors affecting coastal aquifers and thus they are important in supporting material transport and carbon circulation in coastal mangrove swamps the groundwater responses to tidal variations become more complicated owing to the complex topography soil types and the interactions of groundwater with fauna and flora perhaps because of this quantitative relationships between the groundwater dynamics and the tidal actions of coastal mangrove swamps remain unclear there is still a lack of studies that consider the integrated tidal effects on subsurface aquifers of different soil zones and topographic types from january to december 2018 we simultaneously monitored the fluctuations of the piezometric head and salinity at the active root zone shallow zone and the low permeability silty zone middle zone in the riverine forest and fringe forest and on the mudflat of a coastal mangrove swamp tidal signals were extracted from high resolution time series groundwater data using a bayesian statistics modeling method based code baytap08 different time lags between tidal elevation fluctuations and the fluctuations of the piezometric head and salinity were detected at the inland riverine forest and seaward mudflat the upper aquifer quickly dried at low tides whereas that of the fringe forest in between remained wet all the time although the groundwater fluctuations especially the salinity fluctuations were highly attenuated owing to capillary effects in the middle zone the shallow zone showed high dependence on the tidal variations most previous studies have focused either on the macropore function animal burrows and decayed roots of mangrove swamps or on the capillary attenuation of coastal aquifers our results indicate that we need to consider both when analyzing the tidal responses of groundwater in mangrove swamps the insights obtained from this study may help track the movement of water and materials in the coastal aquifers of mangrove swamps and provide references for better management of these valuable ecosystems and other similar coastal aquifers with complicated structures keywords tidal response coastal groundwater mangrove swamp mudflat groundwater exchange 1 introduction groundwater in coastal aquifers is important because it connects marine and terrestrial ecosystems the response of coastal aquifers to external effects has been studied widely in recent decades using field and numerical modeling methods jan et al 2007 smith et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 one of the main factors affecting coastal groundwater is tides which interact with the aquifer directly and indirectly in hydrological and biogeochemical processes heiss et al 2017 levanon et al 2017 despite many studies about the tidal response of coastal groundwater studies on the groundwater response to tides in silty aquifers such as mangrove swamps are rare hou et al 2016 mangrove swamps are coastal wetlands that are submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide they are among the most productive ecosystems on earth and play a key role in sequestrating blue carbon however the importance of mangroves has only been recognized in recent decades and they are at risk owing to negligence and mismanagement at least 35 of mangroves 5 950 000 ha disappeared globally from 1980 to 2000 valiela et al 2001 and there was a further loss of 192 000 ha from 2001 to 2012 world resources institute 2015 numerous studies have investigated mangrove loss owing to anthropogenic effects such as deforestation aquaculture development and urbanization barbier and cox 2003 duke et al 2007 lee et al 2006 and natural effects such as macro climatic and hydrological changes gabler et al 2017 luo and chui 2020 the potential impacts of local hydrological processes on mangrove ecosystems were not recognized until recently the groundwater dynamics in mangrove swamps are particularly ignored owing to their small magnitude compared with the tidal flow mazda and wolanski 2009 the groundwater flow and salinity in mangrove swamps directly influence the survival and development of mangroves xia and li 2012 and the growth and reproduction of other plants and benthic animals in mudflats bennett et al 2009 when subjected to external environmental changes they also influence the distribution of mangroves thus further changing the structure of the ecosystem teh et al 2015 for example sea level rise and storm surges might enable mangroves to take over upland salt intolerant plants because of the increased groundwater salinity in the upland area however the understanding of the quantitative relationships between the external changes especially for the tidal actions and the groundwater dynamics remains incomplete possibly because of the complicated subsurface structure of mangrove swamps according to soil responses to groundwater piezometric head variations whelan et al 2005 classified mangrove sediment deposit into three zones namely the shallow zone active root zone 0 0 35 m middle zone 0 35 4 m and bottom zone 4 6 m in mangrove swamps the upper sediment layer i e the shallow zone and middle zone is usually composed of low permeability silt and clay whereas the lower sediment layer i e the bottom zone is filled with silty sand or gravel with a higher permeability in contrast to the middle zone the shallow zone has many macropores associated with animal burrows and decayed roots mazda and wolanski 2009 horizontally mangrove forests are also classified into three types based on the topographic characteristics namely riverine fringe and basin forests mazda and wolanski 2009 riverine forest is located alongside the drainage channels or tidal creeks in mangrove swamps fringe forest is located at the forest margins where mangroves directly face the open sea basin forest is located inland of the fringe forest in the upper intertidal zone and forms a paludal basin twilley and chen 1998 the complex structure of mangrove swamps may affect the groundwater response to tides and also make the analysis of this response particularly difficult the tidal response of groundwater in mangrove swamps derived from subsurface field data has received less attention natural geochemical tracers such as radon and radium have recently been used to estimate the groundwater discharge in mangrove swamps gleeson et al 2013 sadat noori et al 2017 smith et al 2018 these studies found that natural geochemical tracers showed a clear tidal trend and that tidal pumping is important for water exchange and carbon circulation in a mangrove swamp however these studies did not consider differences in the concentrations of the tracers in the different soil zones of the aquifer moreover these studies required additional surface water information based on mass balance models jiao and post 2019 through the lack of automated monitoring methods and because of the large number of samples required for radium measurements these studies were often conducted over the short term e g several days or weeks they lacked long term investigation into different parts of the mangrove aquifer especially the top 1 m of mangrove soils which is enriched with carbon nitrogen and other nutrients donato et al 2011 santos et al 2012a studies about the tidal response of groundwater derived from the subsurface water level and salinity fluctuations in mangrove swamps are especially rare other studies on the tidal response of conventional coastal aquifers have revealed that tides lead to fluctuations of both the piezometric head and salinity additionally time lags of groundwater tide relative to sea tide increase with the increasing distance to the shoreline in either linear or square root form levanon et al 2016 2017 mao et al 2006 moreover groundwater fluctuations with the tide in coastal unconfined aquifers are mainly controlled by capillary effects next to the water table levanon et al 2016 2017 nevertheless considering the prevalence of animal burrows and humus in the shallow zone of mangrove swamps the tidal response of the groundwater in the mangrove shallow zone and middle zone may be different different tidal responses may also be seen among different mangrove topographies therefore there is a strong need for an integrated study that investigates the relationships between groundwater fluctuations and tides in different soil zones and mangrove topographies for better management and conservation of valuable mangrove swamps and valuable coastal aquifers we hypothesize that the tidal responses of groundwater in a mangrove swamp vary among different mangrove topographies and soil zones we also expect that animal burrows enhance the tidal response in the shallow zone but hardly affect the middle zone where the capillary effect would still function our study aimed to address the following questions 1 what are the relationships between tides and groundwater dynamics in a silty mangrove swamp 2 how do the tidal responses in a mangrove swamp differ from those reported by previous studies especially studies on conventional coastal aquifers our investigation was conducted in a subtropical mangrove swamp in hong kong china where the mangrove forest is among the largest in southern china and is of international importance as in many other mangrove swamps the groundwater is subject to tidal changes as it interacts with mangroves and other benthic animals however no attention has been paid to the groundwater responses to tides and their subsequent potential effects on the whole ecosystem better understanding is thus needed for managing and conserving the mangrove plants and benthic animals living in mangrove swamps 2 methods 2 1 study site the mangrove swamp in mai po nature reserve is located within the inner deep bay in china 114 0 e 114 3 e and 22 28 n 22 30 n which borders shenzhen on the north and hong kong on the south and is adjacent to the pearl river estuary fig 1 mai po and its surrounding wetlands together constitute one of the wetlands of international importance under the ramsar convention i e mai po inner deep bay ramsar site the site is a global ecosystem services hotspot and a key network site for the east asian australasian flyway for millions of migrating birds many of which are under protection the mangrove forest covers over 300 ha making it the largest mangrove forest in hong kong and among the largest in southern china thus bearing high environmental and ecological value chan et al 2011 the sediment deposit covering the mai po area is approximately 6 20 m thick the upper layer with a thickness of 4 10 m mainly consists of low permeability silt and clay and the lower layer with a thickness of 1 13 m mainly consists of high permeability silty sand and gravel cedd 2017 frost 1992 langford et al 1989 with four major drainage channels and rivers and multiple tidal creeks running through or beside the mangrove swamp riverine type topography is also common in mai po the site receives an average annual rainfall of 1 400 mm and precipitation mainly occurs from april to september the tides in the ramsar site are mixed semidiurnal with two cycles of high and low water in one day and a mean tidal range of 1 4 m the salinity of the tides varies from almost fresh 3 psu in the wet season from late spring to summer to relatively saline 23 psu in winter early spring during the dry season the most dominant tidal constituent is lunar semidiurnal m2 followed by lunar solar declinational diurnal k1 lunar declinational diurnal o1 and solar semidiurnal s2 which together constitute approximately 75 of the full tidal range devlin et al 2019 mao et al 2004 the characteristics of the major tidal constituents in the inner deep bay are shown in table 1 2 2 field methods the research undertaken here focused on the shallow zone and middle zone in the mangrove swamp where silt and clay are the dominant components of the aquifer as shown in fig 2 we used the pair well method as described in hou et al 2016 this method enabled us to investigate the groundwater dynamics at two different depths simultaneously which is more reliable for thorough and accurate analysis of the mechanism of tidal influences on adjacent mangrove groundwater ten piezometers at sites of different topographic characteristics i e riverine fringe and mudflat were installed to monitor the groundwater dynamics at different levels below the ground surface 0 2 m and 1 m the coordinates of the sampling sites were recorded using a handheld gps gpsmap 60csx then in google earth pro 7 3 3 a remote sensing image taken at low tide showing the edge of the mudflat were used to measure the distance from the edge of the mudflat to the sampling sites the elevations of the sampling sites were derived from the contour map in chan 2009 using the kriging tool in arcgis 10 2 in general there was a decreasing trend in elevation from gw1 to gw5 fig 2 as shown in fig 1 gw1 and gw2 were near a tidal creek inside the mangrove forest and gw3 and gw4 were at the forest fringe gw5 was the only site on the mudflat distant from the mangrove forest the bottoms of the piezometers were perforated and geotextile fabrics were placed around the perforations to filter sediments and prevent blocking groundwater pressure conductivity and temperature were recorded using groundwater dataloggers solinst ltc levelogger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada all of the sensors took measurements hourly from january 3 to december 31 2018 the accuracies of the level sensor and the conductivity sensor were 0 3 cm and 2 500 30 000 μs cm respectively to obtain the salinity conductivity and temperature data were used following rice et al 2012 the recorded groundwater data 1 m below the surface took longer to reach dynamic equilibrium than those 0 2 m below the surface therefore we eliminated the data recorded in the first week from january 3 to january 9 2018 in the subsequent analysis mean sea level air pressure data were recorded hourly at wetland park automatic weather station which is approximately 3 km from the study site fig 1 the air pressure data were used to barometrically compensate the pressure data measured by the piezometric head sensors tidal elevations were recorded hourly at tsim bei tsui tide gauge station which is approximately 2 km from the study site fig 1 the tidal datum was then transformed from chart datum to hong kong mean sea level the air pressure and tidal data were both provided by hong kong observatory https www hko gov hk cis climat e htm 2 3 time series analysis mangrove swamps located in intertidal zones are regularly inundated by sea tides tidal inundation creates conditions for direct interaction between sea tides and the groundwater to obtain the inundation characteristics in the mai po mangrove swamp we analyzed the piezometric head time series 0 2 m which were more variable and likely to reveal more information of inundation using the tides package created by cox and schepers 2018 in r 3 5 the tides package was specifically developed for water level time series analysis in intertidal areas to determine the inundation time the package finds all high water phases of the groundwater time series by comparing the piezometric head at a certain time t to the piezometric head at a specified time difference before or after t this specified time difference is always assumed to be smaller than the time difference between two consecutive maxima 2 4 tidal signal extraction and cross correlation analysis we used the code baytap08 to extract the tidal signals from the piezometric heads and salinities baytap08 is modified from a program called bayesian tidal analysis program in a grouping method baytap g by d c agnew for easier use tamura and agnew 2008 it is used to analyze time series with tidal and other variations based on bayesian statistics modeling the observed time series data y i at time t i are assumed to be a combination of tidal variations v i a drift d i offsets s i

determined by minimizing the akaike bayesian information criterion abic of the model the initial d value was set to 1 and the final average d value was 124 w controls the smoothness of the tidal admittance according to the length of time series data analyzed w was fixed to 1 a m and b m are the tidal constants i e amplitude and phase respectively of the different tidal constituents in this study considering the frequency space of the tidal constituents and the length of the input data a total of 14 tidal constituents were selected for tidal signal extraction among which 8 were diurnal and 6 were semidiurnal the selected diurnal tidal constituents were q1 o1 m1 p1 s1 k1 j1 and oo1 with frequencies of 0 893 0 930 0 966 0 997 1 000 1 003 1 039 and 1 076 cycles day respectively the selected semidiurnal tidal constituents were 2 n2 n2 m2 l2 s2 and k2 with frequencies of 1 860 1 896 1 932 1 969 2 000 and 2 005 cycles day respectively the drift offsets auxiliary series i e barometric effects and residuals were all removed and we used the remaining tidal variations for subsequent analysis because this study concentrated on the tidal effects on groundwater we eliminated other influences such as disturbances from data downloading we also eliminated salinity data recorded as zero during the dry time after the tidal signals were extracted from the piezometric heads and salinities cross correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the time lag between the tide and groundwater data i e piezometric head and salinity cross correlation analysis provides information about the relationships between the two different time series as well as the pearson s correlation coefficient r of the relationships in this study the extracted tidal signals had the same temporal resolution i e 1 h as the observed data to obtain the time lag statistics at a finer temporal scale we used cubic spline interpolation to interpolate the extracted tidal signals for 15 min data before cross correlation analysis all tidal signal time series were tested as stationary with a p value less than 0 01 the cross correlation equations are documented in brockwell et al 1991 3 results 3 1 piezometric head and salinity seasonally the piezometric head and salinity were more variable in the shallow zone whereas those in the middle zone generally remained stable only gw3 is shown in fig 3 a but the pattern was similar at all sampling sites the range of the groundwater salinity of the shallow zone increased from land to sea with the largest range occurring at gw5 the groundwater salinity of the shallow zone at gw5 varied from 25 psu in february to 2 psu in september fig 4 c the salinities of the middle zone remained stable throughout the year and the largest salinity gap between the shallow zone and the middle zone occurred in february at gw5 fig 4c and 4f from the three day data fig 3b we can see some periodical variations that seem to vary with the tides especially for the data in the shallow zone a similar tidal pattern was seen at other sites as shown in fig 3c the inundation characteristics derived from the piezometric head 0 2 m below the surface are summarized in table 2 as expected the number of inundations and total inundation time all decreased with the increasing distance to the shoreline which is likely due to the increase in elevation in 2018 gw5 had the longest inundation time approximately one third of the study period the shortest inundation time occurred at the most inland site gw1 which was inundated only 7 of the time the average inundation time also generally increased from the landward site to the seaward site the longest average inundation time was also seen at gw5 5 3 h whereas the shortest average inundation time occurred at gw3 3 7 h which is slightly less than that at gw1 3 8 h the frequency of tidal inundation here is defined as the number of inundations divided by the number of total tidal cycles similarly the closer the site to the shoreline the more frequently it was inundated as expected the average low water height represents the average piezometric head at low tide the average low water height at the forest fringe was approximately 5 cm higher than that at the riverine forest and on the mudflat this result indicates that the shallow zones of the riverine forest and mudflat were drier than that of the forest fringe at low tide as shown in fig 3b and 3c the piezometric head of gw3 remained at a certain value remained wet at low tides which was also true for gw4 however the piezometric heads of gw1 gw2 and gw5 quickly decreased after the tides fell in particular during neap tides the piezometric heads at gw1 and gw2 continued to decrease and unlike gw5 the effects from lower high tides were not significant during spring tides the piezometric heads at gw1 gw2 and gw5 also decreased but not as obviously as during neap tides the data for spring tides are shown in the supplementary file 3 2 tidal fluctuations in piezometric head and salinity observed tidal elevation data and piezometric heads and salinities were used as inputs in the tidal signal extraction fig 5 shows the amplitudes of the extracted tidal variations at different frequencies for the observed sea levels the major diurnal tidal constituents were k1 and o1 whereas the major semidiurnal constituents were m2 and s2 this result is consistent with those in devlin et al 2019 and mao et al 2004 the extracted tidal variations of the groundwater data i e piezometric heads and salinities at both the shallow zone and the middle zone show patterns very similar to those of the observed sea levels among the 14 tidal constituents used for tidal signal extraction the dominant tidal constituents were very similar to those of the observed sea levels that is the extracted tidal variations were also composed of four major tidal constituents as shown in fig 5 same for the salinity in the shallow zone and groundwater data in the middle zone not shown here in addition the dominant diurnal constituent was k1 and the dominant semidiurnal constituent was m2 the similarities in the dominant tidal constituents between the observed sea levels and the groundwater data demonstrate that the groundwater dynamics are strongly affected by tides in mai po notably only at the inland sites gw1 and gw2 were the amplitudes of the dominant semidiurnal constituents lower than that of the dominant diurnal tidal constituent this is possibly because the amplitude of a high frequency wave damps more rapidly than that of a low frequency wave because the energy of a high frequency wave dissipates faster owing to friction li et al 2000 we use the m2 tide as an example here because the tides surrounding mai po are mostly semidiurnal and m2 has a relatively large amplitude and is free of thermal and barometric disturbances wang et al 2019 the average amplitude responses to the m2 tide of the piezometric head and salinity at different sampling locations are summarized in table 3 the amplitude responses to the m2 tide in the shallow zone were larger than those in the middle zone for example the minimum amplitude of the piezometric head in the shallow zone was 3 3 cm whereas the largest amplitude of the piezometric head in the middle zone was less than 1 cm the results indicate that the tidal effects were greater in the shallow zone throughout the entire mangrove swamp the amplitudes of salinity to the m2 tide in the middle zone were zero this means that tides had a minimal effect on the salinity in the middle zone or that the magnitude of tidal effects was negligibly small compared with those in the shallow zone although the amplitude of the observed sea level for the m2 tide was approximately 60 cm the amplitudes extracted from the piezometric head at the riverine forest were only approximately 4 cm in the shallow zone the amplitudes of the piezometric heads at the fringe forest and on the mudflat were much larger with the largest amplitude of piezometric head 13 9 cm at gw4 gw2 and gw3 were close in distance to the shoreline however the amplitudes of the piezometric heads at gw3 were more than twice those at gw2 in both the shallow and middle zones from the above results the tidal influences are more pronounced at the fringe forest and the mudflat than at the inland riverine forest in mangrove swamps 3 3 cross correlation results comparison of the time lag between the extracted tidal variations of sea level and groundwater data was conducted using cross correlation analysis as shown in fig 6 the tidal responses of the piezometric head and salinity were different in terms of the amplitude and phase shift but they all showed a mixed semidiurnal pattern except the salinity in the middle zone similar to the tidal variations of the observed sea level this was true for all of the sampling sites but only gw5 is shown in the figure because the amplitudes of the salinity in the middle zone were zero we did not conduct cross correlation analysis for those salinity data the quantitative time lags and corresponding significances are summarized in table 3 compared with the shallow zone the cross correlation results between the tide and piezometric head in the middle zone are less significant these low significances are probably because of the small amplitude of fluctuations levanon et al 2017 both the piezometric head and the salinity in the shallow zone responded faster than the piezometric head in the middle zone the time lags in the shallow zone were less than 1 h and the time lags in the middle zone were 3 4 5 h even when the sampling depth was only 0 8 m lower considering that the sampling locations were far from the shoreline 500 600 m the quick response in the shallow zone was very remarkable this is different from the results obtained by levanon et al 2017 where the time lags were 0 75 2 5 h only 10 70 m from the shoreline in a conventional unconfined coastal aquifer without naturally high hydraulic diffusivity more attention should thus be paid to the function of shallow aquifers in mangrove swamps such as rapid and frequent water and material exchange rates as discussed in sect 4 1 and sect 4 3 in addition the piezometric heads of the inland sites responded simultaneously with that on the mudflat it should also be noted that in the shallow zone there was no time lag between tide and groundwater data i e piezometric head and salinity at the fringe sampling sites gw3 and gw4 the response characteristics of different mangrove landforms are discussed in sect 4 2 4 discussion 4 1 capillary attenuation on groundwater response in the upper aquifer groundwater variations of coastal aquifers are mostly associated with tides in two processes namely pressure head propagation and capillary attenuation levanon et al 2017 pressure head propagation often occurs in the deeper parts of the aquifer especially in confined aquifers where the groundwater responds very fast with the tide levanon et al 2017 in an unconfined coastal aquifer the groundwater variation with the tide is attenuated with increasing time lags owing to capillary effects kong et al 2013 because the specific storage coefficient within unconfined aquifers is several orders of magnitude larger than the specific storage of confined aquifers jiao and tang 1999 levanon et al 2016 it has been reported that capillary attenuation in the tidal response of groundwater occurs either near the coast levanon et al 2017 or hundreds of kilometers from the coast subject to earth tides wang et al 2019 it also occurs either in silt aquifers or in sand aquifers wang et al 2019 the capillary effects on the groundwater response to tides decrease with the increasing distance to the water table for example the closer to the water table the smaller the amplitude of tidal response will be wang et al 2019 our sampling depths 0 2 m and 1 m were both located in the unconfined aquifer and were close to the water table hereafter referred to as the upper aquifer and so the groundwater variation in the upper aquifer is expected to be more affected by capillary attenuation than by pressure head propagation furthermore the upper aquifer of a mangrove swamp is predominantly composed of low permeability silt and clay which is thought to have larger capillary effects smith 1999 moreover the observed piezometric head data showed that 0 2 m below the surface is closer to the water table because the piezometric head is approximately 1 m throughout the year fig 3a as a result the amplitude of tidal response at 0 2 m is expected to be smaller than that at 1 m whereas the time for the tidal response at 0 2 m is expected to be longer than that at 1 m however this contradicts our observed data the groundwater variation 1 m below the surface seemed more attenuated than that 0 2 m below the surface either from the amplitudes of the extracted tidal signals or from the time lags relative to sea tide the above differences are most likely owing to the structure of the upper aquifer where there are abundant animal burrows and decayed roots in the shallow zone even on the upper soil layer of the mudflat there are many fiddler crabs and mudskippers in mai po mangrove swamp which create many macropores that enable the upper aquifer to effectively interact with the tide gomersall 2019 mazda and wolanski 2009 thus the capillary effects are reduced or even reversed by the effects from macropores in the shallow zone this special structure of the shallow zone also explains why the tidal signal still existed at a long distance from the shoreline however this is not a rationale for neglecting the horizontal tidal effects in mangrove swamps the actual tidal response measured at any point in the aquifer is the sum of the tidal response induced by the horizontal pressure propagation the capillary attenuation and the vertical efficient inundation owing to the special structure of the shallow zone notably the shallow zone is also a place of great ecological value where the majority of water sources and nutrients essential for mangroves come from and where mangroves are exposed to salinity variations reef and lovelock 2015 therefore the interpretation of the capillary attenuation of the tidal response of shallow unconfined aquifers in mangrove swamps without considering the structure of the shallow zone may lead to incorrect inferences of groundwater processes and properties these observations also highlight the importance of macropores in increasing the hydraulic conductivity of otherwise impermeable mangrove sediments 4 2 dependence of the tidal response on mangrove topography groundwater dynamics show different patterns in different mangrove topographies in the previous section we argued that in a shallow aquifer there may be vertical differences in the capillary attenuation with the capillary effects in the shallow zone being reduced or even reversed horizontally the tidal response relies more on the mangrove topography the riverine forest and mudflat both had lower average low water heights table 2 which means the soil there was drier at low tides than in the fringe forest considering that inland sites next to riverine forests are reported to remain wet at low tide it is possible that the significant slope of the riverine forest contributes to the ebbing away of groundwater from the swamp to the tidal creek when tides fall mazda 2013 mazda and wolanski 2009 this also suggests that the presence of macropores in mangrove forest helps to store water and retain groundwater levels at low tides mudflats without steep slopes dry rapidly after tides fall possibly because mudflats have fewer macropores because of a lack of decayed roots to store water compared with fringe forests moreover the time lags between the tide and the piezometric head and salinity showed strong dependence on the mangrove topography in the shallow zone table 3 the two fringe sampling sites demonstrated instantaneous responses to the tides with zero time lag the two riverine sampling sites and the mudflat site exhibited similar time lags from tides in sect 4 1 the presence of animal burrows and the presence of decayed roots are deduced as the possible reasons for the quick response in the shallow zone here we also consider the possibility that the high permeability zone owing to animal burrows and decayed roots together with direct exposure to tides has created a very efficient system for tidal water and shallow groundwater interaction as well as for salt transport at the fringe forest this also implies that material exchange at the edge of the forest could be rapid and frequent notably the above analysis of the tidal responses of the fringe forest is based on the fact that the surroundings are flat if the fringe forests had steep slopes like the riverine forests the slopes would likely further assist the exchange of groundwater at the fringe in contrast the permeability of the mudflat is lower than that of the mangrove swamp because of the lack of a root system and mangrove humus causing a longer time lag in response to tides although the riverine forest has high permeability the tidal water in contact with the site is mitigated somewhat as the tide passes through the mangrove swamp this may also account for the general amplitude decay with increasing distance from the shoreline these facts suggest that the tidal response of groundwater depends not only on the soil properties but also on the topography such as steep banks of tidal creeks in riverine forests 4 3 implications for groundwater exchange in mangrove swamps groundwater exchange is important for the biogeochemical circulation of coastal ecosystems because it transports water particles and solutes such as salt carbon and nitrogen into and out of coastal sediments sadat noori et al 2017 santos et al 2012b there are at least 12 mechanisms that drive the groundwater exchange among which tidal pumping bio irrigation hydraulic gradient and convection are believed to be the main origins of groundwater exchange in mangrove swamps gleeson et al 2013 santos et al 2012b these driving forces closely interact with tides tidal pumping is defined as the infiltration of seawater into the sediments at high tides and discharge of the same water at low tides li et al 2009 it occurs throughout the intertidal area and a lower intertidal zone is expected to experience more frequent tidal pumping as revealed from the inundation results table 2 as already implied for the fringe forest with the help of macropores and direct exposure to tides tidal pumping can reduce or even reverse the capillary effect in the upper aquifer therefore the contribution of tidal pumping to groundwater exchange is not simply determined by the inundation frequency it also relies on the structure and mangrove topography bio irrigation refers to the process of benthic organisms such as crabs flushing their burrows with overlying water kristensen and alongi 2006 in this study the flushing from the organisms was not traceable but the existence of the burrows assisted tidal pumping driven groundwater exchange hydraulic gradient driven groundwater exchange often takes the form of seepage and spring water santos et al 2012a this kind of groundwater exchange is often seen in the shallow zone of riverine forests as the shallow groundwater there quickly dries at low tides fig 3c as discussed tidal pumping and hydraulic gradient are largely considered the sources of groundwater exchange in the shallow zone however owing to the small tidal response of the middle zone these two driving forces may not be able to influence groundwater exchange in the middle zone if there is a driving force able to promote water and material exchange in the middle zone it should be a regional force convection is defined as density driven flow owing to salinity differences it can occur wherever there are density differences although the salinity of the middle zone did not show a clear pattern there was a clear tide induced salinity variation in the shallow zone fig 4d f and fig 5 from winter to early spring the groundwater of the shallow zone can be more saline than that of the middle zone especially on the mudflat as the salinity of the shallow zone increases during the dry season larger convection may develop perhaps driving an exchange potential with deeper groundwater santos et al 2012a in the wet season the gap in salinity of groundwater at different depths widened and it peaked in september fig 4 however because the shallow zone is fresher than the middle zone it is less likely to provoke convection driven groundwater exchange in this case upstream water inputs from increasing rainfall could be a supply for stabling the piezometric head and salinity in the middle zone in addition the recharge to the groundwater at mai po from upstream is only likely to occur in the wet season frost 1992 thus convection driven flow in the dry season is less likely to be affected by the upstream water inputs the results here reveal that tidal pumping and hydraulic gradient are the main mechanisms of groundwater exchange in the shallow zone in the mai po mangrove swamp however convection is likely the only driving force that can transport water and materials of the middle zone because it only depends on density differences determination of the groundwater exchange sources contributes to the understanding of the biogeochemical processes in mangrove swamps which is helpful for mitigating the release of carbon and greenhouse gases 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the relationships between tides and the piezometric head and salinity in a mangrove swamp our study revealed the detailed and complex relationships that differ from conventional coastal aquifers without naturally high hydraulic diffusivity and that can be overlooked using widely used natural geochemical tracers our results suggest that the shallow zones of the riverine forest and mudflat are drier than that of the fringe forest at low tides because the steep slope of the riverine forest contributes to groundwater discharge at low tides and mudflats have fewer macropores because of the lack of decayed roots to store water as compared with the fringe forest we also found that the groundwater fluctuations of the shallow zone and middle zone were highly dependent on tidal variations except the salinity of the middle zone which did not show a clear tidal trend the tidal influences were more pronounced at the fringe forest and the mudflat than at the riverine forest because of its rapid and frequent exchange with tides we suggest more attention should be paid to the functions of the shallow zone i e active root zone in mangrove swamps where tidal pumping and hydraulic gradient are the main sources of groundwater exchange in the middle zone convection is likely to be the only driving force that can transport the water and materials because it only depends on density differences when analyzing tidal fluctuations in the groundwater of mangrove swamps we recommend considering both the mangrove topography and the properties of the soil zones for example capillary attenuation of the tidal response of the upper aquifer of a mangrove swamp is mostly reduced at the fringe forest by tidal pumping with the help of abundant animal burrows and decayed roots and because of direct exposure to tides this study contributes to the understanding of groundwater fluctuations in response to tides in silty mangrove swamps it provides references for

5116,tides are one of the main factors affecting coastal aquifers and thus they are important in supporting material transport and carbon circulation in coastal mangrove swamps the groundwater responses to tidal variations become more complicated owing to the complex topography soil types and the interactions of groundwater with fauna and flora perhaps because of this quantitative relationships between the groundwater dynamics and the tidal actions of coastal mangrove swamps remain unclear there is still a lack of studies that consider the integrated tidal effects on subsurface aquifers of different soil zones and topographic types from january to december 2018 we simultaneously monitored the fluctuations of the piezometric head and salinity at the active root zone shallow zone and the low permeability silty zone middle zone in the riverine forest and fringe forest and on the mudflat of a coastal mangrove swamp tidal signals were extracted from high resolution time series groundwater data using a bayesian statistics modeling method based code baytap08 different time lags between tidal elevation fluctuations and the fluctuations of the piezometric head and salinity were detected at the inland riverine forest and seaward mudflat the upper aquifer quickly dried at low tides whereas that of the fringe forest in between remained wet all the time although the groundwater fluctuations especially the salinity fluctuations were highly attenuated owing to capillary effects in the middle zone the shallow zone showed high dependence on the tidal variations most previous studies have focused either on the macropore function animal burrows and decayed roots of mangrove swamps or on the capillary attenuation of coastal aquifers our results indicate that we need to consider both when analyzing the tidal responses of groundwater in mangrove swamps the insights obtained from this study may help track the movement of water and materials in the coastal aquifers of mangrove swamps and provide references for better management of these valuable ecosystems and other similar coastal aquifers with complicated structures keywords tidal response coastal groundwater mangrove swamp mudflat groundwater exchange 1 introduction groundwater in coastal aquifers is important because it connects marine and terrestrial ecosystems the response of coastal aquifers to external effects has been studied widely in recent decades using field and numerical modeling methods jan et al 2007 smith et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 one of the main factors affecting coastal groundwater is tides which interact with the aquifer directly and indirectly in hydrological and biogeochemical processes heiss et al 2017 levanon et al 2017 despite many studies about the tidal response of coastal groundwater studies on the groundwater response to tides in silty aquifers such as mangrove swamps are rare hou et al 2016 mangrove swamps are coastal wetlands that are submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide they are among the most productive ecosystems on earth and play a key role in sequestrating blue carbon however the importance of mangroves has only been recognized in recent decades and they are at risk owing to negligence and mismanagement at least 35 of mangroves 5 950 000 ha disappeared globally from 1980 to 2000 valiela et al 2001 and there was a further loss of 192 000 ha from 2001 to 2012 world resources institute 2015 numerous studies have investigated mangrove loss owing to anthropogenic effects such as deforestation aquaculture development and urbanization barbier and cox 2003 duke et al 2007 lee et al 2006 and natural effects such as macro climatic and hydrological changes gabler et al 2017 luo and chui 2020 the potential impacts of local hydrological processes on mangrove ecosystems were not recognized until recently the groundwater dynamics in mangrove swamps are particularly ignored owing to their small magnitude compared with the tidal flow mazda and wolanski 2009 the groundwater flow and salinity in mangrove swamps directly influence the survival and development of mangroves xia and li 2012 and the growth and reproduction of other plants and benthic animals in mudflats bennett et al 2009 when subjected to external environmental changes they also influence the distribution of mangroves thus further changing the structure of the ecosystem teh et al 2015 for example sea level rise and storm surges might enable mangroves to take over upland salt intolerant plants because of the increased groundwater salinity in the upland area however the understanding of the quantitative relationships between the external changes especially for the tidal actions and the groundwater dynamics remains incomplete possibly because of the complicated subsurface structure of mangrove swamps according to soil responses to groundwater piezometric head variations whelan et al 2005 classified mangrove sediment deposit into three zones namely the shallow zone active root zone 0 0 35 m middle zone 0 35 4 m and bottom zone 4 6 m in mangrove swamps the upper sediment layer i e the shallow zone and middle zone is usually composed of low permeability silt and clay whereas the lower sediment layer i e the bottom zone is filled with silty sand or gravel with a higher permeability in contrast to the middle zone the shallow zone has many macropores associated with animal burrows and decayed roots mazda and wolanski 2009 horizontally mangrove forests are also classified into three types based on the topographic characteristics namely riverine fringe and basin forests mazda and wolanski 2009 riverine forest is located alongside the drainage channels or tidal creeks in mangrove swamps fringe forest is located at the forest margins where mangroves directly face the open sea basin forest is located inland of the fringe forest in the upper intertidal zone and forms a paludal basin twilley and chen 1998 the complex structure of mangrove swamps may affect the groundwater response to tides and also make the analysis of this response particularly difficult the tidal response of groundwater in mangrove swamps derived from subsurface field data has received less attention natural geochemical tracers such as radon and radium have recently been used to estimate the groundwater discharge in mangrove swamps gleeson et al 2013 sadat noori et al 2017 smith et al 2018 these studies found that natural geochemical tracers showed a clear tidal trend and that tidal pumping is important for water exchange and carbon circulation in a mangrove swamp however these studies did not consider differences in the concentrations of the tracers in the different soil zones of the aquifer moreover these studies required additional surface water information based on mass balance models jiao and post 2019 through the lack of automated monitoring methods and because of the large number of samples required for radium measurements these studies were often conducted over the short term e g several days or weeks they lacked long term investigation into different parts of the mangrove aquifer especially the top 1 m of mangrove soils which is enriched with carbon nitrogen and other nutrients donato et al 2011 santos et al 2012a studies about the tidal response of groundwater derived from the subsurface water level and salinity fluctuations in mangrove swamps are especially rare other studies on the tidal response of conventional coastal aquifers have revealed that tides lead to fluctuations of both the piezometric head and salinity additionally time lags of groundwater tide relative to sea tide increase with the increasing distance to the shoreline in either linear or square root form levanon et al 2016 2017 mao et al 2006 moreover groundwater fluctuations with the tide in coastal unconfined aquifers are mainly controlled by capillary effects next to the water table levanon et al 2016 2017 nevertheless considering the prevalence of animal burrows and humus in the shallow zone of mangrove swamps the tidal response of the groundwater in the mangrove shallow zone and middle zone may be different different tidal responses may also be seen among different mangrove topographies therefore there is a strong need for an integrated study that investigates the relationships between groundwater fluctuations and tides in different soil zones and mangrove topographies for better management and conservation of valuable mangrove swamps and valuable coastal aquifers we hypothesize that the tidal responses of groundwater in a mangrove swamp vary among different mangrove topographies and soil zones we also expect that animal burrows enhance the tidal response in the shallow zone but hardly affect the middle zone where the capillary effect would still function our study aimed to address the following questions 1 what are the relationships between tides and groundwater dynamics in a silty mangrove swamp 2 how do the tidal responses in a mangrove swamp differ from those reported by previous studies especially studies on conventional coastal aquifers our investigation was conducted in a subtropical mangrove swamp in hong kong china where the mangrove forest is among the largest in southern china and is of international importance as in many other mangrove swamps the groundwater is subject to tidal changes as it interacts with mangroves and other benthic animals however no attention has been paid to the groundwater responses to tides and their subsequent potential effects on the whole ecosystem better understanding is thus needed for managing and conserving the mangrove plants and benthic animals living in mangrove swamps 2 methods 2 1 study site the mangrove swamp in mai po nature reserve is located within the inner deep bay in china 114 0 e 114 3 e and 22 28 n 22 30 n which borders shenzhen on the north and hong kong on the south and is adjacent to the pearl river estuary fig 1 mai po and its surrounding wetlands together constitute one of the wetlands of international importance under the ramsar convention i e mai po inner deep bay ramsar site the site is a global ecosystem services hotspot and a key network site for the east asian australasian flyway for millions of migrating birds many of which are under protection the mangrove forest covers over 300 ha making it the largest mangrove forest in hong kong and among the largest in southern china thus bearing high environmental and ecological value chan et al 2011 the sediment deposit covering the mai po area is approximately 6 20 m thick the upper layer with a thickness of 4 10 m mainly consists of low permeability silt and clay and the lower layer with a thickness of 1 13 m mainly consists of high permeability silty sand and gravel cedd 2017 frost 1992 langford et al 1989 with four major drainage channels and rivers and multiple tidal creeks running through or beside the mangrove swamp riverine type topography is also common in mai po the site receives an average annual rainfall of 1 400 mm and precipitation mainly occurs from april to september the tides in the ramsar site are mixed semidiurnal with two cycles of high and low water in one day and a mean tidal range of 1 4 m the salinity of the tides varies from almost fresh 3 psu in the wet season from late spring to summer to relatively saline 23 psu in winter early spring during the dry season the most dominant tidal constituent is lunar semidiurnal m2 followed by lunar solar declinational diurnal k1 lunar declinational diurnal o1 and solar semidiurnal s2 which together constitute approximately 75 of the full tidal range devlin et al 2019 mao et al 2004 the characteristics of the major tidal constituents in the inner deep bay are shown in table 1 2 2 field methods the research undertaken here focused on the shallow zone and middle zone in the mangrove swamp where silt and clay are the dominant components of the aquifer as shown in fig 2 we used the pair well method as described in hou et al 2016 this method enabled us to investigate the groundwater dynamics at two different depths simultaneously which is more reliable for thorough and accurate analysis of the mechanism of tidal influences on adjacent mangrove groundwater ten piezometers at sites of different topographic characteristics i e riverine fringe and mudflat were installed to monitor the groundwater dynamics at different levels below the ground surface 0 2 m and 1 m the coordinates of the sampling sites were recorded using a handheld gps gpsmap 60csx then in google earth pro 7 3 3 a remote sensing image taken at low tide showing the edge of the mudflat were used to measure the distance from the edge of the mudflat to the sampling sites the elevations of the sampling sites were derived from the contour map in chan 2009 using the kriging tool in arcgis 10 2 in general there was a decreasing trend in elevation from gw1 to gw5 fig 2 as shown in fig 1 gw1 and gw2 were near a tidal creek inside the mangrove forest and gw3 and gw4 were at the forest fringe gw5 was the only site on the mudflat distant from the mangrove forest the bottoms of the piezometers were perforated and geotextile fabrics were placed around the perforations to filter sediments and prevent blocking groundwater pressure conductivity and temperature were recorded using groundwater dataloggers solinst ltc levelogger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada all of the sensors took measurements hourly from january 3 to december 31 2018 the accuracies of the level sensor and the conductivity sensor were 0 3 cm and 2 500 30 000 μs cm respectively to obtain the salinity conductivity and temperature data were used following rice et al 2012 the recorded groundwater data 1 m below the surface took longer to reach dynamic equilibrium than those 0 2 m below the surface therefore we eliminated the data recorded in the first week from january 3 to january 9 2018 in the subsequent analysis mean sea level air pressure data were recorded hourly at wetland park automatic weather station which is approximately 3 km from the study site fig 1 the air pressure data were used to barometrically compensate the pressure data measured by the piezometric head sensors tidal elevations were recorded hourly at tsim bei tsui tide gauge station which is approximately 2 km from the study site fig 1 the tidal datum was then transformed from chart datum to hong kong mean sea level the air pressure and tidal data were both provided by hong kong observatory https www hko gov hk cis climat e htm 2 3 time series analysis mangrove swamps located in intertidal zones are regularly inundated by sea tides tidal inundation creates conditions for direct interaction between sea tides and the groundwater to obtain the inundation characteristics in the mai po mangrove swamp we analyzed the piezometric head time series 0 2 m which were more variable and likely to reveal more information of inundation using the tides package created by cox and schepers 2018 in r 3 5 the tides package was specifically developed for water level time series analysis in intertidal areas to determine the inundation time the package finds all high water phases of the groundwater time series by comparing the piezometric head at a certain time t to the piezometric head at a specified time difference before or after t this specified time difference is always assumed to be smaller than the time difference between two consecutive maxima 2 4 tidal signal extraction and cross correlation analysis we used the code baytap08 to extract the tidal signals from the piezometric heads and salinities baytap08 is modified from a program called bayesian tidal analysis program in a grouping method baytap g by d c agnew for easier use tamura and agnew 2008 it is used to analyze time series with tidal and other variations based on bayesian statistics modeling the observed time series data y i at time t i are assumed to be a combination of tidal variations v i a drift d i offsets s i

determined by minimizing the akaike bayesian information criterion abic of the model the initial d value was set to 1 and the final average d value was 124 w controls the smoothness of the tidal admittance according to the length of time series data analyzed w was fixed to 1 a m and b m are the tidal constants i e amplitude and phase respectively of the different tidal constituents in this study considering the frequency space of the tidal constituents and the length of the input data a total of 14 tidal constituents were selected for tidal signal extraction among which 8 were diurnal and 6 were semidiurnal the selected diurnal tidal constituents were q1 o1 m1 p1 s1 k1 j1 and oo1 with frequencies of 0 893 0 930 0 966 0 997 1 000 1 003 1 039 and 1 076 cycles day respectively the selected semidiurnal tidal constituents were 2 n2 n2 m2 l2 s2 and k2 with frequencies of 1 860 1 896 1 932 1 969 2 000 and 2 005 cycles day respectively the drift offsets auxiliary series i e barometric effects and residuals were all removed and we used the remaining tidal variations for subsequent analysis because this study concentrated on the tidal effects on groundwater we eliminated other influences such as disturbances from data downloading we also eliminated salinity data recorded as zero during the dry time after the tidal signals were extracted from the piezometric heads and salinities cross correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the time lag between the tide and groundwater data i e piezometric head and salinity cross correlation analysis provides information about the relationships between the two different time series as well as the pearson s correlation coefficient r of the relationships in this study the extracted tidal signals had the same temporal resolution i e 1 h as the observed data to obtain the time lag statistics at a finer temporal scale we used cubic spline interpolation to interpolate the extracted tidal signals for 15 min data before cross correlation analysis all tidal signal time series were tested as stationary with a p value less than 0 01 the cross correlation equations are documented in brockwell et al 1991 3 results 3 1 piezometric head and salinity seasonally the piezometric head and salinity were more variable in the shallow zone whereas those in the middle zone generally remained stable only gw3 is shown in fig 3 a but the pattern was similar at all sampling sites the range of the groundwater salinity of the shallow zone increased from land to sea with the largest range occurring at gw5 the groundwater salinity of the shallow zone at gw5 varied from 25 psu in february to 2 psu in september fig 4 c the salinities of the middle zone remained stable throughout the year and the largest salinity gap between the shallow zone and the middle zone occurred in february at gw5 fig 4c and 4f from the three day data fig 3b we can see some periodical variations that seem to vary with the tides especially for the data in the shallow zone a similar tidal pattern was seen at other sites as shown in fig 3c the inundation characteristics derived from the piezometric head 0 2 m below the surface are summarized in table 2 as expected the number of inundations and total inundation time all decreased with the increasing distance to the shoreline which is likely due to the increase in elevation in 2018 gw5 had the longest inundation time approximately one third of the study period the shortest inundation time occurred at the most inland site gw1 which was inundated only 7 of the time the average inundation time also generally increased from the landward site to the seaward site the longest average inundation time was also seen at gw5 5 3 h whereas the shortest average inundation time occurred at gw3 3 7 h which is slightly less than that at gw1 3 8 h the frequency of tidal inundation here is defined as the number of inundations divided by the number of total tidal cycles similarly the closer the site to the shoreline the more frequently it was inundated as expected the average low water height represents the average piezometric head at low tide the average low water height at the forest fringe was approximately 5 cm higher than that at the riverine forest and on the mudflat this result indicates that the shallow zones of the riverine forest and mudflat were drier than that of the forest fringe at low tide as shown in fig 3b and 3c the piezometric head of gw3 remained at a certain value remained wet at low tides which was also true for gw4 however the piezometric heads of gw1 gw2 and gw5 quickly decreased after the tides fell in particular during neap tides the piezometric heads at gw1 and gw2 continued to decrease and unlike gw5 the effects from lower high tides were not significant during spring tides the piezometric heads at gw1 gw2 and gw5 also decreased but not as obviously as during neap tides the data for spring tides are shown in the supplementary file 3 2 tidal fluctuations in piezometric head and salinity observed tidal elevation data and piezometric heads and salinities were used as inputs in the tidal signal extraction fig 5 shows the amplitudes of the extracted tidal variations at different frequencies for the observed sea levels the major diurnal tidal constituents were k1 and o1 whereas the major semidiurnal constituents were m2 and s2 this result is consistent with those in devlin et al 2019 and mao et al 2004 the extracted tidal variations of the groundwater data i e piezometric heads and salinities at both the shallow zone and the middle zone show patterns very similar to those of the observed sea levels among the 14 tidal constituents used for tidal signal extraction the dominant tidal constituents were very similar to those of the observed sea levels that is the extracted tidal variations were also composed of four major tidal constituents as shown in fig 5 same for the salinity in the shallow zone and groundwater data in the middle zone not shown here in addition the dominant diurnal constituent was k1 and the dominant semidiurnal constituent was m2 the similarities in the dominant tidal constituents between the observed sea levels and the groundwater data demonstrate that the groundwater dynamics are strongly affected by tides in mai po notably only at the inland sites gw1 and gw2 were the amplitudes of the dominant semidiurnal constituents lower than that of the dominant diurnal tidal constituent this is possibly because the amplitude of a high frequency wave damps more rapidly than that of a low frequency wave because the energy of a high frequency wave dissipates faster owing to friction li et al 2000 we use the m2 tide as an example here because the tides surrounding mai po are mostly semidiurnal and m2 has a relatively large amplitude and is free of thermal and barometric disturbances wang et al 2019 the average amplitude responses to the m2 tide of the piezometric head and salinity at different sampling locations are summarized in table 3 the amplitude responses to the m2 tide in the shallow zone were larger than those in the middle zone for example the minimum amplitude of the piezometric head in the shallow zone was 3 3 cm whereas the largest amplitude of the piezometric head in the middle zone was less than 1 cm the results indicate that the tidal effects were greater in the shallow zone throughout the entire mangrove swamp the amplitudes of salinity to the m2 tide in the middle zone were zero this means that tides had a minimal effect on the salinity in the middle zone or that the magnitude of tidal effects was negligibly small compared with those in the shallow zone although the amplitude of the observed sea level for the m2 tide was approximately 60 cm the amplitudes extracted from the piezometric head at the riverine forest were only approximately 4 cm in the shallow zone the amplitudes of the piezometric heads at the fringe forest and on the mudflat were much larger with the largest amplitude of piezometric head 13 9 cm at gw4 gw2 and gw3 were close in distance to the shoreline however the amplitudes of the piezometric heads at gw3 were more than twice those at gw2 in both the shallow and middle zones from the above results the tidal influences are more pronounced at the fringe forest and the mudflat than at the inland riverine forest in mangrove swamps 3 3 cross correlation results comparison of the time lag between the extracted tidal variations of sea level and groundwater data was conducted using cross correlation analysis as shown in fig 6 the tidal responses of the piezometric head and salinity were different in terms of the amplitude and phase shift but they all showed a mixed semidiurnal pattern except the salinity in the middle zone similar to the tidal variations of the observed sea level this was true for all of the sampling sites but only gw5 is shown in the figure because the amplitudes of the salinity in the middle zone were zero we did not conduct cross correlation analysis for those salinity data the quantitative time lags and corresponding significances are summarized in table 3 compared with the shallow zone the cross correlation results between the tide and piezometric head in the middle zone are less significant these low significances are probably because of the small amplitude of fluctuations levanon et al 2017 both the piezometric head and the salinity in the shallow zone responded faster than the piezometric head in the middle zone the time lags in the shallow zone were less than 1 h and the time lags in the middle zone were 3 4 5 h even when the sampling depth was only 0 8 m lower considering that the sampling locations were far from the shoreline 500 600 m the quick response in the shallow zone was very remarkable this is different from the results obtained by levanon et al 2017 where the time lags were 0 75 2 5 h only 10 70 m from the shoreline in a conventional unconfined coastal aquifer without naturally high hydraulic diffusivity more attention should thus be paid to the function of shallow aquifers in mangrove swamps such as rapid and frequent water and material exchange rates as discussed in sect 4 1 and sect 4 3 in addition the piezometric heads of the inland sites responded simultaneously with that on the mudflat it should also be noted that in the shallow zone there was no time lag between tide and groundwater data i e piezometric head and salinity at the fringe sampling sites gw3 and gw4 the response characteristics of different mangrove landforms are discussed in sect 4 2 4 discussion 4 1 capillary attenuation on groundwater response in the upper aquifer groundwater variations of coastal aquifers are mostly associated with tides in two processes namely pressure head propagation and capillary attenuation levanon et al 2017 pressure head propagation often occurs in the deeper parts of the aquifer especially in confined aquifers where the groundwater responds very fast with the tide levanon et al 2017 in an unconfined coastal aquifer the groundwater variation with the tide is attenuated with increasing time lags owing to capillary effects kong et al 2013 because the specific storage coefficient within unconfined aquifers is several orders of magnitude larger than the specific storage of confined aquifers jiao and tang 1999 levanon et al 2016 it has been reported that capillary attenuation in the tidal response of groundwater occurs either near the coast levanon et al 2017 or hundreds of kilometers from the coast subject to earth tides wang et al 2019 it also occurs either in silt aquifers or in sand aquifers wang et al 2019 the capillary effects on the groundwater response to tides decrease with the increasing distance to the water table for example the closer to the water table the smaller the amplitude of tidal response will be wang et al 2019 our sampling depths 0 2 m and 1 m were both located in the unconfined aquifer and were close to the water table hereafter referred to as the upper aquifer and so the groundwater variation in the upper aquifer is expected to be more affected by capillary attenuation than by pressure head propagation furthermore the upper aquifer of a mangrove swamp is predominantly composed of low permeability silt and clay which is thought to have larger capillary effects smith 1999 moreover the observed piezometric head data showed that 0 2 m below the surface is closer to the water table because the piezometric head is approximately 1 m throughout the year fig 3a as a result the amplitude of tidal response at 0 2 m is expected to be smaller than that at 1 m whereas the time for the tidal response at 0 2 m is expected to be longer than that at 1 m however this contradicts our observed data the groundwater variation 1 m below the surface seemed more attenuated than that 0 2 m below the surface either from the amplitudes of the extracted tidal signals or from the time lags relative to sea tide the above differences are most likely owing to the structure of the upper aquifer where there are abundant animal burrows and decayed roots in the shallow zone even on the upper soil layer of the mudflat there are many fiddler crabs and mudskippers in mai po mangrove swamp which create many macropores that enable the upper aquifer to effectively interact with the tide gomersall 2019 mazda and wolanski 2009 thus the capillary effects are reduced or even reversed by the effects from macropores in the shallow zone this special structure of the shallow zone also explains why the tidal signal still existed at a long distance from the shoreline however this is not a rationale for neglecting the horizontal tidal effects in mangrove swamps the actual tidal response measured at any point in the aquifer is the sum of the tidal response induced by the horizontal pressure propagation the capillary attenuation and the vertical efficient inundation owing to the special structure of the shallow zone notably the shallow zone is also a place of great ecological value where the majority of water sources and nutrients essential for mangroves come from and where mangroves are exposed to salinity variations reef and lovelock 2015 therefore the interpretation of the capillary attenuation of the tidal response of shallow unconfined aquifers in mangrove swamps without considering the structure of the shallow zone may lead to incorrect inferences of groundwater processes and properties these observations also highlight the importance of macropores in increasing the hydraulic conductivity of otherwise impermeable mangrove sediments 4 2 dependence of the tidal response on mangrove topography groundwater dynamics show different patterns in different mangrove topographies in the previous section we argued that in a shallow aquifer there may be vertical differences in the capillary attenuation with the capillary effects in the shallow zone being reduced or even reversed horizontally the tidal response relies more on the mangrove topography the riverine forest and mudflat both had lower average low water heights table 2 which means the soil there was drier at low tides than in the fringe forest considering that inland sites next to riverine forests are reported to remain wet at low tide it is possible that the significant slope of the riverine forest contributes to the ebbing away of groundwater from the swamp to the tidal creek when tides fall mazda 2013 mazda and wolanski 2009 this also suggests that the presence of macropores in mangrove forest helps to store water and retain groundwater levels at low tides mudflats without steep slopes dry rapidly after tides fall possibly because mudflats have fewer macropores because of a lack of decayed roots to store water compared with fringe forests moreover the time lags between the tide and the piezometric head and salinity showed strong dependence on the mangrove topography in the shallow zone table 3 the two fringe sampling sites demonstrated instantaneous responses to the tides with zero time lag the two riverine sampling sites and the mudflat site exhibited similar time lags from tides in sect 4 1 the presence of animal burrows and the presence of decayed roots are deduced as the possible reasons for the quick response in the shallow zone here we also consider the possibility that the high permeability zone owing to animal burrows and decayed roots together with direct exposure to tides has created a very efficient system for tidal water and shallow groundwater interaction as well as for salt transport at the fringe forest this also implies that material exchange at the edge of the forest could be rapid and frequent notably the above analysis of the tidal responses of the fringe forest is based on the fact that the surroundings are flat if the fringe forests had steep slopes like the riverine forests the slopes would likely further assist the exchange of groundwater at the fringe in contrast the permeability of the mudflat is lower than that of the mangrove swamp because of the lack of a root system and mangrove humus causing a longer time lag in response to tides although the riverine forest has high permeability the tidal water in contact with the site is mitigated somewhat as the tide passes through the mangrove swamp this may also account for the general amplitude decay with increasing distance from the shoreline these facts suggest that the tidal response of groundwater depends not only on the soil properties but also on the topography such as steep banks of tidal creeks in riverine forests 4 3 implications for groundwater exchange in mangrove swamps groundwater exchange is important for the biogeochemical circulation of coastal ecosystems because it transports water particles and solutes such as salt carbon and nitrogen into and out of coastal sediments sadat noori et al 2017 santos et al 2012b there are at least 12 mechanisms that drive the groundwater exchange among which tidal pumping bio irrigation hydraulic gradient and convection are believed to be the main origins of groundwater exchange in mangrove swamps gleeson et al 2013 santos et al 2012b these driving forces closely interact with tides tidal pumping is defined as the infiltration of seawater into the sediments at high tides and discharge of the same water at low tides li et al 2009 it occurs throughout the intertidal area and a lower intertidal zone is expected to experience more frequent tidal pumping as revealed from the inundation results table 2 as already implied for the fringe forest with the help of macropores and direct exposure to tides tidal pumping can reduce or even reverse the capillary effect in the upper aquifer therefore the contribution of tidal pumping to groundwater exchange is not simply determined by the inundation frequency it also relies on the structure and mangrove topography bio irrigation refers to the process of benthic organisms such as crabs flushing their burrows with overlying water kristensen and alongi 2006 in this study the flushing from the organisms was not traceable but the existence of the burrows assisted tidal pumping driven groundwater exchange hydraulic gradient driven groundwater exchange often takes the form of seepage and spring water santos et al 2012a this kind of groundwater exchange is often seen in the shallow zone of riverine forests as the shallow groundwater there quickly dries at low tides fig 3c as discussed tidal pumping and hydraulic gradient are largely considered the sources of groundwater exchange in the shallow zone however owing to the small tidal response of the middle zone these two driving forces may not be able to influence groundwater exchange in the middle zone if there is a driving force able to promote water and material exchange in the middle zone it should be a regional force convection is defined as density driven flow owing to salinity differences it can occur wherever there are density differences although the salinity of the middle zone did not show a clear pattern there was a clear tide induced salinity variation in the shallow zone fig 4d f and fig 5 from winter to early spring the groundwater of the shallow zone can be more saline than that of the middle zone especially on the mudflat as the salinity of the shallow zone increases during the dry season larger convection may develop perhaps driving an exchange potential with deeper groundwater santos et al 2012a in the wet season the gap in salinity of groundwater at different depths widened and it peaked in september fig 4 however because the shallow zone is fresher than the middle zone it is less likely to provoke convection driven groundwater exchange in this case upstream water inputs from increasing rainfall could be a supply for stabling the piezometric head and salinity in the middle zone in addition the recharge to the groundwater at mai po from upstream is only likely to occur in the wet season frost 1992 thus convection driven flow in the dry season is less likely to be affected by the upstream water inputs the results here reveal that tidal pumping and hydraulic gradient are the main mechanisms of groundwater exchange in the shallow zone in the mai po mangrove swamp however convection is likely the only driving force that can transport water and materials of the middle zone because it only depends on density differences determination of the groundwater exchange sources contributes to the understanding of the biogeochemical processes in mangrove swamps which is helpful for mitigating the release of carbon and greenhouse gases 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the relationships between tides and the piezometric head and salinity in a mangrove swamp our study revealed the detailed and complex relationships that differ from conventional coastal aquifers without naturally high hydraulic diffusivity and that can be overlooked using widely used natural geochemical tracers our results suggest that the shallow zones of the riverine forest and mudflat are drier than that of the fringe forest at low tides because the steep slope of the riverine forest contributes to groundwater discharge at low tides and mudflats have fewer macropores because of the lack of decayed roots to store water as compared with the fringe forest we also found that the groundwater fluctuations of the shallow zone and middle zone were highly dependent on tidal variations except the salinity of the middle zone which did not show a clear tidal trend the tidal influences were more pronounced at the fringe forest and the mudflat than at the riverine forest because of its rapid and frequent exchange with tides we suggest more attention should be paid to the functions of the shallow zone i e active root zone in mangrove swamps where tidal pumping and hydraulic gradient are the main sources of groundwater exchange in the middle zone convection is likely to be the only driving force that can transport the water and materials because it only depends on density differences when analyzing tidal fluctuations in the groundwater of mangrove swamps we recommend considering both the mangrove topography and the properties of the soil zones for example capillary attenuation of the tidal response of the upper aquifer of a mangrove swamp is mostly reduced at the fringe forest by tidal pumping with the help of abundant animal burrows and decayed roots and because of direct exposure to tides this study contributes to the understanding of groundwater fluctuations in response to tides in silty mangrove swamps it provides references for determining the sources of groundwater exchange which is important to biogeochemical processes of coastal areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5117,vegetation cover plays an essential role in control of soil erosion in the loess plateau of china the hydraulic resistance to overland flow under disturbed vegetation is critical in the study of water and soil conservation a series of experiments on runoff hydraulics was conducted on exposed slopes and surfaces with grass cover wheatgrass patches with vegetation density ranging from 0 58 to 5 76 and inflows ranging from 5 to 40 l min incorporating slopes ranging from 4 to 12 were used in this study a total of 264 groups of hydraulic runoff tests were conducted the test results showed that with increasing vegetation density the flow pattern evolved from transient to turbulent flow both vegetation density and slope affected the froude number fr vegetation density is an essential factor affecting flow resistance on the premise of variation in vegetation density the kendall coefficient of re and flow resistance exceeded 0 727 and the spearman correlation coefficient exceeded 0 872 the total resistance of overland flow under vegetation cover can be divided into form resistance and grain resistance with increased vegetation density the proportion of form resistance of the total resistance increased from 95 to 99 vegetation was the main factor that constitutes flow resistance and controls soil erosion these results are helpful for understanding the influence of vegetation community distribution on mechanisms of slope runoff and soil erosion keywords overland flow flow resistance vegetation hydrodynamics soil erosion loess plateau 1 introduction soil erosion is a significant environmental problem in the yellow river basin and the loess plateau in china reducing soil erosion can improve land productivity reduce river sediment concentration and other pollution loads water erosion is the main cause of soil erosion on the loess plateau vegetation can retain runoff and decrease soil erosion pedrani 2011 schumm 1991 zhao et al 2016 the chinese government has experimented with the grain for green project in the loess plateau over the past two decades and has effectively alleviated the problem of soil erosion in this region at present vegetation restoration on the loess plateau has entered the stage of natural succession due to the succession and degradation of vegetation communities the distribution of vegetation cover was random and patches differed in plant density and varying degrees of soil erosion occurred during rainfall therefore studies on the influence of vegetation cover on water erosion are gaining increasing attention in the field of soil erosion science a considerable amount of research has investigated the influence of different vegetation factors on flow resistance el kateb et al 2013 found that soil loss and runoff from cultivated soils were much larger than from grasslands busari and li 2016 found that under the same flow conditions rigid vegetation exerted a larger flow resistance than a flexible plant at the same flow depth the manning coefficient decreases with a decrease in vegetation stiffness parsons et al 1994 found that the resistance coefficient of a thicket was less than that of a meadow jin et al 2000 and mu et al 2019a concluded that flow resistance is proportional to flow depth and vegetation density experimental results showed that the curve of the relationship between flow resistance and reynolds number re does not monotonically increase or decrease and the curves of re and ftotal are influenced by various factors including vegetation cover slope and vegetation type pan et al 2016 found that when the unit flow is higher than the upper critical flow the effect of vegetation on flow resistance is greater than that of surface roughness many studies have shown that vegetation type abrahams et al 1994 garcía díaz et al 2017 vegetation diameter zhao et al 2016 and stem stiffness li et al 2014 xia and nehal 2013 all influence flow resistance simplified studies need to focus on isolating and quantifying the potential effects of vegetation stems on overland flow hydraulics in fixed beds and focus on exploring the application of findings from fixed beds to erodible beds zhao et al 2016 many researchers have explored various empirical equations for calculating the resistance of vegetation covered slopes ma et al 2017 gilley and finkner 1991 and smith et al 2007 studied the relationship between the darcy resistance coefficient and flow resistance under vegetation cover based on the colebrook white equation a predictive model of the influence of vegetation on the flow resistance of a bank slope was established darby and thorne 1996 based on the hydraulic radius of vegetation and the average velocity of flow through the vegetation patch the flow resistance formula under vegetation was established cheng 2013 cheng et al 2019 and shi et al 2019 derived the formula for the resistance coefficient based on the theory of the energy equation of gradual flow liu et al 2019 proposed an equivalent roughness formula based on the vorticity near the plant stem and calculated the flow resistance by using the equivalent roughness inspired by the hydraulics of channels or pipelines some scholars have used a formula containing re to express the slope flow resistance however due to significant differences in test conditions including slope soil type and vegetation characteristics there is no calculation method currently available for flow resistance applicable to slopes with vegetation cover in fixed bed studies the total resistance ftotal is usually divided into four resistance components hu and abrahams 2006 the total flow resistance ftotal is a linear superposition of grain resistance fgrain form resistance fform wave resistance fwave and rain resistance frain grain resistance caused by the grain roughness of the slope surface is related to re form resistance is created by the obstruction to flow it is the resistance caused by vegetation stems litter and gravel wave resistance comes from the dissipation of runoff energy caused by rolling waves and rain resistance comes from the disturbance of runoff by raindrop splash the characteristics of vegetation are also an element that affects resistance to overland flow the resistance caused by vegetation is closely related to the pliability shape and size of plants when the saint venant equation is used to simulate the hydrological process of overland flow hydraulic roughness is particularly essential for calculating flow velocity water depth and runoff process lawrence 2000 used uniform sediment to simulate the roughness of the slope and demonstrated that the surface roughness ks is closely related to the median particle size of sediment d the relationship between equivalent roughness ks and the roughness element density was studied by wooding et al 1973 through a series of detailed experiments parameters such as d pipe diameter and δ boundary layer thickness were introduced to express equivalent roughness ks by raupach et al 1991 the superposition principle of resistance and equivalent roughness can be effective methods to determine flow resistance under vegetation cover raupach et al 1991 overall water flow is a crucial factor in detachment and transport during soil erosion the study of the hydraulic characteristics including flow resistance and flow pattern of overland flow is helpful in explaining the mechanism of soil erosion caused by overland flow although there have been many studies on the influence of vegetation characteristics on flow resistance further study of the influence of vegetation density on the dynamic characteristics of overland flow is still required many useful experiments have explored the expression of flow resistance under vegetation cover but there is still no unified equation to define it in addition there remains a lack of quantitative research on the mechanisms of formation of flow resistance to overland flow under different surface conditions including vegetation cover density and slope therefore the study of overland flow hydraulic resistance under different vegetation densities is an effective way to reveal the mechanism of soil erosion under the influence of vegetation léonard and richard 2004 the objective of this study was to 1 analyse the influence of vegetation density on the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow 2 calculate the flow resistance using vegetation equivalent roughness and quantify the influence of vegetation density on flow resistance and 3 ascertain the contribution of slope roughness and vegetation cover to total resistance and quantitatively analyse the influence of vegetation density on the components of flow resistance the research results will help to clarify the formation of overland flow resistance and will explain how vegetation reduces the energy carried by water flow and water erosion a quantitative study can provide a basis for the optimal design of vegetation measures on the loess plateau in addition this study can provide 264 groups of experimental data for the establishment of an erosion model which is helpful improving the accuracy of prediction of the soil erosion model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and treatments the runoff plot was 4 5 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 1 m deep and was made of spliced plexiglass panels an adjustable height bracket supported the flume with a slope adjustment range of 0 15 water flow discharged into the top of the flume was provided by a water tank placed at the top of the flume fig 1 a plate with a high density of holes was arranged in the water tank to smooth the flow flow discharge was controlled using an adjustable valve installed at the bottom of the water tank a peristaltic pump model yz35 drive zg600x was also used to adjust the flow discharge during the test clusters of artificial grasses with 1 mm thick stem and 20 mm tall were used to simulate the influence of common gramineous plants triticum aestivum l on runoff in the loess plateau in the experiment the size and rigidity of the artificial grass were similar to those of natural plants and the grass was reused there were two test schemes in the experiments bare slope and vegetation cover table 1 the bare slope was the flume bottom composed of glued 40 mesh sandpaper es according to the typical vegetation distribution on the loess plateau the density of vegetation cover sg was approximately 0 58 1 15 1 73 2 3 2 88 3 42 4 03 4 61 5 18 and 5 76 vegetation density was calculated from the total number of stems and stem diameter table 2 grasses were randomly arranged in clusters fig 2 parameters such as the cross sectional area were calculated in the hydrodynamic test a hydrodynamic study was used to calculate the cross sectional area and other parameters of water flow the density of vegetation was used in this study instead of vegetation cover to indicate the number of plants because mature gramineae plants have an umbrella shape they can form a fully vegetated cover with low vegetation density a stem density of 5 76 could form approximately 94 canopy projected cover fig 2f thus the bare ground between the stems could not be seen from above the grasses before the test the slope surface and the grasses were fully wet to reduce fluctuations in water flow caused by differences in dryness across the surface of the slope the slope of the water erosion zone on the loess plateau is generally below 10 and overland flow is the main factor causing water erosion guo et al 2019 therefore a maximum slope of 12 was applied in this study according to the planning and layout principles of slope erosion experimental plots tucker and bras 1998 the slopes of these experiments were set as 4 8 and 12 previous studies have shown that there is a critical rainfall intensity that causes soil erosion in the loess plateau in some areas of china the critical rainfall intensity was defined as 10 25 mm h 1 wei et al 2007 shi and shao 2000 obtained the characteristics for torrential rain in the loess plateau based on the criteria of soil erosion in the loess plateau thus rain intensities of 30 mm h and 120 mm h were selected in the present study moreover eight rates of discharge 5 7 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 40 l min were selected for this experiment based on a consideration of the range of hydrodynamic conditions the surface velocity of flow in each experiment was measured using a dye kmno4 tracer the 2 5 m long test area was divided into three slope sections from top to bottom i e 0 25 1 m 1 1 75 m and 1 75 2 5 m five stopwatch readings were recorded for each section the maximum and minimum values were rejected at each section thus three readings were kept and the surface velocity vs of each slope section was calculated a needle water level gauge model scm40 60 measured the flow depth of each section there were three cross sections perpendicular to the direction of water flow 0 75 m 1 5 m and 2 25 m five water depth measuring points were set at equal intervals for each section flow depth was calculated based on the elevation difference between the slope and the water surface the average flow depth at the measuring points was used as the average flow depth of each section the mean values of the multi section and multi points are closer to the real velocity and water depth of the test section 2 2 hydrodynamic parameter the reynolds number is a dimensionless parameter usually used in hydrodynamics to distinguish whether flow is laminar or turbulent for open channel flow when re 500 flow is laminar when 500 re 5000 flow is transitional when re 5000 flow is turbulent liu et al 2008 concluded that velocity profiles within the vegetation patch for both emergent and submerged flows at the locations in line are a region of lower constant velocity throughout most of the flow depth the velocity then just increases slightly near the free surface so eq 1 uses the average surface velocity instead of the average velocity the re was calculated as follows 1 re ru ν where r is the hydraulic radius m u is the mean flow velocity m s 1 and ν is the kinematic viscosity the froude number reflects how flow velocity and water depth interact and is defined as the ratio of inertia to gravity it is usually used to distinguish whether flow is supercritical or subcritical when fr 1 fr 1 and fr 1 flow is supercritical subcritical or critical flow respectively the froude number fr was calculated as follows 2 fr u gh where g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 and h is the mean flow depth m the hydraulic radius is defined as the ratio of the discharge cross sectional area of flow to the wetted perimeter 3 r a p where a is the discharge cross sectional area m2 and p is the wetted perimeter m due to the vegetation cover grass occupied some space in the flume so the discharge section area was calculated as follows 4 a b e h where be is the effective flow width after removing obstacles in the flow path 5 b e b 1 d v where b is the width of the flume m and dv is the density of vegetation which was calculated by dividing the cross sectional area of the grass stem by the area of the test section vegetation density was calculated as follows 6 d v n π r 2 bl where n is the total number of stems r is the stem radius mm and l is the length of the test section m grasses in the flume were randomly distributed so the wetted perimeter was defined as the ratio of the wet area of the trial area to the length of the trial area 7 p 2 h b l n c π d h n l where n is the total number of stems c is the cross sectional area of a single stem and d is the diameter of the stem 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 trend line analysis the linear trend can eliminate the influence of experimental error on the flow resistance of the slope covered by vegetation and it can reflect the comprehensive impact of vegetation density changes on resistance simple linear regression is based on the change in vegetation density of a single phase element to reflect the total resistance this study used linear regression to analyse the trend of the total resistance in the experimental data which was calculated as follows 8 slope n i 1 n i f i i 1 n i i 1 n f i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope is the slope of the trend line f i is the total resistance of the group i trial and n is the total number of trial groups when slope 0 the total resistance increased moreover the steeper slope resulted in a larger increase in resistance the r2 was used to assess the proportion of variance explained by the independent variable and was calculated as follows 9 r 2 ssr sst where ssr y i y 2 is the regression sum of squares sst y i y 2 is the residual sum of squares y i is the calculated resistance value of group i trial y is the mean value of the calculated resistance y i and is the fitted value of resistance for group i 2 3 2 spearman s correlation coefficient the spearman correlation coefficient ρ indicates the correlation between x independent variable and y dependent variable and was calculated as follows 10 ρ σ i x i x y i y σ i x i x 2 σ i y i y 2 where xi and yi are variables x and y are averages of variables if x increases and y tends to increase he spearman correlation coefficient is positive if x increases and y tends to decrease the spearman correlation coefficient is negative when x and y approach a complete monotonic correlation the spearman correlation coefficient will increase in absolute value in this study the spearman correlation coefficient was used to indicate the correlation between re and flow resistance 2 3 3 kendall correlation coefficient the kendal correlation coefficient is used to measure the correlation between two random variables 11 τ 4 p n n 1 1 where n is the number of variables and p is the sum of all variables of the number of items ranked after the given item by both rankings the kendal correlation coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 when τ is 1 the two random variables have the same rank correlation when τ is 1 the two random variables have opposite rank correlation when τ is 0 the two random variables are independent of each other in this study the kendall correlation coefficient was used to indicate the correlation between re and flow resistance 2 3 4 nse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is generally used to verify the quality of simulation results and compares the goodness of fit of simulation and measured values the value of the nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 when nse is close to 1 the model outputs accurately reflect experimental data and have high credibility when nse is close to 0 it means that the simulation result is close to the average level of the observed value which means that the overall result is credible but the simulation errors are significant when nse is much less than 0 it means the model is not credible the kendal correlation coefficient was calculated as follows 12 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i is the simulation value of sample o i is the measured value of sample is the average value of the sample and n is the number of samples 2 3 5 mad the mean absolute deviation is the average of the absolute values of the deviations of all individual observations from the arithmetic mean the mean absolute deviation can avoid the problem of errors counteracting each other it can accurately reflect the size of the actual prediction error and was calculated as follows 13 mad 1 n i 1 n x i x where x i is the calculated value of trial resistance for group i and x is the mean calculated resistance 3 results 3 1 effects of vegetation density on hydrodynamic parameters vegetation density and slope influenced the distribution range of re fig 3 the distribution of re for a 4 slope ranged from 562 to 1510 to 360 3796 at an 8 slope it ranged from 834 to 1204 to 440 5336 at a 12 slope it ranged from 852 to 1504 to 338 3234 under all slope and vegetation densities laminar flow occurred only at a rate of discharge of 5 l min 1 at a slope of 4 and a 5 76 vegetation density and a rate of discharge of 40 l min 1 flow was turbulent in other conditions flow was transitional the mean values of peak re for the 4 8 and 12 slopes were 1181 1939 and 4122 respectively flow changed from transient to turbulent flow wisps of the dye were observed undulating in a wavy shape the amplitude of the undulation increased with an increase in the rate of discharge indicating that the flow changed from transitional to turbulent vegetation density and slope influenced the distribution range of the froude number fr fig 4 for the 4 slope fr greatly exceeded 1 when vegetation density was in the range 0 58 1 73 and flow was rapid when vegetation density ranged from 2 35 to 4 61 fr changed from 1 23 to 1 01 and the rate of flow declined when the vegetation density was 4 03 and 4 61 and when flow was less than 20 l min 1 fr was almost 1 under this condition flow was considered to be the critical flow when vegetation density was 5 18 and 5 76 fr 1 and flow was slow the distribution of fr for the 8 slope ranged from 2 5 to 3 0 to 0 9 1 3 for the 12 slope it ranged from 2 5 to 2 7 to 0 7 1 8 increased vegetation density resulted in the flow changing from rapid to critical flow and even to slow flow in summary flow was affected by both slope and vegetation density with an increase of slope flow changed from slow to rapid flow in contrast with an increase of vegetation cover flow changed from rapid to slow flow the effects of vegetation density and slope on flow were to restrict each other 3 2 formula of flow resistance based on equivalent roughness converting vegetation properties to a roughness height allowed calculation of flow resistance the roughness height is often identified as a critical factor affecting the resistance to overland flow in nikurade s study of resistance to overland flow a uniform cover of granules was used as roughness elements and the roughness height ks of the uniform granule was demonstrated to be proportional to the median diameter d of the slope sediment this can be used as a useful parameter for calculating resistance to flow vegetation is the main roughness element that produces resistance to overland flow on slopes covered by vegetation many studies have explored the form of the resistance expression as a function of the equivalent roughness height because of the complexity of vegetation morphological characteristics and randomness of distribution the present study used vegetation as a roughness element to study resistance to flow it was assumed that the expression of coefficient of pipe flow resistance is also applicable to the calculation of slope flow resistance in previous studies nicholas proposed that the resistance coefficient is related to re and friction velocity u the resistance coefficient can be expressed as follows 14 λ 8 u 2 u 2 where u is the friction velocity u gri formula 14 has also been shown to be suitable for various shapes of roughness elements including squares and hemispherical in subsequent research to simplify the calculation parameters and improve calculation accuracy hinze proposed an empirical formula for the resistance coefficient suitable for rough regions based on the colebrook white equation darby and thorne 1996 15 λ 2 log 3 7 h k s 2 eqs 14 and 15 are used to calculate the resistance coefficient of rough walls for a constant flow depth the equivalent roughness in eq 15 is the only variable the two simultaneous equations can be solved to obtain the equivalent roughness height of the equivalent roughness element of the vegetated slope 16 k sv 3 7h 10 1 2 u 2 8 g r i according to the method of expressing riverbed roughness proposed by nikuraz ks0 was set as the roughness height of the slope outside the vegetation covered area the equivalent roughness height of vegetation and the roughness of the slope were calculated and superimposed to obtain the equivalent roughness height of the slope covered by vegetation 17 k s k sv 1 d v k s 0 the flow around resistance fd is the sum of the frictional resistance and differential pressure resistance of the fluid passing the surface of the object resistance in the flow direction caused by the obstruction of uniform vegetation stems was defined as 18 f d λ ρ hd u 2 2 where λ is the resistance coefficient ρ is water density kg m 3 and d is the diameter of the roughness element m by replacing the roughness element diameter with the equivalent roughness height of the slope in the equation an expression of the flow resistance of a vegetation covered slope can be obtained 19 f total λ ρ u 2 h k s 2 substituting eqs 16 and 17 into eq 19 the equation for the calculation of slope flow resistance based on equivalent roughness and related to vegetation density was obtained 20 f total 1 2 λ ρ u 2 h 3 7 h 10 1 2 u 2 p 8 g i b 1 d v 1 d v k s 0 according to the principle of resistance segmentation the form resistance caused by vegetation is the difference between total resistance and particle resistance 21 f form f total f grain the equivalent roughness height under test conditions was calculated from eqs 16 and 17 fig 5 substituting the calculated equivalent roughness into formula 20 allowed calculation of resistance values under different vegetation densities fig 6 flow resistance increased with increased vegetation density and resistance increased when vegetation density exceeded 3 42 vegetation density had a significant effect on the change in flow resistance fig 7 across the range 0 58 2 88 of vegetation density resistance increased from 0 to 2 48 only for the 4 slope the maximum resistance was 4 7 for a vegetation density of 3 42 5 76 when flow was less than 15 l min 1 resistance was always less than 2 when the rate of discharge exceeded 15 l min 1 resistance ranged between 15 and 29 9 42 3 and 6 13 under 4 8 and 12 slopes respectively analysis of the resistance trend line table 3 demonstrated that for 0 58 2 88 vegetation density the slope of the regression was positive and the change in slope was only 0 1783 resistance increased slowly and changes in vegetation density influenced the resistance for 3 42 5 76 vegetation density the regression slope was positive for all slopes and the slope increased by 0 5363 1 3907 and 0 0752 at 4 8 and 12 of slope respectively flow resistance was significantly affected by vegetation density 3 3 effect of vegetation density on re ftotal relationships the trend of the re ftotal relationship was affected by vegetation density fig 8 for vegetation densities between 0 58 and 3 42 flow resistance was always less than 5 the re was always less than 2000 and several re was less than 500 thus flow was laminar although several re exceeded 500 the value was small and flow was closer to laminar flow for 4 03 5 76 vegetation density resistance increased significantly with increased re and the increase became more apparent with increased density while the increase in vegetation density enhanced flow turbulence and the increased re for each slope was 1530 2503 and 1560 respectively due to the increase in vegetation density flow circuity increased and the contact area with vegetation increased leading to an increased resistance 3 4 effect of vegetation density on fr f relationships relationships between flow resistance and fr showed different trends as vegetation density changed fig 9 for 0 58 1 73 vegetation density the value of flow resistance was almost unaffected by the variation in fr for 2 3 4 61 vegetation density taking the 8 slope and 40 l min discharge as an example fr ranged from 1 51 to 1 01 and the resistance increment ranged from 2 47 to 12 8 as the rate of flow changed to slow flow resistance increased for 5 18 5 76 vegetation density fr was maintained at approximately 0 7 1 0 and 1 6 at slopes of 4 8 and 12 respectively flow resistance ranged from approximately 0 3 to 29 42 and 12 respectively all of which were the maximum resistances 3 5 effect of vegetation density on the composition of flow resistance 3 5 1 grain resistance the resistance caused by water flowing over bare sandpaper is the grain resistance when this roughness was constant the grain resistance increased with an increase in discharge flow fig 10 a the resistance ranged between 0 004 and 0 066 and the variation of each slope was minimal however with the addition of vegetation cover the contribution of grain resistance to total resistance was affected by changes in vegetation density fig 11 when vegetation density was 2 3 4 03 or 5 76 the minimum proportion of grain resistance to total resistance was 2 18 0 59 and 0 13 respectively and the maximum proportions were 9 47 5 70 and 2 16 respectively 3 5 2 form resistance detracting grain resistance caused by slope roughness from the total resistance yields the form resistance caused by the action of vegetation for 0 58 2 88 vegetation densities the maximum form resistances at 4 8 and 12 of slope were only 4 7 3 48 and 3 2 respectively for larger vegetation densities 3 42 5 76 resistances at 4 8 and 12 slopes were within 29 85 42 25 and 12 99 respectively considerably larger than those with low vegetation densities the contribution of form resistance to total resistance under different vegetation densities differed with increased vegetation density the median of the percentage of form resistance of total resistance p for all slopes increased from 95 to 99 for a 4 slope larger the vegetation densities resulted in a more restricted distribution of p values the less of resistance composition is affected by slope flow discharge and other factors fig 11a for 8 and 12 slopes when the density of vegetation ranged between 1 73 and 2 88 the distribution of p values was larger than that of the other densities fig 11b c for steep slopes the compositional proportions of resistance were strongly influenced by factors such as slope and flow rate for the 4 and 12 slopes when vegetation density was 1 73 the mean proportion of form resistance was 96 59 and 94 62 respectively for the 8 slope when vegetation density was 2 3 mean p was 95 77 and the minimum values within the 1 5 iqr were all smaller than larger or smaller densities fig 11a b c in summary for 1 73 2 3 vegetation density the form resistance caused by vegetation was much larger than the grain resistance however the contribution of form resistance to total resistance decreased and the proportion of grain resistance increased 4 discussion the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of changes in vegetation cover on mechanisms of soil erosion in the loess plateau of china through analyses of flume experiments we quantitatively examined the effects of ten vegetation densities on hydraulic parameters and flow resistance to overland flow as a function of slope variation in vegetation density caused re and fr to change compared to those under bare slopes and these parameters were affected by both vegetation density and slope changes in vegetation density caused changes in the proportional composition of overland flow resistance 4 1 effects of vegetation density on hydrodynamic parameters 4 1 1 reynolds number reynolds number tended to increase with an increase in rate of discharge flow and vegetation density although flow did not become turbulent under most conditions as the vegetation density increased flow changed from transitional to turbulent flow these results were similar to those of meng 2019 and zhao et al 2015 moreover pan and shangguan 2006 and wu et al 2011 found that re on a moveable bed decreased as vegetation cover increased although it appears that the test results differ from the results of previous studies they are in fact the same under moveable bed conditions vegetation roots can increase infiltration and reduce runoff thereby reducing erosion however under fixed bed conditions water flows through the spaces between plants the higher the vegetation density the smaller the effective width of the cross section and the more intense the disturbance to water flow caused by the vegetation from the definition of re r is an important parameter in the calculation of re and they are positively correlated in the absence of vegetation open channel the calculation of r is unaffected by vegetation however eqs 1 3 7 demonstrate that vegetation density is an important factor affecting r therefore an increase in vegetation density leads to an increase in re and water flows change from transitional to turbulent the waves and eddies formed by the turbulence dissipates much of the energy carried by the flow thereby reducing its ability to remove soil particles and carry sediment thus it can be concluded that increasing vegetation density reduces soil erosion 4 1 2 froude number as vegetation density increased fr tended to decrease and flow rate declined from rapid to slow flow similar results were obtained in a fixed bed test mu et al 2019a zhao et al 2015 found that fr was approximately 50 lower on forest covered slopes than bare slopes in addition under the moveable bed of grass cover and simulated rainfall pan and shangguan 2006 wu et al 2011 fr decreased with increased vegetation cover which indicates that the stems of vegetation could weaken the flow s power and the ability of overland flow to carry sand however the fr in the present study was larger than that of pan and shangguan 2006 this may have resulted from the denser vegetation more concentrated water flow and higher flow velocity through the vegetation in this experiment compared to that of pan and shangguan 2006 however the test results demonstrated that as the slope increased fr increased and the flow changed from slow to rapid flows zhao et al 2019 concluded that the flow runoff is related to changes in slope in a study by pan et al 2016 through a flume test under vegetation cover fr increased with increased slope helmers and eisenhauer 2006 also found that on steep slopes covered by vegetation overland flow often occurs in rapids zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that the flow changed from slow to rapid flow with increased slope and flow changed from rapid to slow flow with increased vegetation cover vegetation density and slope restrict each other s influence on the rate of flow consistent with the results of the present study this indicates that under steep slopes flow tends to be more rapid but increased vegetation density can effectively reverse this trend therefore vegetation cover can substantially inhibit soil erosion and the transport of sediment thereby reducing the occurrence of soil erosion 4 2 resistance calculation under vegetation cover the principle of linear superposition of resistance has been widely used in the study of overland flow resistance hu and abrahams 2006 derived an equation for the calculation of resistance using dimensional analysis and regression analysis on slopes covered with vegetation different forms of resistance elements on the slope surface exert a significant influence on simulation results the test results show that the resistance segmentation calculation model is in best agreement with measured values hu s resistance segmentation model was used as the standard value to analyses the nse and the mad between eq 20 and the results of the resistance segmentation model under different vegetation densities to verify the results of eq 20 in this study the nse was 0 58 and the data were evenly distributed around the 1 1 line fig 12 the pearson correlation coefficient of the two data sets was 0 8195 r2 0 67 and the mad value was 2 64 representing only 6 25 of the resistance value these results show that vegetation density is an essential factor in determining resistance to flow because vegetation density is an essential factor affecting overland flow resistance eq 20 based on the equivalent roughness of vegetation is deemed to be reasonable the results of the current study demonstrated that resistance and re always have a power function relationship consistent with the conclusion of gilley and finkner 1991 and pan and shangguan 2006 in all test groups the resistance ftotal increased with re this result differs from the conclusion of the bare slope test in the experiment with only particle friction ftotal decreased significantly with increased re in contrast in the flume test with vegetation cover zhao et al 2015 examined the influence of vegetation on the mechanics of slope water flow and the ftotal of the four groups of tests all decreased with an increase in re zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that when vegetation cover was small the vegetation resistance coefficient decreased with the increase in re and when vegetation cover was large the flow resistance coefficient gradually increased with the increase in re omidvar et al 2019 believed that on a rough bed ftotal and re do not indicate a consistent or monotonic relationship by comparing their experimental conditions it can be demonstrated that vegetation density and surface roughness are essential factors affecting the relationship between ftotal and re this inconsistency is caused by the different shapes and densities of the rough elements moreover the resistance of these rough elements increases with increased discharge flow the results of mu et al 2019b support our conclusion in summary re can be used as a predictive factor of flow resistance on slopes having vegetation cover the relationship between resistance and re can establish a bridge between the study of flow dynamics and soil erosion on the loess plateau resistance did not exhibit a no good functional relationship with fr but vegetation density exerted a significant influence on the ftotal fr relationship at fr 1 when vegetation density was about 4 61 to 5 18 resistance increased sharply reflecting the interaction of velocity with water depth defined as the ratio of inertia to gravity flow resistance is also influenced by gravity and inertial forces therefore it can be assumed that the sum of the effects of inertia and gravity on overland flow will be maximal under different slopes and vegetation densities therefore resistance to water flow will reach a maximum when vegetation density was about 4 61 to 5 18 furthermore it can be assumed that the increased resistance is due to the additional drag provided by the rolling wave of overland flow the occurrence of the rolling wave is related to slope flow and vegetation obstruction previous studies have also demonstrated that rolling waves usually occur in overland flow and this is related to wave resistance and can affect flow resistance wang et al 2019 pan et al 2016 proposed that when fr 0 6 rolling waves become the main component of f thus rolling waves and flow patterns have an essential influence on the formation of resistance to flow therefore the rolling wave of slope runoff is an essential factor affecting soil erosion on loess slopes however there are limited data on the effects of flow pattern and rolling waves on flow resistance it is necessary to carry out further overland flow and runoff experiments correlation analysis between the re of each slope and the flow resistance value was undertaken table 4 for the 4 8 and 12 slopes spearman correlation coefficients were 0 872 0 910 and 0 936 respectively and the kendall correlation coefficients were 0 727 0 750 and 0 795 respectively the increase in slope leads to increased correlation between re and flow resistance and the influence of vegetation density on the relationship was reduced this shows that steep slopes are more suitable for use of re as the parameter calculating flow resistance compared gentle slopes in summary flow resistance under vegetation cover has a power function relationship with re but re is not a consistent and exclusive factor affecting flow resistance on slopes with vegetation cover flow resistance ftotal should be a function under the comprehensive influence of multiple factors including re vegetation density and slope the correlations between fr and flow resistance were analysed table 4 for the 4 8 and 12 slopes spearman correlation coefficients were 0 771 0 471 and 0 420 and the kendall correlation coefficients were 0 594 0 335 and 0 335 respectively for a gentle slope 4 the correlation between fr and flow resistance was moderate and the correlation weakened as slope increased 8 12 therefore fr is not the best parameter to represent resistance to overland flow 4 3 effects of vegetation density on the composition of flow resistance following the principle of superposition of resistance grain resistance was subtracted from the total resistance to calculate the form resistance caused by vegetation fig 13 for overland flow influenced by vegetation part of the total flow resistance arises from vegetation and the rest arises from the slope surface the results of cao et al 2015 and wang et al 2014 also show that grasslands significantly increase the resistance to surface runoff compared to grain surfaces they also emphasised the importance of surface vegetation for total resistance when re 1000 they studied grass and bushes in a walnut orchard in southern arizona and found that grain resistance contributed less than 10 of the total resistance pan et al 2016 found that when re 10000 on slopes with high vegetation cover 90 of the flow resistance was caused by the hindrance imposed by plant stems in this study flow resistance was calculated by the roughness height under our experimental conditions the roughness height calculated by the minimum vegetation density was much larger than the slope roughness height as a result form resistance of vegetation accounted for a large proportion of total resistance when the vegetation density was between 1 73 and 2 3 the contribution of form resistance to total resistance decreased the proportion of grain resistance will increase accordingly with increased grain resistance soil erosion and sediment transportation are more likely to occur 4 4 future research prospects vegetation cover of slopes produced larger resistance to flow than bare slopes while flow resistance sharply increased which can reduce the energy carried by water flow and reduce soil erosion and water and soil loss the decrease in flow velocity is the direct manifestation of the increase in flow resistance slow water flows not only increase infiltration and reduce peak flows but also prolong the retention time of nitrogen in vegetated areas china has been facilitating the return of farmland to forest and grassland in the loess plateau for two decades and vegetation cover of the loess plateau has been dramatically improved with concomitant declines in soil erosion a result in accordance with the results of the present study the continuous growth of cultivated herbaceous plants and roots plus an accumulation of litter will change the underlying surface conditions and soil properties the root system can consolidate soil and improve infiltration capacity the shear strength and cohesion index of soil under vegetation should be considered as the next topic of research in arid or semi arid climates due to the cumulative effect of slope runoff the downslope often experiences a larger flow discharge or re than the upslope zhao et al 2019 the influence of vegetation cover on runoff and sediment transport on downslopes may be more significant than that on the upslope therefore landscape heterogeneity of grasslands due to the succession of vegetation communities will change the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow and this also requires intensive research 5 conclusions experiments on the effects of varying wheatgrass patch densities on overland flow were conducted in this study equivalent roughness was used to calculate vegetation resistance the effects of vegetation density on hydrodynamic parameters components and variations in flow resistance were examined the following conclusions were derived plant stems exert a significant effect on the hydraulic parameters of overland flow the ranges of re and fr were affected by slope and vegetation density with increased vegetation density the flow changed from transitional flow to turbulent flow with increased slope flow changed from slow flow to rapid flow in contrast increased vegetation density resulted in flow changing from rapid to slow flow overland flow carries less energy when flow is slow and it is difficult to trigger soil erosion and sediment transport thereby mitigating soil erosion in these tests resistance increased with increasing vegetation density when vegetation density was 4 03 5 76 the increase of flow resistance was the largest vegetation density affected the relationship between flow resistance and re with the change in vegetation density the relationship between flow resistance and fr showed a different trend when vegetation density was about 4 61 5 18 resistance to flow increased significantly and this was caused by the wave resistance from rolling waves re can be used as a predictor of the resistance to overland flow under vegetation cover on a fixed bed slope covered by vegetation under non rainfall conditions the contribution of form resistance to total resistance is much greater than that of grain resistance the contribution of form resistance to total resistance under different vegetation densities was significantly different when vegetation density was between 1 73 and 2 3 the contribution of grain resistance increased thereby increasing soil erosion as vegetation density increased the median value of the proportion of form resistance in total resistance increased from 95 to 99 higher density vegetation can dissipate the energy carried by water flow and reduce soil erosion therefore vegetation plantation can largely reduces the soil erosion on the slopes this hints that revegetation will greatly decrease the potential of soil erosion even if the shielding effect of vegetation canopy under heavy rain is not considered this finding matches the sharp drop in the sediment yield generated from the loess plateau of china due to the vegetation restoration in recent years funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no

5117,vegetation cover plays an essential role in control of soil erosion in the loess plateau of china the hydraulic resistance to overland flow under disturbed vegetation is critical in the study of water and soil conservation a series of experiments on runoff hydraulics was conducted on exposed slopes and surfaces with grass cover wheatgrass patches with vegetation density ranging from 0 58 to 5 76 and inflows ranging from 5 to 40 l min incorporating slopes ranging from 4 to 12 were used in this study a total of 264 groups of hydraulic runoff tests were conducted the test results showed that with increasing vegetation density the flow pattern evolved from transient to turbulent flow both vegetation density and slope affected the froude number fr vegetation density is an essential factor affecting flow resistance on the premise of variation in vegetation density the kendall coefficient of re and flow resistance exceeded 0 727 and the spearman correlation coefficient exceeded 0 872 the total resistance of overland flow under vegetation cover can be divided into form resistance and grain resistance with increased vegetation density the proportion of form resistance of the total resistance increased from 95 to 99 vegetation was the main factor that constitutes flow resistance and controls soil erosion these results are helpful for understanding the influence of vegetation community distribution on mechanisms of slope runoff and soil erosion keywords overland flow flow resistance vegetation hydrodynamics soil erosion loess plateau 1 introduction soil erosion is a significant environmental problem in the yellow river basin and the loess plateau in china reducing soil erosion can improve land productivity reduce river sediment concentration and other pollution loads water erosion is the main cause of soil erosion on the loess plateau vegetation can retain runoff and decrease soil erosion pedrani 2011 schumm 1991 zhao et al 2016 the chinese government has experimented with the grain for green project in the loess plateau over the past two decades and has effectively alleviated the problem of soil erosion in this region at present vegetation restoration on the loess plateau has entered the stage of natural succession due to the succession and degradation of vegetation communities the distribution of vegetation cover was random and patches differed in plant density and varying degrees of soil erosion occurred during rainfall therefore studies on the influence of vegetation cover on water erosion are gaining increasing attention in the field of soil erosion science a considerable amount of research has investigated the influence of different vegetation factors on flow resistance el kateb et al 2013 found that soil loss and runoff from cultivated soils were much larger than from grasslands busari and li 2016 found that under the same flow conditions rigid vegetation exerted a larger flow resistance than a flexible plant at the same flow depth the manning coefficient decreases with a decrease in vegetation stiffness parsons et al 1994 found that the resistance coefficient of a thicket was less than that of a meadow jin et al 2000 and mu et al 2019a concluded that flow resistance is proportional to flow depth and vegetation density experimental results showed that the curve of the relationship between flow resistance and reynolds number re does not monotonically increase or decrease and the curves of re and ftotal are influenced by various factors including vegetation cover slope and vegetation type pan et al 2016 found that when the unit flow is higher than the upper critical flow the effect of vegetation on flow resistance is greater than that of surface roughness many studies have shown that vegetation type abrahams et al 1994 garcía díaz et al 2017 vegetation diameter zhao et al 2016 and stem stiffness li et al 2014 xia and nehal 2013 all influence flow resistance simplified studies need to focus on isolating and quantifying the potential effects of vegetation stems on overland flow hydraulics in fixed beds and focus on exploring the application of findings from fixed beds to erodible beds zhao et al 2016 many researchers have explored various empirical equations for calculating the resistance of vegetation covered slopes ma et al 2017 gilley and finkner 1991 and smith et al 2007 studied the relationship between the darcy resistance coefficient and flow resistance under vegetation cover based on the colebrook white equation a predictive model of the influence of vegetation on the flow resistance of a bank slope was established darby and thorne 1996 based on the hydraulic radius of vegetation and the average velocity of flow through the vegetation patch the flow resistance formula under vegetation was established cheng 2013 cheng et al 2019 and shi et al 2019 derived the formula for the resistance coefficient based on the theory of the energy equation of gradual flow liu et al 2019 proposed an equivalent roughness formula based on the vorticity near the plant stem and calculated the flow resistance by using the equivalent roughness inspired by the hydraulics of channels or pipelines some scholars have used a formula containing re to express the slope flow resistance however due to significant differences in test conditions including slope soil type and vegetation characteristics there is no calculation method currently available for flow resistance applicable to slopes with vegetation cover in fixed bed studies the total resistance ftotal is usually divided into four resistance components hu and abrahams 2006 the total flow resistance ftotal is a linear superposition of grain resistance fgrain form resistance fform wave resistance fwave and rain resistance frain grain resistance caused by the grain roughness of the slope surface is related to re form resistance is created by the obstruction to flow it is the resistance caused by vegetation stems litter and gravel wave resistance comes from the dissipation of runoff energy caused by rolling waves and rain resistance comes from the disturbance of runoff by raindrop splash the characteristics of vegetation are also an element that affects resistance to overland flow the resistance caused by vegetation is closely related to the pliability shape and size of plants when the saint venant equation is used to simulate the hydrological process of overland flow hydraulic roughness is particularly essential for calculating flow velocity water depth and runoff process lawrence 2000 used uniform sediment to simulate the roughness of the slope and demonstrated that the surface roughness ks is closely related to the median particle size of sediment d the relationship between equivalent roughness ks and the roughness element density was studied by wooding et al 1973 through a series of detailed experiments parameters such as d pipe diameter and δ boundary layer thickness were introduced to express equivalent roughness ks by raupach et al 1991 the superposition principle of resistance and equivalent roughness can be effective methods to determine flow resistance under vegetation cover raupach et al 1991 overall water flow is a crucial factor in detachment and transport during soil erosion the study of the hydraulic characteristics including flow resistance and flow pattern of overland flow is helpful in explaining the mechanism of soil erosion caused by overland flow although there have been many studies on the influence of vegetation characteristics on flow resistance further study of the influence of vegetation density on the dynamic characteristics of overland flow is still required many useful experiments have explored the expression of flow resistance under vegetation cover but there is still no unified equation to define it in addition there remains a lack of quantitative research on the mechanisms of formation of flow resistance to overland flow under different surface conditions including vegetation cover density and slope therefore the study of overland flow hydraulic resistance under different vegetation densities is an effective way to reveal the mechanism of soil erosion under the influence of vegetation léonard and richard 2004 the objective of this study was to 1 analyse the influence of vegetation density on the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow 2 calculate the flow resistance using vegetation equivalent roughness and quantify the influence of vegetation density on flow resistance and 3 ascertain the contribution of slope roughness and vegetation cover to total resistance and quantitatively analyse the influence of vegetation density on the components of flow resistance the research results will help to clarify the formation of overland flow resistance and will explain how vegetation reduces the energy carried by water flow and water erosion a quantitative study can provide a basis for the optimal design of vegetation measures on the loess plateau in addition this study can provide 264 groups of experimental data for the establishment of an erosion model which is helpful improving the accuracy of prediction of the soil erosion model 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions and treatments the runoff plot was 4 5 m long 0 3 m wide and 0 1 m deep and was made of spliced plexiglass panels an adjustable height bracket supported the flume with a slope adjustment range of 0 15 water flow discharged into the top of the flume was provided by a water tank placed at the top of the flume fig 1 a plate with a high density of holes was arranged in the water tank to smooth the flow flow discharge was controlled using an adjustable valve installed at the bottom of the water tank a peristaltic pump model yz35 drive zg600x was also used to adjust the flow discharge during the test clusters of artificial grasses with 1 mm thick stem and 20 mm tall were used to simulate the influence of common gramineous plants triticum aestivum l on runoff in the loess plateau in the experiment the size and rigidity of the artificial grass were similar to those of natural plants and the grass was reused there were two test schemes in the experiments bare slope and vegetation cover table 1 the bare slope was the flume bottom composed of glued 40 mesh sandpaper es according to the typical vegetation distribution on the loess plateau the density of vegetation cover sg was approximately 0 58 1 15 1 73 2 3 2 88 3 42 4 03 4 61 5 18 and 5 76 vegetation density was calculated from the total number of stems and stem diameter table 2 grasses were randomly arranged in clusters fig 2 parameters such as the cross sectional area were calculated in the hydrodynamic test a hydrodynamic study was used to calculate the cross sectional area and other parameters of water flow the density of vegetation was used in this study instead of vegetation cover to indicate the number of plants because mature gramineae plants have an umbrella shape they can form a fully vegetated cover with low vegetation density a stem density of 5 76 could form approximately 94 canopy projected cover fig 2f thus the bare ground between the stems could not be seen from above the grasses before the test the slope surface and the grasses were fully wet to reduce fluctuations in water flow caused by differences in dryness across the surface of the slope the slope of the water erosion zone on the loess plateau is generally below 10 and overland flow is the main factor causing water erosion guo et al 2019 therefore a maximum slope of 12 was applied in this study according to the planning and layout principles of slope erosion experimental plots tucker and bras 1998 the slopes of these experiments were set as 4 8 and 12 previous studies have shown that there is a critical rainfall intensity that causes soil erosion in the loess plateau in some areas of china the critical rainfall intensity was defined as 10 25 mm h 1 wei et al 2007 shi and shao 2000 obtained the characteristics for torrential rain in the loess plateau based on the criteria of soil erosion in the loess plateau thus rain intensities of 30 mm h and 120 mm h were selected in the present study moreover eight rates of discharge 5 7 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 40 l min were selected for this experiment based on a consideration of the range of hydrodynamic conditions the surface velocity of flow in each experiment was measured using a dye kmno4 tracer the 2 5 m long test area was divided into three slope sections from top to bottom i e 0 25 1 m 1 1 75 m and 1 75 2 5 m five stopwatch readings were recorded for each section the maximum and minimum values were rejected at each section thus three readings were kept and the surface velocity vs of each slope section was calculated a needle water level gauge model scm40 60 measured the flow depth of each section there were three cross sections perpendicular to the direction of water flow 0 75 m 1 5 m and 2 25 m five water depth measuring points were set at equal intervals for each section flow depth was calculated based on the elevation difference between the slope and the water surface the average flow depth at the measuring points was used as the average flow depth of each section the mean values of the multi section and multi points are closer to the real velocity and water depth of the test section 2 2 hydrodynamic parameter the reynolds number is a dimensionless parameter usually used in hydrodynamics to distinguish whether flow is laminar or turbulent for open channel flow when re 500 flow is laminar when 500 re 5000 flow is transitional when re 5000 flow is turbulent liu et al 2008 concluded that velocity profiles within the vegetation patch for both emergent and submerged flows at the locations in line are a region of lower constant velocity throughout most of the flow depth the velocity then just increases slightly near the free surface so eq 1 uses the average surface velocity instead of the average velocity the re was calculated as follows 1 re ru ν where r is the hydraulic radius m u is the mean flow velocity m s 1 and ν is the kinematic viscosity the froude number reflects how flow velocity and water depth interact and is defined as the ratio of inertia to gravity it is usually used to distinguish whether flow is supercritical or subcritical when fr 1 fr 1 and fr 1 flow is supercritical subcritical or critical flow respectively the froude number fr was calculated as follows 2 fr u gh where g is gravitational acceleration 9 8 m s 2 and h is the mean flow depth m the hydraulic radius is defined as the ratio of the discharge cross sectional area of flow to the wetted perimeter 3 r a p where a is the discharge cross sectional area m2 and p is the wetted perimeter m due to the vegetation cover grass occupied some space in the flume so the discharge section area was calculated as follows 4 a b e h where be is the effective flow width after removing obstacles in the flow path 5 b e b 1 d v where b is the width of the flume m and dv is the density of vegetation which was calculated by dividing the cross sectional area of the grass stem by the area of the test section vegetation density was calculated as follows 6 d v n π r 2 bl where n is the total number of stems r is the stem radius mm and l is the length of the test section m grasses in the flume were randomly distributed so the wetted perimeter was defined as the ratio of the wet area of the trial area to the length of the trial area 7 p 2 h b l n c π d h n l where n is the total number of stems c is the cross sectional area of a single stem and d is the diameter of the stem 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 trend line analysis the linear trend can eliminate the influence of experimental error on the flow resistance of the slope covered by vegetation and it can reflect the comprehensive impact of vegetation density changes on resistance simple linear regression is based on the change in vegetation density of a single phase element to reflect the total resistance this study used linear regression to analyse the trend of the total resistance in the experimental data which was calculated as follows 8 slope n i 1 n i f i i 1 n i i 1 n f i n i 1 n i 2 i 1 n i 2 where slope is the slope of the trend line f i is the total resistance of the group i trial and n is the total number of trial groups when slope 0 the total resistance increased moreover the steeper slope resulted in a larger increase in resistance the r2 was used to assess the proportion of variance explained by the independent variable and was calculated as follows 9 r 2 ssr sst where ssr y i y 2 is the regression sum of squares sst y i y 2 is the residual sum of squares y i is the calculated resistance value of group i trial y is the mean value of the calculated resistance y i and is the fitted value of resistance for group i 2 3 2 spearman s correlation coefficient the spearman correlation coefficient ρ indicates the correlation between x independent variable and y dependent variable and was calculated as follows 10 ρ σ i x i x y i y σ i x i x 2 σ i y i y 2 where xi and yi are variables x and y are averages of variables if x increases and y tends to increase he spearman correlation coefficient is positive if x increases and y tends to decrease the spearman correlation coefficient is negative when x and y approach a complete monotonic correlation the spearman correlation coefficient will increase in absolute value in this study the spearman correlation coefficient was used to indicate the correlation between re and flow resistance 2 3 3 kendall correlation coefficient the kendal correlation coefficient is used to measure the correlation between two random variables 11 τ 4 p n n 1 1 where n is the number of variables and p is the sum of all variables of the number of items ranked after the given item by both rankings the kendal correlation coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 when τ is 1 the two random variables have the same rank correlation when τ is 1 the two random variables have opposite rank correlation when τ is 0 the two random variables are independent of each other in this study the kendall correlation coefficient was used to indicate the correlation between re and flow resistance 2 3 4 nse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is generally used to verify the quality of simulation results and compares the goodness of fit of simulation and measured values the value of the nse ranges from negative infinity to 1 when nse is close to 1 the model outputs accurately reflect experimental data and have high credibility when nse is close to 0 it means that the simulation result is close to the average level of the observed value which means that the overall result is credible but the simulation errors are significant when nse is much less than 0 it means the model is not credible the kendal correlation coefficient was calculated as follows 12 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where p i is the simulation value of sample o i is the measured value of sample is the average value of the sample and n is the number of samples 2 3 5 mad the mean absolute deviation is the average of the absolute values of the deviations of all individual observations from the arithmetic mean the mean absolute deviation can avoid the problem of errors counteracting each other it can accurately reflect the size of the actual prediction error and was calculated as follows 13 mad 1 n i 1 n x i x where x i is the calculated value of trial resistance for group i and x is the mean calculated resistance 3 results 3 1 effects of vegetation density on hydrodynamic parameters vegetation density and slope influenced the distribution range of re fig 3 the distribution of re for a 4 slope ranged from 562 to 1510 to 360 3796 at an 8 slope it ranged from 834 to 1204 to 440 5336 at a 12 slope it ranged from 852 to 1504 to 338 3234 under all slope and vegetation densities laminar flow occurred only at a rate of discharge of 5 l min 1 at a slope of 4 and a 5 76 vegetation density and a rate of discharge of 40 l min 1 flow was turbulent in other conditions flow was transitional the mean values of peak re for the 4 8 and 12 slopes were 1181 1939 and 4122 respectively flow changed from transient to turbulent flow wisps of the dye were observed undulating in a wavy shape the amplitude of the undulation increased with an increase in the rate of discharge indicating that the flow changed from transitional to turbulent vegetation density and slope influenced the distribution range of the froude number fr fig 4 for the 4 slope fr greatly exceeded 1 when vegetation density was in the range 0 58 1 73 and flow was rapid when vegetation density ranged from 2 35 to 4 61 fr changed from 1 23 to 1 01 and the rate of flow declined when the vegetation density was 4 03 and 4 61 and when flow was less than 20 l min 1 fr was almost 1 under this condition flow was considered to be the critical flow when vegetation density was 5 18 and 5 76 fr 1 and flow was slow the distribution of fr for the 8 slope ranged from 2 5 to 3 0 to 0 9 1 3 for the 12 slope it ranged from 2 5 to 2 7 to 0 7 1 8 increased vegetation density resulted in the flow changing from rapid to critical flow and even to slow flow in summary flow was affected by both slope and vegetation density with an increase of slope flow changed from slow to rapid flow in contrast with an increase of vegetation cover flow changed from rapid to slow flow the effects of vegetation density and slope on flow were to restrict each other 3 2 formula of flow resistance based on equivalent roughness converting vegetation properties to a roughness height allowed calculation of flow resistance the roughness height is often identified as a critical factor affecting the resistance to overland flow in nikurade s study of resistance to overland flow a uniform cover of granules was used as roughness elements and the roughness height ks of the uniform granule was demonstrated to be proportional to the median diameter d of the slope sediment this can be used as a useful parameter for calculating resistance to flow vegetation is the main roughness element that produces resistance to overland flow on slopes covered by vegetation many studies have explored the form of the resistance expression as a function of the equivalent roughness height because of the complexity of vegetation morphological characteristics and randomness of distribution the present study used vegetation as a roughness element to study resistance to flow it was assumed that the expression of coefficient of pipe flow resistance is also applicable to the calculation of slope flow resistance in previous studies nicholas proposed that the resistance coefficient is related to re and friction velocity u the resistance coefficient can be expressed as follows 14 λ 8 u 2 u 2 where u is the friction velocity u gri formula 14 has also been shown to be suitable for various shapes of roughness elements including squares and hemispherical in subsequent research to simplify the calculation parameters and improve calculation accuracy hinze proposed an empirical formula for the resistance coefficient suitable for rough regions based on the colebrook white equation darby and thorne 1996 15 λ 2 log 3 7 h k s 2 eqs 14 and 15 are used to calculate the resistance coefficient of rough walls for a constant flow depth the equivalent roughness in eq 15 is the only variable the two simultaneous equations can be solved to obtain the equivalent roughness height of the equivalent roughness element of the vegetated slope 16 k sv 3 7h 10 1 2 u 2 8 g r i according to the method of expressing riverbed roughness proposed by nikuraz ks0 was set as the roughness height of the slope outside the vegetation covered area the equivalent roughness height of vegetation and the roughness of the slope were calculated and superimposed to obtain the equivalent roughness height of the slope covered by vegetation 17 k s k sv 1 d v k s 0 the flow around resistance fd is the sum of the frictional resistance and differential pressure resistance of the fluid passing the surface of the object resistance in the flow direction caused by the obstruction of uniform vegetation stems was defined as 18 f d λ ρ hd u 2 2 where λ is the resistance coefficient ρ is water density kg m 3 and d is the diameter of the roughness element m by replacing the roughness element diameter with the equivalent roughness height of the slope in the equation an expression of the flow resistance of a vegetation covered slope can be obtained 19 f total λ ρ u 2 h k s 2 substituting eqs 16 and 17 into eq 19 the equation for the calculation of slope flow resistance based on equivalent roughness and related to vegetation density was obtained 20 f total 1 2 λ ρ u 2 h 3 7 h 10 1 2 u 2 p 8 g i b 1 d v 1 d v k s 0 according to the principle of resistance segmentation the form resistance caused by vegetation is the difference between total resistance and particle resistance 21 f form f total f grain the equivalent roughness height under test conditions was calculated from eqs 16 and 17 fig 5 substituting the calculated equivalent roughness into formula 20 allowed calculation of resistance values under different vegetation densities fig 6 flow resistance increased with increased vegetation density and resistance increased when vegetation density exceeded 3 42 vegetation density had a significant effect on the change in flow resistance fig 7 across the range 0 58 2 88 of vegetation density resistance increased from 0 to 2 48 only for the 4 slope the maximum resistance was 4 7 for a vegetation density of 3 42 5 76 when flow was less than 15 l min 1 resistance was always less than 2 when the rate of discharge exceeded 15 l min 1 resistance ranged between 15 and 29 9 42 3 and 6 13 under 4 8 and 12 slopes respectively analysis of the resistance trend line table 3 demonstrated that for 0 58 2 88 vegetation density the slope of the regression was positive and the change in slope was only 0 1783 resistance increased slowly and changes in vegetation density influenced the resistance for 3 42 5 76 vegetation density the regression slope was positive for all slopes and the slope increased by 0 5363 1 3907 and 0 0752 at 4 8 and 12 of slope respectively flow resistance was significantly affected by vegetation density 3 3 effect of vegetation density on re ftotal relationships the trend of the re ftotal relationship was affected by vegetation density fig 8 for vegetation densities between 0 58 and 3 42 flow resistance was always less than 5 the re was always less than 2000 and several re was less than 500 thus flow was laminar although several re exceeded 500 the value was small and flow was closer to laminar flow for 4 03 5 76 vegetation density resistance increased significantly with increased re and the increase became more apparent with increased density while the increase in vegetation density enhanced flow turbulence and the increased re for each slope was 1530 2503 and 1560 respectively due to the increase in vegetation density flow circuity increased and the contact area with vegetation increased leading to an increased resistance 3 4 effect of vegetation density on fr f relationships relationships between flow resistance and fr showed different trends as vegetation density changed fig 9 for 0 58 1 73 vegetation density the value of flow resistance was almost unaffected by the variation in fr for 2 3 4 61 vegetation density taking the 8 slope and 40 l min discharge as an example fr ranged from 1 51 to 1 01 and the resistance increment ranged from 2 47 to 12 8 as the rate of flow changed to slow flow resistance increased for 5 18 5 76 vegetation density fr was maintained at approximately 0 7 1 0 and 1 6 at slopes of 4 8 and 12 respectively flow resistance ranged from approximately 0 3 to 29 42 and 12 respectively all of which were the maximum resistances 3 5 effect of vegetation density on the composition of flow resistance 3 5 1 grain resistance the resistance caused by water flowing over bare sandpaper is the grain resistance when this roughness was constant the grain resistance increased with an increase in discharge flow fig 10 a the resistance ranged between 0 004 and 0 066 and the variation of each slope was minimal however with the addition of vegetation cover the contribution of grain resistance to total resistance was affected by changes in vegetation density fig 11 when vegetation density was 2 3 4 03 or 5 76 the minimum proportion of grain resistance to total resistance was 2 18 0 59 and 0 13 respectively and the maximum proportions were 9 47 5 70 and 2 16 respectively 3 5 2 form resistance detracting grain resistance caused by slope roughness from the total resistance yields the form resistance caused by the action of vegetation for 0 58 2 88 vegetation densities the maximum form resistances at 4 8 and 12 of slope were only 4 7 3 48 and 3 2 respectively for larger vegetation densities 3 42 5 76 resistances at 4 8 and 12 slopes were within 29 85 42 25 and 12 99 respectively considerably larger than those with low vegetation densities the contribution of form resistance to total resistance under different vegetation densities differed with increased vegetation density the median of the percentage of form resistance of total resistance p for all slopes increased from 95 to 99 for a 4 slope larger the vegetation densities resulted in a more restricted distribution of p values the less of resistance composition is affected by slope flow discharge and other factors fig 11a for 8 and 12 slopes when the density of vegetation ranged between 1 73 and 2 88 the distribution of p values was larger than that of the other densities fig 11b c for steep slopes the compositional proportions of resistance were strongly influenced by factors such as slope and flow rate for the 4 and 12 slopes when vegetation density was 1 73 the mean proportion of form resistance was 96 59 and 94 62 respectively for the 8 slope when vegetation density was 2 3 mean p was 95 77 and the minimum values within the 1 5 iqr were all smaller than larger or smaller densities fig 11a b c in summary for 1 73 2 3 vegetation density the form resistance caused by vegetation was much larger than the grain resistance however the contribution of form resistance to total resistance decreased and the proportion of grain resistance increased 4 discussion the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of changes in vegetation cover on mechanisms of soil erosion in the loess plateau of china through analyses of flume experiments we quantitatively examined the effects of ten vegetation densities on hydraulic parameters and flow resistance to overland flow as a function of slope variation in vegetation density caused re and fr to change compared to those under bare slopes and these parameters were affected by both vegetation density and slope changes in vegetation density caused changes in the proportional composition of overland flow resistance 4 1 effects of vegetation density on hydrodynamic parameters 4 1 1 reynolds number reynolds number tended to increase with an increase in rate of discharge flow and vegetation density although flow did not become turbulent under most conditions as the vegetation density increased flow changed from transitional to turbulent flow these results were similar to those of meng 2019 and zhao et al 2015 moreover pan and shangguan 2006 and wu et al 2011 found that re on a moveable bed decreased as vegetation cover increased although it appears that the test results differ from the results of previous studies they are in fact the same under moveable bed conditions vegetation roots can increase infiltration and reduce runoff thereby reducing erosion however under fixed bed conditions water flows through the spaces between plants the higher the vegetation density the smaller the effective width of the cross section and the more intense the disturbance to water flow caused by the vegetation from the definition of re r is an important parameter in the calculation of re and they are positively correlated in the absence of vegetation open channel the calculation of r is unaffected by vegetation however eqs 1 3 7 demonstrate that vegetation density is an important factor affecting r therefore an increase in vegetation density leads to an increase in re and water flows change from transitional to turbulent the waves and eddies formed by the turbulence dissipates much of the energy carried by the flow thereby reducing its ability to remove soil particles and carry sediment thus it can be concluded that increasing vegetation density reduces soil erosion 4 1 2 froude number as vegetation density increased fr tended to decrease and flow rate declined from rapid to slow flow similar results were obtained in a fixed bed test mu et al 2019a zhao et al 2015 found that fr was approximately 50 lower on forest covered slopes than bare slopes in addition under the moveable bed of grass cover and simulated rainfall pan and shangguan 2006 wu et al 2011 fr decreased with increased vegetation cover which indicates that the stems of vegetation could weaken the flow s power and the ability of overland flow to carry sand however the fr in the present study was larger than that of pan and shangguan 2006 this may have resulted from the denser vegetation more concentrated water flow and higher flow velocity through the vegetation in this experiment compared to that of pan and shangguan 2006 however the test results demonstrated that as the slope increased fr increased and the flow changed from slow to rapid flows zhao et al 2019 concluded that the flow runoff is related to changes in slope in a study by pan et al 2016 through a flume test under vegetation cover fr increased with increased slope helmers and eisenhauer 2006 also found that on steep slopes covered by vegetation overland flow often occurs in rapids zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that the flow changed from slow to rapid flow with increased slope and flow changed from rapid to slow flow with increased vegetation cover vegetation density and slope restrict each other s influence on the rate of flow consistent with the results of the present study this indicates that under steep slopes flow tends to be more rapid but increased vegetation density can effectively reverse this trend therefore vegetation cover can substantially inhibit soil erosion and the transport of sediment thereby reducing the occurrence of soil erosion 4 2 resistance calculation under vegetation cover the principle of linear superposition of resistance has been widely used in the study of overland flow resistance hu and abrahams 2006 derived an equation for the calculation of resistance using dimensional analysis and regression analysis on slopes covered with vegetation different forms of resistance elements on the slope surface exert a significant influence on simulation results the test results show that the resistance segmentation calculation model is in best agreement with measured values hu s resistance segmentation model was used as the standard value to analyses the nse and the mad between eq 20 and the results of the resistance segmentation model under different vegetation densities to verify the results of eq 20 in this study the nse was 0 58 and the data were evenly distributed around the 1 1 line fig 12 the pearson correlation coefficient of the two data sets was 0 8195 r2 0 67 and the mad value was 2 64 representing only 6 25 of the resistance value these results show that vegetation density is an essential factor in determining resistance to flow because vegetation density is an essential factor affecting overland flow resistance eq 20 based on the equivalent roughness of vegetation is deemed to be reasonable the results of the current study demonstrated that resistance and re always have a power function relationship consistent with the conclusion of gilley and finkner 1991 and pan and shangguan 2006 in all test groups the resistance ftotal increased with re this result differs from the conclusion of the bare slope test in the experiment with only particle friction ftotal decreased significantly with increased re in contrast in the flume test with vegetation cover zhao et al 2015 examined the influence of vegetation on the mechanics of slope water flow and the ftotal of the four groups of tests all decreased with an increase in re zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that when vegetation cover was small the vegetation resistance coefficient decreased with the increase in re and when vegetation cover was large the flow resistance coefficient gradually increased with the increase in re omidvar et al 2019 believed that on a rough bed ftotal and re do not indicate a consistent or monotonic relationship by comparing their experimental conditions it can be demonstrated that vegetation density and surface roughness are essential factors affecting the relationship between ftotal and re this inconsistency is caused by the different shapes and densities of the rough elements moreover the resistance of these rough elements increases with increased discharge flow the results of mu et al 2019b support our conclusion in summary re can be used as a predictive factor of flow resistance on slopes having vegetation cover the relationship between resistance and re can establish a bridge between the study of flow dynamics and soil erosion on the loess plateau resistance did not exhibit a no good functional relationship with fr but vegetation density exerted a significant influence on the ftotal fr relationship at fr 1 when vegetation density was about 4 61 to 5 18 resistance increased sharply reflecting the interaction of velocity with water depth defined as the ratio of inertia to gravity flow resistance is also influenced by gravity and inertial forces therefore it can be assumed that the sum of the effects of inertia and gravity on overland flow will be maximal under different slopes and vegetation densities therefore resistance to water flow will reach a maximum when vegetation density was about 4 61 to 5 18 furthermore it can be assumed that the increased resistance is due to the additional drag provided by the rolling wave of overland flow the occurrence of the rolling wave is related to slope flow and vegetation obstruction previous studies have also demonstrated that rolling waves usually occur in overland flow and this is related to wave resistance and can affect flow resistance wang et al 2019 pan et al 2016 proposed that when fr 0 6 rolling waves become the main component of f thus rolling waves and flow patterns have an essential influence on the formation of resistance to flow therefore the rolling wave of slope runoff is an essential factor affecting soil erosion on loess slopes however there are limited data on the effects of flow pattern and rolling waves on flow resistance it is necessary to carry out further overland flow and runoff experiments correlation analysis between the re of each slope and the flow resistance value was undertaken table 4 for the 4 8 and 12 slopes spearman correlation coefficients were 0 872 0 910 and 0 936 respectively and the kendall correlation coefficients were 0 727 0 750 and 0 795 respectively the increase in slope leads to increased correlation between re and flow resistance and the influence of vegetation density on the relationship was reduced this shows that steep slopes are more suitable for use of re as the parameter calculating flow resistance compared gentle slopes in summary flow resistance under vegetation cover has a power function relationship with re but re is not a consistent and exclusive factor affecting flow resistance on slopes with vegetation cover flow resistance ftotal should be a function under the comprehensive influence of multiple factors including re vegetation density and slope the correlations between fr and flow resistance were analysed table 4 for the 4 8 and 12 slopes spearman correlation coefficients were 0 771 0 471 and 0 420 and the kendall correlation coefficients were 0 594 0 335 and 0 335 respectively for a gentle slope 4 the correlation between fr and flow resistance was moderate and the correlation weakened as slope increased 8 12 therefore fr is not the best parameter to represent resistance to overland flow 4 3 effects of vegetation density on the composition of flow resistance following the principle of superposition of resistance grain resistance was subtracted from the total resistance to calculate the form resistance caused by vegetation fig 13 for overland flow influenced by vegetation part of the total flow resistance arises from vegetation and the rest arises from the slope surface the results of cao et al 2015 and wang et al 2014 also show that grasslands significantly increase the resistance to surface runoff compared to grain surfaces they also emphasised the importance of surface vegetation for total resistance when re 1000 they studied grass and bushes in a walnut orchard in southern arizona and found that grain resistance contributed less than 10 of the total resistance pan et al 2016 found that when re 10000 on slopes with high vegetation cover 90 of the flow resistance was caused by the hindrance imposed by plant stems in this study flow resistance was calculated by the roughness height under our experimental conditions the roughness height calculated by the minimum vegetation density was much larger than the slope roughness height as a result form resistance of vegetation accounted for a large proportion of total resistance when the vegetation density was between 1 73 and 2 3 the contribution of form resistance to total resistance decreased the proportion of grain resistance will increase accordingly with increased grain resistance soil erosion and sediment transportation are more likely to occur 4 4 future research prospects vegetation cover of slopes produced larger resistance to flow than bare slopes while flow resistance sharply increased which can reduce the energy carried by water flow and reduce soil erosion and water and soil loss the decrease in flow velocity is the direct manifestation of the increase in flow resistance slow water flows not only increase infiltration and reduce peak flows but also prolong the retention time of nitrogen in vegetated areas china has been facilitating the return of farmland to forest and grassland in the loess plateau for two decades and vegetation cover of the loess plateau has been dramatically improved with concomitant declines in soil erosion a result in accordance with the results of the present study the continuous growth of cultivated herbaceous plants and roots plus an accumulation of litter will change the underlying surface conditions and soil properties the root system can consolidate soil and improve infiltration capacity the shear strength and cohesion index of soil under vegetation should be considered as the next topic of research in arid or semi arid climates due to the cumulative effect of slope runoff the downslope often experiences a larger flow discharge or re than the upslope zhao et al 2019 the influence of vegetation cover on runoff and sediment transport on downslopes may be more significant than that on the upslope therefore landscape heterogeneity of grasslands due to the succession of vegetation communities will change the hydrodynamic characteristics of overland flow and this also requires intensive research 5 conclusions experiments on the effects of varying wheatgrass patch densities on overland flow were conducted in this study equivalent roughness was used to calculate vegetation resistance the effects of vegetation density on hydrodynamic parameters components and variations in flow resistance were examined the following conclusions were derived plant stems exert a significant effect on the hydraulic parameters of overland flow the ranges of re and fr were affected by slope and vegetation density with increased vegetation density the flow changed from transitional flow to turbulent flow with increased slope flow changed from slow flow to rapid flow in contrast increased vegetation density resulted in flow changing from rapid to slow flow overland flow carries less energy when flow is slow and it is difficult to trigger soil erosion and sediment transport thereby mitigating soil erosion in these tests resistance increased with increasing vegetation density when vegetation density was 4 03 5 76 the increase of flow resistance was the largest vegetation density affected the relationship between flow resistance and re with the change in vegetation density the relationship between flow resistance and fr showed a different trend when vegetation density was about 4 61 5 18 resistance to flow increased significantly and this was caused by the wave resistance from rolling waves re can be used as a predictor of the resistance to overland flow under vegetation cover on a fixed bed slope covered by vegetation under non rainfall conditions the contribution of form resistance to total resistance is much greater than that of grain resistance the contribution of form resistance to total resistance under different vegetation densities was significantly different when vegetation density was between 1 73 and 2 3 the contribution of grain resistance increased thereby increasing soil erosion as vegetation density increased the median value of the proportion of form resistance in total resistance increased from 95 to 99 higher density vegetation can dissipate the energy carried by water flow and reduce soil erosion therefore vegetation plantation can largely reduces the soil erosion on the slopes this hints that revegetation will greatly decrease the potential of soil erosion even if the shielding effect of vegetation canopy under heavy rain is not considered this finding matches the sharp drop in the sediment yield generated from the loess plateau of china due to the vegetation restoration in recent years funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no

5118,increasingly available high frequency data during storm events when hydrological dynamics most likely activate nitrate storage flux exchanges reveal insights into catchment nitrate dynamics in this study we explored impacts of seasonality and landscape gradients on nitrate concentration discharge c q hysteresis patterns in the selke catchment central germany which has heterogeneous combinations of meteorological hydrogeological and land use conditions three nested gauging stations established along the main selke river captured flow and nitrate export dynamics from the uppermost subcatchment mixed forest and arable land middle subcatchment pure steep forest and lowermost subcatchment arable and urban land we collected continuous high frequency 15 min discharge and nitrate concentration data from 2012 to 2017 and analyzed the 223 events detected at all three stations a dominant hysteresis pattern in the uppermost and middle subcatchments was counter clockwise and combined with an accretion effect indicating many proximal and mobilized distal nitrate sources however 66 of all events at the catchment outlet experienced a dilution effect possibly due to mechanisms that vary seasonally during wetting wet periods october march it was combined mainly with a counter clockwise pattern due to the dominance of event runoff volume from the uppermost and middle subcatchments during drying dry periods april september however it was combined mainly with a clockwise pattern due to occasional quick surface flows from lowland near stream urban areas in addition the clockwise hysteresis occurred mainly from may october during mostly drying dry periods at all three sites indicating little distal nitrate transport in response to the low terrestrial hydrological connectivity especially in the lowermost dry and flat subcatchment this comprehensive analysis i e clockwise vs counter clockwise accretion vs dilution enables in depth analysis of nitrate export mechanisms during certain periods under different landscape conditions specific combination of c q relationships could identify target locations for agricultural management actions that decrease nitrate output therefore we strongly encourage long term multisite and high frequency monitoring strategies in heterogeneous nested catchment s which can help understand process mechanisms generate data for physical based water quality modeling and provide guidance for water and agricultural management keywords nitrate export dynamic c q relationship hysteresis pattern high frequency data landscape effect seasonality effect 1 introduction human activities e g intensive agriculture urbanization deforestation have altered the natural landscape extensively and hence influenced nitrogen n cycling greatly boyer et al 2002 howarth et al 2012 the large external supplies of n clearly exceed terrestrial n demands for plant crop growth and microbial transformation davidson et al 2011 driven by hydrological dynamics the excess terrestrial n has been exported to surface waters and redistributed spatially and temporally throughout fresh coastal water systems reusch et al 2018 shields et al 2008 mitigation measures have been established according to guidelines of multiple government conventions e g the european union water framework directive although diffuse nitrate pollution has been ameliorated it remains a main cause of freshwater quality degradation eea 2018 pursuing more cost effective measures requires better mechanistic understanding of catchment nitrate dynamics especially in the context of contrasting landscape conditions both natural and human and strong seasonal variability flow and nitrate dynamics during storm events are more active due to changes in storage flux interactions and transport pathways compared to those during hydrologically stable conditions e g low flow dry periods therefore the event scale relationship between nitrate concentration and discharge c q relationship has been investigated intensively to determine spatial and temporal variability in catchment nitrate functioning baker and showers 2019 dupas et al 2016 zimmer et al 2019 hysteresis is the most commonly observed pattern of the c q relationship burns et al 2019 hysteresis patterns vary spatially and temporally due to variable combinations of nitrate sources bowes et al 2015 and hydrological drivers vaughan et al 2017 celerity is well known to be faster than particle transport velocity in catchment hydrology cheraghi et al 2016 mcdonnell and beven 2014 williams et al 2018 therefore proximal nitrate storages generally respond faster than distal storages along the formation of hydrograph at the catchment scale resulting in different hysteresis loops of the c q relationship i e clockwise vs counter clockwise meanwhile nitrate storage varies vertically along the soil profile and horizontally under different landscape characteristics and anthropogenic conditions dupas et al 2016 musolff et al 2016 miller et al 2017 driven by flow generations the mobilized terrestrial nitrate may further result in negative or positive hysteresis slopes for stream water representing dilution or accretion effects respectively in turn hysteresis analysis based on comprehensive monitoring data permits detailed explorations of the varying flow and nitrate dynamics continuous high frequency data under various hydro climatic conditions offers the opportunity to evaluate the changes of runoff partitioning and biogeochemical processes as well as their impacts on nitrate mobilizations at multiple spatial scales e g for the catchment wide scale and the local near stream scale carey et al 2014 vaughan et al 2017 intensive monitoring across contrasting landscape characteristics further enables detailed analysis of the interplay between heterogeneous landscape features and varying flow pathways fovet et al 2018 musolff et al 2015 williams et al 2018 landscape characteristics reflect regional climate patterns general pedological and geological properties and human impacts therefore the spatial heterogeneity of landscape characteristics determines the spatial distribution of nitrate source areas and variable catchment mechanisms of hydrology and nutrient transport dupas et al 2017 poor and mcdonnell 2007 the long history of commercial fertilizer application has increased agricultural production but has also accumulated excess n in terrestrial soils outram et al 2016 n sources from agricultural lands have become one of the main pollution sources in most rivers and caused high risks to aquatic ecosystems eea 2019 in forest areas nitrate leaching likely depends on the amount of nitrate in throughfall and the c n ratio of the organic soil horizon borken and matzner 2004 macdonald et al 2002 therefore a synchronous dynamic pattern between discharge and nitrate concentration is commonly observed in forest catchments artificial n is added mainly via atmospheric wet and dry deposition e g ranging from 1 to 60 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which has also been increased greatly in the past few decades macdonald et al 2002 in urban areas extensive paved areas and artificial drainage networks can strongly alter natural processes of water movement and nitrate transport miller et al 2014 for example artificially drained flow easily bypasses the nitrate rich soil and responds quickly even under small precipitation events therefore the process of n export can be misunderstood if the heterogeneity of catchment landscape characteristics is not considered especially in nonuniform and nested catchments driven by seasonal variations in meteorological and hydrological conditions terrestrial export of nitrate always accompanies the changes of runoff components and therefore the surface nitrate c q relationship shows strong seasonality sickman et al 2003 different runoff components i e surface flow interflow and baseflow usually have different nitrate concentrations due to their differing degrees of interactions with soil n sources miller et al 2017 therefore the seasonally varying characteristic of runoff partitioning can alter the c q relationship of specific events considerably recent researches about c q relationship most focus on humid areas jacobs et al 2018 vaughan et al 2017 zimmer et al 2019 where interflow plays an important role in transporting nitrate sources during events studies of process based understanding of temporal nitrate dynamics in dry area are still rare dupas et al 2016 for example interflow and baseflow are considered the dominant runoff components during wet and dry periods respectively in the well monitored selke catchment in central germany yang et al 2018 however quick surface flow from paved area and artificial drainage both with relatively low nitrate concentrations can also occur intermittently in the lowland arable urban area during small events and cause different c q relationships at the outlet the interplay among different runoff components and their effects on nitrate dynamics in dry area are hence in need of improved understanding moreover seasonal biogeochemical processes can also influence the nitrate legacy at the catchment scale in western europe winter spring high flow periods experience high soil moisture which activates hydrological connections between terrestrial and aquatic systems molenat et al 2008 strohmenger et al 2020 and relatively low temperatures which do not stimulate much biogeochemical turnover allen et al 2002 in contrast summer autumn high temperature growing seasons cause high soil evaporation and plant crop transpiration which result in low soil moisture that restricts hydrological connections bracken and croke 2007 and stimulates biogeochemical transformations of n in terrestrial and in stream phases racchetti et al 2011 rode et al 2016a hence these seasonal hydrological and biogeochemical processes can characterize the variation in the c q relationship overall the mechanistic interactions between flow and nitrate dynamics at the event scale vary spatially and temporally comprehensive monitoring datasets for highly heterogeneous catchments are rare but they are essential to reveal effects of landscape heterogeneity and seasonality on c q relationships in this study we focused on the well monitored selke catchment a subcatchment of the terrestrial environmental observatories tereno harz central german lowland observatory wollschläger et al 2016 zacharias et al 2011 three nested gauging stations along the main selke river capture the variety of catchment responses of flow and nitrate processes jiang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 high frequency multi parameter sensors have been continuously deployed at each station ranging from upper forest area to lowland agricultural area rode et al 2016a here we collected discharge and nitrate n concentration data that were continuously monitored during 2012 2017 at a 15 min interval the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify event scale c q relationships among heterogeneous conditions in the nested selke catchment 2 analyze impacts of deviating hydrological and landscape characteristics on hysteresis patterns based on subcatchments discrepancies and 3 investigate seasonal variability of hysteresis patterns given the contrasting wet dry conditions with this study we show how nitrate fluxes are generated in heterogeneous subcatchments and how the interplay of these subcatchments can modulate c q relationships at varying seasonal conditions and event magnitudes at the whole catchment scale 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the selke catchment 456 km2 is located in the transition area between the northern german plain and central german uplands the elevation ranges from ca 590 m in the upper harz mountain region to ca 100 m in the lowland region fig 1 a with mean annual precipitation decreasing from 790 to 450 mm respectively yang et al 2019 three gauging stations set up from upstream to downstream i e silberhuette silb meisdorf meis and hausneindorf haus fig 1a capture responses of the heterogeneous catchments rode et al 2016a the drainage areas of the three stations are 99 184 and 456 km2 respectively the uppermost and middle subcatchments lie in the harz mountainous region which is dominated by shallow and relatively impervious schist and claystone overlain mainly by cambisols in contrast the lowermost subcatchment lies in the unique central german loess chernozem region which has deep tertiary sedimentary rocks therefore the catchment has high gradients of landscape characteristics including meteorology hydrology biogeochemistry and anthropogenic impacts yang et al 2019 the uppermost subcatchment is covered by well mixed forest 60 and agricultural 25 areas while most 85 of the middle subcatchment is covered by pure steep forest fig 1b due to the high fertility of chernozems the lowermost subcatchment is extensively and intensively cultivated as arable land ca 80 and contains considerable urban areas both discharge and nitrate n no 3 n concentration are continuously measured at the three gauging stations we collected high frequency 15 min interval data from 2012 to 2017 for the event scale analysis discharge data were provided by the state agency for flood protection and water management of saxony anhalt lhw no 3 n data were provided by the helmholtz center for environmental research ufz using a trios props uv sensor with an optical path length of 10 mm the sensor data were validated by biweekly parallel grab samples for more information about the high frequency monitoring and maintenance please refer to rode et al 2016b in addition long term daily discharge and biweekly grab sampled no 3 n data 1994 2011 from lhw were also collected for a long term overview of flow and no 3 n concentration dynamics 2 2 variability in event scale nitrate dynamics 2 2 1 detecting storm events storm events were detected first based on automatic identification of all local maxima and minima of the discharge time series each local maximum was considered to be the discharge peak of each event and the closest minima before and after the peak were selected as the preliminary start and end time of the event respectively next the final start and end times of each event were manually adjusted to ensure that they had a similar discharge successive events without a complete recession between them were merged into a single event with multiple peaks events with missing data 10 were excluded from further analysis events were detected using scripts in r software r core team 2020 2 2 2 calculation of hysteresis patterns for each event discharge and no 3 n were normalized following lloyd et al 2016a 1 q t n o r m q t q min q max q min 2 n t n o r m n t n min n max n min where q t and n t are the discharge m3 s 1 and no 3 n mg l 1 concentration measured at time t q t n o r m and n t n o r m are the normalized discharge and no 3 n concentration and the subscripts min and max are the minimum and maximum values of each event to quantify the hysteresis pattern of the c q relationship two indices were calculated from the normalized data first the non dimensional hysteresis index hi was calculated as 3 hi n t n o r m d q t n o r m where hi equals the sum of hysteresis effects of the c q relationship during each event period zhang et al 2017 hi ranges from 1 to 1 hi 0 indicates clockwise hysteresis while hi 0 indicates counter clockwise hysteresis second the concentration changed index ci following butturini et al 2008 was calculated as 4 ci n tp n o r m n ts n o r m where n tp n o r m and n ts n o r m are the normalized no 3 n concentration at the discharge peak and start time of each event respectively ci ranges from 1 to 1 ci 0 indicates an accretion effect of no 3 n concentration following flow dynamics while ci 0 indicates a dilution effect note that if the peak discharge lasted for more than one measured time point the first time point no 3 n concentration was chosen as n tp n o r m 2 2 3 shared event analysis and statistic methods several shared events were specifically analyzed based on the start end and discharge peak time points of each event at the silb meis and haus stations these events propagated from upstream to downstream and were detected simultaneously at all three stations then the start and end times of each shared event were adjusted slightly to encompass the entire event duration at all three stations i e using the latest start time and the earliest end time nitrate n load n l unit kg and runoff volume r v unit m3 of each shared event at each station were calculated using the following two equations respectively 5 n l q t n t d t 6 r v q t d t where q t and n t are the measured discharge m3 s 1 and no 3 n concentration mg l 1 respectively during the shared period using values of n l and r v from the three nested stations nitrate n load and runoff volume were calculated for the uppermost subcatchment subscript up as the values measured at the silb station for the middle subcatchment subscript mid as the values measured at the meis station minus those at the silb station and for the lowermost subcatchment subscript low as the values measured at the haus station minus those at the meis station in addition nitrate n load and runoff volume of the entire catchment subscript all were considered as the values measured at the haus station the nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test and kruskal wallis test were used to detect significant differences in population medians of paired or multiple categories respectively

term dynamics in the long term data 1994 2017 runoff volume increased disproportionately from upstream to downstream stations for example although the uppermost subcatchment covered only 22 of the catchment it contributed 64 of its total mean annual runoff volume i e 3 31 107 and 5 15 107 m3 yr 1 at the silb and haus stations respectively the spatial contribution of mean annual no 3 n load generally followed that of flow volume e g 68 t yr 1 at the silb station was 43 of the total at the haus station differences in runoff volume and no 3 n load among subcatchments were due to spatial variability in no 3 n concentrations from the silb station to the haus station median no 3 n concentration increased significantly from 1 01 to 2 68 mg l 1 wilcoxon signed rank test while median specific runoff decreased significantly from 169 to 67 mm yr 1 wilcoxon signed rank test despite the high spatial variability discharge and no 3 n concentration showed strong seasonal patterns fig 2 based on the general hydro climatic cycling fig 2a we categorized the hydrological year into four periods wetting october december with a continuous increase in mean monthly discharge from 0 90 to 1 80 m3 s 1 at the haus station wet january march with high mean discharge of 2 96 m3 s 1 drying april june with mean monthly discharge decreasing from 2 42 to 0 99 m3 s 1 and dry july september with consistently low mean discharge of 0 58 m3 s 1 the spatial distribution of flow varied greatly among the hydrological periods the uppermost subcatchment generated most of the catchment s runoff volume during the wet period but much less during the dry period e g mean discharge in february and september was 70 and 53 that at haus respectively fig 2a the seasonal pattern of no 3 n was similar to that of discharge at the silb and meis stations with high concentrations e g 3 mg l 1 during the wet period that gradually decreased during the drying period and much lower concentrations e g 1 mg l 1 during the dry period fig 2b however no 3 n at the haus station had consistently high concentrations throughout the hydrological cycle i e generally 2 mg l 1 mean no 3 n concentration during the dry period was significantly higher at haus 2 60 mg l 1 than at silb 0 58 mg l 1 the high mean concentrations at haus much higher than those at meis and silb were likely caused by urban point source contributions before 2002 yang et al 2018 nonetheless the mean monthly concentration decreased slightly from the beginning of the drying period but remained much higher than those at meis and silb 3 2 event detection we analyzed 81 72 and 70 detected events at the silb meis and haus stations respectively from 2012 to 2017 fig 3 supplementary table s1 events were evenly distributed while their magnitude and duration varied greatly during the four hydrological periods among the three stations table 1 event durations were generally much longer during wetting wet periods than during drying dry periods e g mean durations at the silb station were 11 79 and 4 07 days during the wet and dry periods respectively similarly event scale mean discharge and no 3 n had the highest values during the wet period and the lowest values during the dry period at the three stations table 1 3 3 hysteresis pattern analysis the patterns of hi and ci showed both spatial and seasonal variations negative hi i e counter clockwise hysteresis dominated at the silb meis and haus stations i e ca 78 88 and 63 of all events respectively fig 4 a most events with positive hi i e clockwise hysteresis occurred during drying dry periods 78 67 and 88 at the silb meis and haus stations respectively the median hi was significantly different among four hydrological periods at each station kruskal wallis test the trend for ci differed from that of hi positive ci i e accretion effect dominated in the uppermost and middle subcatchments i e 89 and 79 of all events at the silb and meis stations respectively fig 4b however 66 of events at the haus station had negative ci i e dilution effect the median ci between silb and haus and between meis and haus were significantly different wilcoxon signed rank test mean ci was positive during all four hydrological periods at the silb and meis stations but was positive only during the wet period at the haus station fig 4b we combined the two hysteresis indices and categorized all events into four categories fig 5 event scale hysteresis patterns varied greatly among the hydrological periods and landscape conditions fig 6 at the silb station the general hysteresis pattern was negative hi combined with positive ci ca 72 fig 6 the events in this category had the longest duration and highest total precipitation table 2 the pattern of positive hi combined with positive ci accounted for 17 of events at silb most of which occurred during drying dry periods among events with negative ci those combined with negative hi occurred during wetting wet periods fig 6 in contrast events with positive hi occurred during drying dry periods and had the shortest duration lowest total precipitation and lowest discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 at the meis station the general hysteresis pattern was the same as at the silb station i e 71 of events had negative hi with positive ci but the percentage of positive hi with positive ci decreased to 8 indicating an overall lower accretion effect table 2 patterns of negative hi with negative ci increased to 17 of events at meis with a relatively short duration and low discharge table 2 the pattern of positive hi with negative ci was least common and was evenly distributed among the wetting drying and dry periods fig 6 similarly this pattern had the shortest duration and lowest total precipitation discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 the hysteresis pattern at the haus station differed strongly from those at the two upstream stations fig 6 the percentage of events with negative hi combined with positive ci which dominated at upstream stations decreased to only 27 at haus and had the longest duration highest total precipitation and highest discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 the general pattern was negative hi with negative ci which accounted for ca 36 of all events the pattern of positive hi with negative ci increased from 5 at the upper two stations to 30 at the haus station the pattern of positive hi with positive ci occurred only during drying dry periods fig 6 notably regardless of ci patterns with positive hi usually occurred during drying dry periods ca 88 with a short duration and low discharge and no 3 n concentration while patterns with negative hi occurred more during wetting wet periods ca 73 with a long duration and high discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 3 4 shared events analysis to investigate the influence of the landscape on seasonal flow and nitrate dynamics we analyzed 24 catchment wide shared events most shared events had negative hi at the silb and meis stations with only one event with positive hi at the meis station supplementary table s2 three shared events had positive hi during the dry period at the haus station with a high contribution of no 3 n load from the lowermost subcatchment table s2 the number of shared events with negative ci increased from upstream to downstream i e 2 3 and 12 at the silb meis and haus stations respectively table s2 runoff volume r v and nitrate n load n l contributions from each subcatchment had strong seasonal variations at the event scale fig 7 during wetting wet periods r v u p r v a l l was significantly higher than r v m i d r v a l l and r v l o w r v a l l kruskal wallis test r v m i d r v a l l and r v l o w r v a l l varied during the wetting period but the former ratio increased and the latter one decreased during the wet period during the drying period r v u p r v a l l decreased quickly to a proportion similar to r v m i d r v a l l while r v l o w r v a l l increased but remained lower than r v u p r v a l l and r v m i d r v a l l during the dry period contributions from the three subcatchments varied within a similar range with slightly higher r v u p r v a l l than r v m i d r v a l l and r v l o w r v a l l nitrate n load contributions had a different seasonal pattern from runoff volume contributions fig 7b during wetting wet periods nitrate n load contributions from the three subcatchments generally followed runoff volume contributions i e that from the uppermost subcatchment was significantly higher than that form the middle and lowermost subcatchments kruskal wallis test likewise n l m i d n l a l l and n l l o w n l a l l varied with the former ratio increasing and the latter one decreasing during the drying period however n l m i d n l a l l increased quickly and ultimately exceeded n l u p n l a l l while both n l u p n l a l l and n l m i d n l a l l decreased to a similar low proportion during the dry period n l l o w n l a l l decreased thus the subcatchment that contributed the most nitrate n load varied among the four hydrological periods 4 discussion terrestrial nitrate transport at the catchment scale is strongly related to flow dynamics in the selke catchment the land to stream transport has been identified as a key driven factor for surface water dynamics dupas et al 2017 due to the complex combination of meteorological hydrological geographical and pedological characteristics of each subcatchment nitrate dynamics varied from upstream to downstream in the nested selke catchment based on the hysteresis indices four hysteresis patterns can be conceptualized fig 8 the driving factors of their occurrences in the selke catchment fig 6 depend on the combinations of landscape features and hydrological conditions at the seasonal scale 4 1 characteristic patterns of flow and nitrate dynamics the four hysteresis patterns varied strongly spatially and temporally in the uppermost and forest dominated middle subcatchments the most common hysteresis pattern across different seasons was counter clockwise hysteresis with an accretion effect during the rising limb i e negative hi with positive ci c a 70 at the silb and meis stations at the event scale nitrate sources near stream reaches were flushed out quickly which resulted in an accretion effect during the rising limb of the hydrograph given the low ambient nitrate concentrations fig 8d although the uppermost mountainous regions contain considerable areas of agricultural land nitrate cannot accumulate in the deeper subsurface due to the shallow impermeable bedrock and the consequently flashier flow pathways dupas et al 2017 yang et al 2019 this feature results in higher nitrate concentrations in the interflow than in the baseflow consequently a synchronous seasonal pattern of discharge and nitrate concentration was observed i e generally high values during wetting wet interflow dominated periods and low values during drying dry baseflow dominated periods fig 2 due to sufficient precipitation during events and well established hydrological connectivity interflow can transport distal terrestrial nitrate sources to the stream which further increases surface water nitrate concentrations the time lag between hydrological celerity and solute transport velocity makes nitrate concentration normally peak after discharge do which results in counter clockwise hysteresis however this pattern decreased at the haus station accounting for only 27 and occurred more frequently during wetting wet periods under high flow and low temperature conditions the pattern at the catchment outlet was controlled more by the two upstream subcatchments due to their large contributions to both runoff volume and nitrate n load fig 7 and low in stream nitrate uptake rode et al 2016a therefore during wetting wet periods the hysteresis pattern at the haus station can depend more on upstream features than on those of the lowermost subcatchment the propagation effects also influenced the pattern of counter clockwise hysteresis with a dilution effect at the three stations fig 8c the uppermost and middle subcatchments had more saturation overland flow with lower nitrate concentration in forest areas zimmermann et al 2006 overland flow near streams can be generated quickly during wetting wet periods with high discharge causing a dilution effect at the beginning of events the dominant runoff component of overland flow during the rising limb can be replaced by interflow quickly with higher nitrate concentration resulting in counter clockwise hysteresis this pattern was the most common pattern at the haus station during wetting wet periods this hysteresis pattern at haus can be affected by the two upstream subcatchments as mentioned moreover stream water routed from upstream subcatchments can also dilute nitrate concentration in the lowermost subcatchment since the latter generally has higher nitrate concentration during low flow conditions fig 2 changing the hysteresis pattern from upstream accretion to downstream dilution across different seasons table s2 besides influences from upstream subcatchments features of the lowermost subcatchment can also cause a dilution effect urban arable areas have been recognized to influence runoff generation in a catchment during storm events bronstert et al 2002 niehoff et al 2002 agricultural and municipal construction results in quick surface flow which tends to decrease nitrate concentration dilution effects caused by surface flow during storm events were also observed in a mountainous agricultural catchment in california usa goodridge and melack 2012 mountainous agricultural catchments in the tropics jacobs et al 2018 and urbanized catchments in north america barco et al 2008 in this case nitrate concentration decreased quickly at the beginning of the rising limb in the uppermost and lowermost subcatchments fig 5c which both contain urban and arable areas fig 1 interflow can then dominate quickly due to hydrological connectivity during wet periods or baseflow can dominate again after quick flow during the dry period in both situations nitrate concentration increased after quick flow before the discharge peak resulting in counter clockwise hysteresis fig 8c therefore this pattern dominated at the haus station not only due to events that propagated from upstream subcatchments but also events generated in the lowermost subcatchment it was noticeable that clockwise hysteresis occurred more during drying dry periods fig 6 hydrological connectivity from land to stream can be limited by the higher temperature and lower soil moisture during drying dry periods distal nitrate sources become immobilized and are not exported to the stream at low discharge and thus resulted in clockwise hysteresis fig 5a our findings are in line with those of baker and showers 2019 who concluded that clockwise hysteresis was favored when antecedent soil moisture was low in the uppermost subcatchment the accretion effect was caused by plentiful proximal nitrate sources as mentioned in the middle subcatchment atmospheric deposition is the main source of n in forest areas macdonald et al 2002 nitrate concentration has been reported to be higher in the topsoil than in groundwater due to uptake by deep rooted vegetation and denitrification in deep soil layers chaves et al 2009 consequently fewer distal nitrate sources can be transported to the stream during the baseflow dominated dry period in the middle than in the uppermost subcatchment which decreased the number of clockwise hysteresis at the meis station table 2 this pattern was the least common pattern at the haus station and occurred only during drying dry periods fig 6 none of this pattern at haus belonged to shared event table s2 this indicated that this pattern could represent nitrate dynamics exclusively in the lowermost subcatchment the lowermost subcatchment usually stores more nitrate due to mineral fertilizer and manure application saturated nitrate sources that are near the stream are easily flushed out when storm events occur even at low discharge leading to accretion effects fig 8b subsequently nitrate concentration decreases quickly due to insufficient precipitation and low hydrological connectivity with distal nitrate sources resulting in clockwise hysteresis the features of the lowermost subcatchment caused more clockwise hysteresis with the dilution effect fig 8a which was the second most common pattern at the haus station this pattern appeared more during drying dry periods when the lowermost subcatchment contributed considerable nitrate n load and had substantial influence on nitrate export dynamics fig 7b in this situation the dilution effect at the haus station could be related to quick flow from paved areas in the lowermost subcatchment as mentioned nitrate concentration followed a vertical gradient in the lowermost subcatchment lower in the topsoil due to plant uptake and higher in deep soil due to legacy nitrate outram et al 2016 hydrological connectivity was low during drying dry periods and interflow could not increase enough to transport deep nitrate rich sources to the stream which results in the continued decrease in nitrate concentration during the falling limb therefore clockwise hysteresis occurred more at the haus station than at the two upstream stations i e only 4 and 3 times at silb and meis respectively 4 2 implications and limits overall the hysteresis pattern based on the c q relationship varied among landscapes reflecting unique flow pathways and spatial nitrate storage due to different human activities e g fertilizer application drainage construction and geological conditions different patterns can dominate for a given dominant land use for example carey et al 2014 observed more clockwise hysteresis and a dilution effect in coastal catchments in which forest dominated in contrast we observed that counter clockwise hysteresis with an accretion effect dominated in the upstream mountainous forest areas this difference indicates that scientific monitoring should be set up according to meteorological hydrological geographical and pedological features rather than based only on land use this is especially important in a nested catchment where upstream subcatchment s can influence downstream subcatchment s and thus conceal nutrient export dynamics of the latter furthermore differences in hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical processes due to seasonal variations can cause variable flow and nitrate dynamics e g more clockwise hysteresis during drying dry periods and more counter clockwise hysteresis during wetting wet periods to disentangle seasonal effects long term high frequency monitoring can provide reliable datasets our findings can be used to target mitigation measures when specific hi ci combinations dominate in a given catchment for example when the c q relationship suggests that proximal nitrate sources dominate management actions can focus on agricultural land near streams but when distal nitrate sources dominate catchment wide actions are required however hysteresis analysis should also consider hydrographs with dual peaks or extremely long recession periods which may influence the analysis lloyd et al 2016b williams et al 2018 such hydrographs were rare in our study but since they can improve understanding of process mechanisms during certain periods they were not excluded for example the only shared event with positive hi at the meis station showed counter clockwise hysteresis early in the event but was influenced by a dual peak and longer falling limb which yielded a low positive value of hi ca 0 006 this analysis can improve understanding of the corresponding shared event at the silb station that had negative hi multiple distal sources can be consumed after a long period of flushing e g during a large storm event and cause lower nitrate concentrations during the late falling limb this case requires catchment wide management actions instead of focus on proximal streams despite a positive hi at the meis station thus events should be assessed carefully to avoid unreliable conclusions from statistical results especially those with low values of hi or ci doing so may provide a detailed picture of variations in flow nitrate dynamics our comprehensive analysis of landscape and seasonality effects on flow and nitrate dynamics focused mainly on high frequency monitoring data therefore it is difficult to quantify the landscape effect in the three subcatchments of the selke catchment even when considering shared events the landscape effect should be explored further using physical based hydrological water quality models current modeling is based mainly on daily data yang et al 2018 which may bias detection of storm events and calculation of the nitrate n load during storm events thus future studies require high frequency modeling which can be used to quantify influential factors that result in different flow and nitrate dynamics and provide targeted advice for water management 5 conclusions according to c q relationships counter clockwise hysteresis with an accretion effect dominated the catchment throughout the year however hysteresis was clockwise during specific periods in each subcatchment clockwise hysteresis occurred more during the dry period indicating low hydrological connectivity from land to stream for export of distal nitrate sources dilution effects dominated in the lowermost catchment which may have been influenced by flow propagating from upstream subcatchments during the wet period or generated by quick flow from paved areas when analyzing shared events the uppermost subcatchment always dominated runoff volume and dominated nitrate n load during all periods except the dry period when the lowermost subcatchment dominated nitrate n load which indicates the substantial contribution of nitrate export regimes from the lower urban arable area at the event scale this alternation suggests that high nitrate loaded interflow dominated in the upper mountainous subcatchments while quick runoff e g surface flow with low nitrate concentration dominated in the lowermost subcatchment this difference in nitrate export can increase during dry hot seasons when hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical processes change greatly these conclusions depend greatly on high frequency data which enabled events to be detected and nitrate n load to be calculated more accurately although complex hydrographs may have influenced our results the interpretation of the fundamental mechanism of variable c q relationships remains reliable water or agricultural management should be considered in complex conditions in which several mechanisms may coexist thus a continuous and scientific monitoring strategy in a nested catchment is important to capture the nitrate export regime at the seasonal and catchment scale credit authorship

5118,increasingly available high frequency data during storm events when hydrological dynamics most likely activate nitrate storage flux exchanges reveal insights into catchment nitrate dynamics in this study we explored impacts of seasonality and landscape gradients on nitrate concentration discharge c q hysteresis patterns in the selke catchment central germany which has heterogeneous combinations of meteorological hydrogeological and land use conditions three nested gauging stations established along the main selke river captured flow and nitrate export dynamics from the uppermost subcatchment mixed forest and arable land middle subcatchment pure steep forest and lowermost subcatchment arable and urban land we collected continuous high frequency 15 min discharge and nitrate concentration data from 2012 to 2017 and analyzed the 223 events detected at all three stations a dominant hysteresis pattern in the uppermost and middle subcatchments was counter clockwise and combined with an accretion effect indicating many proximal and mobilized distal nitrate sources however 66 of all events at the catchment outlet experienced a dilution effect possibly due to mechanisms that vary seasonally during wetting wet periods october march it was combined mainly with a counter clockwise pattern due to the dominance of event runoff volume from the uppermost and middle subcatchments during drying dry periods april september however it was combined mainly with a clockwise pattern due to occasional quick surface flows from lowland near stream urban areas in addition the clockwise hysteresis occurred mainly from may october during mostly drying dry periods at all three sites indicating little distal nitrate transport in response to the low terrestrial hydrological connectivity especially in the lowermost dry and flat subcatchment this comprehensive analysis i e clockwise vs counter clockwise accretion vs dilution enables in depth analysis of nitrate export mechanisms during certain periods under different landscape conditions specific combination of c q relationships could identify target locations for agricultural management actions that decrease nitrate output therefore we strongly encourage long term multisite and high frequency monitoring strategies in heterogeneous nested catchment s which can help understand process mechanisms

nitrogen n cycling greatly boyer et al 2002 howarth et al 2012 the large external supplies of n clearly exceed terrestrial n demands for plant crop growth and microbial transformation davidson et al 2011 driven by hydrological dynamics the excess terrestrial n has been exported to surface waters and redistributed spatially and temporally throughout fresh coastal water systems reusch et al 2018 shields et al 2008 mitigation measures have been established according to guidelines of multiple government conventions e g the european union water framework directive although diffuse nitrate pollution has been ameliorated it remains a main cause of freshwater quality degradation eea 2018 pursuing more cost effective measures requires better mechanistic understanding of catchment nitrate dynamics especially in the context of contrasting landscape conditions both natural and human and strong seasonal variability flow and nitrate dynamics during storm events are more active due to changes in storage flux interactions and transport pathways compared to those during hydrologically stable conditions e g low flow dry periods therefore the event scale relationship between nitrate concentration and discharge c q relationship has been investigated intensively to determine spatial and temporal variability in catchment nitrate functioning baker and showers 2019 dupas et al 2016 zimmer et al 2019 hysteresis is the most commonly observed pattern of the c q relationship burns et al 2019 hysteresis patterns vary spatially and temporally due to variable combinations of nitrate sources bowes et al 2015 and hydrological drivers vaughan et al 2017 celerity is well known to be faster than particle transport velocity in catchment hydrology cheraghi et al 2016 mcdonnell and beven 2014 williams et al 2018 therefore proximal nitrate storages generally respond faster than distal storages along the formation of hydrograph at the catchment scale resulting in different hysteresis loops of the c q relationship i e clockwise vs counter clockwise meanwhile nitrate storage varies vertically along the soil profile and horizontally under different landscape characteristics and anthropogenic conditions dupas et al 2016 musolff et al 2016 miller et al 2017 driven by flow generations the mobilized terrestrial nitrate may further result in negative or positive hysteresis slopes for stream water representing dilution or accretion effects respectively in turn hysteresis analysis based on comprehensive monitoring data permits detailed explorations of the varying flow and nitrate dynamics continuous high frequency data under various hydro climatic conditions offers the opportunity to evaluate the changes of runoff partitioning and biogeochemical processes as well as their impacts on nitrate mobilizations at multiple spatial scales e g for the catchment wide scale and the local near stream scale carey et al 2014 vaughan et al 2017 intensive monitoring across contrasting landscape characteristics further enables detailed analysis of the interplay between heterogeneous landscape features and varying flow pathways fovet et al 2018 musolff et al 2015 williams et al 2018 landscape characteristics reflect regional climate patterns general pedological and geological properties and human impacts therefore the spatial heterogeneity of landscape characteristics determines the spatial distribution of nitrate source areas and variable catchment mechanisms of hydrology and nutrient transport dupas et al 2017 poor and mcdonnell 2007 the long history of commercial fertilizer application has increased agricultural production but has also accumulated excess n in terrestrial soils outram et al 2016 n sources from agricultural lands have become one of the main pollution sources in most rivers and caused high risks to aquatic ecosystems eea 2019 in forest areas nitrate leaching likely depends on the amount of nitrate in throughfall and the c n ratio of the organic soil horizon borken and matzner 2004 macdonald et al 2002 therefore a synchronous dynamic pattern between discharge and nitrate concentration is commonly observed in forest catchments artificial n is added mainly via atmospheric wet and dry deposition e g ranging from 1 to 60 kg n ha 1 yr 1 which has also been increased greatly in the past few decades macdonald et al 2002 in urban areas extensive paved areas and artificial drainage networks can strongly alter natural processes of water movement and nitrate transport miller et al 2014 for example artificially drained flow easily bypasses the nitrate rich soil and responds quickly even under small precipitation events therefore the process of n export can be misunderstood if the heterogeneity of catchment landscape characteristics is not considered especially in nonuniform and nested catchments driven by seasonal variations in meteorological and hydrological conditions terrestrial export of nitrate always accompanies the changes of runoff components and therefore the surface nitrate c q relationship shows strong seasonality sickman et al 2003 different runoff components i e surface flow interflow and baseflow usually have different nitrate concentrations due to their differing degrees of interactions with soil n sources miller et al 2017 therefore the seasonally varying characteristic of runoff partitioning can alter the c q relationship of specific events considerably recent researches about c q relationship most focus on humid areas jacobs et al 2018 vaughan et al 2017 zimmer et al 2019 where interflow plays an important role in transporting nitrate sources during events studies of process based understanding of temporal nitrate dynamics in dry area are still rare dupas et al 2016 for example interflow and baseflow are considered the dominant runoff components during wet and dry periods respectively in the well monitored selke catchment in central germany yang et al 2018 however quick surface flow from paved area and artificial drainage both with relatively low nitrate concentrations can also occur intermittently in the lowland arable urban area during small events and cause different c q relationships at the outlet the interplay among different runoff components and their effects on nitrate dynamics in dry area are hence in need of improved understanding moreover seasonal biogeochemical processes can also influence the nitrate legacy at the catchment scale in western europe winter spring high flow periods experience high soil moisture which activates hydrological connections between terrestrial and aquatic systems molenat et al 2008 strohmenger et al 2020 and relatively low temperatures which do not stimulate much biogeochemical turnover allen et al 2002 in contrast summer autumn high temperature growing seasons cause high soil evaporation and plant crop transpiration which result in low soil moisture that restricts hydrological connections bracken and croke 2007 and stimulates biogeochemical transformations of n in terrestrial and in stream phases racchetti et al 2011 rode et al 2016a hence these seasonal hydrological and biogeochemical processes can characterize the variation in the c q relationship overall the mechanistic interactions between flow and nitrate dynamics at the event scale vary spatially and temporally comprehensive monitoring datasets for highly heterogeneous catchments are rare but they are essential to reveal effects of landscape heterogeneity and seasonality on c q relationships in this study we focused on the well monitored selke catchment a subcatchment of the terrestrial environmental observatories tereno harz central german lowland observatory wollschläger et al 2016 zacharias et al 2011 three nested gauging stations along the main selke river capture the variety of catchment responses of flow and nitrate processes jiang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 high frequency multi parameter sensors have been continuously deployed at each station ranging from upper forest area to lowland agricultural area rode et al 2016a here we collected discharge and nitrate n concentration data that were continuously monitored during 2012 2017 at a 15 min interval the objectives of this study were to 1 quantify event scale c q relationships among heterogeneous conditions in the nested selke catchment 2 analyze impacts of deviating hydrological and landscape characteristics on hysteresis patterns based on subcatchments discrepancies and 3 investigate seasonal variability of hysteresis patterns given the contrasting wet dry conditions with this study we show how nitrate fluxes are generated in heterogeneous subcatchments and how the interplay of these subcatchments can modulate c q relationships at varying seasonal conditions and event magnitudes at the whole catchment scale 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the selke catchment 456 km2 is located in the transition area between the northern german plain and central german uplands the elevation ranges from ca 590 m in the upper harz mountain region to ca 100 m in the lowland region fig 1 a with mean annual precipitation decreasing from 790 to 450 mm respectively yang et al 2019 three gauging stations set up from upstream to downstream i e silberhuette silb meisdorf meis and hausneindorf haus fig 1a capture responses of the heterogeneous catchments rode et al 2016a the drainage areas of the three stations are 99 184 and 456 km2 respectively the uppermost and middle subcatchments lie in the harz mountainous region which is dominated by shallow and relatively impervious schist and claystone overlain mainly by cambisols in contrast the lowermost subcatchment lies in the unique central german loess chernozem region which has deep tertiary sedimentary rocks therefore the catchment has high gradients of landscape characteristics including meteorology hydrology biogeochemistry and anthropogenic impacts yang et al 2019 the uppermost subcatchment is covered by well mixed forest 60 and agricultural 25 areas while most 85 of the middle subcatchment is covered by pure steep forest fig 1b due to the high fertility of chernozems the lowermost subcatchment is extensively and intensively cultivated as arable land ca 80 and contains considerable urban areas both discharge and nitrate n no 3 n concentration are continuously measured at the three gauging stations we collected high frequency 15 min interval data from 2012 to 2017 for the event scale analysis discharge data were provided by the state agency for flood protection and water management of saxony anhalt lhw no 3 n data were provided by the helmholtz center for environmental research ufz using a trios props uv sensor with an optical path length of 10 mm the sensor data were validated by biweekly parallel grab samples for more information about the high frequency monitoring and maintenance please refer to rode et al 2016b in addition long term daily discharge and biweekly grab sampled no 3 n data 1994 2011 from lhw were also collected for a long term overview of flow and no 3 n concentration dynamics 2 2 variability in event scale nitrate dynamics 2 2 1 detecting storm events storm events were detected first based on automatic identification of all local maxima and minima of the discharge time series each local maximum was considered to be the discharge peak of each event and the closest minima before and after the peak were selected as the preliminary start and end time of the event respectively next the final start and end times of each event were manually adjusted to ensure that they had a similar discharge successive events without a complete recession between them were merged into a single event with multiple peaks events with missing data 10 were excluded from further analysis events were detected using scripts in r software r core team 2020 2 2 2 calculation of hysteresis patterns for each event discharge and no 3 n were normalized following lloyd et al 2016a 1 q t n o r m q t q min q max q min 2 n t n o r m n t n min n max n min where q t and n t are the discharge m3 s 1 and no 3 n mg l 1 concentration measured at time t q t n o r m and n t n o r m are the normalized discharge and no 3 n concentration and the subscripts min and max are the minimum and maximum values of each event to quantify the hysteresis pattern of the c q relationship two indices were calculated from the normalized data first the non dimensional hysteresis index hi was calculated as 3 hi n t n o r m d q t n o r m where hi equals the sum of hysteresis effects of the c q relationship during each event period zhang et al 2017 hi ranges from 1 to 1 hi 0 indicates clockwise hysteresis while hi 0 indicates counter clockwise hysteresis second the concentration changed index ci following butturini et al 2008 was calculated as 4 ci n tp n o r m n ts n o r m where n tp n o r m and n ts n o r m are the normalized no 3 n concentration at the discharge peak and start time of each event respectively ci ranges from 1 to 1 ci 0 indicates an accretion effect of no 3 n concentration following flow dynamics while ci 0 indicates a dilution effect note that if the peak discharge lasted for more than one measured time point the first time point no 3 n concentration was chosen as n tp n o r m 2 2 3 shared event analysis and statistic methods several shared events were specifically analyzed based on the start end and discharge peak time points of each event at the silb meis and haus stations these events propagated from upstream to downstream and were detected simultaneously at all three stations then the start and end times of each shared event were adjusted slightly to encompass the entire event duration at all three stations i e using the latest start time and the earliest end time nitrate n load n l unit kg and runoff volume r v unit m3 of each shared event at each station were calculated using the following two equations respectively 5 n l q t n t d t 6 r v q t d t where q t and n t are the measured discharge m3 s 1 and no 3 n concentration mg l 1 respectively during the shared period using values of n l and r v from the three nested stations nitrate n load and runoff volume were calculated for the uppermost subcatchment subscript up as the values measured at the silb station for the middle subcatchment subscript mid as the values measured at the meis station minus those at the silb station and for the lowermost subcatchment subscript low as the values measured at the haus station minus those at the meis station in addition nitrate n load and runoff volume of the entire catchment subscript all were considered as the values measured at the haus station the nonparametric wilcoxon signed rank test and kruskal wallis test were used to detect significant differences in population medians of paired or multiple categories respectively kruskal and wallis 1952 wilcoxon 1945 the distributions of samples were considered significantly different when the p value was below the level of significance of 0 05 3 results 3 1 overview of long term dynamics in the long term data 1994 2017 runoff volume increased disproportionately from upstream to downstream stations for example although the uppermost subcatchment covered only 22 of the catchment it contributed 64 of its total mean annual runoff volume i e 3 31 107 and 5 15 107 m3 yr 1 at the silb and haus stations respectively the spatial contribution of mean annual no 3 n load generally followed that of flow volume e g 68 t yr 1 at the silb station was 43 of the total at the haus station differences in runoff volume and no 3 n load among subcatchments were due to spatial variability in no 3 n concentrations from the silb station to the haus station median no 3 n concentration increased significantly from 1 01 to 2 68 mg l 1 wilcoxon signed rank test while median specific runoff decreased significantly from 169 to 67 mm yr 1 wilcoxon signed rank test despite the high spatial variability discharge and no 3 n concentration showed strong seasonal patterns fig 2 based on the general hydro climatic cycling fig 2a we categorized the hydrological year into four periods wetting october december with a continuous increase in mean monthly discharge from 0 90 to 1 80 m3 s 1 at the haus station wet january march with high mean discharge of 2 96 m3 s 1 drying april june with mean monthly discharge decreasing from 2 42 to 0 99 m3 s 1 and dry july september with consistently low mean discharge of 0 58 m3 s 1 the spatial distribution of flow varied greatly among the hydrological periods the uppermost subcatchment generated most of the catchment s runoff volume during the wet period but much less during the dry period e g mean discharge in february and september was 70 and 53 that at haus respectively fig 2a the seasonal pattern of no 3 n was similar to that of discharge at the silb and meis stations with high concentrations e g 3 mg l 1 during the wet period that gradually decreased during the drying period and much lower concentrations e g 1 mg l 1 during the dry period fig 2b however no 3 n at the haus station had consistently high concentrations throughout the hydrological cycle i e generally 2 mg l 1 mean no 3 n concentration during the dry period was significantly higher at haus 2 60 mg l 1 than at silb 0 58 mg l 1 the high mean concentrations at haus much higher than those at meis and silb were likely caused by urban point source contributions before 2002 yang et al 2018 nonetheless the mean monthly concentration decreased slightly from the beginning of the drying period but remained much higher than those at meis and silb 3 2 event detection we analyzed 81 72 and 70 detected events at the silb meis and haus stations respectively from 2012 to 2017 fig 3 supplementary table s1 events were evenly distributed while their magnitude and duration varied greatly during the four hydrological periods among the three stations table 1 event durations were generally much longer during wetting wet periods than during drying dry periods e g mean durations at the silb station were 11 79 and 4 07 days during the wet and dry periods respectively similarly event scale mean discharge and no 3 n had the highest values during the wet period and the lowest values during the dry period at the three stations table 1 3 3 hysteresis pattern analysis the patterns of hi and ci showed both spatial and seasonal variations negative hi i e counter clockwise hysteresis dominated at the silb meis and haus stations i e ca 78 88 and 63 of all events respectively fig 4 a most events with positive hi i e clockwise hysteresis occurred during drying dry periods 78 67 and 88 at the silb meis and haus stations respectively the median hi was significantly different among four hydrological periods at each station kruskal wallis test the trend for ci differed from that of hi positive ci i e accretion effect dominated in the uppermost and middle subcatchments i e 89 and 79 of all events at the silb and meis stations respectively fig 4b however 66 of events at the haus station had negative ci i e dilution effect the median ci between silb and haus and between meis and haus were significantly different wilcoxon signed rank test mean ci was positive during all four hydrological periods at the silb and meis stations but was positive only during the wet period at the haus station fig 4b we combined the two hysteresis indices and categorized all events into four categories fig 5 event scale hysteresis patterns varied greatly among the hydrological periods and landscape conditions fig 6 at the silb station the general hysteresis pattern was negative hi combined with positive ci ca 72 fig 6 the events in this category had the longest duration and highest total precipitation table 2 the pattern of positive hi combined with positive ci accounted for 17 of events at silb most of which occurred during drying dry periods among events with negative ci those combined with negative hi occurred during wetting wet periods fig 6 in contrast events with positive hi occurred during drying dry periods and had the shortest duration lowest total precipitation and lowest discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 at the meis station the general hysteresis pattern was the same as at the silb station i e 71 of events had negative hi with positive ci but the percentage of positive hi with positive ci decreased to 8 indicating an overall lower accretion effect table 2 patterns of negative hi with negative ci increased to 17 of events at meis with a relatively short duration and low discharge table 2 the pattern of positive hi with negative ci was least common and was evenly distributed among the wetting drying and dry periods fig 6 similarly this pattern had the shortest duration and lowest total precipitation discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 the hysteresis pattern at the haus station differed strongly from those at the two upstream stations fig 6 the percentage of events with negative hi combined with positive ci which dominated at upstream stations decreased to only 27 at haus and had the longest duration highest total precipitation and highest discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 the general pattern was negative hi with negative ci which accounted for ca 36 of all events the pattern of positive hi with negative ci increased from 5 at the upper two stations to 30 at the haus station the pattern of positive hi with positive ci occurred only during drying dry periods fig 6 notably regardless of ci patterns with positive hi usually occurred during drying dry periods ca 88 with a short duration and low discharge and no 3 n concentration while patterns with negative hi occurred more during wetting wet periods ca 73 with a long duration and high discharge and no 3 n concentration table 2 3 4 shared events analysis to investigate the influence of the landscape on seasonal flow and nitrate dynamics we analyzed 24 catchment wide shared events most shared events had negative hi at the silb and meis stations with only one event with positive hi at the meis station supplementary table s2 three shared events had positive hi during the dry period at the haus station with a high contribution of no 3 n load from the lowermost subcatchment table s2 the number of shared events with negative ci increased from upstream to downstream i e 2 3 and 12 at the silb meis and haus stations respectively table s2 runoff volume r v and nitrate n load n l contributions from each subcatchment had strong seasonal variations at the event scale fig 7 during wetting wet periods r v u p r v a l l was significantly higher than r v m i d r v a l l and r v l o w r v a l l kruskal wallis test r v m i d r v a l l and r v l o w r v a l l varied during the wetting period but the former ratio increased and the latter one decreased during the wet period during the drying period r v u p r v a l l decreased quickly to a proportion similar to r v m i d r v a l l while r v l o w r v a l l increased but remained lower than r v u p r v a l l and r v m i d r v a l l during the dry period contributions from the three subcatchments varied within a similar range with slightly higher r v u p r v a l l than r v m i d r v a l l and r v l o w r v a l l nitrate n load contributions had a different seasonal pattern from runoff volume contributions fig 7b during wetting wet periods nitrate n load contributions from the three subcatchments generally followed runoff volume contributions i e that from the uppermost subcatchment was significantly higher than that form the middle and lowermost subcatchments kruskal wallis test likewise n l m i d n l a l l and n l l o w n l a l l varied with the former ratio increasing and the latter one decreasing during the drying period however n l m i d n l a l l increased quickly and ultimately exceeded n l u p n l a l l while both n l u p n l a l l and n l m i d n l a l l decreased to a similar low proportion during the dry period n l l o w n l a l l decreased thus the subcatchment that contributed the most nitrate n load varied among the four hydrological periods 4 discussion terrestrial nitrate transport at the catchment scale is strongly related to flow dynamics in the selke catchment the land to stream transport has been identified as a key driven factor for surface water dynamics dupas et al 2017 due to the complex combination of meteorological hydrological geographical and pedological characteristics of each subcatchment nitrate dynamics varied from upstream to downstream in the nested selke catchment based on the hysteresis indices four hysteresis patterns can be conceptualized fig 8 the driving factors of their occurrences in the selke catchment fig 6 depend on the combinations of landscape features and hydrological conditions at the seasonal scale 4 1 characteristic patterns of flow and nitrate dynamics the four hysteresis patterns varied strongly spatially and temporally in the uppermost and forest dominated middle subcatchments the most common hysteresis pattern across different seasons was counter clockwise hysteresis with an accretion effect during the rising limb i e negative hi with positive ci c a 70 at the silb and meis stations at the event scale nitrate sources near stream reaches were flushed out quickly which resulted in an accretion effect during the rising limb of the hydrograph given the low ambient nitrate concentrations fig 8d although the uppermost mountainous regions contain considerable areas of agricultural land nitrate cannot accumulate in the deeper subsurface due to the shallow impermeable bedrock and the consequently flashier flow pathways dupas et al 2017 yang et al 2019 this feature results in higher nitrate concentrations in the interflow than in the baseflow consequently a synchronous seasonal pattern of discharge and nitrate concentration was observed i e generally high values during wetting wet interflow dominated periods and low values during drying dry baseflow dominated periods fig 2 due to sufficient precipitation during events and well established hydrological connectivity interflow can transport distal terrestrial nitrate sources to the stream which further increases surface water nitrate concentrations the time lag between hydrological celerity and solute transport velocity makes nitrate concentration normally peak after discharge do which results in counter clockwise hysteresis however this pattern decreased at the haus station accounting for only 27 and occurred more frequently during wetting wet periods under high flow and low temperature conditions the pattern at the catchment outlet was controlled more by the two upstream subcatchments due to their large contributions to both runoff volume and nitrate n load fig 7 and low in stream nitrate uptake rode et al 2016a therefore during wetting wet periods the hysteresis pattern at the haus station can depend more on upstream features than on those of the lowermost subcatchment the propagation effects also influenced the pattern of counter clockwise hysteresis with a dilution effect at the three stations fig 8c the uppermost and middle subcatchments had more saturation overland flow with lower nitrate concentration in forest areas zimmermann et al 2006 overland flow near streams can be generated quickly during wetting wet periods with high discharge causing a dilution effect at the beginning of events the dominant runoff component of overland flow during the rising limb can be replaced by interflow quickly with higher nitrate concentration resulting in counter clockwise hysteresis this pattern was the most common pattern at the haus station during wetting wet periods this hysteresis pattern at haus can be affected by the two upstream subcatchments as mentioned moreover stream water routed from upstream subcatchments can also dilute nitrate concentration in the lowermost subcatchment since the latter generally has higher nitrate concentration during low flow conditions fig 2 changing the hysteresis pattern from upstream accretion to downstream dilution across different seasons table s2 besides influences from upstream subcatchments features of the lowermost subcatchment can also cause a dilution effect urban arable areas have been recognized to influence runoff generation in a catchment during storm events bronstert et al 2002 niehoff et al 2002 agricultural and municipal construction results in quick surface flow which tends to decrease nitrate concentration dilution effects caused by surface flow during storm events were also observed in a mountainous agricultural catchment in california usa goodridge and melack 2012 mountainous agricultural catchments in the tropics jacobs et al 2018 and urbanized catchments in north america barco et al 2008 in this case nitrate concentration decreased quickly at the beginning of the rising limb in the uppermost and lowermost subcatchments fig 5c which both contain urban and arable areas fig 1 interflow can then dominate quickly due to hydrological connectivity during wet periods or baseflow can dominate again after quick flow during the dry period in both situations nitrate concentration increased after quick flow before the discharge peak resulting in counter clockwise hysteresis fig 8c therefore this pattern dominated at the haus station not only due to events that propagated from upstream subcatchments but also events generated in the lowermost subcatchment it was noticeable that clockwise hysteresis occurred more during drying dry periods fig 6 hydrological connectivity from land to stream can be limited by the higher temperature and lower soil moisture during drying dry periods distal nitrate sources become immobilized and are not exported to the stream at low discharge and thus resulted in clockwise hysteresis fig 5a our findings are in line with those of baker and showers 2019 who concluded that clockwise hysteresis was favored when antecedent soil moisture was low in the uppermost subcatchment the accretion effect was caused by plentiful proximal nitrate sources as mentioned in the middle subcatchment atmospheric deposition is the main source of n in forest areas macdonald et al 2002 nitrate concentration has been reported to be higher in the topsoil than in groundwater due to uptake by deep rooted vegetation and denitrification in deep soil layers chaves et al 2009 consequently fewer distal nitrate sources can be transported to the stream during the baseflow dominated dry period in the middle than in the uppermost subcatchment which decreased the number of clockwise hysteresis at the meis station table 2 this pattern was the least common pattern at the haus station and occurred only during drying dry periods fig 6 none of this pattern at haus belonged to shared event table s2 this indicated that this pattern could represent nitrate dynamics exclusively in the lowermost subcatchment the lowermost subcatchment usually stores more nitrate due to mineral fertilizer and manure application saturated nitrate sources that are near the stream are easily flushed out when storm events occur even at low discharge leading to accretion effects fig 8b subsequently nitrate concentration decreases quickly due to insufficient precipitation and low hydrological connectivity with distal nitrate sources resulting in clockwise hysteresis the features of the lowermost subcatchment caused more clockwise hysteresis with the dilution effect fig 8a which was the second most common pattern at the haus station this pattern appeared more during drying dry periods when the lowermost subcatchment contributed considerable nitrate n load and had substantial influence on nitrate export dynamics fig 7b in this situation the dilution effect at the haus station could be related to quick flow from paved areas in the lowermost subcatchment as mentioned nitrate concentration followed a vertical gradient in the lowermost subcatchment lower in the topsoil due to plant uptake and higher in deep soil due to legacy nitrate outram et al 2016 hydrological connectivity was low during drying dry periods and interflow could not increase enough to transport deep nitrate rich sources to the stream which results in the continued decrease in nitrate concentration during the falling limb therefore clockwise hysteresis occurred more at the haus station than at the two upstream stations i e only 4 and 3 times at silb and meis respectively 4 2 implications and limits overall the hysteresis pattern based on the c q relationship varied among landscapes reflecting unique flow pathways and spatial nitrate storage due to different human activities e g fertilizer application drainage construction and geological conditions different patterns can dominate for a given dominant land use for example carey et al 2014 observed more clockwise hysteresis and a dilution effect in coastal catchments in which forest dominated in contrast we observed that counter clockwise hysteresis with an accretion effect dominated in the upstream mountainous forest areas this difference indicates that scientific monitoring should be set up according to meteorological hydrological geographical and pedological features rather than based only on land use this is especially important in a nested catchment where upstream subcatchment s can influence downstream subcatchment s and thus conceal nutrient export dynamics of the latter furthermore differences in hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical processes due to seasonal variations can cause variable flow and nitrate dynamics e g more clockwise hysteresis during drying dry periods and more counter clockwise hysteresis during wetting wet periods to disentangle seasonal effects long term high frequency monitoring can provide reliable datasets our findings can be used to target mitigation measures when specific hi ci combinations dominate in a given catchment for example when the c q relationship suggests that proximal nitrate sources dominate management actions can focus on agricultural land near streams but when distal nitrate sources dominate catchment wide actions are required however hysteresis analysis should also consider hydrographs with dual peaks or extremely long recession periods which may influence the analysis lloyd et al 2016b williams et al 2018 such hydrographs were rare in our study but since they can improve understanding of process mechanisms during certain periods they were not excluded for example the only shared event with positive hi at the meis station showed counter clockwise hysteresis early in the event but was influenced by a dual peak and longer falling limb which yielded a low positive value of hi ca 0 006 this analysis can improve understanding of the corresponding shared event at the silb station that had negative hi multiple distal sources can be consumed after a long period of flushing e g during a large storm event and cause lower nitrate concentrations during the late falling limb this case requires catchment wide management actions instead of focus on proximal streams despite a positive hi at the meis station thus events should be assessed carefully to avoid unreliable conclusions from statistical results especially those with low values of hi or ci doing so may provide a detailed picture of variations in flow nitrate dynamics our comprehensive analysis of landscape and seasonality effects on flow and nitrate dynamics focused mainly on high frequency monitoring data therefore it is difficult to quantify the landscape effect in the three subcatchments of the selke catchment even when considering shared events the landscape effect should be explored further using physical based hydrological water quality models current modeling is based mainly on daily data yang et al 2018 which may bias detection of storm events and calculation of the nitrate n load during storm events thus future studies require high frequency modeling which can be used to quantify influential factors that result in different flow and nitrate dynamics and provide targeted advice for water management 5 conclusions according to c q relationships counter clockwise hysteresis with an accretion effect dominated the catchment throughout the year however hysteresis was clockwise during specific periods in each subcatchment clockwise hysteresis occurred more during the dry period indicating low hydrological connectivity from land to stream for export of distal nitrate sources dilution effects dominated in the lowermost catchment which may have been influenced by flow propagating from upstream subcatchments during the wet period or generated by quick flow from paved areas when analyzing shared events the uppermost subcatchment always dominated runoff volume and dominated nitrate n load during all periods except the dry period when the lowermost subcatchment dominated nitrate n load which indicates the substantial contribution of nitrate export regimes from the lower urban arable area at the event scale this alternation suggests that high nitrate loaded interflow dominated in the upper mountainous subcatchments while quick runoff e g surface flow with low nitrate concentration dominated in the lowermost subcatchment this difference in nitrate export can increase during dry hot seasons when hydrological connectivity and biogeochemical processes change greatly these conclusions depend greatly on high frequency data which enabled events to be detected and nitrate n load to be calculated more accurately although complex hydrographs may have influenced our results the interpretation of the fundamental mechanism of variable c q relationships remains reliable water or agricultural management should be considered in complex conditions in which several mechanisms may coexist thus a continuous and scientific monitoring strategy in a nested catchment is important to capture the nitrate export regime at the seasonal and catchment scale credit authorship

5119,the deltaic and coastal region is an important area for transportation production and transformation of organic matter om however the high degree of urbanization and seasonal variability of runoff in this region significantly impact source apportionments and biogeochemical processes of the om in this study stable isotopes of carbon c and nitrogen n in both suspended particulate matter spm and sedimentary organic matter som were measured in the highly urbanized pearl river delta prd china the results revealed that source apportionments exhibited spatial variations due to different degrees of urbanization and seasonal variations due to seasonal changes in runoff high urbanization could increase the contribution of sewage derived om in the spm and decrease the proportion of soil om in the som increased precipitation and runoff during wet season could result in a greater contribution of sewage derived om 55 and decreased runoff during the dry season resulted in an increased proportion of phytoplankton 51 in the spm urbanization and runoff also affected c and n transformation processes of om an increased volume of sewage discharge due to urbanization provided nutrients for phytoplankton growth promoting photosynthesis and assimilation processes increased light intensity due to decreased precipitation and runoff during the dry season could facilitate photosynthesis by phytoplankton this study suggested that om could record the impacts of urbanization and hydrology on c and n transformation processes in the rivers further improving knowledge on the c and n cycling processes in highly urbanized river ecosystems keywords particulate organic matter urbanization carbon nitrogen isotope 1 introduction organic matter om is an important component of particulate om which is present as suspended particulate matter spm and sedimentary organic matter som in the river ecosystems the particulate om consists of multiple sources including allochthonous inputs e g soil om c3 and c4 plants and sewage derived om and autochthonous production e g phytoplankton dalu et al 2016 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2019 and thus provides integrated information of natural and human activities lambert et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in addition particulate om is composed of nutrients organic micro pollutants and heavy metals particulate om could play a key role in exchange transport and recycling of elements turner and millward 2002 uher et al 2001 zhu et al 2018 and could reveal biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems rose et al 2018 ye et al 2017 thus identifying the relative contributions of particulate om from multiple sources and investigating its transformation processes are crucial steps to understand om biogeochemistry in aquatic ecosystems the deltaic and coastal region is a key pathway for the transport of nutrients from land to the coastal zone and oceans as well as a main repository of om delivered by rivers ni et al 2008 at least half the world s population resides in the deltaic and coastal zone thus human activities put considerable stress on nutrient cycling ache et al 2015 paerl et al 2010 walker and schafran 2015 human activities including intensive agriculture urbanization and industrial expansion in the deltaic river basins have significantly increased nutrient sediment and other pollutant loads in these waters resulting in an unprecedented pressure on ecological condition and sustainability of downstream riverine estuarine and coastal waters conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2014a scavia and bricker 2006 in addition hydrological modifications e g seasonal variation of runoff alter rates of water flow and sedimentation leading to changes in estuarine water environments paerl et al 2014b reyna et al 2017 under hydrological and anthropogenic pressures complex circulation and mixing patterns produce spatiotemporally heterogeneous conditions for phytoplankton growth and thus have great impacts on source apportionment of om and biogeochemical processes of carbon c and nitrogen n cycling in the aquatic ecosystems liénart et al 2018 pitt et al 2018 ray et al 2018 therefore it is essential to understand how human activity and hydrological variation affect the origin distribution and fate of om in the deltaic and coastal region the pearl river delta prd region is a large deltaic and coastal system consisting of a collection of numerous tributaries over the past three decades the prd region has experienced rapid urbanization and extensive agricultural development lu et al 2009 tan et al 2016 especially in 2016 the china state council first highlighted the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba to reactivate the megacity region and strengthen the booming nature of the prd hui et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 given the high attention provided by the government and its rapid development the prd region has become the most important region of economic growth and technological innovation in china for example in 2017 this region was responsible for 13 of the national gross domestic product gdp with only 1 of the country s land area zhou et al 2018 the fast growing economy and rapid urbanization resulted in the release of heavy loads of anthropogenic waste water into the river ecosystem lu et al 2009 tan et al 2016 in addition anthropogenic organic pollutants could affect the phytoplankton growth in the river and be transported with particulate matters to coastal waters and eventually to the oceans numerous of studies have investigated the origin abundance and bioavailability of dissolved nutrients and organic matters in the pearl river estuary guo et al 2019 2015 he et al 2010 ye et al 2017 2016 however few studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of urbanization and hydrological variation on the temporal and spatial patterns of spm and som in rivers of the prd region ou et al 2019 xu et al 2019 ye et al 2016 as c and n bearing matter maintains the isotopic signatures of their sources or alters their isotopic characteristics during transformation processes the stable isotopic compositions of c and n in the om can be treated as an effective method to trace multiple sources and identify predominant processes for instance aquatic plants generally exhibit depleted δ13c values approximately 30 relative to terrestrial soils approximately 25 lu et al 2016 ogrinc et al 2008 and sewage derived om typically has higher δ15n value liu et al 2019 munksgaard et al 2016 in addition c and n transformation processes can leave distinguishable signatures in isotopic composition of the om for example the photosynthesis process can lead to a decrease in the δ13c value of phytoplankton choudhary et al 2009 and assimilation processes can cause a decrease in δ15n of produced organic n and an increase in δ15n of remaining inorganic n granger et al 2004 therefore in this study we measured the isotopes of carbon c and nitrogen n of the spm and som for different seasons in the prd region and quantified source apportionments of the om the aim of this study is to retrieve the impact of urbanization and seasonal change of runoff on source apportionments and transformation processes of the om based on the c and n isotopic record 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prd region is located in southern china and is comprised of rich watercourses and wetlands that are connected to the south china sea scs via eight major riverine runoff outlets fig 1 the annual mean temperature is approximately 20 25 c and annual mean precipitation ranges between 1600 and 2000 mm du et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 the region is located in the subtropical zone and within the transitional zone of the east asian monsoon system with warm and humid summer monsoon and cool and dry winter monsoon resulting in highly seasonal variation in water discharge and particulate organic matter load to the estuary ou et al 2019 ye et al 2017 during the wet season april to september high precipitation 1761 5 mm guangdong water resources bulletin 2018 results in high runoff and increased loading of suspended particulate ou et al 2019 yu et al 2010 during the dry season october to march the water column is well mixed and the suspended particulate is beneficial for deposition due to the effect of low precipitation 343 0 mm guangdong water resources bulletin 2018 and reduced river discharge ye et al 2017 as one of the most prosperous regions in china the prd region has experienced explosive economic growth over the last 20 years resulting in a rapid urbanization and a substantial increase in population liu et al 2018 the region consists of nine cities including guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan huizhou dongguan zhongshan jiangmen and zhaoqing in the guangdong province china fig 1 the resident population has been estimated at 56 90 million people and guangzhou shenzhen foshan and dongguan encompass more than 70 of the population in the prd region tan et al 2016 due to the dense population and growing urbanization sewage inputs have increased markedly in recent decades causing frequent eutrophication and deteriorative water quality chen et al 2019 strokal et al 2015 therefore in the prd region river water receives high loads of organic matter and nutrients due to intensive urbanization causing a profound effect on the chemistry and biology of the river system and strongly influencing the sources and cycling of the spm and som pools 2 2 sample collection based on the precipitation and discharge sampling campaigns were conducted during the dry season in march 2018 and wet season in september 2018 during each sampling period surface water and spm samples were collected from 58

potential organic matter sources soil om and phytoplankton were also collected soil samples 35 sites were collected along the mainstream fig 1 all soil samples were packed in a clean plastic bag and stored in cooling boxes before being transported to the laboratory for further analyses the samples of phytoplankton were collected from 12 sampling sites which were located at the upstream of rivers

and three potential sources soil om sewage derived om and phytoplankton were considered the δ13c and δ15n values of the soil om 25 46 0 82 and 5 49 1 78 were calculated from 52 soil samples collected in the prd region the δ13c and δ15n characteristics of phytoplankton 30 42 0 62 and 2 05 1 45 were calculated from 12 phytoplankton samples collected during the sampling period the δ13c and δ15n characteristics of sewage derived om were collected from literature references the principles of literature reference selection included the following 1 the characteristics of sewage discharge was similar to study region and 2 the nitrogen isotopic signatures of sewage derived om were similar to the δ15n nh4 values of samples in this study in the study region the dominant sewage in the dj river bj river and xj river was derived from domestic sewage which was characterized with high δ15n nh4 values 10 to 20 however in the gz channel industrial wastewater with low δ15n nh4 value 14 to 5 was the dominant sewage source xuan et al 2020 thus the δ13c and δ15n values of sewage derived om 29 03 0 4 and 17 1 54 obtained from the literature schmidt et al 2018 were used to calculate the source apportionments in the dj river bj river and xj river the δ13c and δ15n values of sewage derived om 29 03 0 4 and 1 5 1 54 obtained from the literature de carvalho et al 2019 were used to calculate the source apportionments in the gz channel the fractionation factors for all sources were set to zero cjk 0 in eq 1 because corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors were not conducted and no significant isotope fraction signals were observed in this study 2 4 2 statistical analysis all statistical tests were conducted using spss version 22 0 after testing for normality kolmogorov smirnoff test and homogeneity of variance levene test physiochemical parameters of river water t ph chl a no3 n and nh4 n concentrations poc contents pn contents and δ13c and δ15n values of the spm

varied significantly between different rivers p 0 01 during the wet season the pocspm content and the pnspm content in the gz channel were the highest with averages of 7 38 3 40 and 1 15 0 52 respectively followed by the dj river 5 84 1 20 and 0 83 0 21 respectively and bj river 3 69 1 43 and 0 45 0 18 respectively the xj river exhibited the lowest with averages of 3 04 0 60 and 0 44 0 25 respectively during the dry season the spatial variation patterns of the pocspm and pnspm contents were similar to that in the wet season and the pocspm and pnspm contents in the gz channel dj river bj river and xj river were 6 98 2 10 and 1 27 0 46 3 45 1 11 and 0 68 0 32 4 13 1 20 and 0 68 0 37 and 3 29 1 47 and 0 52 0 22 respectively both seasonal and spatial variations exhibited significantly altered c nspm ratios p 0 05 the δ13cspm and δ15nspm values exhibited significantly alterations in both seasonal and spatial variations p 0 01 during the wet season the average of δ13cspm value in the gz channel was the highest at 27 72 0 79 by contrast during the dry season the δ13cspm value in the gz channel was the lowest with an average of 30 08 1 33 except for the samples from the gz channel the δ15nspm values were significantlyincreased in the wet season compared with the dry season p 0 01 in the gz channel the average δ15nspm value was lower in the wet season 1 37 2 74 compared with the dry season 8 29 4 73 in the som pool the differences in the pocsom content pnsom content δ13csom and δ15nsom values between the dry season and wet season were not significantly different p 0 05 table

content in the gz channel 3 48 and 0 27 respectively were increased compared with the dj river 0 72 and 0 09 respectively bj river 1 37 and 0 12 respectively and xj river 1 05 and 0 08 respectively the average of δ13csom value was the highest in the bj river 26 63 followed by gz channel 26 73 and xj river 27 01 and the lowest values were noted in the dj river 27 46 the average of δ15nsom value was the highest in the dj river 8 18 followed by bj river 7 10 and xj river 6 98 and the lowest values were noted in the gz channel 3 97 3 3 source apportionments of organic matter in the spm and som pools in the prd region the contents of poc and pn were 4 70 2 36 and 0 75 0 44 respectively in the spm and 1 55 1 25 and 0 13 0 09 respectively in the som the difference in the poc and pn contents between the spm and som p 0 01 suggested that the vertical mixing of the water column was poor and source distributions of the spm and som were different in the spm pool the poc and pn contents were increased compared with that in the soils 1 98 1 26 for poc and 0 14 0 08 for pn p 0 01 indicating that not only soil om but also om from other sources resulting in a mixing om sources contributed to the spatial and temporal changes in the spm in the prd in the som pool the contents of poc and pn in the som were similar or slightly lower than that in the soils this finding implies that soil om was preferentially deposited and represents the dominant source contributing to the som to quantify the relative contributions om from multiple sources that contributed to the spm and som three potential sources including soil om sewage derived om and phytoplankton were considered based on typical δ13c and δ15n values fig 3 the siar mixing model outputs of the proportional contributions are presented in fig 4 in the spm pool the source apportionment pattern exhibited significant seasonal variations p 0 01 during the wet season sewage derived om average 55 was the predominant source however during the dry season phytoplankton became the greatest contributor 51 spatial variations were also observed in spm source apportionments fig 4 the contribution from soil om was increased in the bj river 32 and 50 in the wet and dry seasons respectively and xj river 37 and 41 compared with the dj river 8 and 28 in contrast the contribution from sewage derived om was increased in the dj river 83 and 23 compared with the bj river 57 and 5 and xj river 40 and 12 in addition in the dry season the contribution from phytoplankton was higher in the gz channel 65 compared with the dj river 49 bj river 45 and xj river 47 in the som pool no significant seasonal variation was noted in the source apportionment p 0 05 during both the wet and dry seasons the soil om source was the greatest contributor sewage derived om was the second and phytoplankton contributed the least fig 4 som source apportionments were different between rivers the proportion of soil om was greater in the bj river 70 and 69 and xj river 63 and 67 compared with the gz channel 62 and 62 and dj river 54 and 45 in contrast the proportion of sewage derived om was increased in the gz channel 25 and 26 and dj river 27 and 32 compared with the bj river 16 and 19 and xj river 15 and 18 4 discussion 4 1 influences of urbanization and hydrology on source apportionments of organic matter 4 1 1 spatial patterns and urbanization the land use changes influence the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems such as quality of water bodies nutrient loading and organic matter distribution el khoury et al 2015 zorzal almeida et al 2018 the effects of different land use on the organic matter source apportionments in the water are also expected to be detectable liang et al 2011 povilaitis 2008 in the prd region sewage derived om was identified as the dominant source in the spm especially in the wet season recording a proportional contribution as high as 55 this proportion was greater than those reported in agricultural watersheds such as the beijiang river 27 xuan et al 2019 and the abujiao river 38 lu et al 2016 in china and the sava river 14 20 in slovenia ogrinc et al 2008 in addition the contribution from sewage derived om in this study area was even greater than those reported in some urbanized rivers such as an urban river in beijing 10 42 liu et al 2019 the high proportion of sewage derived om contributed to the spm in the prd region is a clear indication of the dominance of domestic sewage discharge on the spm which was related to high degree of urbanization the prd region is one of the most urbanized areas in china and its urbanized area accounts for approximately 80 of the total area hui et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 in addition the region experience a dense population a rapid economic growth and a massive waste water discharge aquatic ecosystems surrounded by urbanized areas are associated with increased nutrients and organic matter concentrations sourced mainly from discharge of domestic effluents tromboni and dodds 2017 thus urbanization would increase the contribution of sewage derived om in the spm pool the spatial variation in source contributions in the spm pool of the prd region could provide further evidence that urbanization was the controlling factor in this study in addition to urbanized land area three indicators including population density gross domestic product gdp and total volume of waste water were used to indicate the degree of urbanization and higher values of these indicators suggested a higher degree of urbanization of note the levels of urbanized indicators were higher in the gz channel and dj river compared with the bj river and xj river table s2 and this factor together with an increased proportion of sewage derived om contributed to the spm fig 4 this finding indicated that a higher degree of urbanization is proportional to accelerated human activities and increased sewage discharges which consequently affects source distribution in the spm pool overall our results suggested that the increased proportion of sewage derived om that contributed to the spm was associated with high degree of urbanization and that spm could be used as an indicator of the progress of urbanization in the som pool the contribution of sewage derived om ranged from 15 to 32 indicating that the som reflects the urbanized sewage discharge furthermore the contributions of sewage derived om in the som exhibited spatial variations with higher proportions in the dj river 30 and gz channel 25 and lower proportions in the bj river 18 and xj river 16 this finding was related to higher urbanized land area in the dj river and gz channel table s2 indicating that the som could also be used as an indicator of levels of urbanization however the contribution of soil om was greater in the som pool than that in the spm pool this finding is attributed to the fact that the spm reflects the impacts of current urbanization but the som is the result of the accumulation of regional deposits including particulate organic matter from low urbanized region generally most soil om sources are derived from natural and agricultural lands zorzal almeida et al 2018 and are mainly affected by soil erosion garzon garcia et al 2017 under the urbanization the following features are noted 1 land use has changed to more paved surfaces and built areas whereas bare soil lawns and paved areas cover soil is rare resulting in reduced erosion dodds and whiles 2004 2 infrastructure construction increased e g large amounts of water move to rivers through engineered structures and construction of levee would decrease soil erosion kaushal and belt 2012 therefore urbanization reduces soil om in the som pool due to increased paved and built areas 4 1 2 temporal patterns and runoff land use urbanization is the original factor affecting the spatial variation in source apportionments of organic matter among regions and runoff is the driving force for organic matter source discharge into the river water liu et al 2017 runoff exhibits significant control on the migration transformation and distribution of particulate organic matter tesi et al 2013 ye et al 2017 in this study the source apportionment pattern exhibited significant variation between seasons in the spm pool p 0 01 fig 4a and b suggesting that seasonal change in runoff was the major factor controlling the seasonal spm source distribution during the wet season sewage derived om was the dominant source that contributed to the spm fig 4a indicating that high runoff increased sewage fluxes in the urbanized area in contrast our previous study in the beijiang river with low urbanization which is located in the upstream of the prd region revealed that soil om was the major source of the spm during the wet season due to intense precipitation high discharge and increased soil erosion xuan et al 2019 compared with our previous study region the prd region is a larger scale region of human activity that received sewage and effluents from diffuse sources di lascio et al 2013 liu et al 2019 in addition levee construction and the rarity of bare soil in the prd region would decrease soil erosion dodds and whiles 2004 leading to high sewage discharge into rivers due to increased runoff during the wet season ke et al 2019 thus in the urbanized rivers the signal of anthropogenic activity due to urbanization was recorded in the spm and this signal was more obvious during the wet season due to increased runoff during the dry season phytoplankton was recognized as the dominant source that contributed to the spm fig 4b this result was similar to our previous study results indicating that the contribution from phytoplankton was greater spm in the dry season than that in the wet season xuan et al 2019 during the dry season longer residence times and increased light intensity due to lower river discharge could give rise to phytoplankton production li et al 2017 however a high discharge during the wet season resulted in a shorter residence time weaker incident light and increased turbidity in the river water causing a reduction in aquatic plant growth huang et al 2004 lu and gan 2015 therefore runoff was the crucial factor affecting seasonal variation in the spm source apportionments high runoff resulted in increased sewage derived om contribution in the wet season and low rainfall and water discharge provided a beneficial environment for phytoplankton growth and resulted in an increase in phytoplankton contribution in the dry season in contrast with the spm pool source apportionment patterns in the som pool were characterized by subtle variations between two sampling seasons and soil om provided the greatest contribution fig 4c and d these findings suggested that the impacts of precipitation and runoff on the som pool were not obvious two reasons can be invoked to explain this result first no significant relationship of the isotope values was noted between the spm and som indicating poor vertical mixing of the water column and deposition from suspended particles ye et al 2016 second most sources of the som are derived from recalcitrant terrestrial organic matter which are characterized by coarser particles thus these particles were more easily deposited and difficult to re suspend toonen et al 2015 therefore in the urbanized rivers runoff was an important factor affecting the source apportionments in the spm pool rather than the som pool 4 2 influences of urbanization and hydrology on transformations of carbon and nitrogen in particulate organic matter migration and transformation processes of spm in the river ecosystems include the following 1 exogenous source input 2 migration with runoff 3 transformations of autochthonous production in the river 4 sedimentation and 5 re suspension as discussed above urbanization was the dominant factor affecting exogenous source input and runoff was the driving force for migration of the spm in the prd region no significant correlation in c and n isotopes is noted between these two phases p 0 05 and the source apportionments in the spm and som pools were different these results indicated poor vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation re suspension processes between the spm and som were not dominant processes thus the transformation of autochthonous production phytoplankton is a key process of c and n transformation of particulate organic matter in the river ecosystems 4 2 1 c transformation processes photosynthesis of phytoplankton is the major process of carbon transformation in the river ecosystem and the process involves conversion of dissolved inorganic carbon dic to poc basu and mackey 2018 liu et al 2010 given that biological and physico chemical c transformation processes are associated with different degrees of isotopic fractionation the isotopic composition of the spm can provide information on the predominant processes raymond and bauer 2001 schulte et al 2011 it is well known that a fundamental factor affecting aqueous inorganic c dynamics and isotope fractionation of organic matter is primary productivity gu et al 2006 phytoplankton preferentially incorporates light 12c compared with heavy 13c during dic uptake when dic is abundant leading to a decrease in δ13c values of the spm choudhary et al 2009 phytoplankton productivity is represented as chl α concentrations in this study in the spm pool a significant negative correlation was observed between the δ13cspm value and chl α concentration fig 5 a however in the som pool no significant correlation was found between the δ13csom value and chl α concentration fig 5b this finding suggested that the degree of phytoplankton growth that associated with c transformation could be reflected by carbon isotopes in the spm rather than the som specially the correlations between the δ13cspm values and chl α concentrations were different between seasons the δ13cspm values were significantly negatively correlated with chl α concentrations during the dry season fig 5d but no significant correlation was noted between δ13cspm values and chl α concentrations during the wet season fig 5c this finding indicated that seasonal variation in the degree of phytoplankton photosynthesis during the dry season increased light intensity due to decreased precipitation and lower turbidity was favourable for phytoplankton growth however during the wet season large sewage discharge and lower light intensity limited the growth of phytoplankton thus phytoplankton photosynthesis might be the dominant c transformation process during the dry season however the δ13cspm values in the wet season were influenced by the riverine input and not by phytoplankton growth in addition the results of the spm source apportionments showed that phytoplankton contributed the greatest proportion 51 during the dry season which provided further evidence that phytoplankton photosynthesis was recognized as the dominant c transformation therefore seasonal change in hydrology was considered as a non negligible factor affecting c transformations in the river ecosystems of note significant spatial variation in δ13cspm values p 0 01 were noted with lower values in the gz channel than that in the dj river bj river and xj river during the dry season fig 2 in addition a significant correlation was observed between the δ13cspm values and chl α concentrations in the gz channel during the dry season these results might be related to the high degree of urbanization and increased human activities during the dry season no3 concentrations were significantly increased in the gz channel compared with the other rivers suggesting that increased volume of sewage discharged to rivers provided sufficient nutrients for phytoplankton growth therefore sewage discharge due to urbanization could promote phytoplankton growth and facilitate c transformations in river ecosystems 4 2 2 n transformation processes assimilation is recognized as the major process of particulate organic n transformation which is the process of inorganic n e g no3 and nh4 uptake by phytoplankton and affects the isotopic compositions of n in the river ecosystems denk et al 2017 deutsch et al 2009 york et al 2007 assimilation processes could cause a decrease in the δ15n of produced organic n and an increase in the δ15n of remaining inorganic n due to preferential uptake of lighter isotopes 14n by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 in the prd region the δ15nspm values were significantly negatively correlated with nh4 concentration during the wet season fig 6 b however no significant correlation was observed between δ15nspm values and no3 concentrations fig 6a this finding indicates that assimilation might occur during the wet season and that phytoplankton preferred to take up nh4 in addition a significant correlation between δ15nspm and δ15n nh4 values during the wet season was reported in our previous study xuan et al 2020 providing additional evidence that nh4 assimilation by phytoplankton was the dominant process of particulate organic n transformation in the wet season the major reason was that increased precipitation and runoff during the wet season resulted in an increased volume of sewage discharge in urban rivers which provided sufficient n sources for phytoplankton assimilation thus urban runoff sewage inputs would be the main driving force for n transformation of the spm the present results showed that δ15nspm values in the gz channel 1 37 2 34 were significantly lower compared with other rivers fig 2 these results were dissimilar to those in other rivers of this study and those in water receiving treated sewage inputs the highly depleted δ15nspm values were similar to those reported in the dan ao river 0 which received hypereutrophic sewage water ke et al 2019 in sewage pollution from the moa point treatment station 2 3 0 2 in new zealand rogers 2003 and in primary sewage effluent 0 from darwin australia munksgaard et al 2016 in addition significant correlations between δ15nspm values and nh4 concentrations were found in the gz channel during both wet and dry seasons fig 6c these results might be related to a larger volume of sewage discharge in the gz channel which was associated with dense urbanized population and rapid urban development in guangzhou city table s2 the highly depleted δ15nspm values in the gz channel during the wet season were also related to n transformations first in the gz channel nh4 n was the primary component of din which contributed to more than 60 of the din indicating that the river water was likely to be hypereutrophic tucker et al 1999 and nh4 was the primary form of nitrogen assimilation by phytoplankton schmidt et al 2018 second the δ15n values of nh4 in the gz channel were lower than that reported in our previous study xuan et al 2020 and this δ15n depleted nh4 was converted into an organic form by phytoplankton leading to subsequent decreases in δ15n of organic matter therefore our data suggested that changes in the riverine environment due to urbanization would affect n transformation which was recorded by characteristics of nitrogen isotopes in the om 5 conclusions the deltaic and coastal region is characterized by a high degree of urbanization and is a key pathway for the transport of nutrients to the coastal zone and oceans thus studying sources and transformations of the om in this region is of significance to understand c and n cycles in the aquatic ecosystems in this study c and n isotopes of the spm and som were measured in the prd region to investigate the effects of urbanization and runoff on source apportionments and transformations of the om the results indicated that urbanization was the original reason causing spatial variation in source apportionments of the om a high degree of urbanization would increase the contribution of sewage derived om in the spm pool and decrease the proportion of soil om in the som pool runoff was the major factor affecting the seasonal variation in the spm source apportionment pattern during the wet season sewage derived om was the major source contributed to the spm during the dry season phytoplankton exhibited the greatest contribution in addition c and n transformation processes were also affected by urbanization and runoff increased light intensity due to decreased precipitation and runoff facilitate phytoplankton growth and c transformations a greater volume of sewage discharge due to urbanization could provide sufficient n sources for phytoplankton assimilation which promoted n transformations therefore the data in this study suggested that urbanization and hydrology were important factors in the sources and transformations of the om in the river ecosystems and the influence of these factors was recorded in the spm and som pool credit authorship contribution statement

5119,the deltaic and coastal region is an important area for transportation production and transformation of organic matter om however the high degree of urbanization and seasonal variability of runoff in this region significantly impact source apportionments and biogeochemical processes of the om in this study stable isotopes of carbon c and nitrogen n in both suspended particulate matter spm and sedimentary organic matter som were measured in the highly urbanized pearl river delta prd china the results revealed that source apportionments exhibited spatial variations due to different degrees of urbanization and seasonal variations due to seasonal changes in runoff high urbanization could increase the contribution of sewage derived om in the spm and decrease the proportion of soil om in the som increased precipitation and runoff during wet season could result in a greater contribution of sewage derived om 55 and decreased runoff during the dry season resulted in an increased proportion of phytoplankton 51 in the spm urbanization and runoff also affected c and n transformation processes of om an increased volume of sewage discharge due to urbanization provided nutrients for phytoplankton growth promoting photosynthesis and assimilation processes increased light intensity due to decreased precipitation and runoff during the dry season could facilitate photosynthesis by phytoplankton this study suggested that om could record the impacts of urbanization and hydrology on c and n transformation processes in the rivers further improving knowledge on the c and n cycling processes in highly urbanized river ecosystems keywords particulate organic matter urbanization carbon nitrogen isotope 1 introduction organic matter om is an important component of particulate om which is present as suspended particulate matter spm and sedimentary organic matter som in the river ecosystems the particulate om consists of multiple sources including allochthonous inputs e g soil om c3 and c4 plants and sewage derived om and autochthonous production e g phytoplankton dalu et al 2016 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2019 and thus provides integrated information of natural and human activities lambert et al 2017 wang et al 2020 in addition particulate om is composed of nutrients organic micro pollutants and heavy metals particulate om could play a key role in exchange transport and recycling of elements turner and millward 2002 uher et al 2001 zhu et al 2018 and could reveal biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems rose et al 2018 ye et al 2017 thus identifying the relative contributions of particulate om from multiple sources and investigating its transformation processes are crucial steps to understand om biogeochemistry in aquatic ecosystems the deltaic and coastal region is a key pathway for the transport of nutrients from land to the coastal zone and oceans as well as a main repository of om delivered by rivers ni et al 2008 at least half the world s population resides in the deltaic and coastal zone thus human activities put considerable stress on nutrient cycling ache et al 2015 paerl et al 2010 walker and schafran 2015 human activities including intensive agriculture urbanization and industrial expansion in the deltaic river basins have significantly increased nutrient sediment and other pollutant loads in these waters resulting in an unprecedented pressure on ecological condition and sustainability of downstream riverine estuarine and coastal waters conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2014a scavia and bricker 2006 in addition hydrological modifications e g seasonal variation of runoff alter rates of water flow and sedimentation leading to changes in estuarine water environments paerl et al 2014b reyna et al 2017 under hydrological and anthropogenic pressures complex circulation and mixing patterns produce spatiotemporally heterogeneous conditions for phytoplankton growth and thus have great impacts on source apportionment of om and biogeochemical processes of carbon c and nitrogen n cycling in the aquatic ecosystems liénart et al 2018 pitt et al 2018 ray et al 2018 therefore it is essential to understand how human activity and hydrological variation affect the origin distribution and fate of om in the deltaic and coastal region the pearl river delta prd region is a large deltaic and coastal system consisting of a collection of numerous tributaries over the past three decades the prd region has experienced rapid urbanization and extensive agricultural development lu et al 2009 tan et al 2016 especially in 2016 the china state council first highlighted the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba to reactivate the megacity region and strengthen the booming nature of the prd hui et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 given the high attention provided by the government and its rapid development the prd region has become the most important region of economic growth and technological innovation in china for example in 2017 this region was responsible for 13 of the national gross domestic product gdp with only 1 of the country s land area zhou et al 2018 the fast growing economy and rapid urbanization resulted in the release of heavy loads of anthropogenic waste water into the river ecosystem lu et al 2009 tan et al 2016 in addition anthropogenic organic pollutants could affect the phytoplankton growth in the river and be transported with particulate matters to coastal waters and eventually to the oceans numerous of studies have investigated the origin abundance and bioavailability of dissolved nutrients and organic matters in the pearl river estuary guo et al 2019 2015 he et al 2010 ye et al 2017 2016 however few studies have been conducted to investigate the impacts of urbanization and hydrological variation on the temporal and spatial patterns of spm and som in rivers of the prd region ou et al 2019 xu et al 2019 ye et al 2016 as c and n bearing matter maintains the isotopic signatures of their sources or alters their isotopic characteristics during transformation processes the stable isotopic compositions of c and n in the om can be treated as an effective method to trace multiple sources and identify predominant processes for instance aquatic plants generally exhibit depleted δ13c values approximately 30 relative to terrestrial soils approximately 25 lu et al 2016 ogrinc et al 2008 and sewage derived om typically has higher δ15n value liu et al 2019 munksgaard et al 2016 in addition c and n transformation processes can leave distinguishable signatures in isotopic composition of the om for example the photosynthesis process can lead to a decrease in the δ13c value of phytoplankton choudhary et al 2009 and assimilation processes can cause a decrease in δ15n of produced organic n and an increase in δ15n of remaining inorganic n granger et al 2004 therefore in this study we measured the isotopes of carbon c and nitrogen n of the spm and som for different seasons in the prd region and quantified source apportionments of the om the aim of this study is to retrieve the impact of urbanization and seasonal change of runoff on source apportionments and transformation processes of the om based on the c and n isotopic record 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the prd region is located in southern china and is comprised of rich watercourses and wetlands that are connected to the south china sea scs via eight major riverine runoff outlets fig 1 the annual mean temperature is approximately 20 25 c and annual mean precipitation ranges between 1600 and 2000 mm du et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 the region is located in the subtropical zone and within the transitional zone of the east asian monsoon system with warm and humid summer monsoon and cool and dry winter monsoon resulting in highly seasonal variation in water discharge and particulate organic matter load to the estuary ou et al 2019 ye et al 2017 during the wet season april to september high precipitation 1761 5 mm guangdong water resources bulletin 2018 results in high runoff and increased loading of suspended particulate ou et al 2019 yu et al 2010 during the dry season october to march the water column is well mixed and the suspended particulate is beneficial for deposition due to the effect of low precipitation 343 0 mm guangdong water resources bulletin 2018 and reduced river discharge ye et al 2017 as one of the most prosperous regions in china the prd region has experienced explosive economic growth over the last 20 years resulting in a rapid urbanization and a substantial increase in population liu et al 2018 the region consists of nine cities including guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan huizhou dongguan zhongshan jiangmen and zhaoqing in the guangdong province china fig 1 the resident population has been estimated at 56 90 million people and guangzhou shenzhen foshan and dongguan encompass more than 70 of the population in the prd region tan et al 2016 due to the dense population and growing urbanization sewage inputs have increased markedly in recent decades causing frequent eutrophication and deteriorative water quality chen et al 2019 strokal et al 2015 therefore in the prd region river water receives high loads of organic matter and nutrients due to intensive urbanization causing a profound effect on the chemistry and biology of the river system and strongly influencing the sources and cycling of the spm and som pools 2 2 sample collection based on the precipitation and discharge sampling campaigns were conducted during the dry season in march 2018 and wet season in september 2018 during each sampling period surface water and spm samples were collected from 58 sampling sites including 14 sampling sites in the guangzhou gz channel of the pearl river 15 sampling sites in the dongjiang dj river 13 sampling sites in the beijiang bj river and 16 sampling sites in the xijiang xj river fig 1 at each sampling site surface water samples 0 5 m below the air water interface were collected with a flow through water sampling bottom 4 l the spm samples were collected by vacuum filtration through glass fibre filters whatman gf f 47 mm in diameter in the field and stored in cooling boxes in the dark at 4 c before they were immediately transferred to the laboratory for further analyses hoang et al 2018 river bed sediment samples were collected from 35 sampling sites during each sampling period fig 1 the river bed sediment was collected using a sediment grab after sampling all sediment samples were packed in a clean plastic bag and stored in cooling boxes before being transported to the laboratory for further analyses samples of the potential organic matter sources soil om and phytoplankton were also collected soil samples 35 sites were collected along the mainstream fig 1 all soil samples were packed in a clean plastic bag and stored in cooling boxes before being transported to the laboratory for further analyses the samples of phytoplankton were collected from 12 sampling sites which were located at the upstream of rivers fig 1 because these samples were less polluted by urbanization and could represent the phytoplankton sources of the om phytoplankton samples were collected by a plankton net with a 64 μm mesh filtered using 100 l water samples were collected in the field cai et al 2019 phytoplankton samples were stored in cooling boxes in the dark at 4 c before they were immediately transferred to the laboratory for further analyses 2 3 analysis method field parameters for water samples including temperature t ph and chlorophyll a chl a were measured in situ using portable multiparameter equipment ysi exo2 that was calibrated before the measurement the concentrations of nitrate n no3 n and ammonium n nh4 n were analysed by continuous flow injection analyser ams alliance integral futura frepillon france with the detection limits of 0 02 mg l 1 for no3 n and 0 03 mg l 1 for nh4 n spm sediment soil and phytoplankton samples were freeze dried at 80 c for 72 h the dried samples were then ground in an agate grinder and sieved through a 0 149 mm mesh for further analysis li et al 2019 prior to analysis of contents and isotopes of c any possible inorganic carbonates were removed from the samples by acidification with 0 5 mol l 1 hcl and the samples were then rinsed with de ionized water until the filtrate ph was neutral yamamuro and kayanne 1995 the contents of pn and poc for all samples were analysed by using an elemental analyser elemental vario macro cube stable isotopic analysis δ13c and δ15n of all samples were measured using an elemental analyser flash ea2000 thermo fisher and mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermo fisher the analytical precisions for δ13c and δ15n were 0 02 and 0 2 respectively all laboratory analyses were made in the laboratory of school of environmental science and engineering sun yat sen university stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta δ notation as follows 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample and rstandard are sample and standard for

statistical analysis 2 4 1 source apportionments calculation to quantify the contributions from multiple sources in the spm and som pools a bayesian stable isotope mixing model stable isotopic analysis in r siar was used based on c and n isotopes parnell and jackson 2010 semmens et al 2009 the siar model can be expressed as follows x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 2 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 i and j 1 2 3 j sjk is the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk is the proportion of source k which needs to be estimated by siar model cjk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with mean λjk and standard deviation τij and εij is the residual error representing the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation σj a detailed description of this model can be found in the literatures jackson et al 2011 parnell and jackson 2010 to estimate the spm and som sources in different seasons δ13c and δ15n j 2 and three potential sources soil om sewage derived om and phytoplankton were considered the δ13c and δ15n values of the soil om 25 46 0 82 and 5 49 1 78 were calculated from 52 soil samples collected in the prd region the δ13c and δ15n characteristics of phytoplankton 30 42 0 62 and 2 05 1 45 were calculated from 12 phytoplankton samples collected during the sampling period the δ13c and δ15n characteristics of sewage derived om were collected from literature references the principles of literature reference selection included the following 1 the characteristics of sewage discharge was similar to study region and 2 the nitrogen isotopic signatures of sewage derived om were similar to the δ15n nh4 values of samples in this study in the study region the dominant sewage in the dj river bj river and xj river was derived from domestic sewage which was characterized with high δ15n nh4 values 10 to 20 however in the gz channel industrial wastewater with low δ15n nh4 value 14 to 5 was the dominant sewage source xuan et al 2020 thus the δ13c and δ15n values of sewage derived om 29 03 0 4 and 17 1 54 obtained from the literature schmidt et al 2018 were used to calculate the source apportionments in the dj river bj river and xj river the δ13c and δ15n values of sewage derived om 29 03 0 4 and 1 5 1 54 obtained from the literature de carvalho et al 2019 were used to calculate the source apportionments in the gz channel the fractionation factors for all sources were set to zero cjk 0 in eq 1 because corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors were not conducted and no significant isotope fraction signals were observed in this study 2 4 2 statistical analysis all statistical tests were conducted using spss version 22 0 after testing for normality kolmogorov smirnoff test and homogeneity of variance levene test physiochemical parameters of river water t ph chl a no3 n and nh4 n concentrations poc contents pn contents and δ13c and δ15n values of the spm

significant spatial variation p 0 05 but no significant seasonal variation p 0 05 the no3 n and nh4 n concentrations varied significantly among different rivers p 0 01 with higher concentrations in the gz channel 3 2 c and n contents and isotopes in the spm and som pools the statistical characteristics of the contents and isotopic values of c and n in the spm and som pools are presented in table 1 and fig 2 in the spm pool no significant differences in the pnspm content and the pocspm content were detected between the dry and wet seasons p 0 05 however the pocspm content and the pnspm content varied significantly between different rivers p 0 01 during the wet season the pocspm content and the pnspm content in the gz channel were the highest with averages of 7 38 3 40 and 1 15 0 52 respectively followed by the dj river 5 84 1 20 and 0 83 0 21 respectively and bj river 3 69 1 43 and 0 45 0 18 respectively the xj river exhibited the lowest with averages of 3 04 0 60 and 0 44 0 25 respectively during the dry season the spatial variation patterns of the pocspm and pnspm contents were similar to that in the wet season and the pocspm and pnspm contents in the gz channel dj river bj river and xj river were 6 98 2 10 and 1 27 0 46 3 45 1 11 and 0 68 0 32 4 13 1 20 and 0 68 0 37 and 3 29 1 47 and 0 52 0 22 respectively both seasonal and spatial variations exhibited significantly altered c nspm ratios p 0 05 the δ13cspm and δ15nspm values exhibited significantly alterations in both seasonal and spatial variations p 0 01 during the wet season the average of δ13cspm value in the gz channel was the highest at 27 72 0 79 by contrast during the dry season the δ13cspm value in the gz channel was the lowest with an average of 30 08 1 33 except for the samples from the gz channel the δ15nspm values were significantlyincreased in the wet season compared with the dry season p 0 01 in the gz channel the average δ15nspm value was lower in the wet season 1 37 2 74 compared with the dry season 8 29 4 73 in the som pool the differences in the pocsom content pnsom content δ13csom and δ15nsom values between the dry season and wet season were not significantly different p 0 05 table 1 however significant spatial variations were noted in the pocsom content pnsom content δ13csom and δ15nsom values among different rivers p 0 05 table 1 the averages of the pocsom content and pnsom content in the gz channel 3 48 and 0 27 respectively were increased compared with the dj river 0 72 and 0 09 respectively bj river 1 37 and 0 12 respectively and xj river 1 05 and 0 08 respectively the average of δ13csom value was the highest in the bj river 26 63 followed by gz channel 26 73 and xj river 27 01 and the lowest values were noted in the dj river 27 46 the average of δ15nsom value was the highest in the dj river 8 18 followed by bj river 7 10 and xj river 6 98 and the lowest values were noted in the gz channel 3 97 3 3 source apportionments of organic matter in the spm and som pools in the prd region the contents of poc and pn were 4 70 2 36 and 0 75 0 44 respectively in the spm and 1 55 1 25 and 0 13 0 09 respectively in the som the difference in the poc and pn contents between the spm and som p 0 01 suggested that the vertical mixing of the water column was poor and source distributions of the spm and som were different in the spm pool the poc and pn contents were increased compared with that in the soils 1 98 1 26 for poc and 0 14 0 08 for pn p 0 01 indicating that not only soil om but also om from other sources resulting in a mixing om sources contributed to the spatial and temporal changes in the spm in the prd in the som pool the contents of poc and pn in the som were similar or slightly lower than that in the soils this finding implies that soil om was preferentially deposited and represents the dominant source contributing to the som to quantify the relative contributions om from multiple sources that contributed to the spm and som three potential sources including soil om sewage derived om and phytoplankton were considered based on typical δ13c and δ15n values fig 3 the siar mixing model outputs of the proportional contributions are presented in fig 4 in the spm pool the source apportionment pattern exhibited significant seasonal variations p 0 01 during the wet season sewage derived om average 55 was the predominant source however during the dry season phytoplankton became the greatest contributor 51 spatial variations were also observed in spm source apportionments fig 4 the contribution from soil om was increased in the bj river 32 and 50 in the wet and dry seasons respectively and xj river 37 and 41 compared with the dj river 8 and 28 in contrast the contribution from sewage derived om was increased in the dj river 83 and 23 compared with the bj river 57 and 5 and xj river 40 and 12 in addition in the dry season the contribution from phytoplankton was higher in the gz channel 65 compared with the dj river 49 bj river 45 and xj river 47 in the som pool no significant seasonal variation was noted in the source apportionment p 0 05 during both the wet and dry seasons the soil om source was the greatest contributor sewage derived om was the second and phytoplankton contributed the least fig 4 som source apportionments were different between rivers the proportion of soil om was greater in the bj river 70 and 69 and xj river 63 and 67 compared with the gz channel 62 and 62 and dj river 54 and 45 in contrast the proportion of sewage derived om was increased in the gz channel 25 and 26 and dj river 27 and 32 compared with the bj river 16 and 19 and xj river 15 and 18 4 discussion 4 1 influences of urbanization and hydrology on source apportionments of organic matter 4 1 1 spatial patterns and urbanization the land use changes influence the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems such as quality of water bodies nutrient loading and organic matter distribution el khoury et al 2015 zorzal almeida et al 2018 the effects of different land use on the organic matter source apportionments in the water are also expected to be detectable liang et al 2011 povilaitis 2008 in the prd region sewage derived om was identified as the dominant source in the spm especially in the wet season recording a proportional contribution as high as 55 this proportion was greater than those reported in agricultural watersheds such as the beijiang river 27 xuan et al 2019 and the abujiao river 38 lu et al 2016 in china and the sava river 14 20 in slovenia ogrinc et al 2008 in addition the contribution from sewage derived om in this study area was even greater than those reported in some urbanized rivers such as an urban river in beijing 10 42 liu et al 2019 the high proportion of sewage derived om contributed to the spm in the prd region is a clear indication of the dominance of domestic sewage discharge on the spm which was related to high degree of urbanization the prd region is one of the most urbanized areas in china and its urbanized area accounts for approximately 80 of the total area hui et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 in addition the region experience a dense population a rapid economic growth and a massive waste water discharge aquatic ecosystems surrounded by urbanized areas are associated with increased nutrients and organic matter concentrations sourced mainly from discharge of domestic effluents tromboni and dodds 2017 thus urbanization would increase the contribution of sewage derived om in the spm pool the spatial variation in source contributions in the spm pool of the prd region could provide further evidence that urbanization was the controlling factor in this study in addition to urbanized land area three indicators including population density gross domestic product gdp and total volume of waste water were used to indicate the degree of urbanization and higher values of these indicators suggested a higher degree of urbanization of note the levels of urbanized indicators were higher in the gz channel and dj river compared with the bj river and xj river table s2 and this factor together with an increased proportion of sewage derived om contributed to the spm fig 4 this finding indicated that a higher degree of urbanization is proportional to accelerated human activities and increased sewage discharges which consequently affects source distribution in the spm pool overall our results suggested that the increased proportion of sewage derived om that contributed to the spm was associated with high degree of urbanization and that spm could be used as an indicator of the progress of urbanization in the som pool the contribution of sewage derived om ranged from 15 to 32 indicating that the som reflects the urbanized sewage discharge furthermore the contributions of sewage derived om in the som exhibited spatial variations with higher proportions in the dj river 30 and gz channel 25 and lower proportions in the bj river 18 and xj river 16 this finding was related to higher urbanized land area in the dj river and gz channel table s2 indicating that the som could also be used as an indicator of levels of urbanization however the contribution of soil om was greater in the som pool than that in the spm pool this finding is attributed to the fact that the spm reflects the impacts of current urbanization but the som is the result of the accumulation of regional deposits including particulate organic matter from low urbanized region generally most soil om sources are derived from natural and agricultural lands zorzal almeida et al 2018 and are mainly affected by soil erosion garzon garcia et al 2017 under the urbanization the following features are noted 1 land use has changed to more paved surfaces and built areas whereas bare soil lawns and paved areas cover soil is rare resulting in reduced erosion dodds and whiles 2004 2 infrastructure construction increased e g large amounts of water move to rivers through engineered structures and construction of levee would decrease soil erosion kaushal and belt 2012 therefore urbanization reduces soil om in the som pool due to increased paved and built areas 4 1 2 temporal patterns and runoff land use urbanization is the original factor affecting the spatial variation in source apportionments of organic matter among regions and runoff is the driving force for organic matter source discharge into the river water liu et al 2017 runoff exhibits significant control on the migration transformation and distribution of particulate organic matter tesi et al 2013 ye et al 2017 in this study the source apportionment pattern exhibited significant variation between seasons in the spm pool p 0 01 fig 4a and b suggesting that seasonal change in runoff was the major factor controlling the seasonal spm source distribution during the wet season sewage derived om was the dominant source that contributed to the spm fig 4a indicating that high runoff increased sewage fluxes in the urbanized area in contrast our previous study in the beijiang river with low urbanization which is located in the upstream of the prd region revealed that soil om was the major source of the spm during the wet season due to intense precipitation high discharge and increased soil erosion xuan et al 2019 compared with our previous study region the prd region is a larger scale region of human activity that received sewage and effluents from diffuse sources di lascio et al 2013 liu et al 2019 in addition levee construction and the rarity of bare soil in the prd region would decrease soil erosion dodds and whiles 2004 leading to high sewage discharge into rivers due to increased runoff during the wet season ke et al 2019 thus in the urbanized rivers the signal of anthropogenic activity due to urbanization was recorded in the spm and this signal was more obvious during the wet season due to increased runoff during the dry season phytoplankton was recognized as the dominant source that contributed to the spm fig 4b this result was similar to our previous study results indicating that the contribution from phytoplankton was greater spm in the dry season than that in the wet season xuan et al 2019 during the dry season longer residence times and increased light intensity due to lower river discharge could give rise to phytoplankton production li et al 2017 however a high discharge during the wet season resulted in a shorter residence time weaker incident light and increased turbidity in the river water causing a reduction in aquatic plant growth huang et al 2004 lu and gan 2015 therefore runoff was the crucial factor affecting seasonal variation in the spm source apportionments high runoff resulted in increased sewage derived om contribution in the wet season and low rainfall and water discharge provided a beneficial environment for phytoplankton growth and resulted in an increase in phytoplankton contribution in the dry season in contrast with the spm pool source apportionment patterns in the som pool were characterized by subtle variations between two sampling seasons and soil om provided the greatest contribution fig 4c and d these findings suggested that the impacts of precipitation and runoff on the som pool were not obvious two reasons can be invoked to explain this result first no significant relationship of the isotope values was noted between the spm and som indicating poor vertical mixing of the water column and deposition from suspended particles ye et al 2016 second most sources of the som are derived from recalcitrant terrestrial organic matter which are characterized by coarser particles thus these particles were more easily deposited and difficult to re suspend toonen et al 2015 therefore in the urbanized rivers runoff was an important factor affecting the source apportionments in the spm pool rather than the som pool 4 2 influences of urbanization and hydrology on transformations of carbon and nitrogen in particulate organic matter migration and transformation processes of spm in the river ecosystems include the following 1 exogenous source input 2 migration with runoff 3 transformations of autochthonous production in the river 4 sedimentation and 5 re suspension as discussed above urbanization was the dominant factor affecting exogenous source input and runoff was the driving force for migration of the spm in the prd region no significant correlation in c and n isotopes is noted between these two phases p 0 05 and the source apportionments in the spm and som pools were different these results indicated poor vertical mixing of the water column and sedimentation re suspension processes between the spm and som were not dominant processes thus the transformation of autochthonous production phytoplankton is a key process of c and n transformation of particulate organic matter in the river ecosystems 4 2 1 c transformation processes photosynthesis of phytoplankton is the major process of carbon transformation in the river ecosystem and the process involves conversion of dissolved inorganic carbon dic to poc basu and mackey 2018 liu et al 2010 given that biological and physico chemical c transformation processes are associated with different degrees of isotopic fractionation the isotopic composition of the spm can provide information on the predominant processes raymond and bauer 2001 schulte et al 2011 it is well known that a fundamental factor affecting aqueous inorganic c dynamics and isotope fractionation of organic matter is primary productivity gu et al 2006 phytoplankton preferentially incorporates light 12c compared with heavy 13c during dic uptake when dic is abundant leading to a decrease in δ13c values of the spm choudhary et al 2009 phytoplankton productivity is represented as chl α concentrations in this study in the spm pool a significant negative correlation was observed between the δ13cspm value and chl α concentration fig 5 a however in the som pool no significant correlation was found between the δ13csom value and chl α concentration fig 5b this finding suggested that the degree of phytoplankton growth that associated with c transformation could be reflected by carbon isotopes in the spm rather than the som specially the correlations between the δ13cspm values and chl α concentrations were different between seasons the δ13cspm values were significantly negatively correlated with chl α concentrations during the dry season fig 5d but no significant correlation was noted between δ13cspm values and chl α concentrations during the wet season fig 5c this finding indicated that seasonal variation in the degree of phytoplankton photosynthesis during the dry season increased light intensity due to decreased precipitation and lower turbidity was favourable for phytoplankton growth however during the wet season large sewage discharge and lower light intensity limited the growth of phytoplankton thus phytoplankton photosynthesis might be the dominant c transformation process during the dry season however the δ13cspm values in the wet season were influenced by the riverine input and not by phytoplankton growth in addition the results of the spm source apportionments showed that phytoplankton contributed the greatest proportion 51 during the dry season which provided further evidence that phytoplankton photosynthesis was recognized as the dominant c transformation therefore seasonal change in hydrology was considered as a non negligible factor affecting c transformations in the river ecosystems of note significant spatial variation in δ13cspm values p 0 01 were noted with lower values in the gz channel than that in the dj river bj river and xj river during the dry season fig 2 in addition a significant correlation was observed between the δ13cspm values and chl α concentrations in the gz channel during the dry season these results might be related to the high degree of urbanization and increased human activities during the dry season no3 concentrations were significantly increased in the gz channel compared with the other rivers suggesting that increased volume of sewage discharged to rivers provided sufficient nutrients for phytoplankton growth therefore sewage discharge due to urbanization could promote phytoplankton growth and facilitate c transformations in river ecosystems 4 2 2 n transformation processes assimilation is recognized as the major process of particulate organic n transformation which is the process of inorganic n e g no3 and nh4 uptake by phytoplankton and affects the isotopic compositions of n in the river ecosystems denk et al 2017 deutsch et al 2009 york et al 2007 assimilation processes could cause a decrease in the δ15n of produced organic n and an increase in the δ15n of remaining inorganic n due to preferential uptake of lighter isotopes 14n by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 in the prd region the δ15nspm values were significantly negatively correlated with nh4 concentration during the wet season fig 6 b however no significant correlation was observed between δ15nspm values and no3 concentrations fig 6a this finding indicates that assimilation might occur during the wet season and that phytoplankton preferred to take up nh4 in addition a significant correlation between δ15nspm and δ15n nh4 values during the wet season was reported in our previous study xuan et al 2020 providing additional evidence that nh4 assimilation by phytoplankton was the dominant process of particulate organic n transformation in the wet season the major reason was that increased precipitation and runoff during the wet season resulted in an increased volume of sewage discharge in urban rivers which provided sufficient n sources for phytoplankton assimilation thus urban runoff sewage inputs would be the main driving force for n transformation of the spm the present results showed that δ15nspm values in the gz channel 1 37 2 34 were significantly lower compared with other rivers fig 2 these results were dissimilar to those in other rivers of this study and those in water receiving treated sewage inputs the highly depleted δ15nspm values were similar to those reported in the dan ao river 0 which received hypereutrophic sewage water ke et al 2019 in sewage pollution from the moa point treatment station 2 3 0 2 in new zealand rogers 2003 and in primary sewage effluent 0 from darwin australia munksgaard et al 2016 in addition significant correlations between δ15nspm values and nh4 concentrations were found in the gz channel during both wet and dry seasons fig 6c these results might be related to a larger volume of sewage discharge in the gz channel which was associated with dense urbanized population and rapid urban development in guangzhou city table s2 the highly depleted δ15nspm values in the gz channel during the wet season were also related to n transformations first in the gz channel nh4 n was the primary component of din which contributed to more than 60 of the din indicating that the river water was likely to be hypereutrophic tucker et al 1999 and nh4 was the primary form of nitrogen assimilation by phytoplankton schmidt et al 2018 second the δ15n values of nh4 in the gz channel were lower than that reported in our previous study xuan et al 2020 and this δ15n depleted nh4 was converted into an organic form by phytoplankton leading to subsequent decreases in δ15n of organic matter therefore our data suggested that changes in the riverine environment due to urbanization would affect n transformation which was recorded by characteristics of nitrogen isotopes in the om 5 conclusions the deltaic and coastal region is characterized by a high degree of urbanization and is a key pathway for the transport of nutrients to the coastal zone and oceans thus studying sources and transformations of the om in this region is of significance to understand c and n cycles in the aquatic ecosystems in this study c and n isotopes of the spm and som were measured in the prd region to investigate the effects of urbanization and runoff on source apportionments and transformations of the om the results indicated that urbanization was the original reason causing spatial variation in source apportionments of the om a high degree of urbanization would increase the contribution of sewage derived om in the spm pool and decrease the proportion of soil om in the som pool runoff was the major factor affecting the seasonal variation in the spm source apportionment pattern during the wet season sewage derived om was the major source contributed to the spm during the dry season phytoplankton exhibited the greatest contribution in addition c and n transformation processes were also affected by urbanization and runoff increased light intensity due to decreased precipitation and runoff facilitate phytoplankton growth and c transformations a greater volume of sewage discharge due to urbanization could provide sufficient n sources for phytoplankton assimilation which promoted n transformations therefore the data in this study suggested that urbanization and hydrology were important factors in the sources and transformations of the om in the river ecosystems and the influence of these factors was recorded in the spm and som pool credit authorship contribution statement
