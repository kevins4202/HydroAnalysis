16515,the most common way to apply anammox for saline wastewater treatment is via salt adaptation of freshwater anammox bacteria fab to better apply this process in practice it s essential to understand the salt adaptation process of fba as well as the underlying mechanisms this study investigated the long term salt adaptation process of a fixed film fab culture in three reactors namely r1 r3 under salinities of 2 8 and 12 nacl g l correspondingly all three reactors were under stable operation and achieved 80 90 total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency throughout the 425 day operation period r1 servers as a blank control based on the clear microbial community shifts in r2 and r3 the operation period was divided into 2 phases during phase 1 all fab in the three reactors belonged to ca brocadia sp the anammox activity aa and the ratio of nitrite ammonium no2 n nh4 n consumption in r2 and r3 decreased with the increase of salinity and did not recover to the initial levels during phase 2 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp in r2 and r3 increased from nearly 0 to about 60 and 77 respectively with the growth of ca kuenenia sp the aa and stoichiometry of r2 and r3 gradually recovered aa of r2 and r3 both reached 1 0 g nh4 n l day at the end of this phase which was about 80 of that in r1 these results indicated that the salt adaptation of fab culture was

increases the salinity of municipal sewage in the meantime the global nacl market was about 314 million ton in 2018 and expected to witness an annual growth of 1 9 freedonia group 2019 owing to an increase in utilization of sodium chloride as a reagent for the chemical industry mainly the chloralkali sector petroleum textile pharmaceutical and leather industry lefebvre et al 2006 the amount of saline wastewater produced from these industries has also increased rapidly in the past decades due to the rising demands of food and industry and daily life products chen et al 2018 li and yang 2018 zhao et al 2020 these high salinity wastewaters often contain high concentrations of nitrogen based contaminants e g salinity and ammonium concentration of the municipal wastewater of hongkong a seawater toilet flushing city are about 5 g l and 40 100 mg n l respectively wu et al 2000 salinity and ammonium concentration of a mustard tuber wastewater are about 28 32 g l and 170 180 mg n l respectively chen et al 2016 salinity and ammonium concentration of a landfill leachate are about 13 30 g l and 1500 2400 mg n l respectively magrí et al 2021 without proper managed these saline wastewaters will result in eutrophication and deterioration of water quality ozturk and bal 2015 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox based wastewater treatment is a cost efficient biological nitrogen removal method and so has drawn a lot of attention over the past few decades this biotechnology which is suitable for low c n wastewater significantly lowers the oxygen and organic carbon demand nsenga kumwimba et al 2020 anammox bacteria belong to the planctomycetes phylum so far six genera of anammox bacteria in natural or engineered environments have been discovered namely ca anammoxoglobus ca anammoximicrobium ca brocadia ca kuenenia ca jettenia and ca scalindua as shown in table s2 the former five genera are mainly found in low salinity or freshwater environments and are called freshwater anammox bacteria fab only the final genus ca scalindua is mainly found in marine areas or other high salinity environments and is called marine anammox bacteria mab the dominant anammox bacteria in almost all full scale anammox based applications are enriched in low salt content water and belong to fab nsenga kumwimba et al 2020 hence the most common way to apply anammox in saline brackish wastewater treatment is via salt adaptation of the enriched fab giustinianovich et al 2018 jin et al 2011 the anammox bacteria are known as slow growing bacteria with a typical doubling time of 10 to 20 days schmid et al 2003 van niftrik et al 2008 hence the salt adaptation period for fab is potentially very long compared with the other biological processes still salt adaptation of fab has been demonstrated for example in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket anammox reactor it took 240 days operation to achieve stable performance at 12 g nacl l salinity with the total inorganic nitrogen tin removal rate of 86 2 at a tin loading rate of 0 258 g n l day chen et al 2015 in an oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification denitrification system after 180 days operation and increased salinity to 30 g nacl l anammox activity aa increased by 46 windey et al 2005 with 340 400 days operation period a fab has been acclimatized to 30 g nacl l and this salt adapted fab mainly belongs to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis ku2 kartal et al 2006 liu et al 2009 but what is not clear is the mechanism for the improved treatment capacity and aa of fab after salt adaptation in previous studies the initial inoculum always contained two or more kinds of anammox species jeong et al 2020 magrí et al 2021 therefore the salt adaptation of fab culture could be due to i the initial fab species adapting to the higher salinity condition and or ii the growth of anammox species with higher salt tolerance in this study three anammox reactors seeded with a highly enriched fixed film fab culture 100 fab belonging to ca brocadia sp at day 0 and run under three different salinity conditions 2 g nacl l in r1 8 g nacl l in r2 and 12 g nacl l in r3 for over 420 days to investigate the distinct salt adaptation process of fab and elucidate the mechanisms through analyzing their long term performances activities stoichiometry and the microbial community dynamics based on these results the suitable strategies on how to reduce the start up time and avoid unstable performance when applying fab in saline brackish wastewater treatment were further discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculums reactor operation three semi continuous moving bed bioreactors mbbr namely r1 r3 each with a total volume of 1 7 l including the working volume of 1 2 l and headspace volume of 0 5 l were set up and operated in a water bath shaker premiere thz 82 china with temperature fixed at 35 1 c and shaking rate of 60 10 strokes min the experimental set up is shown

water ro water ro permeate of tap water with the volume ratio of three times to real wastewater liquor hcl nh4hco3 and nano2 were added to maintain the ph at 5 8 0 2 nitrite concentration at about 520 mg n l and ammonium concentration in the range of 400 472 mg n l depending on the stoichiometric ratio of substrate consumption in the reactors respectively the ph of the medium or effluent of all the three reactors was about 7 0 4 the anammox process consumes h the feeding was flushed with nitrogen gas to maintain do lower than 0 5 mg l nacl was added to achieve the designed salinity level it should be noted that after day 110 an additional 1 6 mg l fe2 was added in the feed of all the three reactors to ensure the basic requirement for growth of anammox bacteria especially for ca kuenenia sp liu and ni 2015 r1 was the low salinity reactor and fed with the influent without nacl addition due to the high nitrogen loading electrical conductivity ec in r1 was about 3 7 ms cm and equivalent to the salinity of 2 g nacl l the salinity of r2 gradually increased with 2 g nacl l every two weeks until the aa of reactor was lower than 50 of the initial level with a total of 6 g nacl l addition after day 29 resulting in ec 15 ms cm equivalent to 8 g nacl l the salinity of r3 was increased by adding 10 g nacl l directly resulting in ec 23 ms cm equivalent to 12 g nacl l all three reactors were fed for 7 min at the beginning of each 2 h cycle and 12 cycles per day during the experimental period the hydraulic retention time hrt of r1 was kept at 1 day 100 ml influent each cycle from day 1 to day 204 to avoid synergistic inhibition of salinity combined with nitrite lin et al 2020 hrts of r2 and r3 were correspondingly adjusted between 1 and 2 8 days shown in fig s2 both ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the effluents were lower than 30 mg n l from day 215 to day 425 hrts of r2 and r3 were maintained at 1 day the optimal density od values for indicating the amount of cod of

typical 2 h cycle study are presented in fig s4 to simplify aa was calculated based on the ammonium consumption rate during the first 0 5 h shown as eq 4 4 aa δ c n h 4 δ t where δ c n h 4 mg n l represents the change in concentration of ammonium δ t is the reaction time 0 5 h note to avoid aa variance caused by limiting substrates aa data shown in this paper were collected from cycle studies with initial nh4 n concentrations of 30 50 mg l and initial substrate ratios no2 n nh4 n of 1 1 1 5 2 3 batch experiment several sets of batch tests using 60 ml serum bottles 6 h reaction were also carried out to explore the characteristics of the anammox biomass randomly collected from their parent reactors in all batch tests the effluent of r1 was used as the medium so to supply the same trace elements for each test and ph was maintained at 7 0 1 by adding 10 mm hepes buffer the initial nitrite and ammonium concentrations were fixed at 100 120 mg n l and 80 100 mg n l by adding nano2 and nh4hco3 respectively the initial ratio of no2 n nh4 n was 1 30 0 05 all the other experimental conditions such as temperature and mixing speed were the same as the parent reactors salinities in the experimental assays were adjusted by adding nacl detailed experimental method was reported at lin et al 2020 the specific anammox activity saa g nh4 n g vs d was calculated by eq 5 5 saa δ c n h 4 v l

represent the changes in concentrations of nitrite and nitrate respectively 2 4 microbial community dynamics biomass grown on the carrier was sampled monthly and stored at 80 c dna was extracted using fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed at the australian centre for ecogenomics ace brisbane australia to assess the composition of the microbial community in the three reactors 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 chemical analysis the ph of three reactors was monitored with calibrated ph probes hanna instrument hi 2910 australia connected to ph transmitters hannah instrument hi8614ln australia the salinity of the medium was tested directly with a portable ec meter eutech instruments ph5 singapore the gas pressure of reactors was tested with a gas

lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin the biomass attached to carriers randomly selected from each reactor was dried at 105 c for 24 h and peeled from the carrier the vs was then analyzed by the standard methods apha 1995 2 5 2 data analysis the data of calculated aas and stoichiometric ratios were subjected to analysis of variance one way anova with the least significant difference lsd test at the 0 01 probability level in spss software version 26 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anammox reactors in this study r1 was the low salinity reactor with the salinity of 2 g nacl l the salinity of r2 was stepwise increased to 8 g nacl l the salinity of r3 was set at 12 g nacl l the tin removal efficiency along with the tin loading rates of the three anammox reactors during 425 days of operation are shown in fig 1 the results show that the fixed film fab functioned well in r2 and r3 the tin removal efficiencies of r2 and r3 were the same as that of r1 88 5 from day 0 to day 184 to avoid substrate accumulation the tin loading rates of r2 and r3 were decreased down to 0 20 g n l day and 0 32 g n l day respectively from day 185 to day 215 the treatment capacities of r2 and r3 both gradually increased allowing for the tin loading rates to be set to match r1 0 92 0 05 g n l from day 215 to day 425 under the same tin loading rate both r2 and r3 achieved desired and stable performances based on the nitrogen and carbon balance calculation anammox activity contributed at least 90 of inorganic nitrogen transformations in all the three reactors in a typical 2 h cycle study toc consumption during was about 10 mg l and no significant do consumption 3 2 microbial community dynamics fig 2 shows the variations in abundance of anammox species in the three reactors from day 0 to day 204 the percentage of total anammox bacteria in three reactors all significantly increased from 7 88 to 21 2 12 4 and 14 9 for r1 r2 and r3 respectively from day 204 to 423 the anammox proportion in r1 slightly increased to 23 5 but the anammox proportion of r2 and r3 both decreased to 7 2 and 11 4 respectively these could be because at a higher salinity more maintenance power is required and therefore less energy can be used for growth lin et al 2020 okabe et al 2021 which may significantly affect the population balance of anammox bacteria in the system the variations of the microbial community structure phylum level in r1 r3 along with the operation days are shown in fig s5 the photos of biomass growth on a carrier collected from three reactors were shown in fig s6 the detectable anammox bacteria in the initial biomass was all belonging to one fab species ca brocadia sp unidentified in r1 two other fab species ca kuenenia sp and ca jettenia sp were firstly detected on day 204 and day 307 respectively on day 110 the ca kuenenia sp was detected in r2 but it only accounted for 0 2 of the total anammox bacteria therefore from day 0 to day 110 all the anammox activity in these three reactors can be attributed to ca brocadia sp and this period was named phase 1 after day 110 the proportion of ca kuenenia sp significantly increased in r2 from 0 2 to 58 8 of total anammox bacteria from 0 02 to 4 25 of total microorganisms and r3 from 0 to 72 6 of total anammox bacteria from 0 to 8 30 of total microorganisms ca kuenenia sp gradually becoming the dominant anammox species in these two reactors these results indicated that compared to ca brocadia sp and ca jettenia sp ca kuenenia sp was more tolerant to a higher salinity condition similarly in a one stage cannon process one ca kuenenia sp exhibited high activity at salinity up to 15 g nacl l while activity of a candidatus jettenia sp sharply declined even at 5 g nacl l wang et al 2017 in addition higher salinity provided a stronger driving force for the shift of anammox species in r3 12 g nacl l than that in r2 8 g nacl l and r1 2 g nacl l which may explain the highest population of ca kuenenia sp in r3 the period day 111 to day 425 with the co existence of ca brocadia sp and ca kuenenia sp in r2 and r3 was named phase 2 3 3 salt adaptation of ca brocadia sp during phase 1 the aa in the three reactors was attributed to ca brocadia sp 99 8 of the total anammox bacteria in all three reactors fig 3 a shows the aas of three reactors during this phase correspondingly the long term effects of salinity on aa and stoichiometry of ca brocadia sp are presented in fig 3 b and fig 4 a respectively further batch tests were conducted on day 56 to compare the saa and stoichiometry of ca brocadia sp collected from the three reactors shown in fig 3 c and fig 4 b respectively 3 3 1 anammox activity as shown in fig 3 a the aa of r1 was generally within the range of 0 8 1 4 g nh4 n l day from day 1 to day 29 the aa of r2 gradually decreased before stabilizing at 0 5 0 1 g nh4 n l day when salinity reached 8 g nacl l for r3 during phase 1 the aa was relatively stable at 0 4 0 1 g nh4 n l day as summarized in fig 3 b the activity of the studied ca brocadia sp significantly decreased with the increase of salinity p 0 01 by increasing salinities from 2 g nacl l to 8 and 12 g nacl l the aa of ca brocadia sp decreased by 55 and 74 respectively in fig 3 c after 56 day salt adaptation at the salinity of 12 g nacl l the saa of ca brocadia sp from r3 was not significantly different from that of bacteria taken from r1 under 8 g nacl l salinity the saas of ca brocadia sp from r2 and r3 were actually lower than that of bacteria taken from r1 in addition when transferred back to the salinity of 2 g nacl l the saa of ca brocadia sp from r2 and r3 decreased by 75 and 57 respectively the results were comparable to jin et al 2011 s study in which after the 91 day operation with 30 g nacl l aa in freshwater conditions decreased by 20 this may be because after long term exposure to a new salinity level the intracellular osmotic pressure of ca brocadia sp cell was adjusted accordingly therefore when transferred back to low salinity condition the aa of the studied ca brocadia sp could not recover immediately 3 3 2 stoichiometry both fig 4 a and b show the significant effect of salinity on the stoichiometry of ca brocadia sp under the initial salinity condition 2 g nacl l the r niam and the r naam were stable at 1 35 and 0 33 respectively which were slightly higher than the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 respectively strous et al 1998 the r niam values of ca brocadia sp significantly decreased with the increase of salinity p 0 01 and were stable at 1 12 and 1 03 with the salinities of 8 and 12 g nacl l respectively in the meanwhile the r naam at the elevated salinity levels varied from 0 32 to 0 22 was lower than the initial level but did not show a significant trend p 0 147 when salinity in the batch tests were adjusted to 2 g nacl l both the r niam and the r naam of ca brocadia sp from r2 and r3 increased and closed to the initial values similarly in ma et al 2012 s study when salinity increased from 5 g l to 20 g l the r niam and the r naam decreased from 1 27 to 0 84 and 0 14 to 0 11 respectively however in some other long term salt adaptation experiments the r niam of fab significantly increased up to 1 5 which was mainly due to the out competition of denitrification dapena mora et al 2006 liu et al 2014 the decrease of the r niam and r naam less nitrite consumption and less nitrate generation can be mutually verified by the fact that the growth of anammox bacteria in r2 and r3 was significantly lower than r1 since nitrate is produced from nitrite to generate reducing equivalents for co2 fixation in anammox cells van de graaf et al 1996 these also indicated the likelihood of the protection process responses of ca brocadia sp under the elevated salinity condition to survive better more energy of fab could be used for i the protection processes up regulation of compatible solutes cyplik et al 2012 liu et al 2014 vyrides et al 2010 and eps ma et al 2012 tang et al 2011 xing et al 2015 ii ion transport substrate transport inside cells and other salt ions like na cl pump out meng et al 2018 these results suggested the studied ca brocadia sp lacked the capacity for salt adaptation all the aa r niam and r naam of the ca brocadia sp decreased under higher salinities and did not recover after long term salt adaptation however under salinities of 8 and 12 g nacl l the aa of the ca brocadia sp was still very stable which ensured the stable performance of r2 and r3 during phase 1 3 4 salt adaptation of ca kuenenia sp the extremely slow growth rate of anammox bacteria under elevated salinity resulted in the long lag period for the development of ca kuenenia sp through phase 2 day 111 to day 425 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp in total anammox bacteria in r2 and r3 gradually increased from essentially 0 to about 60 and 77 respectively the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp was estimated based on the results of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing shown in fig s7 therefore the contribution of the aa from ca kuenenia sp gradually increased in r2 and r3 3 4 1 anammox activity as shown in fig 5 a and b the aa of r2 started to increase after day 260 when the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp reached 30 similarly the aa of r3 started to increase after day 300 when the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp reached 50 the aa values of r2 and r3 both reached and maintained at 0 9 0 1 g nh n l day at the end of this phase r2 during day 370 425 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp varied from 45 to 60 and r3 during day 400 425 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp varied from 70 to 77 further increase of the abundance of ca kuenenia sp did not increase the aa of r2 and r3 this may be because in the fixed film anammox reactor anammox bacteria were mainly located in the inner layer of biofilm meaning the maximum aa was also limited by the substrate transport rate 3 4 2 stoichiometry interestingly the r niam of r2 and r3 gradually increased when the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp increased to about 20 and 30 respectively after which both the r niam and r naam of r2 and r3 became stable and were close to the theoretical ratios for r2 the r niam and r naam were about 1 27 and 0 25 respectively for r3 the r niam and r naam stabilized at 1 20 and 0 18 respectively shown in fig 6 during this period day 185 215 even though the hrts of r2 and r3 gradually increased from about 3 days back to 1 day fig s2 the od of effluent of r2 and r3 were lower than which of day 1 185 fig s3 which suggested less cod wash out therefore the increased values of both r niam and r naam were not attributed to denitrification process which would decrease the r naam these results indicated the increased performance of r2 and r3 during phase 2 was mainly due to the increased amount of total ca kuenenia sp cells and the fab culture adapted to the elevated salinities by shifting the species from the initial species ca brocadia sp to the higher salt tolerance one ca kuenenia sp 3 5 salinity tolerance of different species of anammox bacteria under salinity conditions of r2 gradually increased to 8 g nacl l and r3 12 g nacl l the new fab ca kuenenia sp outcompeted ca brocadia sp after 425 days adaptation short term batch tests were conducted to further compare the salt tolerance of different anammox cultures dominated with ca kuenenia sp sampling at day 450 from r3 and ca brocadia sp sampling before day 0 seeding biomass of mbbr during the batch tests the saa0 blank control assay of anammox biomass dominant with ca brocadia sp and ca kuenenia sp were 0 18 0 09 g nh4 n g vs day at the salinity of 2 g nacl l and 0 12 0 04 g nh4 n g vs day at the salinity of 12 g nacl l respectively as shown in fig 7 ca brocadia sp had low salinity tolerance with optimal salinity raa 90 at 0 3 g nacl l and ic50 of 9 g nacl l while the optimal salinity for ca kuenenia sp was in the range of 10 15 g nacl l raa 85 and its ic50 was about 8 and 17 g nacl l respectively these results also suggested that compared to ca brocadia sp ca kuenenia sp was more tolerant to a higher salinity condition interestingly as suggested by previous studies the anammox species from the genus of ca kuenenia could further adapt to salinity up to 30 g nacl l kartal et al 2006 liu et al 2009 salinity tolerance of the specific anammox species is mainly limited by i enzyme activity and ii substrate transport lin et al 2021 most of the enzymes of anammox bacteria are protein including the transporters of substrates and the enzymes for anammox metabolism process kartal et al 2013 extreme anion or cation concentrations can decrease the flexibility of active sites of enzymes and lower the enzyme activity by changing the rigidity of the protein tertiary structure zhao 2005 the different optimal salt conditions for different anammox species were possibly due to their different protein specificities for example in two fixed biofilm anammox reactors long term salt exposure to 5 and 20 g nacl l respectively 27 proteins were identified and exhibited a significant difference of which 9 proteins related to ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis were significantly up regulated and 18 proteins related to ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sinica jpn1 were down regulated meng et al 2018 in terms of substrate transport our previous study on functional gene expression of the ca brocadia sp indicated that high nacl concentration could be inhibited aa by reducing the transport of nh4 lin et al 2021 in the meantime it has been reported by dsane et al 2020 that the cellular atp of ca brocadia significantly dropped under salinity elevation to 5 g nacl l the decreased atp also dramatically decreased the active transport of ammonium additionally the salinity could affect no2 transport by impacting the energy conservation system for fab no2 active transport was most likely to be relied on proton motive force pmf carvajal arroyo et al 2014 while mab relied on sodium motive force smf wu et al 2019 a proteome analysis suggested ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis can use both pmf and smf for energy conservation de almeida et al 2016 perhaps saline environments could boost smf of ca kuenenia sp and benefit the nitrite transport therefore the decreased affinity of ca brocadia sp to ammonium and the increased affinity of ca kuenenia sp to nitrite could lead to substrate competition advantage of the ca kuenenia sp under a high salinity condition 3 6 operation strategy for fab applying on brackish saline wastewater treatment based on the results of this study several operational strategies can be applied to shorter start up time or avoid unstable performance of fab treating brackish saline wastewater first of all in this study the fab culture adapted to elevated salinity mainly due to the growth of a salt tolerant species therefore strategies that benefit anammox species shifting can be applied to shorten the salt adaptation period on one hand different anammox species often demonstrated different environmental preference and were found in different sources shown in table s2 to shorten the lag period for a new species growth it is better to seed with the sludge from multiple sources for example the seeding sludge can be the mixture of the enriched fab biomass and the sludge coming from a high salinity environment such as landfill marine sediment or anaerobic anoxic bioreactor treating high salinity wastewater on the other hand adopting a large salt elevation step e g 10 g nacl l in r3 can provide a larger driving force for anammox species shift but while maintaining 30 of the initial aa secondly the decrease of stoichiometry ratio of the r niam under high salinity can results in nitrite accumulation especially treating high nitrogen loading wastewater in a two stage anammox reactor and leads to synergistic inhibition of salinity and nitrite lin et al 2020 therefore the substrate concentration especially nitrite should be well monitored to avoid the collapse of the reactor lastly this study showed that the salt adapted anammox culture has its optimal salinity range and a sudden draw off of salt load would be seriously detrimental the rapid changes in salt concentration may also cause the immediate release of cellular constituents resulting in an increase of soluble organic carbon windey et al 2005 hence the salt adaptated anammox culture may not be suitable for the treatment of wastewater with salinity variation interestingly salinity in some way facilitates the application of the anammox based technology it has been widely reported that nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was more sensitive to the salinity shock than ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob aslan and simsek 2012 dinçer and kargi 2001 liu et al 2008 mosquera corral et al 2005 ye et al 2009 for example in an sbr system less than 1 of nob survived while half of aob remained alive and active under 20 g nacl l salinity shock ye et al 2009 in addition salinity may benefit the partial denitrification process consume no3 and provided no2 for anammox li et al 2018 therefore salinity has been considered as a selection factor to achieve a stable pn anammox process liu et al 2020 and partial denitrification anammox process li et al 2018 4 conclusion even though elevated salinity inhibited the aa of fab the anammox reactor can achieve stable operation under salinity conditions of 8 g nacl l r2 and 12 g nacl l r3 with tin removal of 80 90 throughout the 425 day operation period tin loading was 0 92 g n l day from day 220 however the aa and no2 n nh4 n consumption ratio of low salt tolerance species ca brocadia sp decreased along with the increase of salinity and this species could not adapt to the elevated salinity condition but with the increase of abundance of ca kuenenia sp the aa and stoichiometry ratios of r2 and r3 gradually recovered to optimal levels these results indicated that anammox biomass adapted to high salinity mainly through the species evolution by increasing the amount of high salt tolerance anammox species to shorten the salt adaptation process strategies that benefit the species shift to a salt tolerant one are helpful e g reactors seeding with an anammox culture containing high salt tolerance species and instigating a relatively bigger jump in salinity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16515,the most common way to apply anammox for saline wastewater treatment is via salt adaptation of freshwater anammox bacteria fab to better apply this process in practice it s essential to understand the salt adaptation process of fba as well as the underlying mechanisms this study investigated the long term salt adaptation process of a fixed film fab culture in three reactors namely r1 r3 under salinities of 2 8 and 12 nacl g l correspondingly all three reactors were under stable operation and achieved 80 90 total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency throughout the 425 day operation period r1 servers as a blank control based on the clear microbial community shifts in r2 and r3 the operation period was divided into 2 phases during phase 1 all fab in the three reactors belonged to ca brocadia sp the anammox activity aa and the ratio of nitrite ammonium no2 n nh4 n consumption in r2 and r3 decreased with the increase of salinity and did not recover to the initial levels during phase 2 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp in r2 and r3 increased from nearly 0 to about 60 and 77 respectively with the growth of ca kuenenia sp the aa and stoichiometry of r2 and r3 gradually recovered aa of r2 and r3 both reached 1 0 g nh4 n l day at the end of this phase which was about 80 of that in r1 these results indicated that the salt adaptation of fab culture was

increases the salinity of municipal sewage in the meantime the global nacl market was about 314 million ton in 2018 and expected to witness an annual growth of 1 9 freedonia group 2019 owing to an increase in utilization of sodium chloride as a reagent for the chemical industry mainly the chloralkali sector petroleum textile pharmaceutical and leather industry lefebvre et al 2006 the amount of saline wastewater produced from these industries has also increased rapidly in the past decades due to the rising demands of food and industry and daily life products chen et al 2018 li and yang 2018 zhao et al 2020 these high salinity wastewaters often contain high concentrations of nitrogen based contaminants e g salinity and ammonium concentration of the municipal wastewater of hongkong a seawater toilet flushing city are about 5 g l and 40 100 mg n l respectively wu et al 2000 salinity and ammonium concentration of a mustard tuber wastewater are about 28 32 g l and 170 180 mg n l respectively chen et al 2016 salinity and ammonium concentration of a landfill leachate are about 13 30 g l and 1500 2400 mg n l respectively magrí et al 2021 without proper managed these saline wastewaters will result in eutrophication and deterioration of water quality ozturk and bal 2015 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox based wastewater treatment is a cost efficient biological nitrogen removal method and so has drawn a lot of attention over the past few decades this biotechnology which is suitable for low c n wastewater significantly lowers the oxygen and organic carbon demand nsenga kumwimba et al 2020 anammox bacteria belong to the planctomycetes phylum so far six genera of anammox bacteria in natural or engineered environments have been discovered namely ca anammoxoglobus ca anammoximicrobium ca brocadia ca kuenenia ca jettenia and ca scalindua as shown in table s2 the former five genera are mainly found in low salinity or freshwater environments and are called freshwater anammox bacteria fab only the final genus ca scalindua is mainly found in marine areas or other high salinity environments and is called marine anammox bacteria mab the dominant anammox bacteria in almost all full scale anammox based applications are enriched in low salt content water and belong to fab nsenga kumwimba et al 2020 hence the most common way to apply anammox in saline brackish wastewater treatment is via salt adaptation of the enriched fab giustinianovich et al 2018 jin et al 2011 the anammox bacteria are known as slow growing bacteria with a typical doubling time of 10 to 20 days schmid et al 2003 van niftrik et al 2008 hence the salt adaptation period for fab is potentially very long compared with the other biological processes still salt adaptation of fab has been demonstrated for example in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket anammox reactor it took 240 days operation to achieve stable performance at 12 g nacl l salinity with the total inorganic nitrogen tin removal rate of 86 2 at a tin loading rate of 0 258 g n l day chen et al 2015 in an oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification denitrification system after 180 days operation and increased salinity to 30 g nacl l anammox activity aa increased by 46 windey et al 2005 with 340 400 days operation period a fab has been acclimatized to 30 g nacl l and this salt adapted fab mainly belongs to candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis ku2 kartal et al 2006 liu et al 2009 but what is not clear is the mechanism for the improved treatment capacity and aa of fab after salt adaptation in previous studies the initial inoculum always contained two or more kinds of anammox species jeong et al 2020 magrí et al 2021 therefore the salt adaptation of fab culture could be due to i the initial fab species adapting to the higher salinity condition and or ii the growth of anammox species with higher salt tolerance in this study three anammox reactors seeded with a highly enriched fixed film fab culture 100 fab belonging to ca brocadia sp at day 0 and run under three different salinity conditions 2 g nacl l in r1 8 g nacl l in r2 and 12 g nacl l in r3 for over 420 days to investigate the distinct salt adaptation process of fab and elucidate the mechanisms through analyzing their long term performances activities stoichiometry and the microbial community dynamics based on these results the suitable strategies on how to reduce the start up time and avoid unstable performance when applying fab in saline brackish wastewater treatment were further discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 inoculums reactor operation three semi continuous moving bed bioreactors mbbr namely r1 r3 each with a total volume of 1 7 l including the working volume of 1 2 l and headspace volume of 0 5 l were set up and operated in a water bath shaker premiere thz 82 china with temperature fixed at 35 1 c and shaking rate of 60 10 strokes min the experimental set up is shown

water ro water ro permeate of tap water with the volume ratio of three times to real wastewater liquor hcl nh4hco3 and nano2 were added to maintain the ph at 5 8 0 2 nitrite concentration at about 520 mg n l and ammonium concentration in the range of 400 472 mg n l depending on the stoichiometric ratio of substrate consumption in the reactors respectively the ph of the medium or effluent of all the three reactors was about 7 0 4 the anammox process consumes h the feeding was flushed with nitrogen gas to maintain do lower than 0 5 mg l nacl was added to achieve the designed salinity level it should be noted that after day 110 an additional 1 6 mg l fe2 was added in the feed of all the three reactors to ensure the basic requirement for growth of anammox bacteria especially for ca kuenenia sp liu and ni 2015 r1 was the low salinity reactor and fed with the influent without nacl addition due to the high nitrogen loading electrical conductivity ec in r1 was about 3 7 ms cm and equivalent to the salinity of 2 g nacl l the salinity of r2 gradually increased with 2 g nacl l every two weeks until the aa of reactor was lower than 50 of the initial level with a total of 6 g nacl l addition after day 29 resulting in ec 15 ms cm equivalent to 8 g nacl l the salinity of r3 was increased by adding 10 g nacl l directly resulting in ec 23 ms cm equivalent to 12 g nacl l all three reactors were fed for 7 min at the beginning of each 2 h cycle and 12 cycles per day during the experimental period the hydraulic retention time hrt of r1 was kept at 1 day 100 ml influent each cycle from day 1 to day 204 to avoid synergistic inhibition of salinity combined with nitrite lin et al 2020 hrts of r2 and r3 were correspondingly adjusted between 1 and 2 8 days shown in fig s2 both ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the effluents were lower than 30 mg n l from day 215 to day 425 hrts of r2 and r3 were maintained at 1 day the optimal density od values for indicating the amount of cod of

represents the change in concentration of ammonium δ t is the reaction time 0 5 h note to avoid aa variance caused by limiting substrates aa data shown in this paper were collected from cycle studies with initial nh4 n concentrations of 30 50 mg l and initial substrate ratios no2 n nh4 n of 1 1 1 5 2 3 batch experiment several sets of batch tests using 60 ml serum bottles 6 h reaction were also carried out to explore the characteristics of the anammox biomass randomly collected from their parent reactors in all batch tests the effluent of r1 was used as the medium so to supply the same trace elements for each test and ph was maintained at 7 0 1 by adding 10 mm hepes buffer the initial nitrite and ammonium concentrations were fixed at 100 120 mg n l and 80 100 mg n l by adding nano2 and nh4hco3 respectively the initial ratio of no2 n nh4 n was 1 30 0 05 all the other experimental conditions such as temperature and mixing speed were the same as the parent reactors salinities in the

fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was performed at the australian centre for ecogenomics ace brisbane australia to assess the composition of the microbial community

the least significant difference lsd test at the 0 01 probability level in spss software version 26 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anammox reactors in this study r1 was the low salinity reactor with the salinity of 2 g nacl l the salinity of r2 was stepwise increased to 8 g nacl l the salinity of r3 was set at 12 g nacl l the tin removal efficiency along with the tin loading rates of the three anammox reactors during 425 days of operation are shown in fig 1 the results show that the fixed film fab functioned well in r2 and r3 the tin removal efficiencies of r2 and r3 were the same as that of r1 88 5 from day 0 to day 184 to avoid substrate accumulation the tin loading rates of r2 and r3 were decreased down to 0 20 g n l day and 0 32 g n l day respectively from day 185 to day 215 the treatment capacities of r2 and r3 both gradually increased allowing for the tin loading rates to be set to match r1 0 92 0 05 g n l from day 215 to day 425 under the same tin loading rate both r2 and r3 achieved desired and stable performances based on the nitrogen and carbon balance calculation anammox activity contributed at least 90 of inorganic nitrogen transformations in all the three reactors in a typical 2 h cycle study toc consumption during was about 10 mg l and no significant do consumption 3 2 microbial community dynamics fig 2 shows the variations in abundance of anammox species in the three reactors from day 0 to day 204 the percentage of total anammox bacteria in three reactors all significantly increased from 7 88 to 21 2 12 4 and 14 9 for r1 r2 and r3 respectively from day 204 to 423 the anammox proportion in r1 slightly increased to 23 5 but the anammox proportion of r2 and r3 both decreased to 7 2 and 11 4 respectively these could be because at a higher salinity more maintenance power is required and therefore less energy can be used for growth lin et al 2020 okabe et al 2021 which may significantly affect the population balance of anammox bacteria in the system the variations of the microbial community structure phylum level in r1 r3 along with the operation days are shown in fig s5 the photos of biomass growth on a carrier collected from three reactors were shown in fig s6 the detectable anammox bacteria in the initial biomass was all belonging to one fab species ca brocadia sp unidentified in r1 two other fab species ca kuenenia sp and ca jettenia sp were firstly detected on day 204 and day 307 respectively on day 110 the ca kuenenia sp was detected in r2 but it only accounted for 0 2 of the total anammox bacteria therefore from day 0 to day 110 all the anammox activity in these three reactors can be attributed to ca brocadia sp and this period was named phase 1 after day 110 the proportion of ca kuenenia sp significantly increased in r2 from 0 2 to 58 8 of total anammox bacteria from 0 02 to 4 25 of total microorganisms and r3 from 0 to 72 6 of total anammox bacteria from 0 to 8 30 of total microorganisms ca kuenenia sp gradually becoming the dominant anammox species in these two reactors these results indicated that compared to ca brocadia sp and ca jettenia sp ca kuenenia sp was more tolerant to a higher salinity condition similarly in a one stage cannon process one ca kuenenia sp exhibited high activity at salinity up to 15 g nacl l while activity of a candidatus jettenia sp sharply declined even at 5 g nacl l wang et al 2017 in addition higher salinity provided a stronger driving force for the shift of anammox species in r3 12 g nacl l than that in r2 8 g nacl l and r1 2 g nacl l which may explain the highest population of ca kuenenia sp in r3 the period day 111 to day 425 with the co existence of ca brocadia sp and ca kuenenia sp in r2 and r3 was named phase 2 3 3 salt adaptation of ca brocadia sp during phase 1 the aa in the three reactors was attributed to ca brocadia sp 99 8 of the total anammox bacteria in all three reactors fig 3 a shows the aas of three reactors during this phase correspondingly the long term effects of salinity on aa and stoichiometry of ca brocadia sp are presented in fig 3 b and fig 4 a respectively further batch tests were conducted on day 56 to compare the saa and stoichiometry of ca brocadia sp collected from the three reactors shown in fig 3 c and fig 4 b respectively 3 3 1 anammox activity as shown in fig 3 a the aa of r1 was generally within the range of 0 8 1 4 g nh4 n l day from day 1 to day 29 the aa of r2 gradually decreased before stabilizing at 0 5 0 1 g nh4 n l day when salinity reached 8 g nacl l for r3 during phase 1 the aa was relatively stable at 0 4 0 1 g nh4 n l day as summarized in fig 3 b the activity of the studied ca brocadia sp significantly decreased with the increase of salinity p 0 01 by increasing salinities from 2 g nacl l to 8 and 12 g nacl l the aa of ca brocadia sp decreased by 55 and 74 respectively in fig 3 c after 56 day salt adaptation at the salinity of 12 g nacl l the saa of ca brocadia sp from r3 was not significantly different from that of bacteria taken from r1 under 8 g nacl l salinity the saas of ca brocadia sp from r2 and r3 were actually lower than that of bacteria taken from r1 in addition when transferred back to the salinity of 2 g nacl l the saa of ca brocadia sp from r2 and r3 decreased by 75 and 57 respectively the results were comparable to jin et al 2011 s study in which after the 91 day operation with 30 g nacl l aa in freshwater conditions decreased by 20 this may be because after long term exposure to a new salinity level the intracellular osmotic pressure of ca brocadia sp cell was adjusted accordingly therefore when transferred back to low salinity condition the aa of the studied ca brocadia sp could not recover immediately 3 3 2 stoichiometry both fig 4 a and b show the significant effect of salinity on the stoichiometry of ca brocadia sp under the initial salinity condition 2 g nacl l the r niam and the r naam were stable at 1 35 and 0 33 respectively which were slightly higher than the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 respectively strous et al 1998 the r niam values of ca brocadia sp significantly decreased with the increase of salinity p 0 01 and were stable at 1 12 and 1 03 with the salinities of 8 and 12 g nacl l respectively in the meanwhile the r naam at the elevated salinity levels varied from 0 32 to 0 22 was lower than the initial level but did not show a significant trend p 0 147 when salinity in the batch tests were adjusted to 2 g nacl l both the r niam and the r naam of ca brocadia sp from r2 and r3 increased and closed to the initial values similarly in ma et al 2012 s study when salinity increased from 5 g l to 20 g l the r niam and the r naam decreased from 1 27 to 0 84 and 0 14 to 0 11 respectively however in some other long term salt adaptation experiments the r niam of fab significantly increased up to 1 5 which was mainly due to the out competition of denitrification dapena mora et al 2006 liu et al 2014 the decrease of the r niam and r naam less nitrite consumption and less nitrate generation can be mutually verified by the fact that the growth of anammox bacteria in r2 and r3 was significantly lower than r1 since nitrate is produced from nitrite to generate reducing equivalents for co2 fixation in anammox cells van de graaf et al 1996 these also indicated the likelihood of the protection process responses of ca brocadia sp under the elevated salinity condition to survive better more energy of fab could be used for i the protection processes up regulation of compatible solutes cyplik et al 2012 liu et al 2014 vyrides et al 2010 and eps ma et al 2012 tang et al 2011 xing et al 2015 ii ion transport substrate transport inside cells and other salt ions like na cl pump out meng et al 2018 these results suggested the studied ca brocadia sp lacked the capacity for salt adaptation all the aa r niam and r naam of the ca brocadia sp decreased under higher salinities and did not recover after long term salt adaptation however under salinities of 8 and 12 g nacl l the aa of the ca brocadia sp was still very stable which ensured the stable performance of r2 and r3 during phase 1 3 4 salt adaptation of ca kuenenia sp the extremely slow growth rate of anammox bacteria under elevated salinity resulted in the long lag period for the development of ca kuenenia sp through phase 2 day 111 to day 425 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp in total anammox bacteria in r2 and r3 gradually increased from essentially 0 to about 60 and 77 respectively the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp was estimated based on the results of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing shown in fig s7 therefore the contribution of the aa from ca kuenenia sp gradually increased in r2 and r3 3 4 1 anammox activity as shown in fig 5 a and b the aa of r2 started to increase after day 260 when the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp reached 30 similarly the aa of r3 started to increase after day 300 when the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp reached 50 the aa values of r2 and r3 both reached and maintained at 0 9 0 1 g nh n l day at the end of this phase r2 during day 370 425 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp varied from 45 to 60 and r3 during day 400 425 the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp varied from 70 to 77 further increase of the abundance of ca kuenenia sp did not increase the aa of r2 and r3 this may be because in the fixed film anammox reactor anammox bacteria were mainly located in the inner layer of biofilm meaning the maximum aa was also limited by the substrate transport rate 3 4 2 stoichiometry interestingly the r niam of r2 and r3 gradually increased when the relative abundance of ca kuenenia sp increased to about 20 and 30 respectively after which both the r niam and r naam of r2 and r3 became stable and were close to the theoretical ratios for r2 the r niam and r naam were about 1 27 and 0 25 respectively for r3 the r niam and r naam stabilized at 1 20 and 0 18 respectively shown in fig 6 during this period day 185 215 even though the hrts of r2 and r3 gradually increased from about 3 days back to 1 day fig s2 the od of effluent of r2 and r3 were lower than which of day 1 185 fig s3 which suggested less cod wash out therefore the increased values of both r niam and r naam were not attributed to denitrification process which would decrease the r naam these results indicated the increased performance of r2 and r3 during phase 2 was mainly due to the increased amount of total ca kuenenia sp cells and the fab culture adapted to the elevated salinities by shifting the species from the initial species ca brocadia sp to the higher salt tolerance one ca kuenenia sp 3 5 salinity tolerance of different species of anammox bacteria under salinity conditions of r2 gradually increased to 8 g nacl l and r3 12 g nacl l the new fab ca kuenenia sp outcompeted ca brocadia sp after 425 days adaptation short term batch tests were conducted to further compare the salt tolerance of different anammox cultures dominated with ca kuenenia sp sampling at day 450 from r3 and ca brocadia sp sampling before day 0 seeding biomass of mbbr during the batch tests the saa0 blank control assay of anammox biomass dominant with ca brocadia sp and ca kuenenia sp were 0 18 0 09 g nh4 n g vs day at the salinity of 2 g nacl l and 0 12 0 04 g nh4 n g vs day at the salinity of 12 g nacl l respectively as shown in fig 7 ca brocadia sp had low salinity tolerance with optimal salinity raa 90 at 0 3 g nacl l and ic50 of 9 g nacl l while the optimal salinity for ca kuenenia sp was in the range of 10 15 g nacl l raa 85 and its ic50 was about 8 and 17 g nacl l respectively these results also suggested that compared to ca brocadia sp ca kuenenia sp was more tolerant to a higher salinity condition interestingly as suggested by previous studies the anammox species from the genus of ca kuenenia could further adapt to salinity up to 30 g nacl l kartal et al 2006 liu et al 2009 salinity tolerance of the specific anammox species is mainly limited by i enzyme activity and ii substrate transport lin et al 2021 most of the enzymes of anammox bacteria are protein including the transporters of substrates and the enzymes for anammox metabolism process kartal et al 2013 extreme anion or cation concentrations can decrease the flexibility of active sites of enzymes and lower the enzyme activity by changing the rigidity of the protein tertiary structure zhao 2005 the different optimal salt conditions for different anammox species were possibly due to their different protein specificities for example in two fixed biofilm anammox reactors long term salt exposure to 5 and 20 g nacl l respectively 27 proteins were identified and exhibited a significant difference of which 9 proteins related to ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis were significantly up regulated and 18 proteins related to ca jettenia caeni and ca brocadia sinica jpn1 were down regulated meng et al 2018 in terms of substrate transport our previous study on functional gene expression of the ca brocadia sp indicated that high nacl concentration could be inhibited aa by reducing the transport of nh4 lin et al 2021 in the meantime it has been reported by dsane et al 2020 that the cellular atp of ca brocadia significantly dropped under salinity elevation to 5 g nacl l the decreased atp also dramatically decreased the active transport of ammonium additionally the salinity could affect no2 transport by impacting the energy conservation system for fab no2 active transport was most likely to be relied on proton motive force pmf carvajal arroyo et al 2014 while mab relied on sodium motive force smf wu et al 2019 a proteome analysis suggested ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis can use both pmf and smf for energy conservation de almeida et al 2016 perhaps saline environments could boost smf of ca kuenenia sp and benefit the nitrite transport therefore the decreased affinity of ca brocadia sp to ammonium and the increased affinity of ca kuenenia sp to nitrite could lead to substrate competition advantage of the ca kuenenia sp under a high salinity condition 3 6 operation strategy for fab applying on brackish saline wastewater treatment based on the results of this study several operational strategies can be applied to shorter start up time or avoid unstable performance of fab treating brackish saline wastewater first of all in this study the fab culture adapted to elevated salinity mainly due to the growth of a salt tolerant species therefore strategies that benefit anammox species shifting can be applied to shorten the salt adaptation period on one hand different anammox species often demonstrated different environmental preference and were found in different sources shown in table s2 to shorten the lag period for a new species growth it is better to seed with the sludge from multiple sources for example the seeding sludge can be the mixture of the enriched fab biomass and the sludge coming from a high salinity environment such as landfill marine sediment or anaerobic anoxic bioreactor treating high salinity wastewater on the other hand adopting a large salt elevation step e g 10 g nacl l in r3 can provide a larger driving force for anammox species shift but while maintaining 30 of the initial aa secondly the decrease of stoichiometry ratio of the r niam under high salinity can results in nitrite accumulation especially treating high nitrogen loading wastewater in a two stage anammox reactor and leads to synergistic inhibition of salinity and nitrite lin et al 2020 therefore the substrate concentration especially nitrite should be well monitored to avoid the collapse of the reactor lastly this study showed that the salt adapted anammox culture has its optimal salinity range and a sudden draw off of salt load would be seriously detrimental the rapid changes in salt concentration may also cause the immediate release of cellular constituents resulting in an increase of soluble organic carbon windey et al 2005 hence the salt adaptated anammox culture may not be suitable for the treatment of wastewater with salinity variation interestingly salinity in some way facilitates the application of the anammox based technology it has been widely reported that nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob was more sensitive to the salinity shock than ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob aslan and simsek 2012 dinçer and kargi 2001 liu et al 2008 mosquera corral et al 2005 ye et al 2009 for example in an sbr system less than 1 of nob survived while half of aob remained alive and active under 20 g nacl l salinity shock ye et al 2009 in addition salinity may benefit the partial denitrification process consume no3 and provided no2 for anammox li et al 2018 therefore salinity has been considered as a selection factor to achieve a stable pn anammox process liu et al 2020 and partial denitrification anammox process li et al 2018 4 conclusion even though elevated salinity inhibited the aa of fab the anammox reactor can achieve stable operation under salinity conditions of 8 g nacl l r2 and 12 g nacl l r3 with tin removal of 80 90 throughout the 425 day operation period tin loading was 0 92 g n l day from day 220 however the aa and no2 n nh4 n consumption ratio of low salt tolerance species ca brocadia sp decreased along with the increase of salinity and this species could not adapt to the elevated salinity condition but with the increase of abundance of ca kuenenia sp the aa and stoichiometry ratios of r2 and r3 gradually recovered to optimal levels these results indicated that anammox biomass adapted to high salinity mainly through the species evolution by increasing the amount of high salt tolerance anammox species to shorten the salt adaptation process strategies that benefit the species shift to a salt tolerant one are helpful e g reactors seeding with an anammox culture containing high salt tolerance species and instigating a relatively bigger jump in salinity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16516,expanding drinking water chlorination could substantially reduce the burden of disease in low and middle income countries but the taste of chlorinated water often impedes adoption we developed a monte carlo simulation to estimate the effect of people s choice to accept or reject drinking water based on chlorine taste and their subsequent exposure to e coli and trihalomethanes a class of disinfection byproduct dbp the simulation used empirical data from dhaka bangladesh a megacity with endemic waterborne disease we drew on published taste acceptability thresholds from dhaka residents measured residual chlorine and thermotolerant e coli inactivation following the addition of six chlorine doses 0 25 3 0 mg l as cl2 to untreated piped water samples from 100 locations and analyzed trihalomethane formation in 54 samples a dose of 0 5 mg l 75 lower than the 2 mg l dose typically recommended for household chlorination of low turbidity waters minimized overall exposure to e coli doses of 1 2 mg l maximized overall exposure to trihalomethanes accounting for chlorine taste aversion indicates that microbiological exposure increases and dbp exposure decreases above certain doses as a higher proportion of people reject chlorinated water in favor of untreated water taken together with findings from other modeling analyses empirical studies and field trials our results suggest that taste acceptability should be a critical consideration in establishing chlorination dosing guidelines particularly when chlorination is first implemented in water supplies with low chlorine

common scenario in much of the world elliott et al 2019 dosing chlorine at 2 mg l may lead people to reject disinfected water in favor of untreated options that are more likely to be fecally contaminated we estimated the effect of chlorine taste on the choice by households in dhaka to use chlorinated versus untreated piped water and their resulting exposure to fecal contamination and thms waterborne disease is endemic in dhaka talukdar et al 2013 as is common in lmics bivins et al 2017 most dhaka households use intermittently supplied piped groundwater that can become fecally contaminated in the distribution system we developed a monte carlo simulation that incorporated published chlorine taste acceptability threshold concentrations from dhaka residents crider et al 2018 along with newly collected data on the concentration of thms and fecal indicator bacteria specifically e coli in samples of untreated water and water chlorinated in the lab our primary objectives were to create a model of people s decision to accept or reject the taste of chlorinated water across a range of chlorine doses and to estimate their resulting exposures to e coli and thms we use our model outputs to identify the chlorine dose for household water treatment that would minimize exposure to fecal contamination in dhaka 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample frame dhaka the capital of bangladesh has a fast growing metropolitan population of approximately 20 million un 2018 the dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa a public utility delivers water to 65 75 of the metropolitan population through a piped water network in spite of service improvements over the last 15 years the piped water supply is intermittent i e provided 24 h day centralized chlorination is limited and fecal sludge management is poor peal et al 2014 over 700 deep groundwater pumping stations 100 to 400 meters deep supply more than 80 of the piped water four surface water treatment plants provide the remainder sharma and alipalo 2017 at the time of study most groundwater pumping stations lacked chlorination equipment and some that had chlorination equipment were not using it the intermittent supply allows wastewater and stormwater to infiltrate the pipe network which introduces fecal contamination and organic matter to the water supply household water supply in dhaka is thus characterized by fecal contamination the absence of chlorine residual and the potential for high concentrations of organic matter even where deep groundwater is the source acharjee et al 2014 amin et al 2019 haq 2006 sharma and alipalo 2017 talukdar et al 2013 the persistently poor microbiological water quality in dhaka has motivated a series of water treatment intervention trials as well as coping behaviors among residents household water treatment trials have used imported and locally available chlorine tablets and liquid bleach with doses of 2 mg l as cl2 clasen et al 2007 luoto et al 2011 rashid et al 2016 thomas et al 2020 technologies to chlorinate water in housing compounds at the point where people collect it such as shared taps and handpumps have also been tested amin et al 2016 pickering et al 2019 2015 these trials found that chlorine doses of 2 mg l resulted in frequent taste complaints yet dhaka residents chlorine taste detection thresholds are similar to those in the usa and higher than those in france and spain crider et al 2018 mackey et al 2004 piriou et al 2015 2004 suggesting this population is no more sensitive to chlorine taste than others for which comparable data are available boiling is common throughout dhaka and many high income households purchase point of use membrane filters alternative water sources including vended water private wells and ponds are available but usually have microbiological contamination ahmed et al 2014 amin et al 2019 with different sources and treatment options available dhaka households can thus opt to use water with or without chlorine based on their preferences our study site comprises 4 km2 1 of the city and is illustrative of water supply conditions that most dhaka residents experience additional sample frame details in si and map in supplementary fig s1 the site has 23 deep groundwater pumping stations that supply untreated water to the intermittently pressurized pipe network each pumping station in the study site was screened in person to confirm that no chlorination was occurring one hundred sampling locations at residential buildings were established on a geographic grid within the site using the fishnet tool in arcmap 10 5 1 esri california usa water was collected from two of these locations per day visited in a randomized order from august to november 2018 a period which spanned the end of the rainy season and beginning of the dry season the absence of total chlorine in water samples was confirmed in the field by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method using a lamotte dc1500 cl colorimeter maryland usa 2 2 data utilized in the monte carlo simulation we developed a monte carlo simulation of dhaka residents decision to accept or reject drinking water treated with six different chlorine doses and estimated their resulting exposure to waterborne fecal contamination and thms table 1 presents the data collection and analysis methods for the four types of data used in the simulation summarized below additional details in si 1 residual chlorine we applied chlorine as naocl to six samples of untreated municipal piped water from each of the 100 sampling locations using doses ranging from 0 25 to 3 0 mg l cl2 supplementary fig s2 the dosing range included values drawn from previous trials of chlorination in dhaka 0 5 to 2 0 mg l clasen et al 2007 pickering et al 2019 2015 rashid et al 2016 plus one lower and one higher dose we measured residual free and total chlorine concentration in each sample after one n 600 and 24 h n 600 of contact time control samples from each location that were not dosed with chlorine were also tested after one n 100 and 24 h n 100 all samples were stored in capped bottles at ambient temperature 24 h is the maximum storage time recommended for maintaining free residual chlorine in most household water treatment guidelines wilhelm et al 2018 lab blanks of deionized water n 300 and sample replicates n 11 were tested for free chlorine simultaneously with the samples to confirm dosing accuracy qa qc details in si all glassware was sterilized by autoclave made chlorine demand free by immersion in a dilute chlorine solution and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water before use 2 thermotolerant e coli we measured e coli concentrations by membrane filtration in paired samples of untreated and chlorinated water from each of the 100 locations for each of the six chlorine doses after one hour of contact time n 700 supplementary fig s2 e coli concentration in drinking water is the most commonly used health based indicator of microbiological quality and is correlated with child diarrhea gruber et al 2014 luby et al 2015 the standard for drinking water safety in bangladesh is e coli 1 colony forming unit cfu 100ml consistent with international guidelines bangladesh department of public health engineering 2021 us epa 2020 who 2017 qa qc testing suggested that the sampling and analytical methods for e coli were valid and reliable si e coli and residual chlorine analyses were conducted at the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research bangladesh icddr b in dhaka 3 thms we measured thm concentrations in samples that were collected from 54 locations and that we treated with chlorine doses as naocl ranging from 0 5 to 8 0 mg l as cl2 n 139 twenty sampling locations were among the 100 for residual chlorine and e coli sampling samples from an additional 34 residential buildings were also included to better represent thm formation potential in dhaka s water supply these buildings were near the 100 locations sampled for residual chlorine and e coli also received untreated municipal piped water from groundwater sources and were sampled across the rainy and dry seasons supplementary fig s1 we measured thm concentrations after 24 h of contact time including in non chlorinated controls n 16 thm analyses were conducted at stanford university usa after transporting filtered water samples on ice from dhaka time and budget constraints precluded evaluation of thm formation for all sites and chlorine doses we fit a linear hierarchical mixed effects regression model to the measured values and used it to predict thm concentration for each monte carlo simulation cycle as a function of the chlorine dose applied to a given sample analytical and computational details in si 4 chlorine taste acceptability threshold we fit empirical kernel density distributions to the concentrations of free chlorine at which 50 residents of an informal settlement in dhaka supplied with dwasa water said they would seek an alternative source of drinking water in a previous blinded taste test crider et al 2018 crider et al 2018 used 3 alternative forced choice tests an astm international standard procedure astm international 2011 to evaluate participants taste acceptability thresholds of free chlorine participants were presented with three sets of three samples of bottled water in which one sample per set was spiked with a known concentration of free chlorine and asked to identify the chlorinated samples the test was repeated with increasing free chlorine concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mg l respondents were also asked to rate using ordinal categories from definitely to definitely not the likelihood that they would seek an alternative water source if the taste of samples were representative of the water at their primary drinking water source crider et al 2018 p 843 we use the lowest free chlorine concentration at which respondents said they probably or definitely would seek an alternative source as the taste acceptability threshold value additional details in si although the taste of free chlorine in bottled water is an imperfect proxy for the taste of chlorinated piped water which could include tastes of combined chlorine and dbps the data from crider et al 2018 are the best available with which to specify a distribution of taste acceptability thresholds additionally utilizing free chlorine concentration as the only criterion likely overestimates taste acceptability as any other compounds formed by chlorination would add to the taste of the water in order to base our acceptability threshold values exclusively on chlorine concentrations tested by crider et al 2018 we would need to assume that most dhaka residents would reject the taste of water with free chlorine concentrations greater than 2 mg l the highest concentration evaluated in that study instead we modified the fitted distribution to set the cumulative probability of taste acceptability at the maximum dose we tested 3 0 mg l to be equivalent to that of 2 0 mg l in crider et al 2018 supplementary fig s3 this modified kernel density distribution thus includes a more conservative upper bound on taste acceptability it assumes that there is no free chlorine residual value below 5 mg l at which taste acceptability goes to zero we ran the monte carlo simulation using both the original and modified distributions to assess the sensitivity of our results to the choice of specification 2 3 monte carlo simulation each cycle of the monte carlo simulation began by randomly selecting an untreated water sample fig 1 the measured e coli concentration of that sample before chlorination and the measured residual free chlorine and e coli concentration after applying each of the six chlorine doses was used to represent the biological quality of untreated and chlorinated water that could be delivered a taste acceptability threshold value representing a dhaka resident was assigned by random draw from the kernel density distributions fit to the thresholds measured by crider et al 2018 the decision to accept or reject the chlorinated water was modeled as follows for each dose applied to the selected sample if the assigned taste acceptability threshold value exceeded the measured residual free chlorine in the sample the water chlorinated at that dose was accepted exposure at that dose was thus modeled as the measured e coli and the estimated thm concentrations in the chlorinated water if the assigned taste acceptability threshold value was less than or equal to the measured residual free chlorine in the sample the chlorinated water was rejected at that dose exposure at that dose was thus modeled as the measured e coli in the untreated water and a thm concentration of zero the simulation was run 10 000 times to estimate the proportion of dhaka residents who would based on their acceptance or rejection of water chlorinated at each dose be exposed to i e coli 1 cfu 100ml the widely accepted health based standard for e coli in drinking water bangladesh department of public health engineering 2021 us epa 2020 who 2017 and ii thms we used matlab r2018a with functions from the statistics and machine learning toolbox mathworks massachusetts usa for the monte carlo simulation and stata i c 15 1 stata corp texas usa for statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 e coli and residual chlorine e coli were detected in 86 of 100 86 samples of untreated piped water exceeding the standard of e coli 1 cfu 100 ml supplementary table s1 concentrations in untreated water spanned five orders of magnitude from 1 to 164 000 cfu 100 ml with a median of 97 cfu 100 ml chlorine demand the amount of chlorine consumed during disinfection in most samples was low as indicated by free and total chlorine residuals that tended to remain close to the dose supplementary table s1 at a dose of 2 mg l for example the median free chlorine residual was 1 78 mg l one hour after dosing and 1 69 mg l 24 h after dosing these results suggest that the water on average had low levels of dissolved organic carbon and or metals and other compounds that react with chlorine black veatch corporation 2010 after one hour of chlorine contact e coli were not detected in 92 of the 600 dosed samples supplementary table s1 the 90th percentile e coli concentration was non detectable for all chlorine doses except the lowest 0 25 mg l cl2 whose value was at the 1 cfu 100 ml detection limit however e coli were detected in some samples at each chlorine dose with no apparent trend in maximum concentrations for doses higher than 0 25 mg l 3 2 thms thm concentrations increased asymptotically with dose supplementary fig s4 no measured thm concentration exceeded the u s epa maximum contaminant level of 80 µg l us epa 2020 nor the less stringent who guideline who 2017 bangladesh does not currently have a standard for thms the maximum thm concentration for chlorine doses less than or equal to 3 0 mg l cl2 which was also the maximum dose tested for e coli inactivation was 36 µg l these results consistent with those for residual chlorine indicate low concentrations of dissolved organic matter in the water sampled 3 3 monte carlo simulation results the monte carlo simulation generated three outputs for both distributions of taste acceptability thresholds employed the proportion of dhaka residents who would accept the taste of chlorinated drinking water for each of six chlorine doses or reject it in favor of untreated water and based on that decision their exposure to e coli 1 and thms for each dose 3 3 1 taste acceptability greater than 78 of simulated instances for doses 1 0 mg l had free chlorine residual concentrations of acceptable taste counting results both one and 24 h after dosing for both taste acceptability threshold distributions fig 2 at a dose of 2 0 mg l the proportion with chlorine residual concentrations of acceptable taste dropped to 60 62 using the modified taste acceptability distribution and 40 45 using the original distribution at a dose of 3 0 mg l 42 of instances had chlorine residual concentrations of acceptable taste using the modified distribution compared to 14 using the original distribution 3 3 2 simulated e coli and thm exposure fig 3 a presents predicted frequencies of fecal contamination and thm exposure across the six chlorine doses tested following the conventional assumption that households will not reject chlorinated water in this scenario all chlorine doses reduce exposure to e coli with doses 0 25 mg l cl2 having a slightly higher effect thm exposure increases monotonically with dose thm concentrations were below the u s epa maximum contaminant level of 80 µg l in all simulated instances except 0 04 of those at a dose of 3 mg l cl2 for which they were 83 µg l supplementary fig s6 fig 3b and c present the predicted frequencies of exposure when the possibility of rejecting chlorinated water in favor of untreated water due to unacceptable chlorine taste is simulated notably a dose of 0 5 mg l minimizes the frequency of exposure to concentrations of e coli 1 cfu 100 ml chlorine doses higher than 0 5 mg l result in increasing exposure to fecal contamination a dose of 2 mg l results in exposure to e coli 1 cfu 100ml at least 30 more frequently than a dose of 0 5 mg l mean simulated e coli concentrations increase monotonically with dose supplementary fig s5 in the scenario where rejecting chlorinated water is possible fig 3b and c show that exposure to thms is maximized at an intermediate chlorine dose the thm maximum occurs because the increasing proportion of people who would reject water with higher chlorine doses and thus avoid exposure to thms offsets the higher thm concentrations that people who do accept water chlorinated with higher doses would ingest the value of 5 µg l for thms selected for fig 3 does not represent a specific health based exposure threshold for cancer risk it serves solely as an example to illustrate our finding that thm exposure was maximized at intermediate chlorine doses across all simulated conditions supplementary fig s6 4 discussion failing to consider how people will react to the taste of chlorinated water can lead to inflated projections of the public health benefits of introducing chlorine disinfection for drinking water in our analysis a chlorine dose 75 lower than the 2 mg l as cl2 often applied for household water treatment in lmics minimized exposure to fecal contamination indeed our model predicts that dosing at 2 mg l would result in 38 60 of dhaka residents refusing to drink the chlorinated water which would result in their being exposed to the less safe untreated water available to them using a lower chlorine dose would also reduce residents exposure to thms because thm concentration was positively associated with chlorine dose up to a dose of 1 2 mg l fig 3b and c our results are also useful to compare with more flexible household chlorination dosing guidelines that target a range of free chlorine residual rather than specify a dose lantagne 2008 the u s centers for disease control cdc for example recommends dosing for household water treatment such that residual free chlorine is 2 0 mg l after 30 min of contact time and 0 2 mg l after 24 h us 2020a among the doses we tested the one that produced water in compliance with the cdc guideline most frequently was 1 5 mg l 92 of samples assuming our one hour values can be used for the 30 minute criterion supplementary fig s7 a dose of 0 5 mg l produced water in compliance with the cdc guideline in 72 of samples but according to our analysis dhaka residents are 22 36 more likely to drink water dosed at 0 5 mg l than 1 5 mg l fig 1 this difference in taste acceptability is enough to result in lower exposure to both e coli and thms after dosing with 0 5 mg l than dosing following the cdc s guideline our results are robust to different specifications we tested for both the distribution of taste acceptability threshold values and the model used to estimate thm concentrations we modified the original taste acceptability threshold data measured by crider et al 2018 to expand the range of free chlorine concentrations that we assumed dhaka residents would accept but we also obtain the same substantive conclusions using the original data alternative regression model specifications yielded somewhat different magnitudes and variances of predicted thm concentrations but all resulted in maximum thm exposure at intermediate doses 1 0 2 0 mg l notably all simulated thm concentrations were lower than international standards except a negligible proportion at a dose of 3 mg l supplementary fig s6 our findings align with and build upon those from previous research on the intersection of water quality and treatment behavior and health risk several studies utilizing quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to estimate the health effects of water consumption choices have found that even short lapses in drinking treated water may sharply reduce the health gains expected from disinfection brown and clasen 2012 enger et al 2013 2012 hunter et al 2009 studies using empirical data also found that periodic service interruptions eliminate much of the health benefit of piped water supply jeandron et al 2015 trudeau et al 2018 a study that incorporated decision theory to qmra analysis following logic similar to ours found that sacrificing pathogen removal efficacy so that people use household water treatment products more consistently usually reduced the risk of diarrheal disease hayashi et al 2019 the important role that user preference for low chlorine taste plays in the acceptance of new water treatment interventions has also been documented in field trials across several contexts in guatemala the first of two trials of a flocculant disinfectant product for household water treatment used a dose of 3 5 mg l as cl2 reller et al 2003 the second trial used a dose to 2 mg l to reduce chlorine taste which resulted in more consistent use of the product and a larger reduction in diarrheal disease chiller et al 2006 in dhaka a series of three trials of point of collection chlorination at shared water points began with a dose of 2 0 mg l the dose was later reduced in response to residents complaints about chlorine taste amin et al 2016 pickering et al 2019 2015 the third trial which dosed chlorine at about 0 6 mg l on average assuming a similar chlorine demand as we measured resulted in a 23 reduction of child diarrhea incidence pickering et al 2019 in refugee settlements in bangladesh most respondents disliked water treated with a dose of 2 0 mg l leading the researchers to conclude that a lower dose would have led to more consistent use of chlorinated water chlorine tablet working group 2019 our results build on these studies by suggesting that for a given context there is a theoretically optimal chlorine dose lower than 2 mg l at which the combined likelihoods of people drinking chlorinated water consistently and microbiological inactivation minimize population level exposure to pathogens dosing at this optimum would also reduce exposure to dbps including thms an important limitation of this study and for the generalizability of the results is that the piped water samples were sourced from deep aquifers most samples had low dbp formation potential and chlorine demand suggesting low concentrations of dissolved organic matter despite evident intrusion of wastewater into the distribution system that contaminated most samples with e coli all else held constant low chlorine demand allows a relatively low dose of chlorine to maintain the residual needed for disinfection low dbp concentrations suggest a low likelihood of taste related objections stemming from compounds other than free chlorine further research is needed to clarify the relationships between chlorine dose user acceptability and exposure to fecal contamination and dbps in waters with higher and more variable concentrations of dissolved organic matter under these conditions it is unclear whether doses that achieve acceptable taste would also result in substantially lower exposure to microbiological contamination this limitation is relevant in many water systems in lmics including in dhaka where a growing share of the population receives piped water from rivers sharma and alipalo 2017 and elsewhere in south asia where wastewater impacts to water sources result in higher dbp concentrations furst et al 2019 despite this limitation our results are informative for chlorination initiatives in the many parts of south asia and lmics where water supplies share traits with that of dhaka around half of the global population including 80 of the south asian population is estimated to rely on groundwater for drinking morris et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2021 unesco 2003 drilled wells with handpumps supply most rural households in bangladesh and pakistan duchanois et al 2019 and are the most common type of drinking water infrastructure in rural africa macarthur 2015 in southeast asia and pacific nations groundwater is the primary source for 79 of households including 66 of urban households carrard et al 2019 most megacities cities with populations 10 million like dhaka also depend on groundwater for part of their water supply morris et al 2003 these groundwater supplies like the one in our study site are likely to have low concentrations of dissolved organic matter many piped groundwater supplies in lmics lack consistent centralized treatment the intermittency in dhaka that permits fecal contamination to enter the piped supply is also the norm in cities in lmics affecting an estimated 925 million people with the highest proportion in south asia bivins et al 2017 mckenzieb and ray 2009 future studies and implementation of chlorination in areas with these characteristics could find our results helpful to inform their dosing strategies research using our method or an improved version thereof could be conducted to check the generalizability of our findings to similar water supply scenarios as well as estimate the tradeoffs between chlorine taste disinfection efficacy and dbp formation in waters with higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter additional study limitations should be noted we assumed that people accepted or rejected chlorinated water based exclusively on taste jeuland et al 2015 people may make that decision for other reasons including cost and the inconvenience of chlorinating their own water we assumed that people reverted to using untreated water from the same source if chlorine taste was unacceptable as have other researchers brown and clasen 2012 enger et al 2013 hayashi et al 2019 hunter et al 2009 and measured the tradeoffs between chlorine demand e coli and thms in controlled laboratory settings we did not consider the potential for the introduction of microbes trevett et al 2005 or dissolved organic matter post chlorination we used taste acceptability data from a sample of residents of an informal settlement who may not accurately represent dhaka s entire population though their sensitivity to chlorine taste is within the range measured elsewhere mackey et al 2004 piriou et al 2015 2004 lastly we relied on e coli as an indicator of microbiological quality rather than measuring pathogens some pathogens are less susceptible than e coli to chlorine who 2017 in dhaka several waterborne pathogens susceptible to chlorine are endemic acharjee et al 2014 hashizume et al 2008 ram et al 2007 rashid et al 2016 talukdar et al 2013 us cdc 2020b suggesting that e coli is a valid indicator of microbiological water quality in this context 5 conclusion by incorporating a taste based decision into the analysis of the tradeoff between microbiological inactivation and dbp formation when chlorinating intermittently supplied groundwater subject to wastewater infiltration in dhaka we find a different relationship between chlorine dose and exposures than conventionally assumed accounting for chlorine taste aversion indicates that microbiological exposure increases and dbp exposure decreases above certain doses as a higher proportion of people reject chlorinated water under these conditions there are doses that result in minimum microbiological exposure and maximum dbp exposure taken together with findings from modeling analyses empirical studies and chlorination field trials our findings suggest that taste acceptability should be a critical consideration in establishing chlorination dosing guidelines that aim to minimize population level exposure to both fecal contamination and dbps applying the general dosing recommendation of 2 mg l for household chlorination of low turbidity waters could prevent people from adopting treated water in dhaka and places with similar water supplies due to excessive chlorine taste particularly when chlorination is first implemented in water supplies with low chlorine demand lower doses would help avoid taste related objections while still meaningfully reducing contaminant exposure although people likely become habituated to chlorine taste piriou et al 2015 how fast and the extent to which habituation occurs among people who begin to use chlorinated water and thus how soon they may tolerate higher doses remains unclear future work on these questions would enable more accurate and long term simulations across multiple contexts as well as further guide efforts to expand access to chlorinated water

16516,expanding drinking water chlorination could substantially reduce the burden of disease in low and middle income countries but the taste of chlorinated water often impedes adoption we developed a monte carlo simulation to estimate the effect of people s choice to accept or reject drinking water based on chlorine taste and their subsequent exposure to e coli and trihalomethanes a class of disinfection byproduct dbp the simulation used empirical data from dhaka bangladesh a megacity with endemic waterborne disease we drew on published taste acceptability thresholds from dhaka residents measured residual chlorine and thermotolerant e coli inactivation following the addition of six chlorine doses 0 25 3 0 mg l as cl2 to untreated piped water samples from 100 locations and analyzed trihalomethane formation in 54 samples a dose of 0 5 mg l 75 lower than the 2 mg l dose typically recommended for household chlorination of low turbidity waters minimized overall exposure to e coli doses of 1 2 mg l maximized overall exposure to trihalomethanes accounting for chlorine taste aversion indicates that microbiological exposure increases and dbp exposure decreases above certain doses as a higher proportion of people reject chlorinated water in favor of untreated water taken together with findings from other modeling analyses empirical studies and field trials our results suggest that taste acceptability should be a critical consideration in establishing chlorination dosing guidelines particularly when chlorination is first implemented in water supplies with low chlorine

the overall health risk from dbps however is acknowledged to be lower than that from exposure to waterborne pathogens in untreated water havelaar et al 2000 who 2017 we hypothesized that applying chlorine doses lower than the 2 mg l often used in household water treatment could reduce a population s overall exposure to both dbps and fecal contamination in water supplies applying lower doses of chlorine reduces the formation of dbps liang and singer 2003 treatment with chlorine imparts taste and odor to water hereafter termed chlorine taste that has been shown to impede the acceptance of chlorinated water in lmics jeuland et al 2015 mitro et al 2019 nagata et al 2011 successive field trials of chlorination among households in guatemala and at shared water points in dhaka reduced chlorine doses to increase acceptability the lower doses significantly reduced child diarrhea amin et al 2016 chiller et al 2006 pickering et al 2019 2015 reller et al 2003 reactions of chlorine with dissolved organic matter can also form odorants such as chlorophenols who 2017 that contribute significantly to unpleasant flavor in water where households have multiple water sources available a common scenario in much of the world elliott et al 2019 dosing chlorine at 2 mg l may lead people to reject disinfected water in favor of untreated options that are more likely to be fecally contaminated we estimated the effect of chlorine taste on the choice by households in dhaka to use chlorinated versus untreated piped water and their resulting exposure to fecal contamination and thms waterborne disease is endemic in dhaka talukdar et al 2013 as is common in lmics bivins et al 2017 most dhaka households use intermittently supplied piped groundwater that can become fecally contaminated in the distribution system we developed a monte carlo simulation that incorporated published chlorine taste acceptability threshold concentrations from dhaka residents crider et al 2018 along with newly collected data on the concentration of thms and fecal indicator bacteria specifically e coli in samples of untreated water and water chlorinated in the lab our primary objectives were to create a model of people s decision to accept or reject the taste of chlorinated water across a range of chlorine doses and to estimate their resulting exposures to e coli and thms we use our model outputs to identify the chlorine dose for household water treatment that would minimize exposure to fecal contamination in dhaka 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sample frame dhaka the capital of bangladesh has a fast growing metropolitan population of approximately 20 million un 2018 the dhaka water supply and sewerage authority dwasa a public utility delivers water to 65 75 of the metropolitan population through a piped water network in spite of service improvements over the last 15 years the piped water supply is intermittent i e provided 24 h day centralized chlorination is limited and fecal sludge management is poor peal et al 2014 over 700 deep groundwater pumping stations 100 to 400 meters deep supply more than 80 of the piped water four surface water treatment plants provide the remainder sharma and alipalo 2017 at the time of study most groundwater pumping stations lacked chlorination equipment and some that had chlorination equipment were not using it the intermittent supply allows wastewater and stormwater to infiltrate the pipe network which introduces fecal contamination and organic matter to the water supply household water supply in dhaka is thus characterized by fecal contamination the absence of chlorine residual and the potential for high concentrations of organic matter even where deep groundwater is the source acharjee et al 2014 amin et al 2019 haq 2006 sharma and alipalo 2017 talukdar et al 2013 the persistently poor microbiological water quality in dhaka has motivated a series of water treatment intervention trials as well as coping behaviors among residents household water treatment trials have used imported and locally available chlorine tablets and liquid bleach with doses of 2 mg l as cl2 clasen et al 2007 luoto et al 2011 rashid et al 2016 thomas et al 2020 technologies to chlorinate water in housing compounds at the point where people collect it such as shared taps and handpumps have also been tested amin et al 2016 pickering et al 2019 2015 these trials found that chlorine doses of 2 mg l resulted in frequent taste complaints yet dhaka residents chlorine taste detection thresholds are similar to those in the usa and higher than those in france and spain crider et al 2018 mackey et al 2004 piriou et al 2015 2004 suggesting this population is no more sensitive to chlorine taste than others for which comparable data are available boiling is common throughout dhaka and many high income households purchase point of use membrane filters alternative water sources including vended water private wells and ponds are available but usually have microbiological contamination ahmed et al 2014 amin et al 2019 with different sources and treatment options available dhaka households can thus opt to use water with or without chlorine based on their preferences our study site comprises 4 km2 1 of the city and is illustrative of water supply conditions that most dhaka residents experience additional sample frame details in si and map in supplementary fig s1 the site has 23 deep groundwater pumping stations that supply untreated water to the intermittently pressurized pipe network each pumping station in the study site was screened in person to confirm that no chlorination was occurring one hundred sampling locations at residential buildings were established on a geographic grid within the site using the fishnet tool in arcmap 10 5 1 esri california usa water was collected from two of these locations per day visited in a randomized order from august to november 2018 a period which spanned the end of the rainy season and beginning of the dry season the absence of total chlorine in water samples was confirmed in the field by the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method using a lamotte dc1500 cl colorimeter maryland usa 2 2 data utilized in the monte carlo simulation we developed a monte carlo simulation of dhaka residents decision to accept or reject drinking water treated with six different chlorine doses and estimated their resulting exposure to waterborne fecal contamination and thms table 1 presents the data collection and analysis methods for the four types of data used in the simulation summarized below additional details in si 1 residual chlorine we applied chlorine as naocl to six samples of untreated municipal piped water from each of the 100 sampling locations using doses ranging from 0 25 to 3 0 mg l cl2 supplementary fig s2 the dosing range included values drawn from previous trials of chlorination in dhaka 0 5 to 2 0 mg l clasen et al 2007 pickering et al 2019 2015 rashid et al 2016 plus one lower and one higher dose we measured residual free and total chlorine concentration in each sample after one n 600 and 24 h n 600 of contact time control samples from each location that were not dosed with chlorine were also tested after one n 100 and 24 h n 100 all samples were stored in capped bottles at ambient temperature 24 h is the maximum storage time recommended for maintaining free residual chlorine in most household water treatment guidelines wilhelm et al 2018 lab blanks of deionized water n 300 and sample replicates n 11 were tested for free chlorine simultaneously with the samples to confirm dosing accuracy qa qc details in si all glassware was sterilized by autoclave made chlorine demand free by immersion in a dilute chlorine solution and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water before use 2 thermotolerant e coli we measured e coli concentrations by membrane filtration in paired samples of untreated and chlorinated water from each of the 100 locations for each of the six chlorine doses after one hour of contact time n 700 supplementary fig s2 e coli concentration in drinking water is the most commonly used health based indicator of microbiological quality and is correlated with child diarrhea gruber et al 2014 luby et al 2015 the standard for drinking water safety in bangladesh is e coli 1 colony forming unit cfu 100ml consistent with international guidelines bangladesh department of public health engineering 2021 us epa 2020 who 2017 qa qc testing suggested that the sampling and analytical methods for e coli were valid and reliable si e coli and residual chlorine analyses were conducted at the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research bangladesh icddr b in dhaka 3 thms we measured thm concentrations in samples that were collected from 54 locations and that we treated with chlorine doses as naocl ranging from 0 5 to 8 0 mg l as cl2 n 139 twenty sampling locations were among the 100 for residual chlorine and e coli sampling samples from an additional 34 residential buildings were also included to better represent thm formation potential in dhaka s water supply these buildings were near the 100 locations sampled for residual chlorine and e coli also received untreated municipal piped water from groundwater sources and were sampled across the rainy and dry seasons supplementary fig s1 we measured thm concentrations after 24 h of contact time including in non chlorinated controls n 16 thm analyses were conducted at stanford university usa after transporting filtered water samples on ice from dhaka time and budget constraints precluded evaluation of thm formation for all sites and chlorine doses we fit a linear hierarchical mixed effects regression model to the measured values and used it to predict thm concentration for each monte carlo simulation cycle as a function of the chlorine dose applied to a given sample analytical and computational details in si 4 chlorine taste acceptability threshold we fit empirical kernel density distributions to the concentrations of free chlorine at which 50 residents of an informal settlement in dhaka supplied with dwasa water said they would seek an alternative source of drinking water in a previous blinded taste test crider et al 2018 crider et al 2018 used 3 alternative forced choice tests an astm international standard procedure astm international 2011 to evaluate participants taste acceptability thresholds of free chlorine participants were presented with three sets of three samples of bottled water in which one sample per set was spiked with a known concentration of free chlorine and asked to identify the chlorinated samples the test was repeated with increasing free chlorine concentrations of 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mg l respondents were also asked to rate using ordinal categories from definitely to definitely not the likelihood that they would seek an alternative water source if the taste of samples were representative of the water at their primary drinking water source crider et al 2018 p 843 we use the lowest free chlorine concentration at which respondents said they probably or definitely would seek an alternative source as the taste acceptability threshold value additional details in si although the taste of free chlorine in bottled water is an imperfect proxy for the taste of chlorinated piped water which could include tastes of combined chlorine and dbps the data from crider et al 2018 are the best available with which to specify a distribution of taste acceptability thresholds additionally utilizing free chlorine concentration as the only criterion likely overestimates taste acceptability as any other compounds formed by chlorination would add to the taste of the water in order to base our acceptability threshold values exclusively on chlorine concentrations tested by crider et al 2018 we would need to assume that most dhaka residents would reject the taste of water with free chlorine concentrations greater than 2 mg l the highest concentration evaluated in that study instead we modified the fitted distribution to set the cumulative probability of taste acceptability at the maximum dose we tested 3 0 mg l to be equivalent to that of 2 0 mg l in crider et al 2018 supplementary fig s3 this modified kernel density distribution thus includes a more conservative upper bound on taste acceptability it assumes that there is no free chlorine residual value below 5 mg l at which taste acceptability goes to zero we ran the monte carlo simulation using both the original and modified distributions to assess the sensitivity of our results to the choice of specification 2 3 monte carlo simulation each cycle of the monte carlo simulation began by randomly selecting an untreated water sample fig 1 the measured e coli concentration of that sample before chlorination and the measured residual free chlorine and e coli concentration after applying each of the six chlorine doses was used to represent the biological quality of untreated and chlorinated water that could be delivered a taste acceptability threshold value representing a dhaka resident was assigned by random draw from the kernel density distributions fit to the thresholds measured by crider et al 2018 the decision to accept or reject the chlorinated water was modeled as follows for each dose applied to the selected sample if the assigned taste acceptability threshold value exceeded the measured residual free chlorine in the sample the water chlorinated at that dose was accepted exposure at that dose was thus modeled as the measured e coli and the estimated thm concentrations in the chlorinated water if the assigned taste acceptability threshold value was less than or equal to the measured residual free chlorine in the sample the chlorinated water was rejected at that dose exposure at that dose was thus modeled as the measured e coli in the untreated water and a thm concentration of zero the simulation was run 10 000 times to estimate the proportion of dhaka residents who would based on their acceptance or rejection of water chlorinated at each dose be exposed to i e coli 1 cfu 100ml the widely accepted health based standard for e coli in drinking water bangladesh department of public health engineering 2021 us epa 2020 who 2017 and ii thms we used matlab r2018a with functions from the statistics and machine learning toolbox mathworks massachusetts usa for the monte carlo simulation and stata i c 15 1 stata corp texas usa for statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 e coli and residual chlorine e coli were detected in 86 of 100 86 samples of untreated piped water exceeding the standard of e coli 1 cfu 100 ml supplementary table s1 concentrations in untreated water spanned five orders of magnitude from 1 to 164 000 cfu 100 ml with a median of 97 cfu 100 ml chlorine demand the amount of chlorine consumed during disinfection in most samples was low as indicated by free and total chlorine residuals that tended to remain close to the dose supplementary table s1 at a dose of 2 mg l for example the median free chlorine residual was 1 78 mg l one hour after dosing and 1 69 mg l 24 h after dosing these results suggest that the water on average had low levels of dissolved organic carbon and or metals and other compounds that react with chlorine black veatch corporation 2010 after one hour of chlorine contact e coli were not detected in 92 of the 600 dosed samples supplementary table s1 the 90th percentile e coli concentration was non detectable for all chlorine doses except the lowest 0 25 mg l cl2 whose value was at the 1 cfu 100 ml detection limit however e coli were detected in some samples at each chlorine dose with no apparent trend in maximum concentrations for doses higher than 0 25 mg l 3 2 thms thm concentrations increased asymptotically with dose supplementary fig s4 no measured thm concentration exceeded the u s epa maximum contaminant level of 80 µg l us epa 2020 nor the less stringent who guideline who 2017 bangladesh does not currently have a standard for thms the maximum thm concentration for chlorine doses less than or equal to 3 0 mg l cl2 which was also the maximum dose tested for e coli inactivation was 36 µg l these results consistent with those for residual chlorine indicate low concentrations of dissolved organic matter in the water sampled 3 3 monte carlo simulation results the monte carlo simulation generated three outputs for both distributions of taste acceptability thresholds employed the proportion of dhaka residents who would accept the taste of chlorinated drinking water for each of six chlorine doses or reject it in favor of untreated water and based on that decision their exposure to e coli 1 and thms for each dose 3 3 1 taste acceptability greater than 78 of simulated instances for doses 1 0 mg l had free chlorine residual concentrations of acceptable taste counting results both one and 24 h after dosing for both taste acceptability threshold distributions fig 2 at a dose of 2 0 mg l the proportion with chlorine residual concentrations of acceptable taste dropped to 60 62 using the modified taste acceptability distribution and 40 45 using the original distribution at a dose of 3 0 mg l 42 of instances had chlorine residual concentrations of acceptable taste using the modified distribution compared to 14 using the original distribution 3 3 2 simulated e coli and thm exposure fig 3 a presents predicted frequencies of fecal contamination and thm exposure across the six chlorine doses tested following the conventional assumption that households will not reject chlorinated water in this scenario all chlorine doses reduce exposure to e coli with doses 0 25 mg l cl2 having a slightly higher effect thm exposure increases monotonically with dose thm concentrations were below the u s epa maximum contaminant level of 80 µg l in all simulated instances except 0 04 of those at a dose of 3 mg l cl2 for which they were 83 µg l supplementary fig s6 fig 3b and c present the predicted frequencies of exposure when the possibility of rejecting chlorinated water in favor of untreated water due to unacceptable chlorine taste is simulated notably a dose of 0 5 mg l minimizes the frequency of exposure to concentrations of e coli 1 cfu 100 ml chlorine doses higher than 0 5 mg l result in increasing exposure to fecal contamination a dose of 2 mg l results in exposure to e coli 1 cfu 100ml at least 30 more frequently than a dose of 0 5 mg l mean simulated e coli concentrations increase monotonically with dose supplementary fig s5 in the scenario where rejecting chlorinated water is possible fig 3b and c show that exposure to thms is maximized at an intermediate chlorine dose the thm maximum occurs because the increasing proportion of people who would reject water with higher chlorine doses and thus avoid exposure to thms offsets the higher thm concentrations that people who do accept water chlorinated with higher doses would ingest the value of 5 µg l for thms selected for fig 3 does not represent a specific health based exposure threshold for cancer risk it serves solely as an example to illustrate our finding that thm exposure was maximized at intermediate chlorine doses across all simulated conditions supplementary fig s6 4 discussion failing to consider how people will react to the taste of chlorinated water can lead to inflated projections of the public health benefits of introducing chlorine disinfection for drinking water in our analysis a chlorine dose 75 lower than the 2 mg l as cl2 often applied for household water treatment in lmics minimized exposure to fecal contamination indeed our model predicts that dosing at 2 mg l would result in 38 60 of dhaka residents refusing to drink the chlorinated water which would result in their being exposed to the less safe untreated water available to them using a lower chlorine dose would also reduce residents exposure to thms because thm concentration was positively associated with chlorine dose up to a dose of 1 2 mg l fig 3b and c our results are also useful to compare with more flexible household chlorination dosing guidelines that target a range of free chlorine residual rather than specify a dose lantagne 2008 the u s centers for disease control cdc for example recommends dosing for household water treatment such that residual free chlorine is 2 0 mg l after 30 min of contact time and 0 2 mg l after 24 h us 2020a among the doses we tested the one that produced water in compliance with the cdc guideline most frequently was 1 5 mg l 92 of samples assuming our one hour values can be used for the 30 minute criterion supplementary fig s7 a dose of 0 5 mg l produced water in compliance with the cdc guideline in 72 of samples but according to our analysis dhaka residents are 22 36 more likely to drink water dosed at 0 5 mg l than 1 5 mg l fig 1 this difference in taste acceptability is enough to result in lower exposure to both e coli and thms after dosing with 0 5 mg l than dosing following the cdc s guideline our results are robust to different specifications we tested for both the distribution of taste acceptability threshold values and the model used to estimate thm concentrations we modified the original taste acceptability threshold data measured by crider et al 2018 to expand the range of free chlorine concentrations that we assumed dhaka residents would accept but we also obtain the same substantive conclusions using the original data alternative regression model specifications yielded somewhat different magnitudes and variances of predicted thm concentrations but all resulted in maximum thm exposure at intermediate doses 1 0 2 0 mg l notably all simulated thm concentrations were lower than international standards except a negligible proportion at a dose of 3 mg l supplementary fig s6 our findings align with and build upon those from previous research on the intersection of water quality and treatment behavior and health risk several studies utilizing quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to estimate the health effects of water consumption choices have found that even short lapses in drinking treated water may sharply reduce the health gains expected from disinfection brown and clasen 2012 enger et al 2013 2012 hunter et al 2009 studies using empirical data also found that periodic service interruptions eliminate much of the health benefit of piped water supply jeandron et al 2015 trudeau et al 2018 a study that incorporated decision theory to qmra analysis following logic similar to ours found that sacrificing pathogen removal efficacy so that people use household water treatment products more consistently usually reduced the risk of diarrheal disease hayashi et al 2019 the important role that user preference for low chlorine taste plays in the acceptance of new water treatment interventions has also been documented in field trials across several contexts in guatemala the first of two trials of a flocculant disinfectant product for household water treatment used a dose of 3 5 mg l as cl2 reller et al 2003 the second trial used a dose to 2 mg l to reduce chlorine taste which resulted in more consistent use of the product and a larger reduction in diarrheal disease chiller et al 2006 in dhaka a series of three trials of point of collection chlorination at shared water points began with a dose of 2 0 mg l the dose was later reduced in response to residents complaints about chlorine taste amin et al 2016 pickering et al 2019 2015 the third trial which dosed chlorine at about 0 6 mg l on average assuming a similar chlorine demand as we measured resulted in a 23 reduction of child diarrhea incidence pickering et al 2019 in refugee settlements in bangladesh most respondents disliked water treated with a dose of 2 0 mg l leading the researchers to conclude that a lower dose would have led to more consistent use of chlorinated water chlorine tablet working group 2019 our results build on these studies by suggesting that for a given context there is a theoretically optimal chlorine dose lower than 2 mg l at which the combined likelihoods of people drinking chlorinated water consistently and microbiological inactivation minimize population level exposure to pathogens dosing at this optimum would also reduce exposure to dbps including thms an important limitation of this study and for the generalizability of the results is that the piped water samples were sourced from deep aquifers most samples had low dbp formation potential and chlorine demand suggesting low concentrations of dissolved organic matter despite evident intrusion of wastewater into the distribution system that contaminated most samples with e coli all else held constant low chlorine demand allows a relatively low dose of chlorine to maintain the residual needed for disinfection low dbp concentrations suggest a low likelihood of taste related objections stemming from compounds other than free chlorine further research is needed to clarify the relationships between chlorine dose user acceptability and exposure to fecal contamination and dbps in waters with higher and more variable concentrations of dissolved organic matter under these conditions it is unclear whether doses that achieve acceptable taste would also result in substantially lower exposure to microbiological contamination this limitation is relevant in many water systems in lmics including in dhaka where a growing share of the population receives piped water from rivers sharma and alipalo 2017 and elsewhere in south asia where wastewater impacts to water sources result in higher dbp concentrations furst et al 2019 despite this limitation our results are informative for chlorination initiatives in the many parts of south asia and lmics where water supplies share traits with that of dhaka around half of the global population including 80 of the south asian population is estimated to rely on groundwater for drinking morris et al 2003 mukherjee et al 2021 unesco 2003 drilled wells with handpumps supply most rural households in bangladesh and pakistan duchanois et al 2019 and are the most common type of drinking water infrastructure in rural africa macarthur 2015 in southeast asia and pacific nations groundwater is the primary source for 79 of households including 66 of urban households carrard et al 2019 most megacities cities with populations 10 million like dhaka also depend on groundwater for part of their water supply morris et al 2003 these groundwater supplies like the one in our study site are likely to have low concentrations of dissolved organic matter many piped groundwater supplies in lmics lack consistent centralized treatment the intermittency in dhaka that permits fecal contamination to enter the piped supply is also the norm in cities in lmics affecting an estimated 925 million people with the highest proportion in south asia bivins et al 2017 mckenzieb and ray 2009 future studies and implementation of chlorination in areas with these characteristics could find our results helpful to inform their dosing strategies research using our method or an improved version thereof could be conducted to check the generalizability of our findings to similar water supply scenarios as well as estimate the tradeoffs between chlorine taste disinfection efficacy and dbp formation in waters with higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter additional study limitations should be noted we assumed that people accepted or rejected chlorinated water based exclusively on taste jeuland et al 2015 people may make that decision for other reasons including cost and the inconvenience of chlorinating their own water we assumed that people reverted to using untreated water from the same source if chlorine taste was unacceptable as have other researchers brown and clasen 2012 enger et al 2013 hayashi et al 2019 hunter et al 2009 and measured the tradeoffs between chlorine demand e coli and thms in controlled laboratory settings we did not consider the potential for the introduction of microbes trevett et al 2005 or dissolved organic matter post chlorination we used taste acceptability data from a sample of residents of an informal settlement who may not accurately represent dhaka s entire population though their sensitivity to chlorine taste is within the range measured elsewhere mackey et al 2004 piriou et al 2015 2004 lastly we relied on e coli as an indicator of microbiological quality rather than measuring pathogens some pathogens are less susceptible than e coli to chlorine who 2017 in dhaka several waterborne pathogens susceptible to chlorine are endemic acharjee et al 2014 hashizume et al 2008 ram et al 2007 rashid et al 2016 talukdar et al 2013 us cdc 2020b suggesting that e coli is a valid indicator of microbiological water quality in this context 5 conclusion by incorporating a taste based decision into the analysis of the tradeoff between microbiological inactivation and dbp formation when chlorinating intermittently supplied groundwater subject to wastewater infiltration in dhaka we find a different relationship between chlorine dose and exposures than conventionally assumed accounting for chlorine taste aversion indicates that microbiological exposure increases and dbp exposure decreases above certain doses as a higher proportion of people reject chlorinated water under these conditions there are doses that result in minimum microbiological exposure and maximum dbp exposure taken together with findings from modeling analyses empirical studies and chlorination field trials our findings suggest that taste acceptability should be a critical consideration in establishing chlorination dosing guidelines that aim to minimize population level exposure to both fecal contamination and dbps applying the general dosing recommendation of 2 mg l for household chlorination of low turbidity waters could prevent people from adopting treated water in dhaka and places with similar water supplies due to excessive chlorine taste particularly when chlorination is first implemented in water supplies with low chlorine demand lower doses would help avoid taste related objections while still meaningfully reducing contaminant exposure although people likely become habituated to chlorine taste piriou et al 2015 how fast and the extent to which habituation occurs among people who begin to use chlorinated water and thus how soon they may tolerate higher doses remains unclear future work on these questions would enable more accurate and long term simulations across multiple contexts as well as further guide efforts to expand access to chlorinated water

16517,although anion exchange resin aer treatment is considered an effective technology for removing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass from impacted water the environmental impacts associated with aer regeneration have not been systematically explored in particular the trade offs of altering the composition of the regeneration solution and disposing of or recycling the waste regeneration solution are not known to fill these important gaps in the literature this research conducted a comparative life cycle assessment lca of an aer based pfas remediation system with different regeneration scenarios including disposing of waste regeneration solution via incineration reusing the organic cosolvent and brine fractions of the waste regeneration solution and altering the composition of the regeneration solution to avoid organic cosolvent or nacl the results show that disposing of waste regeneration solution via incineration without recycling organic cosolvent or brine had the greatest environmental impact and that incineration accounted for the greatest impact among contributing processes recycling of the cosolvent or cosolvent and brine fraction of the waste regeneration solution resulted in lower environmental impacts due to reduced mass of waste disposed of via incineration replacing nacl in the brine with an alternative salt resulted in higher environmental impacts with salts derived from chemical production such as ammonium chloride and potassium carbonate showing the largest increases in impacts the results of this research highlight the importance of understanding the fate of pfass during incineration and the need for pfas destruction technologies that can be coupled to aer regeneration to avoid incineration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater remediation incineration life cycle assessment lca methanol perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos 1 introduction many countries are concerned about the contamination of groundwater with per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass banzhaf et al 2017 crone et al 2019 toms et al 2019 the concerns come from the adverse health effects associated with exposure to pfass in water including cancer reproductive and developmental effects and immunological effects pelch et al 2019 the regulatory status of pfass is evolving with countries and states regions within countries assessing the extent of contamination and considering new regulatory determinations the two most widely detected and studied pfass are perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos which are members of the perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa group of pfass buck et al 2011 pontius 2019 a variety of physical chemical processes have been explored for pfas removal from drinking water sources and for groundwater remediation ahmed et al 2020 banks et al 2020 crone et al 2019 kucharzyk et al 2017 with adsorption by granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resin aer being the most studied and effective overall research on pfas removal from contaminated groundwater by gac and aer has progressed from laboratory studies to field trials and full scale demonstrations and there are full scale gac and aer facilities in place crone et al 2019 most of the research has focused on direct metrics of performance such as adsorption capacity selectivity and bed volumes treated limited research has investigated the secondary impacts of pfas adsorption such as impacts on treated water and management of waste streams for instance life cycle assessment lca is an established methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product or process corominas et al 2020 to date one lca study has been conducted on pfas removal from impacted groundwater by gac and aer adsorption processes emery et al 2019 hence there are many unanswered questions about the environmental impacts and trade offs of pfas remediation technologies previous research on pfas removal from water shows higher adsorption capacity by aer than gac and higher removal of long chain pfass like pfoa and pfos than short chain analogs gagliano et al 2020 as an added benefit aer has the potential to be chemically regenerated onsite whereas gac must be transported off site for thermal regeneration or destruction for example laboratory tests and pilot trials have shown that aer used for pfas removal can be chemically regenerated and reused in subsequent adsorption cycles boyer et al 2021 for these reasons aer was selected as the focus of this research management of waste regeneration solution containing hazardous chemicals such as nitrate perchlorate and hexavalent chromium is complex and expensive jensen and darby 2016 plummer et al 2018 an additional complication for pfas adsorption by aer is that most research shows that a combination of brine or caustic brine and organic cosolvent is required to effectively desorb pfass from the resin boyer et al 2021 this is because pfass interact with the aer through a combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic van der waals and hydrophobic interactions gagliano et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the brine chloride ion disrupts the electrostatic interactions while the organic cosolvent typically methanol decreases the polarity of the regeneration solution thereby weakening the non electrostatic interactions for weak base aer the caustic brine renders the aer non ionic and thereby eliminates electrostatic interactions and facilitates desorption miyazaki and nakai 2011 víctor ortega et al 2017 the resulting waste regeneration solution contains water salt ions organic cosolvent and pfass and must be handled as hazardous waste a possible strategy for management of pfas derived waste regeneration solution is to recover the methanol cosolvent via distillation and concentrate the pfass in the distillation bottoms liang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the pfass can then be removed from the distillation bottoms and loaded onto gac to render the pfass a solid waste for disposal or incineration n hagelin personal communication ultimately the pfass in the waste regeneration solution or adsorbed to aer or gac must be disposed of incineration of pfas laden waste streams is one of the options being pursued usepa 2020 in addition pfas destruction technologies applied to waste regeneration solution could be an option and is the subject of current research liang et al 2018 schaefer et al 2020 wang et al 2021 resin regeneration is a critical step during aer treatment because it allows the resin to be reused in numerous adsorption cycles however it requires significant chemical inputs and generates a waste stream that must be managed and disposed previous lca studies on aer treatment have confirmed the importance of regeneration on environmental impacts amini et al 2015 choe et al 2015 choe et al 2013 maul et al 2014 ras and von blottnitz 2012 although the previous studies examined different contaminants and operating scenarios many of the studies found that the regeneration step was the major contributor to harmful environmental impacts for example nacl for regeneration of aer used to treat perchlorate contaminated groundwater accounted for the majority of impacts across all impact categories choe et al 2013 and nacl for regeneration and brine waste from aer used to treat highly colored groundwater resulted in high impacts for eutrophication human toxicity cancer and non cancer and ecotoxicity amini et al 2015 which are common midpoint categories used to assess environmental impact using a regeneration solution composed of brine or caustic brine and organic cosolvent as required for pfass is expected to increase the environmental impacts of aer regeneration over the impacts of brine alone since there is only one published study on the life cycle environmental impacts of aer treatment for pfas remediation emery et al 2019 there are important gaps in the literature for instance in the lca study by emery et al emery et al 2019 the hypothetical aer system recycled the regeneration solution by recovering the methanol cosolvent and brine this is an attractive approach in terms of minimizing chemical inputs however it requires electricity and natural gas for methanol recovery and production and disposal of gac for brine recovery hence a comparison of disposal and different options for recycling waste regeneration solution is needed the lca results by emery et al emery et al 2019 showed that electricity use dominated environmental impacts at moderate to low pfas concentrations in groundwater i e 0 7 µg l pfoa pfos whereas the aer regeneration process dominated environmental impacts at high pfas concentrations in groundwater i e 70 µg l pfoa pfos however the environmental impacts of the sub processes contributing to aer regeneration e g methanol distillation and the sensitivity of those sub processes was not explored to fill the gaps in the literature on environmental impacts of aer regeneration a comparison of regeneration options including waste disposal and chemical inputs is needed to provide guidance on future research design and operation needs although a pfas concentration of 70 µg l in groundwater is more representative of a contaminated site s source zone backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 the concentration level was selected to evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of different regeneration options the goal of this research was to provide new insights on the environmental impacts and trade offs of different regeneration options for aer remediation system for removal of pfoa and pfos from impacted groundwater the regeneration options were divided into two categories 1 management of waste regeneration solution and 2 altering the chemical composition of the regeneration solution the specific objectives expanded on the two main categories of regeneration options by evaluating the environmental impacts of 1a disposal of pfas contaminated waste regeneration solution via off site incineration 1b partial recycling of waste regeneration solution via onsite recovery and reuse of methanol cosolvent before off site incineration of pfas contaminated distillation bottoms 1c full recycling of waste regeneration solution via onsite recovery and reuse of methanol cosolvent and brine before off site incineration of pfas loaded gac 2a altering the composition of the regeneration solution by replacing nacl with an alternative salt while maintaining the methanol cosolvent and 2b altering the composition of the regeneration solution by replacing methanol cosolvent with inorganic base while maintaining the brine thereby creating a caustic brine the life cycle assessment followed the standard methodology of goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation 2 methods 2 1 scope of study the scope of the lca was to compare the environmental impacts of an aer remediation system with different regeneration options only the operating phase was considered given the regeneration options were based on hypothetical treatment scenarios seeking an attributional comparison corominas et al 2020 the remediation system boundary included aer treatment and regeneration methanol cosolvent recovery via onsite distillation brine recovery via onsite gac adsorption of pfass transport of chemicals to the site transport of waste to off site incinerator and off site hazardous waste incineration and considered the input of materials and electricity to the processes and associated emissions see fig 1 the functional unit for the study was 1 m3 of aer treated groundwater with combined pfoa and pfos concentration equal to 70 µg l in untreated water and nondetectable concentration of pfoa and pfos in treated water each specific objective defined in section 1 was taken as an lca scenario in scenario 1a the regeneration solution was composed of tap water nacl and methanol see fig 1a the waste regeneration solution which contained water nacl methanol and desorbed pfoa and pfos was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration in scenario 1b the regeneration solution was composed of tap water nacl and combination of new and recycled methanol see fig 1b the methanol was recovered via onsite distillation process following distillation the remaining pfas contaminated waste regeneration solution was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration in scenario 1c the regeneration solution was composed of tap water nacl recycled brine and combination of new and recycled methanol see fig 1c the methanol recovery process was identical to scenario 1b following distillation brine was recovered from the waste regeneration solution via onsite gac adsorption of pfoa and pfos the gac which was loaded with pfoa and pfos was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration the regeneration facilities in scenarios 1a c and 2a would require onsite fire suppression and other safety features due to solvent flammability which was not considered here given the focus on the operating phase of the lca the second set of scenarios focused on substitution of components in the regeneration solution make up scenario 2a followed the same process flow as scenario 1b see fig 1b with nacl replaced with potassium chloride kcl ammonium chloride nh4cl sodium sulfate na2so4 potassium sulfate k2so4 ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 sodium carbonate na2co3 potassium carbonate k2co3 or ammonium carbonate nh4 2co3 methanol was used as the cosolvent in scenario 2a following methanol recovery by onsite distillation the pfas contaminated waste regeneration solution was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration scenario 2b followed a similar process flow as scenario 1c see fig 1d but methanol was replaced with sodium hydroxide naoh potassium hydroxide koh or ammonium hydroxide nh4oh to produce an aqueous only regeneration solution i e caustic brine scenario 2b used brine based on chloride salt with the same co ion as the base e g nacl paired with naoh distillation was excluded since the regeneration solution did not contain organic cosolvent the regeneration solution was recycled via onsite gac adsorption of pfass which concentrated the pfoa and pfos on gac and waste gac was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration scenario 2b is most applicable to weak base aer that can be regenerated in brine caustic solution deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 whereas brine organic cosolvent solution used in scenarios 1a c and 2a is most applicable to strong base aer boyer et al 2021 this is because weak base aer exhibit ph dependent charging behavior and nonionic character at alkaline ph miyazaki and nakai 2011 2 2 life cycle inventory the inventory list of materials fuel electricity and processes were generated from consumables used during aer treatment and regeneration see table 1 the inventory list was created based on a hypothetical aer remediation system treating groundwater with combined pfoa and pfos concentration equal to 70 µg l and treated water with nondetectable i e 0 concentration of pfoa and pfos the hypothetical aer remediation system including pfas concentrations in groundwater was based on a previous lca study by emery et al emery et al 2019 calculations assumptions and data sources in support of the hypothetical system are given in supplementary materials appendix a the design calculations for the aer system represent a hypothetical system where 100 adsorption capacity and regeneration efficiency are achieved regeneration of pfas loaded aer is an active area of research with studies showing 90 regeneration efficiency using brine and brine organic cosolvent solutions deng et al 2010 wang et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 the aer system operated at 5 min empty bed contact time ebct and aer adsorption capacity for pfoa and pfos of 1 66 g kg based on pilot study of pfas removal by aer woodard et al 2017 the volume of aer equivalent to 1 bed volume bv was calculated from the volumetric flow rate for the hypothetical aer system and ebct the bvs of water treated to resin saturation was calculated by mass balance from the aer adsorption capacity and influent concentration of 70 µg l pfoa and pfos assuming nondetectable i e 0 concentration of pfoa and pfos in the treated water pfoa and pfos concentrations of 70 µg l represents a contaminated site source zone backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 and was selected because a previous lca study showed the aer remediation system to dominate environmental impacts at this concentration emery et al 2019 the aer system was regenerated once the resin was saturated with pfoa and pfos the volume of aer and the bvs of water treated to resin saturation were used to calculate the total volume of water treated per regeneration cycle which was used to normalize all input parameters to the functional unit of 1 m3 of aer treated water the regeneration procedure consisted of flushing 10 bvs of regeneration solution followed by 1 bv of rinse water through the aer bed based on pilot studies of pfas removal by aer woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 for all scenarios it was assumed that the regeneration process was 100 efficient in terms of desorbing pfoa and pfos from the resin and restoring the initial aer adsorption capacity which is supported by studies in the literature regeneration of pfas loaded aer is an active area of research with some solutions e g methanol nh4cl and nh4cl nh4oh showing 90 regeneration efficiency as reviewed in boyer et al 2021 hence 100 regeneration efficiency is conceivable and shows the lowest possible impacts that could be attained for a regenerable aer system regeneration efficiency 100 would require more frequent regenerations and would increase the environmental impacts of the process aer was not required as an input to the system since there was no resin loss during the operating phase in a real system aer would need to be periodically replaced due to attrition of resin beads and irreversible fouling both of which reduce the ion exchange capacity of the system for scenarios 1a c the regeneration solution was composed of 70 v v methanol and 30 v v brine based on previous studies comparing different regeneration solutions deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 the brine was composed of tap water containing 10 m m nacl upon mixing methanol and brine the final regeneration solution contained 4 m m nacl there is uncertainty in the literature on the impact of salt concentration on regeneration efficiency with some studies suggesting increasing desorption with decreasing salt concentration deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 and other studies showing the opposite trend dixit et al 2020 in scenario 1a the waste regeneration solution was transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator the transport distance was assumed the impact of transport is explored in the sensitivity analysis described later in scenarios 1b and 1c distillation was used to recover 95 m m methanol from the regeneration solution using natural gas and electricity as inputs based on similar assumptions in emery et al emery et al 2019 it was assumed that all water nacl pfass and 5 m m methanol were collected from the distillation process and either i transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator in scenario 1b or ii used as input to brine recovery process in scenario 1c in scenario 1c gac adsorption was used to remove pfass from the waste regeneration solution and thereby enable the recovery of 90 m m water and nacl from the methanol depleted regeneration solution it was assumed that pfoa and pfos were completely adsorbed by the gac thereby allowing the brine to be recycled and used for regeneration the gac adsorption process required gac electricity and transport as inputs emery et al 2019 the pfas loaded gac and a small amount of waste regeneration solution 10 m m water and nacl and 5 m m methanol were transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator the process of brine recovery via onsite gac adsorption of pfass is used hypothetically in this lca based previous research investigating brine reuse emery et al 2019 woodard et al 2017 future research is needed to confirm that gac adsorption of pfass in distillation bottoms can be used for recycling brine for regeneration one reason the effectiveness of this process is not known is because of the variable level of dissolved organic carbon doc possible in the distillation bottoms which would inhibit gac adsorption of pfass similar to that observed in landfill leachate wei et al 2019 scenario 2a followed the same composition of regeneration solution as scenario 1b with nacl replaced by an alternative salt at the same mass fraction which followed previous experimental and lca study on alternative salt regeneration maul et al 2014 for scenario 2b the regeneration solution was composed of aqueous solution of 0 5 m m inorganic base and 0 5 m m salt based on study comparing regeneration efficiency of brine caustic brine and brine cosolvent zaggia et al 2016 in scenarios 2a and 2b waste regeneration solution and gac if applicable were transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator for all scenarios waste rinse water was discharged without treatment e g sewer its disposal impact was not considered regarding incineration the ecoinvent database contains inventory items for incineration of municipal waste relevant options include municipal solid waste and spent aer and hazardous waste relevant options include hazardous waste and spent solvent mixture in this lca the spent solvent mixture inventory item was used to represent incineration of liquid waste while the hazardous waste inventory item was used to represent incineration of spent gac the electricity required to pump groundwater and operate the aer remediation system was assumed to be the same for all scenarios the methanol recovery and brine recovery processes had separate electricity inputs hypothetical truck transport distances were assumed 50 km for transport of regeneration chemicals to the aer remediation site and 500 km for transport of waste from the aer remediation site to an incinerator it was assumed that the aer remediation site was connected to the electric grid tap water and sewer the scenarios were constructed using simapro 8 0 4 30 software a procedure on the use of simapro for this research is given in supplementary materials inventory items were obtained from the following databases ecoinvent 3 allocation default unit version 3 1 compiled october 2014 u s life cycle inventory uslci updated october 2013 and agri footprint mass allocation version 1 0 may 2014 inventory items were selected for united states location code us or north america location code rna if available and consistent with input requirements for the study global inventory items location codes row or glo were selected if united states or north america were not available or appropriate inventory items for material inputs and incineration were selected as transformation processes which included inputs from production and associated emissions inventory items for electricity and tap water were selected as market processes which included inputs from production and transportation and associated emissions 2 3 life cycle impact assessment traci 2 1 version 1 02 impact assessment method was used to evaluate the impacts of different regeneration options for the aer remediation system bare 2012 the impact assessment method transforms process inputs and emissions into tangible environmental impacts along the cause and effect chain of environmental degradation bare 2010 traci was developed by the u s epa so it has location specific features for the united states and north america and uses midpoint impact categories that are associated with u s environmental regulations and guidelines bare 2011 traci uses ten midpoint impact categories ozone depletion kg cfc 11 eq global warming kg co2 eq smog kg o3 eq acidification kg so2 eq eutrophication kg n eq human toxicity cancer ctuh human toxicity non cancer ctuh respiratory effects kg pm2 5 eq ecotoxicity ctue and fossil fuel depletion mj surplus the terms human toxicity cancer and human toxicity non cancer are used interchangeably with carcinogens and non carcinogens respectively ozone depletion air global warming potential air smog air acidification air and water eutrophication air and water and ecotoxicity air water and soil represent categories of pollution with the affected environmental media listed in parentheses human toxicity cancer human toxicity non cancer and respiratory effects represent categories of human health impacts fossil fuel depletion represents a category of resource depletion the environmental impact results are presented as scaled characterization values and normalized characterization values as is typically done in lca studies briefly because the impact categories have different units that cannot be compared the characterization values were scaled such that the scenario or process with the highest characterization value in each impact category was set at 100 with the other values scaled accordingly to directly compare the magnitude of the different impact categories the characterization values were normalized to the same unit which is the average annual impact of a u s citizen in 2008 as the reference ryberg et al 2014 because this lca study was focused on groundwater remediation impact categories of relevance included climate change impact as indicated by global warming human health as indicated by human toxicity cancer and non cancer and environmental pollution as indicated by eutrophication and ecotoxicity 2 4 sensitivity analysis a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted for scenarios 1a c and 2a by varying each input amount by 50 based on the doubling of an input amount an impact category was operationally defined as not sensitive 10 increase low sensitivity 10 to 25 increase medium sensitivity 25 to 50 increase or high sensitivity 50 increase the maximum possible increase from doubling an input amount is 100 the relative change in the characterization value for each impact category was quantified to identify the most sensitive combinations of inputs and impact categories the response of the lca model to changing quantities of inventory items reveals the largest drivers of impact across the system the sensitivity of the impact assessment results to specific inventory items was also explored within the scenarios for example in scenarios 1a c different incineration inventory items were compared and in scenario 2a different salt production inventory items were compared the nature of the incineration process was examined by comparing the impacts of the available incineration inventory items in simapro municipal solid waste spent anion exchange resin spent solvent mixture and hazardous waste at the same mass with other processes excluded the nine salts considered in this research na k nh4 cl so4 2 co3 2 can be divided into two categories mined from natural deposits that require varying extents of purification referred to as natural production i e nacl na2so4 na2co3 and kcl and produced from bulk chemicals and energy inputs referred to as chemical production i e k2so4 k2co3 nh4cl nh4 2so4 and nh4 2co3 the salts were compared at the same mass with other processes within the aer system excluded 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of disposal vs recycling of waste regeneration solution 3 1 1 comparison of disposal vs recycling of waste regeneration solution the environmental impacts of the different options for management of waste regeneration solution i e disposal scenario 1a partial recycling scenario 1b and full recycling scenario 1c are explored in this section the results are considered first with respect to the overall impact between scenarios fig 2 scaled characterization values followed by the impacts of contributing processes within the scenarios fig 3 a c normalized characterization values fig 2 shows that for all impact categories the order of decreasing environmental impact was disposal scenario 1a partial recycling scenario 1b full recycling scenario 1c the main changes occurring in the scenarios from disposal to full recycling included decreasing mass of chemical inputs and decreasing mass of waste being transported for off site incineration see table 1 among the impact categories fossil fuel depletion and ecotoxicity showed the greatest decrease in relative impact going from disposal to partial recycling scenario 1a to 1b and eutrophication showed the greatest decrease in relative impact going from disposal to full recycling scenario 1a to 1c and partial recycling to full recycling scenario 1b to 1c the reduction in fossil fuel depletion was due to a significant decrease in methanol consumption in transitioning from disposal to partial recycling i e methanol recovery was assumed to be 95 efficient the reductions in ecotoxicity and eutrophication were due to significant decreases in the amount of waste incinerated in transitioning from disposal and partial recycling to full recycling i e replacing liquid waste stream by solid adsorbent smog showed the smallest decrease in relative impact when going from disposal to partial recycling and disposal to full recycling this was because electricity dominates smog formation and overall electricity use increased as more of the regeneration solution was recycled via methanol recovery and brine recovery processes fossil fuel depletion acidification and respiratory effects showed the smallest decreases in relative impact going from partial recycling to full recycling as both scenarios recovered and recycled methanol figs 3a c show the normalized characterization results for disposal partial recycling and full recycling scenarios respectively illustrating the processes that contribute to the scenarios note that the scale of the y axis in fig 3 decreases going from disposal to full recycling figure s1 in appendix a compares the normalized characterization results for the three scenarios in the same plot among the impact categories human toxicity cancer i e carcinogens had the highest impact in the three scenarios ecotoxicity acidification and fossil fuel depletion had the next highest impacts and varied by scenario both the human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity impact categories reflect the release of chemicals to the environment air water and land and the pathways of exposure to humans and biota whereas acidification reflects environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion reflects resource consumption in this lca pfas emissions are not considered in human toxicity cancer or non cancer or ecotoxicity however research is underway to include pfas emissions in impact categories holmquist et al 2020 the climate change impact of aer regeneration was lower than human toxicity and environmental pollution impacts for the disposal scenario global warming potential was similar to non carcinogens and less than carcinogens ecotoxicity acidification and eutrophication ozone depletion which results from the release of halogen containing chemicals to the atmosphere showed the smallest impact at least two orders of magnitude lower than the other impact categories and is not considered in subsequent results and discussion it should be noted however that production of aer requires halogen containing chemicals and as such ozone depletion is an important impact category when aer is an input to the system such as using non regenerable aer or when regenerable aer is compared with another technology saetta et al 2015 3 1 2 impacts of disposal of waste regeneration solutions for disposal of waste regeneration solution the greatest environmental impacts and corresponding contributing process were to carcinogens by incineration fossil fuel depletion by methanol consumption eutrophication by incineration and ecotoxicity by incineration and methanol consumption see fig 3a incineration accounted for the greatest contribution to global warming potential but its impact was less than carcinogens ecotoxicity and eutrophication by incineration considering all impact categories the overall environmental impact of each contributing process in the disposal scenario was as follows 47 5 incineration 37 8 methanol consumption 11 7 electricity use 2 7 transportation 0 18 nacl consumption and 0 15 tap water use the results for the disposal scenario illustrate the high environmental impacts associated with methanol consumption for preparing the regeneration solution and incineration of the waste regeneration solution the results indicate that decreasing the methanol content of the regeneration solution and or decreasing the mass of waste regeneration solution disposed of via incineration would decrease the environmental impacts of the aer system 3 1 3 impacts of partial recycling of waste regeneration solutions for partial recycling of waste regeneration solution the greatest environmental impacts and corresponding contributing process were carcinogens eutrophication ecotoxicity by incineration and acidification by electricity use see fig 3b incineration and electricity use contributed similarly to global warming potential and their impact was less than several other categories especially those related to human health and environmental pollution considering all impact categories the overall environmental impact of each contributing process in the partial recycling scenario was as follows 44 8 incineration 27 6 electricity use 19 9 methanol recovery process which included natural gas and electricity inputs 4 5 methanol consumption 2 4 transportation 0 43 nacl consumption and 0 36 tap water use the results for the partial recycling scenario show that incineration had the greatest environmental impacts although the magnitude of the impacts was reduced relative to disposal see figure s1 comparing disposal and partial recycling scenarios recycling methanol decreased the impacts associated with methanol consumption and shifted the impacts to electricity use both directly and as part of the methanol recovery process because the methanol recovery process required fossil fuel and electricity as inputs it contributed to many of the same environmental impact categories as methanol consumption 3 1 4 impacts of full recycling of waste regeneration solutions for full recycling of waste regeneration solution the greatest environmental impacts were to carcinogens by brine recovery process acidification by electricity use and fossil fuel depletion by methanol recovery process see fig 3c in a shift from the previous scenarios electricity use accounted for the greatest contribution to global warming potential however global warming potential and its impact from electricity use was smaller than several other environmental impacts and contributing processes considering all impact categories the overall environmental impact of each contributing process shown in the full recycling scenario was as follows 36 8 electricity use 26 5 methanol recovery process 19 8 brine recovery process which included activated carbon consumption electricity use transportation and incineration 10 2 incineration 6 0 methanol consumption 0 57 transportation 0 16 tap water and 0 06 nacl consumption the results for the full recycling scenario show that electricity use was associated with the greatest environmental impacts which is consistent with previous research that shows electricity use is often the dominant contributor to environmental impacts for water and wastewater treatment corominas et al 2020 prézélus et al 2021 the brine recovery process decreased the mass of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration see table 1 which resulted in smaller impacts by incineration to several environmental impact categories and lower environmental impacts overall relative to the other scenarios see figure s1 however the brine recovery process was the dominant contributor to carcinogens so there was some shifting of environmental impacts 3 2 sensitivity analysis of disposal vs recycling of waste regeneration solution 3 2 1 sensitivity analysis on input amounts table 2 shows the results of the one at a time sensitivity analysis on the input amounts to the aer regeneration scenarios of disposal partial recycling and full recycling the scenarios were most sensitive to the amount of waste sent to incineration and electricity use across several impact categories with eutrophication being the most sensitive impact for the disposal and partial recycling scenarios when the incineration amount was doubled the impact to eutrophication almost doubled which is the maximum sensitivity possible global warming potential human toxicity cancer and non cancer and ecotoxicity showed medium to high sensitivity to the incineration amount for the disposal and partial recycling scenarios the full recycling scenario showed lower sensitivity to incineration amount than the other scenarios because the amount of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration was reduced by implementing both methanol and brine recovery human toxicity cancer was highly sensitive to the brine recovery amount in the full recycling scenario the scenarios became more sensitive to electricity use as the scenarios transitioned from disposal to partial and full recycling of waste regeneration solution because the cosolvent and brine recovery processes required additional electricity inputs and the amount of waste sent to incineration decreased several impact categories for the disposal scenario i e acidification respiratory effects and fossil fuel depletion were sensitive to methanol consumption whereas the same impact categories for the partial and full recycling scenarios were not sensitive to methanol consumption and instead were sensitive to the amount of methanol recovered the impact categories were not sensitive to the amount of nacl consumption transportation or tap water use the fact that the aer regeneration scenarios were not sensitive to the amount of nacl consumed is a surprising and important result given previous lca studies showing the high environmental impacts of aer regeneration amini et al 2015 choe et al 2013 the lack of sensitivity to nacl consumed reflects the unique composition of the regeneration solution i e only 30 v v brine and the need to incinerate the waste produced 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis on incineration process for 8 out of 10 impact categories the general order of decreasing environmental impact was hazardous waste incineration spent solvent mixture incineration spent aer incineration municipal solid waste incineration whereas for non carcinogens and ecotoxicity the order of decreasing environmental impact was municipal solid waste incineration hazardous waste incineration spent solvent mixture incineration spent aer incineration see figure s2a for the normalized characterization results the highest impacts were attributed to carcinogens and ecotoxicity see figure s2b in the context of the aer regeneration scenarios replacing incineration of spent solvent mixtures default inventory item with incineration of spent aer would decrease environmental impacts whereas replacing incineration of spent solvent mixtures with incineration of hazardous waste would increase environmental impacts replacing incineration of spent solvent mixtures with incineration of municipal solid waste would decrease environmental impacts for most categories however it would increase the impacts of carcinogens non carcinogens and ecotoxicity recalling that carcinogens and ecotoxicity had some of the highest normalized characterization values across the scenarios see figure s1 these impacts would increase if incineration of municipal waste or hazardous waste was used in place of incineration of spent solvent mixtures to represent incineration of waste regeneration solution hence the environmental impacts of the aer regeneration scenarios are highly sensitive to the amount of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration and the nature of the incineration process finally the lca impact categories do not consider pfas emissions holmquist et al 2020 and in the case of incineration pfas destruction is an active area of research khan et al 2020 solo gabriele et al 2020 3 3 impact of altering the salt used for regeneration solution 3 3 1 comparison of salts from natural and chemical production table s1 compares the environmental impacts of altering the type of salt used in the regeneration solution considering all impact categories the overall trend of decreasing environmental impact was nh4cl k2co3 nh4 2co3 nh4cl modified solvay process k2so4 na2co3 modified solvay process kcl nh4 2so4 na2co3 nacl powder nacl brine solution na2so4 nacl see table s1a nacl which was used as the default salt inventory item in scenarios 1a c had the lowest impact in all categories based on the normalized characterization values see table s1b the categories with highest impact were human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity followed by human toxicity non cancer and eutrophication global warming potential was one of the lowest impact categories hence both human health and ecosystems would receive adverse impacts from mining and production of alternative salts to nacl the results showed higher environmental impacts for salts obtained by chemical production and lower environmental impacts for salts obtained by natural production see table s1 for example nh4cl and k2co3 had the highest scaled characterization values across impact categories whereby nh4cl production requires ammonia and hydrochloric acid and k2co3 production requires potassium hydroxide which are products from other chemical and energy demanding processes in contrast nacl na2so4 and na2co3 which had the lowest scaled characterization values across impact categories are mined from natural deposits that require lower chemical and energy inputs in some cases the mined salt requires more chemical and energy inputs to purify which results in a higher environmental impact e g kcl maul et al 2014 in other cases the manufactured salt is a co product or byproduct of another chemical process so its environmental impacts are lower such as nh4 2so4 as byproduct of nylon production in the ecoinvent database 3 3 2 evaluation of alternative salts as part of partial recycling of waste regeneration solution fig 4 shows the scaled and normalized characterization values for partial recycling scenarios 1b using nacl and 2a using kcl nh4cl na2so4 nh4 2so4 and k2co3 and figure s3 shows the normalized characterization values for each alternative salt in partial recycling scenario 2a in terms of the contributing processes the order of decreasing environmental impact based on scaled characterization values was nh4cl k2co3 kcl na2so4 nh4 2so4 nacl see fig 4a the highest impact categories for all salts were human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity based on normalized characterization values see fig 4b the impact categories of human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication showed the greatest difference in environmental impact between salts obtained by natural production nacl kcl na2so4 vs chemical production nh4cl k2co3 with nh4 2so4 exhibiting similar impacts as natural production but produced by chemical production figure s3 shows that the higher impact of scenario 2a for nh4cl and k2co3 in categories like human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity was due to salt consumption which reflects chemical production of the salts the results in fig 4 indicate that replacing nacl with another salt obtained by natural production had a minimal change in environmental impact whereas replacing nacl with another salt obtained by chemical production resulted in higher environmental impacts especially for human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication table s2 further explores the impact of salt selection and shows the contributions of the processes in scenarios 1b and 2a for example nacl consumption accounted for 0 4 of total environmental impacts in scenario 1b with incineration and electricity use accounting for 45 and 28 respectively in contrast in scenario 2a nh4cl and k2co3 consumption accounted for nearly 25 of total environmental impacts with incineration and electricity use accounting for 34 and 21 respectively replacing nacl with kcl na2so4 or nh4 2so4 resulted in impacts due to salt consumption increasing from 0 4 to 3 5 6 7 of total environmental impacts hence consumption of non nacl salts obtained by natural production can result in total environmental impacts greater than methanol consumption or transport in scenario 1b and non nacl salts obtained by chemical production can result in total environmental impacts greater than methanol recovery and similar to electricity use in scenario 1b 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis on input amounts a one at a time sensitivity analysis for the results in fig 4 showed that human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication were moderately sensitive to the amount of nh4cl and k2co3 consumed see table s3 comparing the sensitivity results in tables 2 and s3 human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication were most sensitive to incineration amount followed by nh4cl and k2co3 consumed and then electricity use human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity showed low sensitivity to the amount of kcl and nh4 2so4 consumed environmental impacts were not sensitive to the amount of na2so4 consumed which was the same result shown in table 2 for nacl the conclusion from section 3 2 that the regenerable aer system was not sensitive to the amount of nacl consumed remains valid however with the important caveat that the system is sensitive to the type and amount of non nacl salt consumed especially for salts obtained from chemical production two additional factors for salt selection are cost and pfas destruction as nacl is typically the cheapest salt maul et al 2014 but nacl interferes with electrochemical oxidation of pfass schaefer et al 2020 3 4 impact of eliminating organic cosolvent from regeneration solution fig 5 compares the impact of full recycling of brine methanol scenario 1c with full recycling of brine caustic scenario 2b using nacl naoh kcl koh and nh4cl nh4oh brine caustic had greater relative impact than brine methanol for ozone depletion eutrophication potential and human toxicity cancer whereas brine methanol had greater relative impact than brine caustic for acidification human toxicity non cancer respiratory effects and fossil fuel depletion see fig 5a global warming potential smog and ecotoxicity were similar for brine methanol and brine caustic scenarios in terms of magnitude of impacts impacts to human toxicity cancer were the highest with brine caustic having a higher impact than brine methanol the brine recovery process was the greatest contributor to the human toxicity cancer impact category and the single greatest contributor overall this follows from table 2 where human toxicity cancer was highly sensitive to the amount of brine recovered due to the assumptions of the hypothetical aer system the full recycling of brine caustic had approximately twice the mass of brine recovered than the full recycling of brine methanol see table 1 which manifested itself as higher impacts in the human toxicity cancer category this was because the brine recovery process was applied to the entire volume of brine caustic solution whereas the brine recovery process was only applied to the aqueous fraction i e 30 of the brine methanol solution if researchers can confirm that brine caustic can effectively desorb pfass from weak base aer boyer et al 2021 then the next step is to reduce the volume of waste regeneration solution prior to brine recovery possibly through membrane separation franke et al 2019 woodard et al 2017 or even evaporation for the results in fig 5 the different formulations of brine caustic showed similar impact within an impact category suggesting that formulations of brine caustic should be selected based on regeneration efficiency and the possibility of coupling to pfas destruction technologies lu et al 2020 schaefer et al 2020 4 conclusions this research evaluated the environmental impacts and trade offs of different regeneration options for aer remediation system for removal of pfoa and pfos from impacted groundwater the conclusions of this research are as follows disposal of waste regeneration solution via incineration was the greatest contributor to environmental impacts especially for the impact categories of human toxicity cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication the environmental impacts of aer regeneration were reduced by recycling methanol and or brine thereby reducing the amount of waste sent to incineration future research is needed to confirm that organic cosolvent and or brine can be effectively separated and reused for regeneration solution in particular the recycled organic solvent and brine should be free of pfass environmental impacts were sensitive to the amount of waste incinerated and the nature of the incineration process hence further research is needed to refine the amount and characteristics of the waste generated for incineration and emissions from the incineration process in particular the environmental impacts of pfas incineration and its byproducts was not included in this research and is a next logical task for future research in addition volume reduction technologies such as nanofiltration reverse osmosis and evaporation should be explored with the intent of reducing the volume of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration the environmental impacts of aer regeneration options had greater impacts to human toxicity ecotoxicity and eutrophication than climate change as the hypothetical scenarios from this study are supported with new experimental and field data on regeneration performance the life cycle environmental impacts should be compared with life cycle costs to identify the regeneration options that minimize both harmful environmental impacts and cost altering the composition of the regeneration solution increased the environmental impact of aer regeneration because all salts and inorganic bases considered in this research had a greater environmental impact than nacl however salts obtained by natural production exhibited a smaller change in impact than salts obtained by chemical production using non nacl salts for regeneration create the possibility of coupling regeneration with pfas destruction technologies such as electrochemical e g using sulfate based regeneration solution and hydrothermal e g using alkaline regeneration solution future research should explore the selectivity of aer using mobile counterions other than chloride and the regeneration efficiency using non nacl salts in the context of pfas ion exchange credit authorship contribution statement treavor h boyer conceptualization

16517,although anion exchange resin aer treatment is considered an effective technology for removing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass from impacted water the environmental impacts associated with aer regeneration have not been systematically explored in particular the trade offs of altering the composition of the regeneration solution and disposing of or recycling the waste regeneration solution are not known to fill these important gaps in the literature this research conducted a comparative life cycle assessment lca of an aer based pfas remediation system with different regeneration scenarios including disposing of waste regeneration solution via incineration reusing the organic cosolvent and brine fractions of the waste regeneration solution and altering the composition of the regeneration solution to avoid organic cosolvent or nacl the results show that disposing of waste regeneration solution via incineration without recycling organic cosolvent or brine had the greatest environmental impact and that incineration accounted for the greatest impact among contributing processes recycling of the cosolvent or cosolvent and brine fraction of the waste regeneration solution resulted in lower environmental impacts due to reduced mass of waste disposed of via incineration replacing nacl in the brine with an alternative salt resulted in higher environmental impacts with salts derived from chemical production such as ammonium chloride and potassium carbonate showing the largest increases in impacts the results of this research highlight the importance of understanding the fate of pfass during incineration and the need for pfas destruction technologies that can be coupled to aer regeneration to avoid incineration graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater remediation incineration life cycle assessment lca methanol perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos 1 introduction many countries are concerned about the contamination of groundwater with per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass banzhaf et al 2017 crone et al 2019 toms et al 2019 the concerns come from the adverse health effects associated with exposure to pfass in water including cancer reproductive and developmental effects and immunological effects pelch et al 2019 the regulatory status of pfass is evolving with countries and states regions within countries assessing the extent of contamination and considering new regulatory determinations the two most widely detected and studied pfass are perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos which are members of the perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa group of pfass buck et al 2011 pontius 2019 a variety of physical chemical processes have been explored for pfas removal from drinking water sources and for groundwater remediation ahmed et al 2020 banks et al 2020 crone et al 2019 kucharzyk et al 2017 with adsorption by granular activated carbon gac and anion exchange resin aer being the most studied and effective overall research on pfas removal from contaminated groundwater by gac and aer has progressed from laboratory studies to field trials and full scale demonstrations and there are full scale gac and aer facilities in place crone et al 2019 most of the research has focused on direct metrics of performance such as adsorption capacity selectivity and bed volumes treated limited research has investigated the secondary impacts of pfas adsorption such as impacts on treated water and management of waste streams for instance life cycle assessment lca is an established methodology for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product or process corominas et al 2020 to date one lca study has been conducted on pfas removal from impacted groundwater by gac and aer adsorption processes emery et al 2019 hence there are many unanswered questions about the environmental impacts and trade offs of pfas remediation technologies previous research on pfas removal from water shows higher adsorption capacity by aer than gac and higher removal of long chain pfass like pfoa and pfos than short chain analogs gagliano et al 2020 as an added benefit aer has the potential to be chemically regenerated onsite whereas gac must be transported off site for thermal regeneration or destruction for example laboratory tests and pilot trials have shown that aer used for pfas removal can be chemically regenerated and reused in subsequent adsorption cycles boyer et al 2021 for these reasons aer was selected as the focus of this research management of waste regeneration solution containing hazardous chemicals such as nitrate perchlorate and hexavalent chromium is complex and expensive jensen and darby 2016 plummer et al 2018 an additional complication for pfas adsorption by aer is that most research shows that a combination of brine or caustic brine and organic cosolvent is required to effectively desorb pfass from the resin boyer et al 2021 this is because pfass interact with the aer through a combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic van der waals and hydrophobic interactions gagliano et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 the brine chloride ion disrupts the electrostatic interactions while the organic cosolvent typically methanol decreases the polarity of the regeneration solution thereby weakening the non electrostatic interactions for weak base aer the caustic brine renders the aer non ionic and thereby eliminates electrostatic interactions and facilitates desorption miyazaki and nakai 2011 víctor ortega et al 2017 the resulting waste regeneration solution contains water salt ions organic cosolvent and pfass and must be handled as hazardous waste a possible strategy for management of pfas derived waste regeneration solution is to recover the methanol cosolvent via distillation and concentrate the pfass in the distillation bottoms liang et al 2018 wang et al 2021 the pfass can then be removed from the distillation bottoms and loaded onto gac to render the pfass a solid waste for disposal or incineration n hagelin personal communication ultimately the pfass in the waste regeneration solution or adsorbed to aer or gac must be disposed of incineration of pfas laden waste streams is one of the options being pursued usepa 2020 in addition pfas destruction technologies applied to waste regeneration solution could be an option and is the subject of current research liang et al 2018 schaefer et al 2020 wang et al 2021 resin regeneration is a critical step during aer treatment because it allows the resin to be reused in numerous adsorption cycles however it requires significant chemical inputs and generates a waste stream that must be managed and disposed previous lca studies on aer treatment have confirmed the importance of regeneration on environmental impacts amini et al 2015 choe et al 2015 choe et al 2013 maul et al 2014 ras and von blottnitz 2012 although the previous studies examined different contaminants and operating scenarios many of the studies found that the regeneration step was the major contributor to harmful environmental impacts for example nacl for regeneration of aer used to treat perchlorate contaminated groundwater accounted for the majority of impacts across all impact categories choe et al 2013 and nacl for regeneration and brine waste from aer used to treat highly colored groundwater resulted in high impacts for eutrophication human toxicity cancer and non cancer and ecotoxicity amini et al 2015 which are common midpoint categories used to assess environmental impact using a regeneration solution composed of brine or caustic brine and organic cosolvent as required for pfass is expected to increase the environmental impacts of aer regeneration over the impacts of brine alone since there is only one published study on the life cycle environmental impacts of aer treatment for pfas remediation emery et al 2019 there are important gaps in the literature for instance in the lca study by emery et al emery et al 2019 the hypothetical aer system recycled the regeneration solution by recovering the methanol cosolvent and brine this is an attractive approach in terms of minimizing chemical inputs however it requires electricity and natural gas for methanol recovery and production and disposal of gac for brine recovery hence a comparison of disposal and different options for recycling waste regeneration solution is needed the lca results by emery et al emery et al 2019 showed that electricity use dominated environmental impacts at moderate to low pfas concentrations in groundwater i e 0 7 µg l pfoa pfos whereas the aer regeneration process dominated environmental impacts at high pfas concentrations in groundwater i e 70 µg l pfoa pfos however the environmental impacts of the sub processes contributing to aer regeneration e g methanol distillation and the sensitivity of those sub processes was not explored to fill the gaps in the literature on environmental impacts of aer regeneration a comparison of regeneration options including waste disposal and chemical inputs is needed to provide guidance on future research design and operation needs although a pfas concentration of 70 µg l in groundwater is more representative of a contaminated site s source zone backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 the concentration level was selected to evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of different regeneration options the goal of this research was to provide new insights on the environmental impacts and trade offs of different regeneration options for aer remediation system for removal of pfoa and pfos from impacted groundwater the regeneration options were divided into two categories 1 management of waste regeneration solution and 2 altering the chemical composition of the regeneration solution the specific objectives expanded on the two main categories of regeneration options by evaluating the environmental impacts of 1a disposal of pfas contaminated waste regeneration solution via off site incineration 1b partial recycling of waste regeneration solution via onsite recovery and reuse of methanol cosolvent before off site incineration of pfas contaminated distillation bottoms 1c full recycling of waste regeneration solution via onsite recovery and reuse of methanol cosolvent and brine before off site incineration of pfas loaded gac 2a altering the composition of the regeneration solution by replacing nacl with an alternative salt while maintaining the methanol cosolvent and 2b altering the composition of the regeneration solution by replacing methanol cosolvent with inorganic base while maintaining the brine thereby creating a caustic brine the life cycle assessment followed the standard methodology of goal and scope definition inventory analysis impact assessment and interpretation 2 methods 2 1 scope of study the scope of the lca was to compare the environmental impacts of an aer remediation system with different regeneration options only the operating phase was considered given the regeneration options were based on hypothetical treatment scenarios seeking an attributional comparison corominas et al 2020 the remediation system boundary included aer treatment and regeneration methanol cosolvent recovery via onsite distillation brine recovery via onsite gac adsorption of pfass transport of chemicals to the site transport of waste to off site incinerator and off site hazardous waste incineration and considered the input of materials and electricity to the processes and associated emissions see fig 1 the functional unit for the study was 1 m3 of aer treated groundwater with combined pfoa and pfos concentration equal to 70 µg l in untreated water and nondetectable concentration of pfoa and pfos in treated water each specific objective defined in section 1 was taken as an lca scenario in scenario 1a the regeneration solution was composed of tap water nacl and methanol see fig 1a the waste regeneration solution which contained water nacl methanol and desorbed pfoa and pfos was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration in scenario 1b the regeneration solution was composed of tap water nacl and combination of new and recycled methanol see fig 1b the methanol was recovered via onsite distillation process following distillation the remaining pfas contaminated waste regeneration solution was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration in scenario 1c the regeneration solution was composed of tap water nacl recycled brine and combination of new and recycled methanol see fig 1c the methanol recovery process was identical to scenario 1b following distillation brine was recovered from the waste regeneration solution via onsite gac adsorption of pfoa and pfos the gac which was loaded with pfoa and pfos was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration the regeneration facilities in scenarios 1a c and 2a would require onsite fire suppression and other safety features due to solvent flammability which was not considered here given the focus on the operating phase of the lca the second set of scenarios focused on substitution of components in the regeneration solution make up scenario 2a followed the same process flow as scenario 1b see fig 1b with nacl replaced with potassium chloride kcl ammonium chloride nh4cl sodium sulfate na2so4 potassium sulfate k2so4 ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 sodium carbonate na2co3 potassium carbonate k2co3 or ammonium carbonate nh4 2co3 methanol was used as the cosolvent in scenario 2a following methanol recovery by onsite distillation the pfas contaminated waste regeneration solution was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration scenario 2b followed a similar process flow as scenario 1c see fig 1d but methanol was replaced with sodium hydroxide naoh potassium hydroxide koh or ammonium hydroxide nh4oh to produce an aqueous only regeneration solution i e caustic brine scenario 2b used brine based on chloride salt with the same co ion as the base e g nacl paired with naoh distillation was excluded since the regeneration solution did not contain organic cosolvent the regeneration solution was recycled via onsite gac adsorption of pfass which concentrated the pfoa and pfos on gac and waste gac was transported by truck and disposed of via off site hazardous waste incineration scenario 2b is most applicable to weak base aer that can be regenerated in brine caustic solution deng et al 2010 gao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 whereas brine organic cosolvent solution used in scenarios 1a c and 2a is most applicable to strong base aer boyer et al 2021 this is because weak base aer exhibit ph dependent charging behavior and nonionic character at alkaline ph miyazaki and nakai 2011 2 2 life cycle inventory the inventory list of materials fuel electricity and processes were generated from consumables used during aer treatment and regeneration see table 1 the inventory list was created based on a hypothetical aer remediation system treating groundwater with combined pfoa and pfos concentration equal to 70 µg l and treated water with nondetectable i e 0 concentration of pfoa and pfos the hypothetical aer remediation system including pfas concentrations in groundwater was based on a previous lca study by emery et al emery et al 2019 calculations assumptions and data sources in support of the hypothetical system are given in supplementary materials appendix a the design calculations for the aer system represent a hypothetical system where 100 adsorption capacity and regeneration efficiency are achieved regeneration of pfas loaded aer is an active area of research with studies showing 90 regeneration efficiency using brine and brine organic cosolvent solutions deng et al 2010 wang et al 2019 zaggia et al 2016 the aer system operated at 5 min empty bed contact time ebct and aer adsorption capacity for pfoa and pfos of 1 66 g kg based on pilot study of pfas removal by aer woodard et al 2017 the volume of aer equivalent to 1 bed volume bv was calculated from the volumetric flow rate for the hypothetical aer system and ebct the bvs of water treated to resin saturation was calculated by mass balance from the aer adsorption capacity and influent concentration of 70 µg l pfoa and pfos assuming nondetectable i e 0 concentration of pfoa and pfos in the treated water pfoa and pfos concentrations of 70 µg l represents a contaminated site source zone backe et al 2013 mcguire et al 2014 and was selected because a previous lca study showed the aer remediation system to dominate environmental impacts at this concentration emery et al 2019 the aer system was regenerated once the resin was saturated with pfoa and pfos the volume of aer and the bvs of water treated to resin saturation were used to calculate the total volume of water treated per regeneration cycle which was used to normalize all input parameters to the functional unit of 1 m3 of aer treated water the regeneration procedure consisted of flushing 10 bvs of regeneration solution followed by 1 bv of rinse water through the aer bed based on pilot studies of pfas removal by aer woodard et al 2017 zaggia et al 2016 for all scenarios it was assumed that the regeneration process was 100 efficient in terms of desorbing pfoa and pfos from the resin and restoring the initial aer adsorption capacity which is supported by studies in the literature regeneration of pfas loaded aer is an active area of research with some solutions e g methanol nh4cl and nh4cl nh4oh showing 90 regeneration efficiency as reviewed in boyer et al 2021 hence 100 regeneration efficiency is conceivable and shows the lowest possible impacts that could be attained for a regenerable aer system regeneration efficiency 100 would require more frequent regenerations and would increase the environmental impacts of the process aer was not required as an input to the system since there was no resin loss during the operating phase in a real system aer would need to be periodically replaced due to attrition of resin beads and irreversible fouling both of which reduce the ion exchange capacity of the system for scenarios 1a c the regeneration solution was composed of 70 v v methanol and 30 v v brine based on previous studies comparing different regeneration solutions deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 the brine was composed of tap water containing 10 m m nacl upon mixing methanol and brine the final regeneration solution contained 4 m m nacl there is uncertainty in the literature on the impact of salt concentration on regeneration efficiency with some studies suggesting increasing desorption with decreasing salt concentration deng et al 2010 zaggia et al 2016 and other studies showing the opposite trend dixit et al 2020 in scenario 1a the waste regeneration solution was transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator the transport distance was assumed the impact of transport is explored in the sensitivity analysis described later in scenarios 1b and 1c distillation was used to recover 95 m m methanol from the regeneration solution using natural gas and electricity as inputs based on similar assumptions in emery et al emery et al 2019 it was assumed that all water nacl pfass and 5 m m methanol were collected from the distillation process and either i transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator in scenario 1b or ii used as input to brine recovery process in scenario 1c in scenario 1c gac adsorption was used to remove pfass from the waste regeneration solution and thereby enable the recovery of 90 m m water and nacl from the methanol depleted regeneration solution it was assumed that pfoa and pfos were completely adsorbed by the gac thereby allowing the brine to be recycled and used for regeneration the gac adsorption process required gac electricity and transport as inputs emery et al 2019 the pfas loaded gac and a small amount of waste regeneration solution 10 m m water and nacl and 5 m m methanol were transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator the process of brine recovery via onsite gac adsorption of pfass is used hypothetically in this lca based previous research investigating brine reuse emery et al 2019 woodard et al 2017 future research is needed to confirm that gac adsorption of pfass in distillation bottoms can be used for recycling brine for regeneration one reason the effectiveness of this process is not known is because of the variable level of dissolved organic carbon doc possible in the distillation bottoms which would inhibit gac adsorption of pfass similar to that observed in landfill leachate wei et al 2019 scenario 2a followed the same composition of regeneration solution as scenario 1b with nacl replaced by an alternative salt at the same mass fraction which followed previous experimental and lca study on alternative salt regeneration maul et al 2014 for scenario 2b the regeneration solution was composed of aqueous solution of 0 5 m m inorganic base and 0 5 m m salt based on study comparing regeneration efficiency of brine caustic brine and brine cosolvent zaggia et al 2016 in scenarios 2a and 2b waste regeneration solution and gac if applicable were transported 500 km to a hazardous waste incinerator for all scenarios waste rinse water was discharged without treatment e g sewer its disposal impact was not considered regarding incineration the ecoinvent database contains inventory items for incineration of municipal waste relevant options include municipal solid waste and spent aer and hazardous waste relevant options include hazardous waste and spent solvent mixture in this lca the spent solvent mixture inventory item was used to represent incineration of liquid waste while the hazardous waste inventory item was used to represent incineration of spent gac the electricity required to pump groundwater and operate the aer remediation system was assumed to be the same for all scenarios the methanol recovery and brine recovery processes had separate electricity inputs hypothetical truck transport distances were assumed 50 km for transport of regeneration chemicals to the aer remediation site and 500 km for transport of waste from the aer remediation site to an incinerator it was assumed that the aer remediation site was connected to the electric grid tap water and sewer the scenarios were constructed using simapro 8 0 4 30 software a procedure on the use of simapro for this research is given in supplementary materials inventory items were obtained from the following databases ecoinvent 3 allocation default unit version 3 1 compiled october 2014 u s life cycle inventory uslci updated october 2013 and agri footprint mass allocation version 1 0 may 2014 inventory items were selected for united states location code us or north america location code rna if available and consistent with input requirements for the study global inventory items location codes row or glo were selected if united states or north america were not available or appropriate inventory items for material inputs and incineration were selected as transformation processes which included inputs from production and associated emissions inventory items for electricity and tap water were selected as market processes which included inputs from production and transportation and associated emissions 2 3 life cycle impact assessment traci 2 1 version 1 02 impact assessment method was used to evaluate the impacts of different regeneration options for the aer remediation system bare 2012 the impact assessment method transforms process inputs and emissions into tangible environmental impacts along the cause and effect chain of environmental degradation bare 2010 traci was developed by the u s epa so it has location specific features for the united states and north america and uses midpoint impact categories that are associated with u s environmental regulations and guidelines bare 2011 traci uses ten midpoint impact categories ozone depletion kg cfc 11 eq global warming kg co2 eq smog kg o3 eq acidification kg so2 eq eutrophication kg n eq human toxicity cancer ctuh human toxicity non cancer ctuh respiratory effects kg pm2 5 eq ecotoxicity ctue and fossil fuel depletion mj surplus the terms human toxicity cancer and human toxicity non cancer are used interchangeably with carcinogens and non carcinogens respectively ozone depletion air global warming potential air smog air acidification air and water eutrophication air and water and ecotoxicity air water and soil represent categories of pollution with the affected environmental media listed in parentheses human toxicity cancer human toxicity non cancer and respiratory effects represent categories of human health impacts fossil fuel depletion represents a category of resource depletion the environmental impact results are presented as scaled characterization values and normalized characterization values as is typically done in lca studies briefly because the impact categories have different units that cannot be compared the characterization values were scaled such that the scenario or process with the highest characterization value in each impact category was set at 100 with the other values scaled accordingly to directly compare the magnitude of the different impact categories the characterization values were normalized to the same unit which is the average annual impact of a u s citizen in 2008 as the reference ryberg et al 2014 because this lca study was focused on groundwater remediation impact categories of relevance included climate change impact as indicated by global warming human health as indicated by human toxicity cancer and non cancer and environmental pollution as indicated by eutrophication and ecotoxicity 2 4 sensitivity analysis a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted for scenarios 1a c and 2a by varying each input amount by 50 based on the doubling of an input amount an impact category was operationally defined as not sensitive 10 increase low sensitivity 10 to 25 increase medium sensitivity 25 to 50 increase or high sensitivity 50 increase the maximum possible increase from doubling an input amount is 100 the relative change in the characterization value for each impact category was quantified to identify the most sensitive combinations of inputs and impact categories the response of the lca model to changing quantities of inventory items reveals the largest drivers of impact across the system the sensitivity of the impact assessment results to specific inventory items was also explored within the scenarios for example in scenarios 1a c different incineration inventory items were compared and in scenario 2a different salt production inventory items were compared the nature of the incineration process was examined by comparing the impacts of the available incineration inventory items in simapro municipal solid waste spent anion exchange resin spent solvent mixture and hazardous waste at the same mass with other processes excluded the nine salts considered in this research na k nh4 cl so4 2 co3 2 can be divided into two categories mined from natural deposits that require varying extents of purification referred to as natural production i e nacl na2so4 na2co3 and kcl and produced from bulk chemicals and energy inputs referred to as chemical production i e k2so4 k2co3 nh4cl nh4 2so4 and nh4 2co3 the salts were compared at the same mass with other processes within the aer system excluded 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of disposal vs recycling of waste regeneration solution 3 1 1 comparison of disposal vs recycling of waste regeneration solution the environmental impacts of the different options for management of waste regeneration solution i e disposal scenario 1a partial recycling scenario 1b and full recycling scenario 1c are explored in this section the results are considered first with respect to the overall impact between scenarios fig 2 scaled characterization values followed by the impacts of contributing processes within the scenarios fig 3 a c normalized characterization values fig 2 shows that for all impact categories the order of decreasing environmental impact was disposal scenario 1a partial recycling scenario 1b full recycling scenario 1c the main changes occurring in the scenarios from disposal to full recycling included decreasing mass of chemical inputs and decreasing mass of waste being transported for off site incineration see table 1 among the impact categories fossil fuel depletion and ecotoxicity showed the greatest decrease in relative impact going from disposal to partial recycling scenario 1a to 1b and eutrophication showed the greatest decrease in relative impact going from disposal to full recycling scenario 1a to 1c and partial recycling to full recycling scenario 1b to 1c the reduction in fossil fuel depletion was due to a significant decrease in methanol consumption in transitioning from disposal to partial recycling i e methanol recovery was assumed to be 95 efficient the reductions in ecotoxicity and eutrophication were due to significant decreases in the amount of waste incinerated in transitioning from disposal and partial recycling to full recycling i e replacing liquid waste stream by solid adsorbent smog showed the smallest decrease in relative impact when going from disposal to partial recycling and disposal to full recycling this was because electricity dominates smog formation and overall electricity use increased as more of the regeneration solution was recycled via methanol recovery and brine recovery processes fossil fuel depletion acidification and respiratory effects showed the smallest decreases in relative impact going from partial recycling to full recycling as both scenarios recovered and recycled methanol figs 3a c show the normalized characterization results for disposal partial recycling and full recycling scenarios respectively illustrating the processes that contribute to the scenarios note that the scale of the y axis in fig 3 decreases going from disposal to full recycling figure s1 in appendix a compares the normalized characterization results for the three scenarios in the same plot among the impact categories human toxicity cancer i e carcinogens had the highest impact in the three scenarios ecotoxicity acidification and fossil fuel depletion had the next highest impacts and varied by scenario both the human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity impact categories reflect the release of chemicals to the environment air water and land and the pathways of exposure to humans and biota whereas acidification reflects environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion reflects resource consumption in this lca pfas emissions are not considered in human toxicity cancer or non cancer or ecotoxicity however research is underway to include pfas emissions in impact categories holmquist et al 2020 the climate change impact of aer regeneration was lower than human toxicity and environmental pollution impacts for the disposal scenario global warming potential was similar to non carcinogens and less than carcinogens ecotoxicity acidification and eutrophication ozone depletion which results from the release of halogen containing chemicals to the atmosphere showed the smallest impact at least two orders of magnitude lower than the other impact categories and is not considered in subsequent results and discussion it should be noted however that production of aer requires halogen containing chemicals and as such ozone depletion is an important impact category when aer is an input to the system such as using non regenerable aer or when regenerable aer is compared with another technology saetta et al 2015 3 1 2 impacts of disposal of waste regeneration solutions for disposal of waste regeneration solution the greatest environmental impacts and corresponding contributing process were to carcinogens by incineration fossil fuel depletion by methanol consumption eutrophication by incineration and ecotoxicity by incineration and methanol consumption see fig 3a incineration accounted for the greatest contribution to global warming potential but its impact was less than carcinogens ecotoxicity and eutrophication by incineration considering all impact categories the overall environmental impact of each contributing process in the disposal scenario was as follows 47 5 incineration 37 8 methanol consumption 11 7 electricity use 2 7 transportation 0 18 nacl consumption and 0 15 tap water use the results for the disposal scenario illustrate the high environmental impacts associated with methanol consumption for preparing the regeneration solution and incineration of the waste regeneration solution the results indicate that decreasing the methanol content of the regeneration solution and or decreasing the mass of waste regeneration solution disposed of via incineration would decrease the environmental impacts of the aer system 3 1 3 impacts of partial recycling of waste regeneration solutions for partial recycling of waste regeneration solution the greatest environmental impacts and corresponding contributing process were carcinogens eutrophication ecotoxicity by incineration and acidification by electricity use see fig 3b incineration and electricity use contributed similarly to global warming potential and their impact was less than several other categories especially those related to human health and environmental pollution considering all impact categories the overall environmental impact of each contributing process in the partial recycling scenario was as follows 44 8 incineration 27 6 electricity use 19 9 methanol recovery process which included natural gas and electricity inputs 4 5 methanol consumption 2 4 transportation 0 43 nacl consumption and 0 36 tap water use the results for the partial recycling scenario show that incineration had the greatest environmental impacts although the magnitude of the impacts was reduced relative to disposal see figure s1 comparing disposal and partial recycling scenarios recycling methanol decreased the impacts associated with methanol consumption and shifted the impacts to electricity use both directly and as part of the methanol recovery process because the methanol recovery process required fossil fuel and electricity as inputs it contributed to many of the same environmental impact categories as methanol consumption 3 1 4 impacts of full recycling of waste regeneration solutions for full recycling of waste regeneration solution the greatest environmental impacts were to carcinogens by brine recovery process acidification by electricity use and fossil fuel depletion by methanol recovery process see fig 3c in a shift from the previous scenarios electricity use accounted for the greatest contribution to global warming potential however global warming potential and its impact from electricity use was smaller than several other environmental impacts and contributing processes considering all impact categories the overall environmental impact of each contributing process shown in the full recycling scenario was as follows 36 8 electricity use 26 5 methanol recovery process 19 8 brine recovery process which included activated carbon consumption electricity use transportation and incineration 10 2 incineration 6 0 methanol consumption 0 57 transportation 0 16 tap water and 0 06 nacl consumption the results for the full recycling scenario show that electricity use was associated with the greatest environmental impacts which is consistent with previous research that shows electricity use is often the dominant contributor to environmental impacts for water and wastewater treatment corominas et al 2020 prézélus et al 2021 the brine recovery process decreased the mass of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration see table 1 which resulted in smaller impacts by incineration to several environmental impact categories and lower environmental impacts overall relative to the other scenarios see figure s1 however the brine recovery process was the dominant contributor to carcinogens so there was some shifting of environmental impacts 3 2 sensitivity analysis of disposal vs recycling of waste regeneration solution 3 2 1 sensitivity analysis on input amounts table 2 shows the results of the one at a time sensitivity analysis on the input amounts to the aer regeneration scenarios of disposal partial recycling and full recycling the scenarios were most sensitive to the amount of waste sent to incineration and electricity use across several impact categories with eutrophication being the most sensitive impact for the disposal and partial recycling scenarios when the incineration amount was doubled the impact to eutrophication almost doubled which is the maximum sensitivity possible global warming potential human toxicity cancer and non cancer and ecotoxicity showed medium to high sensitivity to the incineration amount for the disposal and partial recycling scenarios the full recycling scenario showed lower sensitivity to incineration amount than the other scenarios because the amount of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration was reduced by implementing both methanol and brine recovery human toxicity cancer was highly sensitive to the brine recovery amount in the full recycling scenario the scenarios became more sensitive to electricity use as the scenarios transitioned from disposal to partial and full recycling of waste regeneration solution because the cosolvent and brine recovery processes required additional electricity inputs and the amount of waste sent to incineration decreased several impact categories for the disposal scenario i e acidification respiratory effects and fossil fuel depletion were sensitive to methanol consumption whereas the same impact categories for the partial and full recycling scenarios were not sensitive to methanol consumption and instead were sensitive to the amount of methanol recovered the impact categories were not sensitive to the amount of nacl consumption transportation or tap water use the fact that the aer regeneration scenarios were not sensitive to the amount of nacl consumed is a surprising and important result given previous lca studies showing the high environmental impacts of aer regeneration amini et al 2015 choe et al 2013 the lack of sensitivity to nacl consumed reflects the unique composition of the regeneration solution i e only 30 v v brine and the need to incinerate the waste produced 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis on incineration process for 8 out of 10 impact categories the general order of decreasing environmental impact was hazardous waste incineration spent solvent mixture incineration spent aer incineration municipal solid waste incineration whereas for non carcinogens and ecotoxicity the order of decreasing environmental impact was municipal solid waste incineration hazardous waste incineration spent solvent mixture incineration spent aer incineration see figure s2a for the normalized characterization results the highest impacts were attributed to carcinogens and ecotoxicity see figure s2b in the context of the aer regeneration scenarios replacing incineration of spent solvent mixtures default inventory item with incineration of spent aer would decrease environmental impacts whereas replacing incineration of spent solvent mixtures with incineration of hazardous waste would increase environmental impacts replacing incineration of spent solvent mixtures with incineration of municipal solid waste would decrease environmental impacts for most categories however it would increase the impacts of carcinogens non carcinogens and ecotoxicity recalling that carcinogens and ecotoxicity had some of the highest normalized characterization values across the scenarios see figure s1 these impacts would increase if incineration of municipal waste or hazardous waste was used in place of incineration of spent solvent mixtures to represent incineration of waste regeneration solution hence the environmental impacts of the aer regeneration scenarios are highly sensitive to the amount of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration and the nature of the incineration process finally the lca impact categories do not consider pfas emissions holmquist et al 2020 and in the case of incineration pfas destruction is an active area of research khan et al 2020 solo gabriele et al 2020 3 3 impact of altering the salt used for regeneration solution 3 3 1 comparison of salts from natural and chemical production table s1 compares the environmental impacts of altering the type of salt used in the regeneration solution considering all impact categories the overall trend of decreasing environmental impact was nh4cl k2co3 nh4 2co3 nh4cl modified solvay process k2so4 na2co3 modified solvay process kcl nh4 2so4 na2co3 nacl powder nacl brine solution na2so4 nacl see table s1a nacl which was used as the default salt inventory item in scenarios 1a c had the lowest impact in all categories based on the normalized characterization values see table s1b the categories with highest impact were human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity followed by human toxicity non cancer and eutrophication global warming potential was one of the lowest impact categories hence both human health and ecosystems would receive adverse impacts from mining and production of alternative salts to nacl the results showed higher environmental impacts for salts obtained by chemical production and lower environmental impacts for salts obtained by natural production see table s1 for example nh4cl and k2co3 had the highest scaled characterization values across impact categories whereby nh4cl production requires ammonia and hydrochloric acid and k2co3 production requires potassium hydroxide which are products from other chemical and energy demanding processes in contrast nacl na2so4 and na2co3 which had the lowest scaled characterization values across impact categories are mined from natural deposits that require lower chemical and energy inputs in some cases the mined salt requires more chemical and energy inputs to purify which results in a higher environmental impact e g kcl maul et al 2014 in other cases the manufactured salt is a co product or byproduct of another chemical process so its environmental impacts are lower such as nh4 2so4 as byproduct of nylon production in the ecoinvent database 3 3 2 evaluation of alternative salts as part of partial recycling of waste regeneration solution fig 4 shows the scaled and normalized characterization values for partial recycling scenarios 1b using nacl and 2a using kcl nh4cl na2so4 nh4 2so4 and k2co3 and figure s3 shows the normalized characterization values for each alternative salt in partial recycling scenario 2a in terms of the contributing processes the order of decreasing environmental impact based on scaled characterization values was nh4cl k2co3 kcl na2so4 nh4 2so4 nacl see fig 4a the highest impact categories for all salts were human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity based on normalized characterization values see fig 4b the impact categories of human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication showed the greatest difference in environmental impact between salts obtained by natural production nacl kcl na2so4 vs chemical production nh4cl k2co3 with nh4 2so4 exhibiting similar impacts as natural production but produced by chemical production figure s3 shows that the higher impact of scenario 2a for nh4cl and k2co3 in categories like human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity was due to salt consumption which reflects chemical production of the salts the results in fig 4 indicate that replacing nacl with another salt obtained by natural production had a minimal change in environmental impact whereas replacing nacl with another salt obtained by chemical production resulted in higher environmental impacts especially for human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication table s2 further explores the impact of salt selection and shows the contributions of the processes in scenarios 1b and 2a for example nacl consumption accounted for 0 4 of total environmental impacts in scenario 1b with incineration and electricity use accounting for 45 and 28 respectively in contrast in scenario 2a nh4cl and k2co3 consumption accounted for nearly 25 of total environmental impacts with incineration and electricity use accounting for 34 and 21 respectively replacing nacl with kcl na2so4 or nh4 2so4 resulted in impacts due to salt consumption increasing from 0 4 to 3 5 6 7 of total environmental impacts hence consumption of non nacl salts obtained by natural production can result in total environmental impacts greater than methanol consumption or transport in scenario 1b and non nacl salts obtained by chemical production can result in total environmental impacts greater than methanol recovery and similar to electricity use in scenario 1b 3 3 3 sensitivity analysis on input amounts a one at a time sensitivity analysis for the results in fig 4 showed that human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication were moderately sensitive to the amount of nh4cl and k2co3 consumed see table s3 comparing the sensitivity results in tables 2 and s3 human toxicity cancer and non cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication were most sensitive to incineration amount followed by nh4cl and k2co3 consumed and then electricity use human toxicity cancer and ecotoxicity showed low sensitivity to the amount of kcl and nh4 2so4 consumed environmental impacts were not sensitive to the amount of na2so4 consumed which was the same result shown in table 2 for nacl the conclusion from section 3 2 that the regenerable aer system was not sensitive to the amount of nacl consumed remains valid however with the important caveat that the system is sensitive to the type and amount of non nacl salt consumed especially for salts obtained from chemical production two additional factors for salt selection are cost and pfas destruction as nacl is typically the cheapest salt maul et al 2014 but nacl interferes with electrochemical oxidation of pfass schaefer et al 2020 3 4 impact of eliminating organic cosolvent from regeneration solution fig 5 compares the impact of full recycling of brine methanol scenario 1c with full recycling of brine caustic scenario 2b using nacl naoh kcl koh and nh4cl nh4oh brine caustic had greater relative impact than brine methanol for ozone depletion eutrophication potential and human toxicity cancer whereas brine methanol had greater relative impact than brine caustic for acidification human toxicity non cancer respiratory effects and fossil fuel depletion see fig 5a global warming potential smog and ecotoxicity were similar for brine methanol and brine caustic scenarios in terms of magnitude of impacts impacts to human toxicity cancer were the highest with brine caustic having a higher impact than brine methanol the brine recovery process was the greatest contributor to the human toxicity cancer impact category and the single greatest contributor overall this follows from table 2 where human toxicity cancer was highly sensitive to the amount of brine recovered due to the assumptions of the hypothetical aer system the full recycling of brine caustic had approximately twice the mass of brine recovered than the full recycling of brine methanol see table 1 which manifested itself as higher impacts in the human toxicity cancer category this was because the brine recovery process was applied to the entire volume of brine caustic solution whereas the brine recovery process was only applied to the aqueous fraction i e 30 of the brine methanol solution if researchers can confirm that brine caustic can effectively desorb pfass from weak base aer boyer et al 2021 then the next step is to reduce the volume of waste regeneration solution prior to brine recovery possibly through membrane separation franke et al 2019 woodard et al 2017 or even evaporation for the results in fig 5 the different formulations of brine caustic showed similar impact within an impact category suggesting that formulations of brine caustic should be selected based on regeneration efficiency and the possibility of coupling to pfas destruction technologies lu et al 2020 schaefer et al 2020 4 conclusions this research evaluated the environmental impacts and trade offs of different regeneration options for aer remediation system for removal of pfoa and pfos from impacted groundwater the conclusions of this research are as follows disposal of waste regeneration solution via incineration was the greatest contributor to environmental impacts especially for the impact categories of human toxicity cancer ecotoxicity and eutrophication the environmental impacts of aer regeneration were reduced by recycling methanol and or brine thereby reducing the amount of waste sent to incineration future research is needed to confirm that organic cosolvent and or brine can be effectively separated and reused for regeneration solution in particular the recycled organic solvent and brine should be free of pfass environmental impacts were sensitive to the amount of waste incinerated and the nature of the incineration process hence further research is needed to refine the amount and characteristics of the waste generated for incineration and emissions from the incineration process in particular the environmental impacts of pfas incineration and its byproducts was not included in this research and is a next logical task for future research in addition volume reduction technologies such as nanofiltration reverse osmosis and evaporation should be explored with the intent of reducing the volume of waste regeneration solution sent to incineration the environmental impacts of aer regeneration options had greater impacts to human toxicity ecotoxicity and eutrophication than climate change as the hypothetical scenarios from this study are supported with new experimental and field data on regeneration performance the life cycle environmental impacts should be compared with life cycle costs to identify the regeneration options that minimize both harmful environmental impacts and cost altering the composition of the regeneration solution increased the environmental impact of aer regeneration because all salts and inorganic bases considered in this research had a greater environmental impact than nacl however salts obtained by natural production exhibited a smaller change in impact than salts obtained by chemical production using non nacl salts for regeneration create the possibility of coupling regeneration with pfas destruction technologies such as electrochemical e g using sulfate based regeneration solution and hydrothermal e g using alkaline regeneration solution future research should explore the selectivity of aer using mobile counterions other than chloride and the regeneration efficiency using non nacl salts in the context of pfas ion exchange credit authorship contribution statement treavor h boyer conceptualization

16518,still 10 of world s population has no sustainable access to centralized water supply system causing millions of deaths annually by waterborne diseases here we develop polypyrrole nanowire arrays ppynws modified electrodes by polymerization of pyrrole on graphite felt for point of use water disinfection via low voltage electroporation a flow through mode is specially applied to alleviate diffusion barrier of pyrrole in the porous graphite felt for uniform ppynws growth the flow through disinfection device using the optimized ppynws electrode achieves above 4 log removal for model virus ms2 and gram positive negative bacteria e faecalis and e coli at applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes below 1000 and 2500 l m2 h electroporation is recognized as the dominant disinfection mechanism by using square wave alternating voltage of 1 0 v to eliminate the electrochemical reactions in situ sampling experiments reveal that anode acts as the main disinfection function due to its electric field attraction with negatively charged e coli cells the live dead baclight staining experiments indicate an adsorption desorption process of e coli cells on anode and the adsorption desorption balance determines the disinfection abilities of ppynws anode under 1 0 v and 2000 l m2 h the disinfection device enables above 4 log e coli removal in tap water within 7 day operation with energy consumption below 20 mj l suggesting its sound application potential for point of use water disinfection graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flow through electrode system disinfection high energy efficiency electroporation 1 introduction nowadays around 10 of world s population still has no sustainable access to safe drinking water services martínez santos 2017 disinfection is an essential and significant process in drinking water treatment to protect human beings from pathogenic infections pathogen contaminated drinking water can transmit diseases such as diarrhea malaria and dysentery which are causing up to 700 000 deaths annually among children under 5 years of age in developing areas without centralized water supply system kirby et al 2017 conventional disinfection technologies such as chlorination ozonation ultraviolet radiation and membrane filtration have been implemented in developed areas to obtain clean and safe drinking water but the obvious drawbacks of chemical storage high energy consumption and expensive facilities inhibit significantly their application in developing areas therefore it is of paramount importance to develop a highly efficient low energy consuming and easily applicable disinfection method for decentralized application based on the lightning rod effect of conductive nanowires with nano sized diameter and micro sized length the electric field strength near their sharp tips can be amplified by several orders of magnitude josé et al 2004 inspired by this phenomenon nanowires assisted electroporation disinfection has been developed to inactive microorganisms such as microalgae bacterial and virus huo et al 2018c 2019b liu et al 2020 at low applied voltages via damaging the cell membranes or virus capsids by the strong electric fields formed near the nanowires tips narsetti et al 2006 zodrow et al 2017 which provides a feasible physical disinfection technology for point of use water disinfection the physical disinfection technology also exhibited excellent adaptability to water quality and insignificant differences were observed in disinfection performance toward model pathogen using background solutions of di water lake water or wastewater treatment plant effluent huo et al 2018b 2019a in addition the conventional chlorination and ozonation disinfection methods were related to the hazardous chemical transportation and storage whereas the operation at applied voltages of several volts enables the construction of portable devices powered with button battery for decentralized water disinfection in developing areas a series of metallic compound based nanowire arrays including cu oh 2 huo et al 2018c cu2o wang et al 2020 fe2o3 wang et al 2018b zno tian et al 2017 wang et al 2018a cu3p huo et al 2018c 2019a 2019b and cuo liu et al 2014 yue et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 nanowires have been successfully in situ grown on porous substrates to fabricate 3d nanowire modified electrodes the flow through electroporation disinfection devices were constructed by using the above porous electrodes to enhance the convective transfer of pathogens to the strong electric field at electrode interface thereby enabling the highly efficient pathogen inactivation at low applied voltages huo et al 2016 2018c jakstys et al 2020 due to the electric field induced disinfection the electroporation disinfection devices exhibited excellent adaptability to water quality huo et al 2018b under the same operation conditions insignificant differences were observed in disinfection performance of the model pathogens in deionized water lake water or the effluent of wastewater treatment plant in particular the energy consumption was in the range of 1 5 j for disinfecting 1 l of water huo et al 2016 2018c 2019b which was compared favorably to the ultraviolet radiation with low pressure uv lamps beck et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 however the above metallic compound based nanowires existed inherent defects such as poor mechanical strength and electrochemical stability which significantly inhibited their practical application for water disinfection under the hydraulic shear force in the porous electrode nanowires were easily broken with detectable nanoparticles in the effluent solutions in addition even under an applied voltage of 1 v the anodic oxidation also led to the corrosion and dissolution of metallic compounds the loss of nanowires by the above negative effects significantly shortened the service life of the nanowire electrodes also resulting in the pollution risk of heavy metal ions and nanoparticles for the treated water huo et al 2016 2018c 2019b polypyrrole ppy known as a kind of conducting polymers has attracted much attention due to its high conductivity good stability and excellent flexibility which has been applied extensively in the fields of batteries cho et al 2021 electrochemical sensors salunke et al 2021 and supercapacitors bhargava et al 2020 thus as compared with metallic compound based nanowires these properties can guarantee that ppy can be reliable and durable nanowire materials for electroporation disinfection previous studies have synthesized ppy nanowire arrays ppynws via electrochemical oxidative polymerization of pyrrole on 2d plane substrates in batch mode reactors such as carbon cloth huang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 and pt plate zang et al 2008 huang et al 2010 however under the batch mode for ppynws growth on thick and 3d porous substrates the diffusion barrier of pyrrole containing synthetic solution into porous substrate inevitably causes the non uniform growth of ppynws on porous substrate as mentioned above the flow through mode via pumping the solution through the porous substrates can enhance the mass transfer and alleviate the diffusion barrier potentially promoting the uniform ppynws growth on porous substrate herein in this work a flow through mode with periodical inversion of the counter cathode and flow direction was developed for synthesizing uniform ppynws on porous substrate graphite felt and the fabricated ppynws materials were utilized as electrodes to construct flow through devices for reliable and durable electroporation disinfection towards the model bacteria and virus first the morphologies and disinfection abilities of the ppynws electrodes fabricated via batch and flow through modes were compared and optimized systematically then in situ sampling experiments and live dead staining experiments were conducted to distinguish the disinfection functions and electroporation mechanisms of individual cathode and anode in the flow through devices finally the long term operation of the ppynws electrodes was investigated to explore its application potentials 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals including pyrrole 98 and sodium p toluenesulfonate were of analytical grade and used as received and all solutions were prepared by using deionized water with a resistivity of 18 mω cm millipore milli q water system graphite felt gf with thickness of 5 mm and elemental carbon composition of 98 5 wt obtained from liaoning jingu carbon material co ltd china was cut into cylinders with a diameter of 50 mm as porous and conductive substrate for growing nanowire arrays then the gfs were immersed in 1 1 ethanol and deionized water with sonication to remove impurities washed thoroughly with deionized water and stored in the deionized water until use escherichia coli e coli cgmcc 1 3373 enterococcus faecalis e faecalis atcc 19 433 and bacteriophage ms2 provided by the institute of microbiology chinese academy of science were selected as model pathogens 2 2 fabrication of polypyrrole nanowire arrays modified gf electrodes polypyrrole nanowire arrays ppynws modified gf electrodes were fabricated with electrochemical oxidation method by growing ppynws on gf substrates using the synthetic solution as reported by the previous works zang et al 2008 huang et al 2010 moozarm nia et al 2015 with minor modification 0 2 m phosphate buffer solution 0 1 m pyrrole monomer and 0 1 m sodium p toluenesulfonate to get the uniform ppynws growth on the gf substrate batch mode bm and flow through mode ftm reactors were constructed to synthesize ppynws electrodes fig 1 for the two modes the ti mesh was used as cathode and gf with diameter of 50 mm was used as anode based on our preliminary experiments voltage of 2 4 v was chosen to apply to the two electrodes for electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole for bm synthetic experiments fig 1a the two parallel electrodes with 10 mm distance were soaked and reacted under 2 4 v in a beaker with 300 ml of synthetic solution at ambient conditions with stirring speeds of 0 1000 rmp for 30 min for ftm synthetic experiments fig 1b a flow through reactor was developed and the experimental setup and device photograph are shown in si fig s1 the electrode chambers had the same dimensions as the gf substrate with 50 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height the gf anode was equipped with two ti mesh cathodes the upper and lower ones and the distance between the anode and cathode was also fixed at 10 mm during oxidation synthesis only one cathode was used as the counter electrode for the gf anode and 300 ml of synthetic solution in a beaker was pumped into the flow through reactor using a peristaltic pump with collecting the effluent in the beaker within the total synthetic time of 30 min the flow direction up flow or down flow one and the counter cathode upper or lower one were periodically inversed for each 5 min under the flow rate of 10 60 ml min after electrochemical synthesis the ppynws modified gf electrodes were collected rinsed repeatedly with deionized water and dried at 80 c for 24 h the ppynws electrodes were cut into cylinders of 10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness for electroporation disinfection experiments and were named as bm x or ftm y where x and y are stirring speed rmp fabricated with bm and flow rates ml min fabricated with ftm 2 3 construction of electroporation disinfection device and operation procedures the construction of electroporation disinfection device edd was similar to the ftm reactor but the disinfection device had an inner diameter of 10 mm si fig s1 the ppynws electrodes with diameter of 10 mm and thickness of 5 mm were served as both anode and cathode and were connected with a dc power supply dg1718e 5 to measure the disinfection performance of the ppynws electrodes the gram negative bacterium e coli gram positive bacterium e faecalis and bacteriophage ms2 were used as model bacteria and virus their cultivation and enumeration procedures were described in supporting information the pathogen contaminated drinking water was prepared by seeding the bacteria or virus in distilled water or raw tap water and was pumped into the edd using a peristaltic pump with sequential treatment by cathode then anode named as red ox unit or anode then cathode named as ox red unit in our preliminary experiments it was revealed that the red ox unit exhibited slightly better disinfection ability than ox red unit see more details in the following sections and the configuration of red ox unit was used in this work unless otherwise indicated the disinfection experiments were conducted at applied voltage of 1 0 v and under fluxes of 1000 4000 l m2 h with permeability above 105 l m2 h bar the effluent solutions were collected in autoclaved centrifugal tubes followed by immediately enumeration of bacteria or virus based on the differences of pathogen concentrations before and after edd treatment the logarithmic reduction was calculated as log c0 c e for evaluating the disinfection performance where the c0 and ce represent the pathogen concentrations in the influent and effluent solutions based on a typical disinfection process si fig s2 the log removal of e coli using the ppynws electrodes at 1 0 v and 3000 l m2 h maintained stable levels after continuous operation of 5 min and the ppynws electrodes without applied voltage exhibited limited interception or adsorption abilities toward e coli cells hence after operation for 20 min effluent samples were collected to measure the pathogen concentrations each experiment was repeated at least three times and the error bar represents the standard deviation of at least three replicate experiments 2 4 analytical methods the structures of the gf substrate and the ppynws on gf were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy sem su8020 hitachi to investigate the uniformity of ppynws grown on the outer and inner surfaces of the porous gf the sem images were obtained at the two circular bases and middle section of the cylindrical ppynws electrodes the surface functional groups of the gf and ppynws electrode were also evaluated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shimadzu model 8300 in situ sampling experiments were developed to evaluate the disinfection functions of the individual cathode and anode in the edd the live dead baclight staining experiments were conducted to evaluate the concentration of pathogen cells in influent and effluent and the cells intercepted or adsorbed on the electrodes with a laser scanning fluorescence microscopy more characterization details can be found in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ppynws electrodes the sem morphologies of the gf substrate are shown in fig 2 a the gf exhibited a randomly netlike structure with void content up to 95 and average carbon fiber diameter around 9 5 0 3 μm which enabled the high surface area for ppynws growth and pathogen inactivation after electrochemical deposition the fourier transform infrared spectra of the gf substrate and ppynws electrode revealed the ppy formation on gf substrate si fig s3 to investigate the uniformity of the grown ppynws sem images of the ppynws at the two circular bases and middle section of the cylindrical ppynws electrodes were obtained as shown in fig 2 and si fig s5 for the ppynws electrodes fabricated with bm bm x it is obvious from fig 2b and 2c that no ppynws were grown at the middle section of gf substrate even at stirring speed of 1000 rmp bm 1000 which was due to the poor permeability of synthetic solution into the thick gf substrate in addition the ppynws were grown vertically on the carbon fibers at the circular bases of gf without stirring bm 0 however as increased the stirring speeds the ppynws tended to aggregate and collapse on the carbon fiber indicating that the hydraulic shear stress at high stirring speed inhibited the formation of vertical ppynws the sem images of the ppynws electrodes fabricated with ftm ftm y are shown in fig 2d and 2e it can be seen clearly that ppynws were formed at the middle section of gf substrate which reflected that the ftm promoted the diffusion of synthetic solution into the porous gf also the ppy loading weights for ftm y electrodes 2 5 3 2 mg cm3 gf were much higher than that for bm x electrodes 2 0 2 7 mg cm3 gf and the ppy loading weights increased with increasing the stirring speed or the flow rate for the two synthetic modes by reducing the diffusion barrier of synthetic solution into the porous gf si fig s4 the flow rate also affected significantly the ppy morphologies at low flow rate of 10 ml min only short ppynws were formed on the inner carbon fibers of gf at high flow rate of 60 ml min the hydraulic shear stress resulted in the collapsed ppy structure which was coincident with the observation for the bm x sample fabricated at high stirring speed fig 2b while at the suitable flow rate around 40 ml min vertical ppynws were formed at the circular bases and the middle section of the ppynws electrodes fig 2d and 2e the above results demonstrated that the ftm enabled the ppynws growth on the inner carbon fibers of thick gf substrate it was also worthy to be noted that the ppynws at the two circular bases exhibited similar morphologies si fig s5 whereas the ppynws at the middle section of the ppynws electrodes possessed shorter nanowire length and lower nanowire density than that at the circular bases fig 2 with the image j measurement the ppynws at the circular bases had diameter 150 nm length 2 μm and density 8 wires μm2 while the ppynws at the middle section had diameter 120 nm length 1 2 μm and density 2 wires μm2 during ppynws synthesis with ftm for the cylindrical gf with two circular bases the synthetic solution contacted with one base first then pass through the gf and finally ejected from the other base with the consumption of pyrrole for forming ppynws the pyrrole concentration in the porous gf substrate decreased along the flow direction thereby causing the decrease in ppynws formation in the porous gf substrate along the flow direction fig 1 with periodical inversion the counter cathode and flow direction it is easy to achieve the uniform ppynws growth on the two circular bases of gf substrate in this work high flow rates up to 60 ml min were used to alleviate the difference of pyrrole concentration in the porous gf however the hydraulic shear stress in the porous gf inhibited the vertical growth of ppynws leading to the difficulty for the uniform ppynws growth potentially further increasing the pyrrole concentration in the synthetic solution could be a good attempt to reduce the pyrrole concentration differences in the porous gf substrate in turn promoting uniform ppynws growth on porous gf substrate also the structures of ppynws should be regulated by adjusting the synthetic solution composition and fabrication temperature xia et al 2014 to further investigate its effect on disinfection 3 2 disinfection performance of ppynws electrodes fabricated with bm and ftm the disinfection abilities of the ppynws electrodes fabricated with bm and ftm were compared under applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes of 1000 4000 l m2 h as shown in fig 3 a and 3b the log removal of e coli for the bm x and ftm y electrodes decreased with increasing the fluxes which due to the shorter contact time at higher flux between e coli cells and the electrodes liu et al 2019 obviously the disinfection performance of the ftm y electrodes was much better than that of bm x electrodes reflecting that the ppynws acted as important functions for the e coli inactivation the bm x electrodes achieved poor e coli inactivation with less than 1 log removal whereas the ftm y electrodes achieved above 4 log e coli removal undetectable culturable e coli cells in effluent with detection limit of 1 cfu ml under fluxes in the range of 1000 to 2500 l m2 h for these ftm y electrodes the e coli inactivation increased then decreased with the synthetic flow rates from 10 to 60 ml min and reached to maximum values for the ftm 40 electrode which was in agreement with sem results that the short and collapsed nanowires inhibited the formation of strong electric field near the tips of ppynws yue et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the ftm 40 edd achieved above 4 log e coli inactivation at fluxes below 2500 l m2 h which was much higher than membrane filtration based disinfection with fluxes below 500 l m2 h fu and zhang 2018 zhang et al 2020 in the following parts of this work the ftm 40 was employed as the optimized ppynws electrode for further studies after edd treatment the effluent solutions were collected and conduced immediately by e coli enumeration procedures some e coli cells were suffered from permanent membrane electroporation leading to the non culturable e coli cells on nutrient agar while some moderately impaired e coli cells may be recovered or inactivated during storage in the treated water medium which was also observed by previous works for treatment of algae bodénès et al 2019 and saccharomyces cerevisiae martínez et al 2018 with strong electric fields hence it is necessary to investigate the e coli viability during storage after edd treatment after treatment by the ftm 40 edd under applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes of 2000 and 4000 l m2 h the effluent solutions with 4 log and 1 6 log removal were stored under room temperature of 25 c and the culturable e coli cells in the solutions were enumerated on nutrient agar plate within 24 h as shown in si fig s6 for the effluent solution with 4 log e coli removal culturable e coli cells were undetectable within the storage time of 24 h indicating no reactivation of e coli cells after electroporation disinfection while the e coli viability in the effluent solution with 1 6 log e coli removal decreased gradually with the storage time and after 16 h storage no e coli cells were survival in the effluent as compared with the viability of untreated e coli in influent 94 these results reflected that the edd treatment caused the irreversible electroporation for the e coli cells and the moderately impaired e coli cells were inactivated gradually during storage in di water medium the effect of e coli concentration on the disinfection performance of ftm 40 edd is presented in fig 3c the inactivation efficiency of e coli declined with increasing the e coli concentration which can be attributed to the limited contact sites of the ppynws electrodes under a certain hydraulic retention time when e coli concentration was around 5 104 cfu ml the ftm 40 edd achieved undetectable culturable e coli cells in effluent with above 4 7 log removal at fluxes below 1500 l m2 h for treating the e coli solutions with concentration in the range of 105 106 cfu ml above 90 e coli cells were inactivated under fluxes below 3500 l m2 h and the log removal increased with decreasing the fluxes hence lowering the flow rate could improve the pathogen inactivation and eliminate the microbial contaminated water with high pathogen concentrations the disinfection performance of ftm 40 edd towards e faecalis a gram positive bacteria and bacteriophage ms2 using di water and tap water mediums are shown in fig 3d the ftm 40 edd achieved above 4 log e faecalis removal or 4 log ms2 removal under fluxes below 2500 l m2 h or 1000 l m2 h as compared with the e coli the slightly poorer e faecalis inactivation was due to the thicker cell wall of gram positive bacterium guaranteeing its higher electric field resistance garner 2019 this phenomenon was coincident with previous observation huo et al 2019a 2019b as compared with the micro sized bacteria the lower inactivation of nano sized ms2 was attributed to the less intensity of transmembrane potential for achieving electroporation huang et al 2014 the bacteria of e coli and e faecalis in tap water obtained better inactivation by the edd than that in di water resulting from the lower ohmic drop of edd treating the tap water with higher conductivity 784 μs cm the above results suggested that the edd has great potential application as point of use device to control microbiological risk in drinking water 3 3 electroporation disinfection mechanisms of the ppynws cathode and anode the disinfection mechanisms of ppynws based edd can be mainly attributed to the electric field induced electroporation and electrochemical reactions on the electrodes the square wave alternating voltage of 1 0 v was used to differentiate the disinfection mechanism of electric field induced electroporation from electrochemical reactions by adjusting the square wave frequency since the electrochemical reactions on the electrodes ms and electroporation μs ns were required different minimum response times liu et al 2013 huo et al 2018c 2019a as shown in fig 4 a the e coli inactivation with edd treatment under flux of 2000 l m2 h was also investigated by using the square wave alternating voltage with frequency varying from 1 to 108 hz when the frequency of alternating voltage increased from 1 to 104 hz the corresponding peak currents electrochemical reaction strength decreased obviously from 17 8 to 3 2 μa but the e coli inactivation kept above 4 log removal suggesting that electroporation was the major mechanism for cell death as the frequency increased from105 to 108 hz e coli inactivation decreased sharply from 4 log to 0 66 log removal resulting from the too short electric field exposure time to achieve electroporation in order to distinguish the disinfection functions of the individual ppynws electrode in the edd in situ sampling experiments were set up fig 4b more details in supporting information to evaluate the contribution of the cathode and anode to the disinfection performance and the ox red unit was also constructed to compare with the red ox unit the culturable e coli concentration and solution ph in the anode cathode treated influent and effluent solutions for the two units were measured the e coli inactivation cfu ml by the individual ppynws electrode was calculated based on the e coli concentration in influent anode cathode treated influent and effluent for example in the red ox unit the e coli inactivation by the cathode or the subsequent anode was calculated by c 0 c 1 or c 1 c e where the c 0 c 1 and c e represent the culturable e coli concentration in influent cathode treated influent and effluent as illustrated in fig 4c the anode made a major contribution to e coli inactivation in the two units for the red ox unit the influent was treated by cathode first and then treated by anode as increased the fluxes the e coli inactivation by cathode decreased due to its poor disinfection ability and e coli inactivation by the anode increased gradually which indicated that the survivable cells after cathode treatment were inactivated effectively by the subsequent anode for the ox red unit the influent was treated by anode first and then treated by cathode at fluxes below 2500 l m2 h almost all e coli cells in the influent were inactivated by the anode as increased the flux some survivable cells after anode treatment were inactivated by the subsequent cathode leading to its increase in e coli inactivation based on the in situ sampling experiments the solution ph of anode cathode treated influent and effluent for the two units was measured as shown in fig 4d in the red ox or ox red units after electro reduction oxidation by the cathode anode some oh h ions were accumulated in the cathode anode treated influent resulting in the increase decrease in solution ph due to the weak electrochemical reactions below 25 μa in the two units limited increase or decrease in solution ph of cathode anode treated influent was observed after treatment by the subsequent anode cathode the h oh ions were consumed via electrochemical oxidation reduction leading to the similar ph values between the influent and effluent for the two units as reported in our previous work liu et al 2019 under solution ph of 2 70 or 11 0 with hydraulic retention time of 7 s limited e coli cells were inactivated under strong acidic or alkaline conditions hence considering the over 4 log e coli inactivation under 2500 l m2 h hydraulic retention time of 7 2 s for each electrode and the solution ph values in fig 4d the variation of ph in the two systems would not be responsible for the e coli inactivation the disinfection ability of the edd with ox red and red ox units are compared in si fig s7 the red ox unit exhibited slightly higher log removal of e coli than the ox red unit the isoelectric point of e coli cell was measured to be 4 6 in our previous work huo et al 2018a when the bulk solution ph values in the influent and anode cathode treated influent were above its isoelectric point the cells were negatively charged hence the electric field attraction promoted the cell transfer to the anode causing its higher e coli inactivation otherwise the electric field repulsion between e coli cells and cathode inhibited the cell transfer and inactivation as compared with the anode in the ox red unit the inflow of the anode in the red ox unit was the cathode treated influent with higher solution ph than that in influent which promoted the e coli transfer on the anode and e coli inactivation in the red ox unit 3 4 disinfection processes for pathogen inactivation in edd in order to evaluate the disinfection processes on the anode and cathode in the edd with red ox unit the live dead staining experiments were conducted for the effluent solutions under 1 0 v and 2000 l m2 h by using green fluorescent syto 9 dye for staining dead and live e coli cells and red fluorescent pi dye for staining dead e coli cells under the above operation condition no live e coli cells were detected in effluent thus the amount of dead e coli cells can represent the total amount of e coli cells in effluent as shown in fig 5 a the amount of e coli cells in the effluent after 2 min operation was much less than that in influent indicating that some e coli cells were retained in the edd due to electric field attraction between the cells and anode while the amounts of e coli cells 350 400 cells per picture in the effluent solutions after 5 and 10 min operation were similar to that in influent reflecting that the hydraulic shear stress in the porous ppynws electrode promoted the release of cells from the anode the edd was also disassembled after 20 min operation and the ppynws anode and cathode were taken out and shaken at 150 rmp in di water for 20 min then the soak solutions were stained with syto 9 to compare the amounts of e coli cells retained on the cathode and anode obviously the amount of cells in anode soak solution was much higher than that in cathode soak solution as shown in fig 5b which reflected that more e coli cells were retained by the anode via electric field attraction than the cathode based on the above results in the red ox unit with a flow through mode the anode played a much more important role for electroporation inactivation of e coli than the cathode due to its electric field attraction with the negatively charged e coli cells and the electroporation disinfection process on the cathode and anode were illustrated in fig 5c for the disinfection process on cathode the convective mass transfer in the porous ppynws cathode overcame its electric field repulsion with the negatively charged e coli cells and promoted the cells exposure to the strong electric field near the ppynws leading to a certain contribution to e coli inactivation in turn the electric field repulsion and hydraulic shear stress in the porous electrode also avoided the adsorption accumulation of e coli cells on the cathode for the disinfection process on the anode under the convective mass transfer and electric field attraction e coli cells were prone to adsorb on the anode and inactivate by the strong electric field near the ppynws causing the major contribution to e coli inactivation however adsorption accumulation of e coli cells occurred on the anode via electric field attraction fig 5a and 5b leading to the gradual decrease in e coli inactivation within the initial operation time of 5 min si fig s2 meanwhile the convective mass transfer in the porous anode overcame the electric field attraction and promoted the release of cells into bulk solution in turn the adsorption desorption balance of cells determined effective contact area of the ppynws anode for e coli inactivation resulting in the stable e coli inactivation after operation for 5 min si fig s2 3 5 long term operation and energy consumption the long term disinfection performance of the ftm 40 edd was carried out at applied voltage of 1 v and flux of 2000 l m2 h to investigate its durability and energy consumption fig 6 synthetic drinking water was prepared by adding model e coli cells in tap water with concentration around 104 cfu ml which is 10 100 times higher than that in actual microorganism contaminated drinking water eskandani et al 2018 phiri et al 2021 ward et al 2021 the disinfection ability of edd maintained above 4 log removal without live e coli in effluent under detection limit of 1 cfu ml within the continuous operation of 7 days the ppynws electrode possessed more excellent durability than the metallic compound based nanowires electrode for example due to their poor mechanical strength and electrochemical stability the cu oh 2 huo et al 2018c cuo huo et al 2016 and cu3p huo et al 2019b nanowire arrays electrodes lost their disinfection abilities after continuous operation time of 8 min 20 min and 8 h respectively therefore ppynws can be a feasible material as electroporation disinfection electrodes to address the short service life and release of nanowires and metal ions of above metallic compound based nanowires as shown in si table s2 the energy consumption below 4 mj l of ppynws based edd for per log e coli removal compared favorably with the nanowire electrodes in previous work above 200 mj l due to the electrochemical stability of ppy material under low applied voltages the operation at low applied voltage with low energy consumption guaranteed the design of portable devices supplied with button battery for point of use water disinfection in developing areas without centralized water supply system and the constructed electroporation disinfection devices with flow through configuration could be installed in the pipelines to control the microbiological risk in drinking water distribution systems for instance electroporation disinfection devices can be constructed by staking the multiple pairs of ppynws cathode and anode with large dimensions to scale up the disinfection capacity also under higher applied voltages the electrochemical reactions can be enhanced and produced some oxidants in turn inducing the direct or indirect oxidation for e coli inactivation it would be of great importance to further study the disinfection ability and energy consumption of the edd under the electroporation coupled electrochemical oxidation 4 conclusion a flow through mode with periodical inversion of the counter cathode and flow direction was applied successfully to alleviate diffusion barrier of pyrrole in porous gf for uniform ppynws growth the flow through disinfection device using the optimized ppynws electrode exhibited excellent disinfection performance achieving above 4 log removal toward model virus ms2 and gram positive negative bacteria under low applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes below 1000 and 2500 l m2 h after disinfection treatment no regrowth and reactivation of pathogen occurred during the storage after fes treatment the ppynws electrodes achieved the pathogen inactivation dominantly by strong electric field induced electroporation rather than the oxidation via electro chemically generated oxidants the anode acted as the main disinfection function due to its electric field attraction with the negatively charge e coli cells and the adsorption desorption process of pathogen on ppynws anode determined its disinfection abilities the stability of disinfection device using ppnws electrodes was demonstrated by the continuous operation of 7 days at the applied voltage of 1 0 v achieving above 4 log e coli removal in tap water with energy consumption below 20 mj l which was more excellent than the metallic compound based nanowires electrode energy consumption above 200 mj l and durability blow 8 h

ppynws modified electrodes by polymerization of pyrrole on graphite felt for point of use water disinfection via low voltage electroporation a flow through mode is specially applied to alleviate diffusion barrier of pyrrole in the porous graphite felt for uniform ppynws growth the flow through disinfection device using the optimized ppynws electrode achieves above 4 log removal for model virus ms2 and gram positive negative bacteria e faecalis and e coli at applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes below 1000 and 2500 l m2 h electroporation is recognized as the dominant disinfection mechanism by using square wave alternating voltage of 1 0 v to eliminate the electrochemical reactions in situ sampling experiments reveal that anode acts as the main disinfection function due to its electric field attraction with negatively charged e coli cells the live dead baclight staining experiments indicate an adsorption desorption process of e coli cells on anode and the adsorption desorption balance determines the disinfection abilities of ppynws anode under 1 0 v and 2000 l m2 h the disinfection device enables above 4 log e coli removal in tap water within 7 day operation with

disinfection high energy efficiency electroporation 1 introduction nowadays around 10 of world s population still has no sustainable access to safe drinking water services martínez santos 2017 disinfection is an essential and significant process in drinking water treatment to protect human beings from pathogenic infections pathogen contaminated drinking water can transmit diseases such as diarrhea malaria and dysentery which are causing up to 700 000 deaths annually among children under 5 years of age in developing areas without centralized water supply system kirby et al 2017 conventional disinfection technologies such as chlorination ozonation ultraviolet radiation and membrane filtration have been implemented in developed areas to obtain clean and safe drinking water but the obvious drawbacks of chemical storage high energy consumption and expensive facilities inhibit significantly their application in developing areas therefore it is of paramount importance to develop a highly efficient low energy consuming and easily applicable disinfection method for decentralized application based on the lightning rod effect of conductive nanowires with nano sized diameter and micro sized length the electric field strength near their sharp tips can be amplified by several orders of magnitude josé et al 2004 inspired by this phenomenon nanowires assisted electroporation disinfection has been developed to inactive microorganisms such as microalgae bacterial and virus huo et al 2018c 2019b liu et al 2020 at low applied voltages via damaging the cell membranes or virus capsids by the strong electric fields formed near the nanowires tips narsetti et al 2006 zodrow et al 2017 which provides a feasible physical disinfection technology for point of use water disinfection the physical disinfection technology also exhibited excellent adaptability to water quality and insignificant differences were observed in disinfection performance toward model pathogen using background solutions of di water lake water or wastewater treatment plant effluent huo et al 2018b 2019a in addition the conventional chlorination and ozonation disinfection methods were related to the hazardous chemical transportation and storage whereas the operation at applied voltages of several volts enables the construction of portable devices powered with button battery for decentralized water disinfection in developing areas a series of metallic compound based nanowire arrays including cu oh 2 huo et al 2018c cu2o wang et al 2020 fe2o3 wang et al 2018b zno tian et al 2017 wang et al 2018a cu3p huo et al 2018c 2019a 2019b and cuo liu et al 2014 yue et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 nanowires have been successfully in situ grown on porous substrates to fabricate 3d nanowire modified electrodes the flow through electroporation disinfection devices were constructed by using the above porous electrodes to enhance the convective transfer of pathogens to the strong electric field at electrode interface thereby enabling the highly efficient pathogen inactivation at low applied voltages huo et al 2016 2018c jakstys et al 2020 due to the electric field induced disinfection the electroporation disinfection devices exhibited excellent adaptability to water quality huo et al 2018b under the same operation conditions insignificant differences were observed in disinfection performance of the model pathogens in deionized water lake water or the effluent of wastewater treatment plant in particular the energy consumption was in the range of 1 5 j for disinfecting 1 l of water huo et al 2016 2018c 2019b which was compared favorably to the ultraviolet radiation with low pressure uv lamps beck et al 2017 rattanakul and oguma 2018 however the above metallic compound based nanowires existed inherent defects such as poor mechanical strength and electrochemical stability which significantly inhibited their practical application for water disinfection under the hydraulic shear force in the porous electrode nanowires were easily broken with detectable nanoparticles in the effluent solutions in addition even under an applied voltage of 1 v the anodic oxidation also led to the corrosion and dissolution of metallic compounds the loss of nanowires by the above negative effects significantly shortened the service life of the nanowire electrodes also resulting in the pollution risk of heavy metal ions and nanoparticles for the treated water huo et al 2016 2018c 2019b polypyrrole ppy known as a kind of conducting polymers has attracted much attention due to its high conductivity good stability and excellent flexibility which has been applied extensively in the fields of batteries cho et al 2021 electrochemical sensors salunke et al 2021 and supercapacitors bhargava et al 2020 thus as compared with metallic compound based nanowires these properties can guarantee that ppy can be reliable and durable nanowire materials for electroporation disinfection previous studies have synthesized ppy nanowire arrays ppynws via electrochemical oxidative polymerization of pyrrole on 2d plane substrates in batch mode reactors such as carbon cloth huang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 and pt plate zang et al 2008 huang et al 2010 however under the batch mode for ppynws growth on thick and 3d porous substrates the diffusion barrier of pyrrole containing synthetic solution into porous substrate inevitably causes the non uniform growth of ppynws on porous substrate as mentioned above the flow through mode via pumping the solution through the porous substrates can enhance the mass transfer and alleviate the diffusion barrier potentially promoting the uniform ppynws growth on porous substrate herein in this work a flow through mode with periodical inversion of the counter cathode and flow direction was developed for synthesizing uniform ppynws on porous substrate graphite felt and the fabricated ppynws materials were utilized as electrodes to construct flow through devices for reliable and durable electroporation disinfection towards the model bacteria and virus first the morphologies and disinfection abilities of the ppynws electrodes fabricated via batch and flow through modes were compared and optimized systematically then in situ sampling experiments and live dead staining experiments were conducted to distinguish the disinfection functions and electroporation mechanisms of individual cathode and anode in the flow through devices finally the long term operation of the ppynws electrodes was investigated to explore its application potentials 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents all chemicals including pyrrole 98 and sodium p toluenesulfonate were of analytical grade and used as received and all solutions were prepared by using deionized water with a resistivity of 18 mω cm millipore milli q water system graphite felt gf with thickness of 5 mm and elemental carbon composition of 98 5 wt obtained from liaoning jingu carbon material co ltd china was cut into cylinders with a diameter of 50 mm as porous and conductive substrate for growing nanowire arrays then the gfs were immersed in 1 1 ethanol and deionized water with sonication to remove impurities washed thoroughly with deionized water and stored in the deionized water until use escherichia coli e coli cgmcc 1 3373 enterococcus faecalis e faecalis atcc 19 433 and bacteriophage ms2 provided by the institute of microbiology chinese academy of science were selected as model pathogens 2 2 fabrication of polypyrrole nanowire arrays modified gf electrodes polypyrrole nanowire arrays ppynws modified gf electrodes were fabricated with electrochemical oxidation method by growing ppynws on gf substrates using the synthetic solution as reported by the previous works zang et al 2008 huang et al 2010 moozarm nia et al 2015 with minor modification 0 2 m phosphate buffer solution 0 1 m pyrrole monomer and 0 1 m sodium p toluenesulfonate to get the uniform ppynws growth on the gf substrate batch mode bm and flow through mode ftm reactors were constructed to synthesize ppynws electrodes fig 1 for the two modes the ti mesh was used as cathode and gf with diameter of 50 mm was used as anode based on our preliminary experiments voltage of 2 4 v was chosen to apply to the two electrodes for electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole for bm synthetic experiments fig 1a the two parallel electrodes with 10 mm distance were soaked and reacted under 2 4 v in a beaker with 300 ml of synthetic solution at ambient conditions with stirring speeds of 0 1000 rmp for 30 min for ftm synthetic experiments fig 1b a flow through reactor was developed and the experimental setup and device photograph are shown in si fig s1 the electrode chambers had the same dimensions as the gf substrate with 50 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height the gf anode was equipped with two ti mesh cathodes the upper and lower ones and the distance between the anode and cathode was also fixed at 10 mm during oxidation synthesis only one cathode was used as the counter electrode for the gf anode and 300 ml of synthetic solution in a beaker was pumped into the flow through reactor using a peristaltic pump with collecting the effluent in the beaker within the total synthetic time of 30 min the flow direction up flow or down flow one and the counter cathode upper or lower one were periodically inversed for each 5 min under the flow rate of 10 60 ml min after electrochemical synthesis the ppynws modified gf electrodes were collected rinsed repeatedly with deionized water and dried at 80 c for 24 h the ppynws electrodes were cut into cylinders of 10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness for electroporation disinfection experiments and were named as bm x or ftm y where x and y are stirring speed rmp fabricated with bm and flow rates ml min fabricated with ftm 2 3 construction of electroporation disinfection device and operation procedures the construction of electroporation disinfection device edd was similar to the ftm reactor but the disinfection device had an inner diameter of 10 mm si fig s1 the ppynws electrodes with diameter of 10 mm and thickness of 5 mm were served as both anode and cathode and were connected with a dc power supply dg1718e 5 to measure the disinfection performance of the ppynws electrodes the gram negative bacterium e coli gram positive bacterium e faecalis and bacteriophage ms2 were used as model bacteria and virus their cultivation and enumeration procedures were described in supporting information the pathogen contaminated drinking water was prepared by seeding the bacteria or virus in distilled water or raw tap water and was pumped into the edd using a peristaltic pump with sequential treatment by cathode then anode named as red ox unit or anode then cathode named as ox red unit in our preliminary experiments it was revealed that the red ox unit exhibited slightly better disinfection ability than ox red unit see more details in the following sections and the configuration of red ox unit was used in this work unless otherwise indicated the disinfection experiments were conducted at applied voltage of 1 0 v and under fluxes of 1000 4000 l m2 h with permeability above 105 l m2 h bar the effluent solutions were collected in autoclaved centrifugal tubes followed by immediately enumeration of bacteria or virus based on the differences of pathogen concentrations before and after edd treatment the logarithmic reduction was calculated as log c0 c e for evaluating the disinfection performance where the c0 and ce represent the pathogen concentrations in the influent and effluent solutions based on a typical disinfection process si fig s2 the log removal of e coli using the ppynws electrodes at 1 0 v and 3000 l m2 h maintained stable levels after continuous operation of 5 min and the ppynws electrodes without applied voltage exhibited limited interception or adsorption abilities toward e coli cells hence after operation for 20 min effluent samples were collected to measure the pathogen concentrations each experiment was repeated at least three times and the error bar represents the standard deviation of at least three replicate experiments 2 4 analytical methods the structures of the gf substrate and the ppynws on gf were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy sem su8020 hitachi to investigate the uniformity of ppynws grown on the outer and inner surfaces of the porous gf the sem images were obtained at the two circular bases and middle section of the cylindrical ppynws electrodes the surface functional groups of the gf and ppynws electrode were also evaluated by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shimadzu model 8300 in situ sampling experiments were developed to evaluate the disinfection functions of the individual cathode and anode in the edd the live dead baclight staining experiments were conducted to evaluate the concentration of pathogen cells in influent and effluent and the cells intercepted or adsorbed on the electrodes with a laser scanning fluorescence microscopy more characterization details can be found in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ppynws electrodes the sem morphologies of the gf substrate are shown in fig 2 a the gf exhibited a randomly netlike structure with void content up to 95 and average carbon fiber diameter around 9 5 0 3 μm which enabled the high surface area for ppynws growth and pathogen inactivation after electrochemical deposition the fourier transform infrared spectra of the gf substrate and ppynws electrode revealed the ppy formation on gf substrate si fig s3 to investigate the uniformity of the grown ppynws sem images of the ppynws at the two circular bases and middle section of the cylindrical ppynws electrodes were obtained as shown in fig 2 and si fig s5 for the ppynws electrodes fabricated with bm bm x it is obvious from fig 2b and 2c that no ppynws were grown at the middle section of gf substrate even at stirring speed of 1000 rmp bm 1000 which was due to the poor permeability of synthetic solution into the thick gf substrate in addition the ppynws were grown vertically on the carbon fibers at the circular bases of gf without stirring bm 0 however as increased the stirring speeds the ppynws tended to aggregate and collapse on the carbon fiber indicating that the hydraulic shear stress at high stirring speed inhibited the formation of vertical ppynws the sem images of the ppynws electrodes fabricated with ftm ftm y are shown in fig 2d and 2e it can be seen clearly that ppynws were formed at the middle section of gf substrate which reflected that the ftm promoted the diffusion of synthetic solution into the porous gf also the ppy loading weights for ftm y electrodes 2 5 3 2 mg cm3 gf were much higher than that for bm x electrodes 2 0 2 7 mg cm3 gf and the ppy loading weights increased with increasing the stirring speed or the flow rate for the two synthetic modes by reducing the diffusion barrier of synthetic solution into the porous gf si fig s4 the flow rate also affected significantly the ppy morphologies at low flow rate of 10 ml min only short ppynws were formed on the inner carbon fibers of gf at high flow rate of 60 ml min the hydraulic shear stress resulted in the collapsed ppy structure which was coincident with the observation for the bm x sample fabricated at high stirring speed fig 2b while at the suitable flow rate around 40 ml min vertical ppynws were formed at the circular bases and the middle section of the ppynws electrodes fig 2d and 2e the above results demonstrated that the ftm enabled the ppynws growth on the inner carbon fibers of thick gf substrate it was also worthy to be noted that the ppynws at the two circular bases exhibited similar morphologies si fig s5 whereas the ppynws at the middle section of the ppynws electrodes possessed shorter nanowire length and lower nanowire density than that at the circular bases fig 2 with the image j measurement the ppynws at the circular bases had diameter 150 nm length 2 μm and density 8 wires μm2 while the ppynws at the middle section had diameter 120 nm length 1 2 μm and density 2 wires μm2 during ppynws synthesis with ftm for the cylindrical gf with two circular bases the synthetic solution contacted with one base first then pass through the gf and finally ejected from the other base with the consumption of pyrrole for forming ppynws the pyrrole concentration in the porous gf substrate decreased along the flow direction thereby causing the decrease in ppynws formation in the porous gf substrate along the flow direction fig 1 with periodical inversion the counter cathode and flow direction it is easy to achieve the uniform ppynws growth on the two circular bases of gf substrate in this work high flow rates up to 60 ml min were used to alleviate the difference of pyrrole concentration in the porous gf however the hydraulic shear stress in the porous gf inhibited the vertical growth of ppynws leading to the difficulty for the uniform ppynws growth potentially further increasing the pyrrole concentration in the synthetic solution could be a good attempt to reduce the pyrrole concentration differences in the porous gf substrate in turn promoting uniform ppynws growth on porous gf substrate also the structures of ppynws should be regulated by adjusting the synthetic solution composition and fabrication temperature xia et al 2014 to further investigate its effect on disinfection 3 2 disinfection performance of ppynws electrodes fabricated with bm and ftm the disinfection abilities of the ppynws electrodes fabricated with bm and ftm were compared under applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes of 1000 4000 l m2 h as shown in fig 3 a and 3b the log removal of e coli for the bm x and ftm y electrodes decreased with increasing the fluxes which due to the shorter contact time at higher flux between e coli cells and the electrodes liu et al 2019 obviously the disinfection performance of the ftm y electrodes was much better than that of bm x electrodes reflecting that the ppynws acted as important functions for the e coli inactivation the bm x electrodes achieved poor e coli inactivation with less than 1 log removal whereas the ftm y electrodes achieved above 4 log e coli removal undetectable culturable e coli cells in effluent with detection limit of 1 cfu ml under fluxes in the range of 1000 to 2500 l m2 h for these ftm y electrodes the e coli inactivation increased then decreased with the synthetic flow rates from 10 to 60 ml min and reached to maximum values for the ftm 40 electrode which was in agreement with sem results that the short and collapsed nanowires inhibited the formation of strong electric field near the tips of ppynws yue et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 the ftm 40 edd achieved above 4 log e coli inactivation at fluxes below 2500 l m2 h which was much higher than membrane filtration based disinfection with fluxes below 500 l m2 h fu and zhang 2018 zhang et al 2020 in the following parts of this work the ftm 40 was employed as the optimized ppynws electrode for further studies after edd treatment the effluent solutions were collected and conduced immediately by e coli enumeration procedures some e coli cells were suffered from permanent membrane electroporation leading to the non culturable e coli cells on nutrient agar while some moderately impaired e coli cells may be recovered or inactivated during storage in the treated water medium which was also observed by previous works for treatment of algae bodénès et al 2019 and saccharomyces cerevisiae martínez et al 2018 with strong electric fields hence it is necessary to investigate the e coli viability during storage after edd treatment after treatment by the ftm 40 edd under applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes of 2000 and 4000 l m2 h the effluent solutions with 4 log and 1 6 log removal were stored under room temperature of 25 c and the culturable e coli cells in the solutions were enumerated on nutrient agar plate within 24 h as shown in si fig s6 for the effluent solution with 4 log e coli removal culturable e coli cells were undetectable within the storage time of 24 h indicating no reactivation of e coli cells after electroporation disinfection while the e coli viability in the effluent solution with 1 6 log e coli removal decreased gradually with the storage time and after 16 h storage no e coli cells were survival in the effluent as compared with the viability of untreated e coli in influent 94 these results reflected that the edd treatment caused the irreversible electroporation for the e coli cells and the moderately impaired e coli cells were inactivated gradually during storage in di water medium the effect of e coli concentration on the disinfection performance of ftm 40 edd is presented in fig 3c the inactivation efficiency of e coli declined with increasing the e coli concentration which can be attributed to the limited contact sites of the ppynws electrodes under a certain hydraulic retention time when e coli concentration was around 5 104 cfu ml the ftm 40 edd achieved undetectable culturable e coli cells in effluent with above 4 7 log removal at fluxes below 1500 l m2 h for treating the e coli solutions with concentration in the range of 105 106 cfu ml above 90 e coli cells were inactivated under fluxes below 3500 l m2 h and the log removal increased with decreasing the fluxes hence lowering the flow rate could improve the pathogen inactivation and eliminate the microbial contaminated water with high pathogen concentrations the disinfection performance of ftm 40 edd towards e faecalis a gram positive bacteria and bacteriophage ms2 using di water and tap water mediums are shown in fig 3d the ftm 40 edd achieved above 4 log e faecalis removal or 4 log ms2 removal under fluxes below 2500 l m2 h or 1000 l m2 h as compared with the e coli the slightly poorer e faecalis inactivation was due to the thicker cell wall of gram positive bacterium guaranteeing its higher electric field resistance garner 2019 this phenomenon was coincident with previous observation huo et al 2019a 2019b as compared with the micro sized bacteria the lower inactivation of nano sized ms2 was attributed to the less intensity of transmembrane potential for achieving electroporation huang et al 2014 the bacteria of e coli and e faecalis in tap water obtained better inactivation by the edd than that in di water resulting from the lower ohmic drop of edd treating the tap water with higher conductivity 784 μs cm the above results suggested that the edd has great potential application as point of use device to control microbiological risk in drinking water 3 3 electroporation disinfection mechanisms of the ppynws cathode and anode the disinfection mechanisms of ppynws based edd can be mainly attributed to the electric field induced electroporation and electrochemical reactions on the electrodes the square wave alternating voltage of 1 0 v was used to differentiate the disinfection mechanism of electric field induced electroporation from electrochemical reactions by adjusting the square wave frequency since the electrochemical reactions on the electrodes ms and electroporation μs ns were required different minimum response times liu et al 2013 huo et al 2018c 2019a as shown in fig 4 a the e coli inactivation with edd treatment under flux of 2000 l m2 h was also investigated by using the square wave alternating voltage with frequency varying from 1 to 108 hz when the frequency of alternating voltage increased from 1 to 104 hz the corresponding peak currents electrochemical reaction strength decreased obviously from 17 8 to 3 2 μa but the e coli inactivation kept above 4 log removal suggesting that electroporation was the major mechanism for cell death as the frequency increased from105 to 108 hz e coli inactivation decreased sharply from 4 log to 0 66 log removal resulting from the too short electric field exposure time to achieve electroporation in order to distinguish the disinfection functions of the individual ppynws electrode in the edd in situ sampling experiments were set up fig 4b more details in supporting information to evaluate the contribution of the cathode and anode to the disinfection performance and the ox red unit was also constructed to compare with the red ox unit the culturable e coli concentration and solution ph in the anode cathode treated influent and effluent solutions for the two units were measured the e coli inactivation cfu ml by the individual ppynws electrode was calculated based on the e coli concentration in influent anode cathode treated influent and effluent for example in the red ox unit the e coli inactivation by the cathode or the subsequent anode was calculated by c 0 c 1 or c 1 c e where the c 0 c 1 and c e represent the culturable e coli concentration in influent cathode treated influent and effluent as illustrated in fig 4c the anode made a major contribution to e coli inactivation in the two units for the red ox unit the influent was treated by cathode first and then treated by anode as increased the fluxes the e coli inactivation by cathode decreased due to its poor disinfection ability and e coli inactivation by the anode increased gradually which indicated that the survivable cells after cathode treatment were inactivated effectively by the subsequent anode for the ox red unit the influent was treated by anode first and then treated by cathode at fluxes below 2500 l m2 h almost all e coli cells in the influent were inactivated by the anode as increased the flux some survivable cells after anode treatment were inactivated by the subsequent cathode leading to its increase in e coli inactivation based on the in situ sampling experiments the solution ph of anode cathode treated influent and effluent for the two units was measured as shown in fig 4d in the red ox or ox red units after electro reduction oxidation by the cathode anode some oh h ions were accumulated in the cathode anode treated influent resulting in the increase decrease in solution ph due to the weak electrochemical reactions below 25 μa in the two units limited increase or decrease in solution ph of cathode anode treated influent was observed after treatment by the subsequent anode cathode the h oh ions were consumed via electrochemical oxidation reduction leading to the similar ph values between the influent and effluent for the two units as reported in our previous work liu et al 2019 under solution ph of 2 70 or 11 0 with hydraulic retention time of 7 s limited e coli cells were inactivated under strong acidic or alkaline conditions hence considering the over 4 log e coli inactivation under 2500 l m2 h hydraulic retention time of 7 2 s for each electrode and the solution ph values in fig 4d the variation of ph in the two systems would not be responsible for the e coli inactivation the disinfection ability of the edd with ox red and red ox units are compared in si fig s7 the red ox unit exhibited slightly higher log removal of e coli than the ox red unit the isoelectric point of e coli cell was measured to be 4 6 in our previous work huo et al 2018a when the bulk solution ph values in the influent and anode cathode treated influent were above its isoelectric point the cells were negatively charged hence the electric field attraction promoted the cell transfer to the anode causing its higher e coli inactivation otherwise the electric field repulsion between e coli cells and cathode inhibited the cell transfer and inactivation as compared with the anode in the ox red unit the inflow of the anode in the red ox unit was the cathode treated influent with higher solution ph than that in influent which promoted the e coli transfer on the anode and e coli inactivation in the red ox unit 3 4 disinfection processes for pathogen inactivation in edd in order to evaluate the disinfection processes on the anode and cathode in the edd with red ox unit the live dead staining experiments were conducted for the effluent solutions under 1 0 v and 2000 l m2 h by using green fluorescent syto 9 dye for staining dead and live e coli cells and red fluorescent pi dye for staining dead e coli cells under the above operation condition no live e coli cells were detected in effluent thus the amount of dead e coli cells can represent the total amount of e coli cells in effluent as shown in fig 5 a the amount of e coli cells in the effluent after 2 min operation was much less than that in influent indicating that some e coli cells were retained in the edd due to electric field attraction between the cells and anode while the amounts of e coli cells 350 400 cells per picture in the effluent solutions after 5 and 10 min operation were similar to that in influent reflecting that the hydraulic shear stress in the porous ppynws electrode promoted the release of cells from the anode the edd was also disassembled after 20 min operation and the ppynws anode and cathode were taken out and shaken at 150 rmp in di water for 20 min then the soak solutions were stained with syto 9 to compare the amounts of e coli cells retained on the cathode and anode obviously the amount of cells in anode soak solution was much higher than that in cathode soak solution as shown in fig 5b which reflected that more e coli cells were retained by the anode via electric field attraction than the cathode based on the above results in the red ox unit with a flow through mode the anode played a much more important role for electroporation inactivation of e coli than the cathode due to its electric field attraction with the negatively charged e coli cells and the electroporation disinfection process on the cathode and anode were illustrated in fig 5c for the disinfection process on cathode the convective mass transfer in the porous ppynws cathode overcame its electric field repulsion with the negatively charged e coli cells and promoted the cells exposure to the strong electric field near the ppynws leading to a certain contribution to e coli inactivation in turn the electric field repulsion and hydraulic shear stress in the porous electrode also avoided the adsorption accumulation of e coli cells on the cathode for the disinfection process on the anode under the convective mass transfer and electric field attraction e coli cells were prone to adsorb on the anode and inactivate by the strong electric field near the ppynws causing the major contribution to e coli inactivation however adsorption accumulation of e coli cells occurred on the anode via electric field attraction fig 5a and 5b leading to the gradual decrease in e coli inactivation within the initial operation time of 5 min si fig s2 meanwhile the convective mass transfer in the porous anode overcame the electric field attraction and promoted the release of cells into bulk solution in turn the adsorption desorption balance of cells determined effective contact area of the ppynws anode for e coli inactivation resulting in the stable e coli inactivation after operation for 5 min si fig s2 3 5 long term operation and energy consumption the long term disinfection performance of the ftm 40 edd was carried out at applied voltage of 1 v and flux of 2000 l m2 h to investigate its durability and energy consumption fig 6 synthetic drinking water was prepared by adding model e coli cells in tap water with concentration around 104 cfu ml which is 10 100 times higher than that in actual microorganism contaminated drinking water eskandani et al 2018 phiri et al 2021 ward et al 2021 the disinfection ability of edd maintained above 4 log removal without live e coli in effluent under detection limit of 1 cfu ml within the continuous operation of 7 days the ppynws electrode possessed more excellent durability than the metallic compound based nanowires electrode for example due to their poor mechanical strength and electrochemical stability the cu oh 2 huo et al 2018c cuo huo et al 2016 and cu3p huo et al 2019b nanowire arrays electrodes lost their disinfection abilities after continuous operation time of 8 min 20 min and 8 h respectively therefore ppynws can be a feasible material as electroporation disinfection electrodes to address the short service life and release of nanowires and metal ions of above metallic compound based nanowires as shown in si table s2 the energy consumption below 4 mj l of ppynws based edd for per log e coli removal compared favorably with the nanowire electrodes in previous work above 200 mj l due to the electrochemical stability of ppy material under low applied voltages the operation at low applied voltage with low energy consumption guaranteed the design of portable devices supplied with button battery for point of use water disinfection in developing areas without centralized water supply system and the constructed electroporation disinfection devices with flow through configuration could be installed in the pipelines to control the microbiological risk in drinking water distribution systems for instance electroporation disinfection devices can be constructed by staking the multiple pairs of ppynws cathode and anode with large dimensions to scale up the disinfection capacity also under higher applied voltages the electrochemical reactions can be enhanced and produced some oxidants in turn inducing the direct or indirect oxidation for e coli inactivation it would be of great importance to further study the disinfection ability and energy consumption of the edd under the electroporation coupled electrochemical oxidation 4 conclusion a flow through mode with periodical inversion of the counter cathode and flow direction was applied successfully to alleviate diffusion barrier of pyrrole in porous gf for uniform ppynws growth the flow through disinfection device using the optimized ppynws electrode exhibited excellent disinfection performance achieving above 4 log removal toward model virus ms2 and gram positive negative bacteria under low applied voltage of 1 0 v and fluxes below 1000 and 2500 l m2 h after disinfection treatment no regrowth and reactivation of pathogen occurred during the storage after fes treatment the ppynws electrodes achieved the pathogen inactivation dominantly by strong electric field induced electroporation rather than the oxidation via electro chemically generated oxidants the anode acted as the main disinfection function due to its electric field attraction with the negatively charge e coli cells and the adsorption desorption process of pathogen on ppynws anode determined its disinfection abilities the stability of disinfection device using ppnws electrodes was demonstrated by the continuous operation of 7 days at the applied voltage of 1 0 v achieving above 4 log e coli removal in tap water with energy consumption below 20 mj l which was more excellent than the metallic compound based nanowires electrode energy consumption above 200 mj l and durability blow 8 h

16519,micropollutants mp with varying ozone reactive moieties were spiked to lake water in the influent of a drinking water pilot plant consisting of an ozonation followed by a biological sand filtration during ozonation 227 transformation products otps from 39 of the spiked 51 mps were detected after solid phase extraction by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms ms based on the ms ms data tentative molecular structures are proposed reaction mechanisms for the formation of a large number of otps are suggested by combination of the kinetics of formation and abatement and state of the art knowledge on ozone and hydroxyl radical chemistry otps forming as primary or higher generation products from the oxidation of mps could be differentiated however some expected products from the reactions of ozone with activated aromatic compounds and olefins were not detected with the applied analytical procedure 187 otps were present in the sand filtration in sufficiently high concentrations to elucidate their fate in this treatment step 35 of these otps 19 were abated in the sand filtration step most likely due to biodegradation only 24 13 of the otps were abated more efficiently than the parent compounds with a dependency on the functional group of the parent mps and otps overall this study provides evidence that the common assumption that otps are easily abated in biological post treatment is not generally valid nevertheless it is unknown how the otps which escaped detection would have behaved in the biological post treatment keywords ozone hydroxyl radical sand filter transformation products abatement lake water 1 introduction oxidation processes have been applied for water disinfection for more than a century von gunten 2018 since several decades such processes are also applied for the oxidative abatement of micropollutants with a strong focus on ozonation and advanced oxidation processes aops von gunten 2018 the efficiency of the abatement of micropollutants during oxidation processes depends on reaction kinetics which is related to the structural features of the target compounds lee and von gunten 2012 typically micropollutants are not mineralized and a suite of transformation products is formed lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during ozonation and aops the formed transformation products have often only limited residual biological activity related to the originally intended effects lee and von gunten 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation processes are currently also applied for enhanced treatment of municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents to protect the aquatic environment or for potable reuse purposes eggen et al 2014 gerrity et al 2013 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2003 olivieri et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 reungoat et al 2010 ternes et al 2003 due to the formation of mostly low molecular weight biodegradable organic compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids summarized as assimilable organic carbon aoc biodegradable organic carbon bdoc during ozonation of waters containing dissolved organic matter dom it is generally followed by a biological post treatment to abate aoc bdoc bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021 hammes et al 2006 marron et al 2020 rosario ortiz et al 2016 van der kooij et al 1989 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 it has also been demonstrated that toxicity which can be formed during ozonation probably related to aldehydes ketones etc is mostly abated during biological post filtration prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2010 based on these observations it has often been suggested that biological post treatment will also degrade transformation products otps formed from micropollutants during ozonation the fate of otps from the direct reaction with ozone during biological processes has been theoretically assessed previously hübner et al 2015 it has been concluded in that study that otps from amine containing compounds with a n oxidation are generally less biodegradable than those formed from aromatic ring opening products and olefinic compounds aldehyde and ketone formation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this could be at least partially confirmed in one study on the biodegradability of otps of carbamazepine hübner et al 2014 recently it has been demonstrated that biological post treatment after ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents has little effect on the abatement of many different transformation products bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021 kharel et al 2021 however two of these studies had a partial bias on amine type compounds especially tertiary amines with the ensuing formation of n oxides von sonntag and von gunten 2012 one additional difference between the theoretical study by hübner et al 2015 and ozonation in real water systems is the role of hydroxyl radicals oh which are formed as secondary oxidants from the ozone decomposition hoigné and bader 1975 staehelin et al 1984 since oh are very reactive with organic compounds a significantly higher number and variety of transformation products can be expected in presence of this oxidant von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 so far a systematic evaluation of the formation of otps from target compounds with various ozone reactive functional groups is missing for realistic ozonation conditions furthermore there is only limited experimental information on the fate of micropollutants and the corresponding otps in biological post filtration after ozonation the goal of this study was to systematically evaluate the formation of otps from a large selection of target compounds by kinetic and mechanistic considerations and compare the abatement of otps with their parent micropollutants in a post treatment by a biological sand filter fifty one micropollutants were selected most of them with distinct ozone reactive sites some with only low ozone reactivity the experiments were carried out on a pilot plant for drinking water production consisting of an ozonation reactor with a post treatment by biological sand filtration where the selected micropollutants were spiked to the raw lake water water samples taken at 12 different locations throughout the treatment train were measured after solid phase extraction with liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms ms a screening for the formation of transformation product signals from the selected parent micropollutants was performed based on signals that were detected in laboratory ozonation experiments with a synthetic water matrix mimicking realistic conditions the structures of the otps were elucidated and the formation of the otps was rationalized by kinetic and mechanistic information on ozone and oh radical chemistry furthermore the fate of the otps in the biological sand filtration was compared to the fate of their respective parent compounds which were spiked directly on the sand filter 2 material and methods 2 1 micropollutant selection and preparation of stock solution fifty one micropollutants mps were selected based on the

inhibitor a personal care product a dietary supplement and a stimulant see si5 a stock solution of all 51 mps was prepared 30 mg l each in 10 l deionized water to guarantee a complete dissolution the solution was stirred at 40 c overnight and subsequently filtered through a glass microfiber filter gf d 2 7 µm pore size whatman the stock solution was then diluted with tap water to a total volume of 120 l resulting in a mp concentration of 2 5 mg l each before dosing to the raw water of the pilot plant see section 2 3 for mp dosing in laboratory experiments 2 2 pilot scale ozonation with post treatment by biological sand filtration ozonation experiments were performed with a pilot scale reactor followed by a biological sand filtration as described in more detail previously bourgin et al 2017 fig s1 si3 ultra filtrated lake zürich water was continuously fed into a 4 chamber reactor with a total volume of 2 2 m3 kaiser et al 2013 operated at a flow of 4 2 m3 h continuous spiking of the mp mixture 2 5 mg l to the raw water final concentration of 1 µg l for each mp was started 17 h before sampling to enable steady state conditions about 2 5 times the hydraulic residence time of the whole system after spiking the mps to the main flow ozone produced from oxygen gas by an ozone generator ozonia switzerland was injected to a side stream 10 of the water flow and passed through a static mixer after mixing the ozone enriched side stream into the main stream and passing through a second static mixer a transferred ozone dose of 1 mg l 0 8 go3 gdoc was achieved the ozone reactor

switzerland was transferred to the sand filter column ozonated ultra filtrated lake zürich water without mp spiking was fed to the sand filter for 12 months prior to the ozonation experiments to enable growth of a stable microbial community the biological activity was tested before the ozonation experiments by spiking and measuring the abatement of paracetamol atenolol valsartan and carbamazepine which are known to be bio transformed to different extents in activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants helbling et al 2012 fig s2 si3 five sampling points were selected at the cylindric sand filter at depths of 20 40 80 120 and 160 cm sf20 sf40 sf80 sf120 sf160 and one at the outlet sfout fig s1 si3 replicate samples were taken at three different time points 17 19 5 and 22 5 h after the start of mp spiking in reverse direction i e from sfout to o3in the sampling tap was opened for approximately 1 min before water samples were taken at each sampling point two water samples were taken first for the analysis of otps via lc hrms ms 100 ml water was added to a 100 ml schott bottle that was spiked with 500 µl of a fresh na2so3 solution 50 mm immediately before sampling to quench ozone these samples were kept at 4 c in the dark until analysis second the residual ozone concentration was determined by the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 the ph doc concentration and temperature during the experimental campaign were stable at 7 8 1 2 mg l and 6 c respectively to compare the fate of the otps with the corresponding parent mps in sand filtration the experiment was repeated without ozone dosing after the last sampling of the above described experiment the addition of ozone was stopped while the spiking of the mps was continued to ensure steady state conditions sampling was conducted 15 17 5 and 20 5 h after stopping the ozonation sampling was performed similarly at the sampling points sfout sf160 sf120 sf80 sf40 sf20 sfin o3out for the analysis of mps by lc hrms ms additionally sand samples were taken after the last water sampling at a depth of 175 140 105 70 35 20 and 10 cm in triplicates to measure the bacterial abundance via the protein content fig s3 si3 by a slightly adapted method from rudolf von rohr et al 2014 text s1 si3 2 3 ozonation batch experiments o3ball a laboratory ozonation batch experiment was conducted in a matrix constituted of a similar ozone and oh exposure as the lake water but only with surrogate organic matter methanol and acetate to enable otp peak verification in this ozonation batch experiment o3ball all parent mps were spiked together to final concentrations of 1 µg l while methanol and acetate were added as promoters and inhibitors respectively to simulate the ozone decay and oh radical formation elovitz and von gunten 1999 details for these experiments are provided in gulde et al 2021 briefly 1 3 mg l ozone was added to the experimental solution at room temperature containing methanol 0 029 mm and acetate 0 15 mm in a phosphate buffer adjusted to ph 7 5 which corresponds to a oh scavenging rate of a doc concentration of 1 3 mg l aliquots were taken over the course of the experiments before and 53 158 308 488 s after ozone addition quenched with sulfite and kept at 4 c in the dark until lc hrms ms analysis additional experiments performed earlier allowed the backtracking of the parent mp to each of the formed otp see gulde et al 2021 2 4 chemical analysis and evaluation of results 2 4 1 determination of ozone and oh radical exposures in the pilot plant samples ozone exposure ʃ o3 dt could be determined from the area under the measured ozone depletion curves from ozone concentrations at sampling points figs s1 and s4 and table s1 si3 as the ozone reactor in the pilot plant was previously assessed to be close to a plug flow reactor gresch et al 2009 kaiser et al 2013 von gunten and hoigné 1994 the rct ratio of the concentrations of oh o3 elovitz and von gunten 1999 was calculated from the abatement of the ozone resistant compounds atrazine ibuprofen and ketoprofen according to previous studies bourgin et al 2017 elovitz and von gunten 1999 2 4 2 lc hrms ms method for analysis of micropollutants and their otps for the mp and otp analyses an online solid phase extraction spe coupled to a lc hrms ms measurement was applied details on the method including the used internal standard solutions are provided in gulde et al 2021 samples from the pilot plant were centrifuged 10 min 4300 rpm and 19 5 ml were mixed with 0 5 ml ultra purified water barnstead nanopure thermo scientific switzerland containing 16 µl internal standard solution 250 mg l for a final amount of 4 ng on the column for the preparation of the o3ball samples 5 ml of the sulfite quenched sample were mixed with 15 ml ultra purified water containing 16 µl internal standard solution the prepared 20 ml samples were loaded on spe cartridges 9 mg oasis hlb and 9 mg of a mixture of strata x aw strata x cw env 1 1 1 5 which were eluted with methanol containing 0 1 formic acid the chromatographic separation was carried out with an c18 atlantis t3 column particle size 5 µm 3 0 150 mm waters using a gradient of ultra purified water and methanol both acidified with 0 1 formic acid as eluents hr ms and ms ms acquisition were obtained by a q exactive ms instrument thermo scientific with r 140 000 at m z 200 and data dependent ms ms r 17 500 top 7 dynamic exclusion 5 s data dependent ms2 were triggered at otp masses that were identified from a previous study gulde et al 2021 separate runs for positive and negative electrospray ionization mode were acquired 2 4 3 identification of otp signals forming in the pilot plant experiment to identify otp signals the software compound discoverer 2 1 thermo scientific was used separately for positive and negative mode acquisitions all data from the pilot plant experiment were processed together with the data from the o3ball experiment to identify otp signals that form in both the pilot scale ozonation experiment and in the o3ball experiment an automatic filter and a manual selection was used the automatic filter had the following criteria signals had to i be detectable at least at one sampling point in all three replicates from the pilot plant experiments ii be at least 5 times higher than in the raw water before spiking of the mps blind iii be detectable in at least one sampling point of the o3ball experiment iv increase in the o3ball experiment at least two times from the reference sample before ozone addition to a later time point v have a retention time between 4 and 28 min and vi have an area of at least 100 000 or 50 000 in positive or negative mode respectively additionally signals were manually selected based on i reasonable presence clearly distinguishable from noise in the samples of the pilot plant and the laboratory ozonation experiments and absence in blind samples ii presence on the list of previously identified otp signals for each mp determined in an earlier study gulde et al 2021 o3bmix and iii a reasonable peak shape the assignment of parent mps was possible thanks to the earlier experiments o3bmix samples 2 4 4 structure elucidation of identified otps the structure elucidation was performed according to a previous study gulde et al 2021 and is only explained here in brief since an otp can form multiple components different adducts in source fragments related signals were grouped manually based on their rt and peak shapes within compound discoverer 2 1 assumed adducts m h m h m fa h and chemical formula were assigned using xcalibur qualbrowser 4 1 thermo scientific plausible otp structures were proposed based on the information of ms2 spectra and on known ozone reaction pathways using compound discoverer 2 1 and manual interpretation confidence levels were assigned as proposed by schymanski et al 2014 2 4 5 evaluation of the abatement of parent mps and otps the observed abatement of mps and otps in the ozonation reactor was assessed by the general rate law which includes the reactions with ozone and oh eq 1 1 ln c t 2 c t 1 k o 3 t 1 t 2 o 3 dt k oh t 1 t 2 oh dt where c is the concentration of a target compound at times t1 or t2 respectively during ozonation k o3 and k oh are the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the target compound with ozone and oh respectively for the conditions of the experiment ph 7 8 the previously reported second order rate constants k o3 and k oh are provided in si5 to estimate the observed relative abatement or formation of the mps or the otps during sand filtration the relative change of the concentration corrected with internal standards or area as given by compound discoverer respectively from the inlet to the outlet of the sand filter was calculated by eq 2 2 c r c out c in c in where c r is the relative change c is the mean concentration of parent mps or peak area of otps from the replicates out indicates the sampling point at the outlet of the sand filter which was sfout if all three replicate values were available fig s1 si3 if this was not the case the values of sfout and sf160 were combined for five otps that were already abated at these sampling points points closer to the inlet were chosen see si1 in indicates the sampling point at the inlet of the sand filter which was sf20 if all three replicate values were available otherwise the values of sf20 and sf40 were combined theoretically it would be better to use the sampling point after the ozonation reactor as in however ozone was still present at this sampling point residual ozone was degraded at the top layer of the sand filter with a concurrent formation of oh as indicated by the sudden decrease and or increase of some otps to classify the fate of mps and otps during sand filtration the following limits were chosen for the relative change c r abatement if c r 20 no abatement or formation if 20 c r 20 and formation if c r 20 however replicate values can scatter substantially and interpretation of only the mean values might lead to meaningless results therefore to identify relevant abatement or formation the uncertainty of c r was also taken into account by a monte carlo simulation 10 000 samples lognormal distribution empirical mean and standard deviation from the replicates therewith the probability of the relative change c r to be negative c r 0 was calculated an abatement was defined as relevant abatement if this probability was 95 and a formation was defined as relevant formation if the probability was 5 all other combinations i e not relevant abatement not relevant formation not relevant and no abatement or formation and relevant and no abatement or formation were defined as stable to estimate if an otp was better abated than its respective parent mp the difference of the relative change was calculated by eq 3 3 δ c r c r otp c r mp also here a monte carlo simulation 10 000 samples lognormal distribution empirical mean and standard deviation from the replicates was used to point out meaningful results by calculating the probability of δ c r 0 the abatement capacity of an otp in comparison to its respective parent mp was treated as better if this value was 90 as similar if this value was between 10 and 90 and as worse if this value was 10 2 4 6 bromate formation samples were taken before during and after ozonation and quenched with indigo for bromide adapted from salhi and von gunten 1999 and bromate analysis adapted from shah et al 2015 in the ozone reactor and sand filter the limits of quantification for bromide and bromate were 10 µg l and 0 2 µg l respectively with standard deviations of 5 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 pilot scale ozonation reactor 3 1 1 ozonation conditions ozonation in the pilot scale system was performed to elucidate the formation of otps from the selected mps by interpretation of lc hrms ms data of pilot and batch samples and kinetic and mechanistic information the ozonation conditions in the laboratory batch experiments with surrogate organic matter o3ball were similar in terms of the general oxidation conditions specific ozone dose ozone and oh exposure and rct fig s5 si3 as in the pilot scale ozonation reactor rct obtained in the ozonation laboratory batch experiments o3ball was 1 45 0 19 10 8 bottom of fig s5 si3 and in the pilot experiments in the range of 0 5 1 0 10 8 top of fig s5 si3 these values were similar to seven surface waters in a previous study 0 12 5 8 10 8 elovitz et al 2000 therefore in the laboratory system of the current study realistic ozonation conditions were achieved 3 1 2 parent mp abatement and otp formation study design and overview fifty one mps were spiked to the raw lake water before ozonation ozonation resulted in their abatement and formation of 480 otp signals which could be reduced to 274 otps after grouping of multiple signals adducts in source fragments 227 of these otps could be unambiguously related to a parent mp thanks to batch experiments performed earlier gulde et al 2021 for all these otps a structure elucidation was performed and the corresponding data is shown in si1 a summary of this data is also provided in si4 and table s3 si3 only the 187 otps with sufficiently high concentrations in the sand filter the 227 otps can be assigned to 39 parent mps as no otps could be identified for 12 parent otps acesulfame benzophenone 3 benzotriazole 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid emtricitabine ketoprofen metformin metoprolol mycophenolic acid naproxen ranitidine resveratrol the reason for not identifying certain otps can be manifold such as the limited analytical window low concentrations low stabilities of otps low pre concentration efficiency etc the evolution of all spiked mps and the corresponding otps was analyzed as a function of the ozone exposure and is presented in si1 based on this tentative reaction mechanisms for the otp formation are proposed as presented in si2 and for selected examples in figs 1 5 below in the panels presented in si1 for each otp the top two figures show the formation of an otp in the laboratory experiment left and the abatement of the parent mp with the ensuing formation of the otp as a function of the ozone exposure see fig s1 and table s1 si3 for the numerical values in the three pilot plant experiments right in si1 the compounds are ordered alphabetically with the abbreviation of the parent compound provided in section 2 1 and the mode of detection n negative p positive the exact mass with four decimal points and the retention time in min for better reading otps are referred to only by the abbreviation of the parent and the exact mass without decimal points in the following text if they can be unambiguously assigned otherwise also the retention time is provided 3 1 3 parent micropollutant abatement and otp formation kinetic assessment the kinetics of the abatement of mps is a crucial parameter to assess the efficiency of an ozonation and if the primary reaction occurs via ozone and or oh attack eq 1 due to the generally low oh exposure during ozonation only ozone reactive compounds show high abatement kinetics furthermore the rate of the formation of otps provides information about the transformation efficiency and whether the otps are primary secondary or higher level transformation products this information is important for mechanistic considerations to assess to which extent a transformation occurs directly or over several reaction steps and by reactions with ozone or oh or a combination thereof these aspects are crucial for the discussion of the product formation in section 3 1 4 to get a first impression about the agreement of the observed abatement kinetics of the parent mps to kinetic data from literature the abatement of the target mps at the sampling point o3sp2 with an ozone exposure of 14 10 3 ms was compared to the logarithm of the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the parent compounds with ozone k o3 as fig s6 si3 indicates the expected trends for the mp abatement are generally in good agreement with the results from the pilot scale experiments to assess the mp abatement and otp formation systematically a kinetic classification of four different patterns was carried out this was done by visual inspection of the data which allowed to distinguish four major trends for the mp abatement and the formation of the first detected otps i high abatement kinetics of the mp with a fast increase of the otp which is either stable or further abated ii high abatement kinetics of the mp with a slow and steady increase of the otp iii intermediate abatement kinetics of the mp with a parallel increase of the otp and iv low abatement kinetics of the mp with a parallel increase of the otps to illustrate this approach in the following some examples are discussed for each trend class more details are provided in section 3 1 4 where the formation mechanism for otps will be discussed i high abatement kinetics of the mp non detect or very low detect at o3 exposures 8 10 3 ms with fast increase of the otp which is either stable or further abated this is a typical case of a fast reaction of mps with ozone with calculated high second order rate constants k 500 m 1s 1 at 6 c during pilot scale ozonation resulting from a 99 abatement of a mp at an o3 exposure 8 10 3 ms this directly leads to a first generation of transformation products which are ozone resistant or slowly further abated by ozone and oh typically after the first attack of ozone many compounds containing only one ozone reactive functional group have a lower reactivity with ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 one case in point is the oxidation of atenolol ate si1 which reacts with an apparent second order rate constant of k o3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c benner et al 2008 at the secondary amine moiety to form the nitro compound ate255 see si2 which can further react at the aromatic ring with k o3 110 m 1s 1 at 20 c benner et al 2008 if an activation energy of 55 kj mol as for formate with a similar second order rate constant k o3 46 m 1s 1 at 20 c reisz et al 2014 is assumed a k o3 of 35 m 1s 1 at 6 c can be calculated for the aromatic ring in ate by the arrhenius equation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this would lead to a calculated 43 abatement of ate255 for an ozone exposure of 16 10 3 ms this is very close to the observed ca 50 further abatement of ate255 during ozonation from o3sp1 ozone exposure 8 10 3 ms until o3out ozone exposure 24 10 3 ms therefore it can be hypothesized that most of the further otp transformation occurs by a direct ozone reaction nevertheless oh also plays a certain role 5 10 however as shown for atrazine or ibuprofen si1 and fig s5 si3 an abatement by this route is not very efficient beyond an ozone exposure of about 8 10 3 ms during ozonation in laboratory and pilot experiments a short primary phase with high oh yield by direct electron transfer from dom to ozone is followed by a secondary phase during which oh formation occurs more slowly by the ozone decomposition chain reaction buffle et al 2006a buffle et al 2006b buffle and von gunten 2006 for several mps a similar pattern with a fast abatement of mps and the formation and relatively fast abatement of the otps by predominantly o3 and partially oh were found cephalexin cpx flecainide fle oseltamivir ose propranolol pro trimethoprim tri another example of a fast and direct formation of a transformation product is the oxidation of carbamazepine cbz si1 by ozone attack at the olefin group which leads to bqm cbz251 a previously detected product hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 however its further transformation by direct ozone reaction is slow k o3 3 m 1s 1 mcdowell et al 2005 which would lead to an abatement of 10 until o3out based on the measured ozone exposure however since an 80 abatement occurs in the pilot experiment this has to be due to oh reactions for which an overall second order rate constant k oh 7 109 m 1s 1 was estimated mcdowell et al 2005 from the abatement of atrazine an oh exposure of 1 2 10 10 ms can be calculated by considering both k o3 6 m 1s 1 and k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 acero et al 2000 taking into consideration eq 1 and the measured ozone exposure combining the o3 and oh exposure for cbz251 an abatement of ca 65 can be calculated until o3out ca 10 by direct ozone reaction ca 55 by oh reaction which is relatively close to the observed approximatively 80 abatement in the experiment considering the uncertainties of such estimates similar trends with an initial dominant reaction of the mps with ozone followed by an abatement of the otps mostly by oh are also observed for cetirizine cet clarithromycin cla citalopram cit clindamycin cli diclophenac dic diphenhydramine dip fenpropidin fen hydrochlorothiazide hct lidocaine lid phenazone phe sulpiride sul tramadol tra venlaflaxine ven other mps with high ozone reactivity for which no otps were detected are benzophenone 3 bzp emtricitabine emt metoprolol mto mycophenolic acid mya naproxen nap ranitidine ran resveratrol res ii fast abatement of the mp with slow formation of the otp high abatement kinetics followed by a slow increase of the otp is a typical indication for the formation of a secondary product from an un detected primary product formed from the direct reaction with ozone the secondary products still build up from the reaction of the un detected primary product with ozone and or oh even though the target mp has been completely depleted a good example for this category is carbamazepine cbz si1 with its otp baqd cbz283 as discussed above the fast oxidation of cbz leads to the primary product bqm cbz251 which is then further oxidized to bqd cbz267 and finally to baqd cbz283 mcdowell et al 2005 the oxidation of bqd is a slow process which leads to a continuous build up of baqd cbz283 until o3out further cases of this category are benzisothiazolone bit sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx iii intermediate abatement kinetics of the mp non detect or very low in the o3 exposure range above 8 10 3 ms and below 24 10 3 ms with a parallel otp formation compounds with an intermediate ozone reactivity might react with ozone and oh and the primary products can be formed from reactions with either ozone or oh bezafibrate bzf si1 is a representative compound with an intermediate ozone reactivity k o3 590 m 1s 1 at 20 c huber et al 2003 if we assume the same activation energy as above 55 kj mol a k o3 188 m 1s 1 at 6 c can be calculated leading to a predicted 80 abatement at an o3 exposure of 8 10 3 ms this is close to the observed abatement of 82 at the same o3 exposure the main site of ozone attack is the alkoxybenzene moiety which is controlling the ozone reactivity there are several products formed in parallel to its abatement during ozonation which is an indication for their direct formation from the target mp possibly by oh mps with similar reactivity patterns are caffeine cof methylprednisolone mpn propyzamide pyz and sitagliptin sit iv low abatement kinetics of the mp still detectable at o3 exposure of 24 10 3 ms with a parallel otp formation compounds with a low reactivity towards ozone show low abatement kinetics during ozonation which is mainly caused by the reaction with oh atrazine atz si1 is a classical case for this group of compounds with a k o3 6 m 1s 1 and k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 at room temperature acero et al 2000 under the experimental ozonation conditions in the pilot plant about 25 of its abatement is caused by a direct ozone reaction calculated from overall ozone exposure until o3out whereas 75 is due to reaction with oh typical primary products were detected such as deisopropylatrazine atz174 and deethylatrazine atz188 0698 but also secondary products such as atz188 0334 and atz246 several other compounds fall in this class for which otps were detected diuron diu gabapentin gab ibuprofen ibu lamotrigine lam mecoprop mec oxcarbazepine oxc prometon prm sucralose suc thiacloprid thi valsartan val or for which no otps were detected 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d acesulfame ace ketoprofen ket 3 1 4 mechanisms of otp formation in the following sections the detected otps with their proposed structures and mechanisms of their formation will be discussed based on si1 and si2 for the different classes of mps depending on their ozone reactive functional groups and the compounds are ordered alphabetically for each functional group the observed otps will be discussed based on mechanistic and kinetic understanding of ozone and oh reactions mostly gained from controlled laboratory experiments in literature therewith it is possible to test if the generally expected mechanisms occur within this empirical study under more realistic conditions at pilot scale in this section the focus is on all 227 otps from 39 mps which are also summarized in si1 and si2 and all 51 parent compounds are discussed even if no otps could be identified the main components of these otps were detected in positive mode for 158 and in negative mode for 69 otps the discussions include otps for which a formation mechanism can be proposed based on kinetic and mechanistic information however there are also numerous other otps for which the formation is unclear 3 1 4 1 tertiary amines cetirizine cet class i or ii the abatement of cet as a function of the ozone exposure is very efficient si1 and si2 at ph 7 8 cet reacts with an apparent second order rate constant k o3 2 4 105 m 1s 1 with ozone at 20 c borowska et al 2016 the otp cet217 has been detected in a previous mechanistic study from the direct ozone reaction with cet borowska et al 2016 even though it forms directly as a consequence of the abatement of cet a further increase is observed even after cet is completely depleted this points towards a formation of another primary product e g the expected but non detected n oxide which then further reacts to cet217 cet421 the second proposed product is a n oxide which is expected from the direct ozone attack on the tertiary amine moiety borowska et al 2016 but an additional oxygen is added cet421 is formed rapidly but also shows a further formation after cet has been completely depleted this points again towards a formation of a non detected n oxide followed by a secondary oh attack on the rest of the molecule in borowska et al 2016 the n oxide was formed as major otp in batch studies with oh scavengers but was also hardly found in ozonated wastewater supporting the further transformation by oh attack from a kinetic point of view intrinsic rate constants and number of carbons for oh attack a formation of a phenolic compound would be favorable however it would be abated very quickly to non detect during the further ozonation for example phenol has an apparent k o3 107 m 1s 1 at ph 8 and 20 c hoigné and bader 1983b a reaction mechanism over a transient oh induced phenol formation from aromatic moieties with a rapid further transformation by ozone can be generally hypothesized for mps or otps with low ozone reactivity this will not be discussed in detail for each mp again therefore in the case of cet421 a hydroxylation at the tertiary c atom to a tertiary alcohol seems the most likely mechanism citalopram cit class i fig 1 cit is quickly abated during ozonation and cit341 is the expected n oxide which is directly formed from cit si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the secondary otps such as cit245 cit261 and cit355 during ozonation of citalopram cit are formed from cit341 which is slowly oxidized by mostly oh via various mechanisms because no more ozone reactive sites are present in cit341 cit261 and cit355 are a result of an oh attack to form a carbonyl group h2 o von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 adjacent to the heterocyclic oxygen cit261 includes also a loss of the fluorobenzene ring the next generation products cit277 includes a further o addition to a hydroxylated species of cit261 which is most likely again caused by oh attack at the aliphatic side chains von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 because a short lived transient phenol moiety would escape detection clarithromycin cla class i cla is quickly abated with the formation of cla764 si1 si2 a n oxide at the tertiary amine moiety which has been previously reported k o3 4 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 20 c lange et al 2006 merel et al 2017 once the n oxide is formed there are no more ozone reactive moieties in this compound and cla764 can only slowly be further abated by reactions with oh this leads to the formation of carbonyls from alcohols cla762 and hydroxylated species cla794 von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 a second minor mechanism for tertiary amines involves an n dealkylation zimmermann et al 2012 the corresponding product is not observed however a second generation acid cla606 3485 h2 o2 is formed by reactions with oh von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 diphenhydramine dip class i dip is quickly abated with a formation of the n oxide dip272 by direct ozone reaction si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 dip210 is a secondary product which is formed slowly most likely by oh attack on the aromatic ring which may lead to a loss of one of the benzene rings and formation of a carboxyl group via several reaction routes pan et al 1993 the formation of dip278 from the ozonation of dip272 is characterized by a slow criegee type reaction on one of the aromatic rings k o3 benzene 2 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a which might be enhanced by a transient phenol formation the formation mechanism of dip167 is unclear it involves several reaction steps with oh finally leading to an intramolecular coupling coupling reactions of aromatic systems during ozonation have been observed before in low yields for phenol mainly in experiments with relatively high parent compound concentrations mvula and von sonntag 2003 this could be enhanced in the current study because of the higher ozone stability of benzene and the proximity of the two benzene rings fenpropidin fen class i abatement of fen leads to the primary n oxide product fen290 which is formed quickly during ozonation si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 further otps from fen290 are formed by an o addition fen292 most likely alcohol formation at the aliphatic chain and fen320 with a mass difference of h2 o2 the latter could be a result of a phenol formation with an ensuing further fast reaction to a benzoquinone by ozone ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 benzoquinones are less reactive with ozone k o3 benzoquinone 2 5 103 m 1s 1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 which explains why this compound can still be detected during ozonation benzoquinones are toxicologically relevant otps which need to be taken into consideration tentscher et al 2018 tentscher et al 2021 a direct oh attack on fen leads to two carboxylated products fen288 and a benzoquinone fen304 via a transient phenol which undergoes further reaction to the n oxide fen320 lidocaine lid class i fig 2 also for this tertiary amine the n oxide lid251 is the primary product si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the next generation otp from the oxidation of lid251 by oh is lid265 containing a carbonyl group von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 another product lid221 is an imine n oxide formed via the n desethyl lid by ozone attack lid221 is readily further degraded which is expected for imine n oxides k o3 n ethylethanimine oxide 1 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 room temperature lim et al 2019 the product of this reaction lid207 is assumed to be the corresponding nitro compound lim et al 2019 which has not been detected in this study in contrast the build up and slow further reactions of lid249 two products show that the secondary amine is deactivated by a formation of amide type compounds they are formed by oxidation of one of the three carbon atoms adjacent to the n by oh attack since there are two sites which lead to the same product and the third site is deactivated by an adjacent carbonyl group it is proposed that the higher peak areas are related to lid249 13 4 whereas lid249 13 9 accounts for the other peak sulpiride sul class i the n oxide sul358 is directly formed by ozone attack merel et al 2017 followed by the minor formation of sul231 by cleavage of a side chain si1 si2 because of the low ozone reactivity of the amide nitrogen the latter is probably formed by oh attack a c n bond cleavage at the amide has also been observed for other mps in this study see below for sul359 the sulfonamide group in sul358 is fully oxidized to a sulfonic acid which is probably due to oh attack lee et al 2004 tramadol tra class i for tra again the n oxide tra280 is the main otp merel et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2012 and the parent compound for further next generation otps such as carbonyl compounds tra294 11 9 12 7 and alcohols tra296 10 7 11 8 12 1 which are formed by oh attack on tra280 si1 si2 these products can further react by oh attack to tra310 and tra328 two further very minor tra296 13 1 13 8 products are formed from an ozone attack on the anisole of tra which has a k o3 77 m 1s 1 at 22 c zimmermann et al 2012 tra312 can either be formed from tra280 by ozone attack on the anisole or from tra296 13 1 13 8 by ozone attack on the tertiary amine moiety the n demethylated tra has also been detected tra250 but it is expected to be formed only in minor quantities zimmermann et al 2012 further oxidation of tra250 by oh leads to several alcohols and carbonyl type compounds tra264 tra266 some products have been formed from the oh attack of tra with an intact tertiary secondary amine group however further reactions of these compounds with ozone are expected to lead to the corresponding n oxides or nitro compounds lim et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2012 venlafaxine ven class i ven leads to a formation of the n oxide by ozone attack ven294 lajeunesse et al 2013 lester et al 2013 zucker et al 2018 which is followed by several otps formed by oh attack such as the alcohols ven310 three otps and the carbonyls ven308 two otps si1 si2 ven212 is a product formed by a loss of the cyclohexanol group induced by oh attack all these products still contain an anisole group which reacts with ozone with k o3 290 m 1s 1 at 20 c hoigné and bader 1983a and lead to their further abatement by direct ozone reaction to ring opening products see tra if an activation energy of 55 kj mol is assumed see section 3 1 3 at 6 c a k o3 anisole 92 m 1s 1 can be calculated which is very close to k o3 ven294 82 m 1s 1 which was calculated from the available abatement data since many of the otps have similar abatement patterns as ven294 it can be concluded that their abatement kinetics is also controlled by an ozone attack on the anisole group however the expected ring opening products have not been detected most likely because these more polar transformation products may not be retained on the spe cartridge an interesting side reaction is the formation of ven292 an amide which is recalcitrant at the nitrogen to further ozone attack this compound reacts by oh attack further to ven308 alcohol on hexyl ring and by ozone at the anisole group to other products finally also the n demethylated form of ven was detected ven264 and further oxidized to the amide ven278 which is then further abated by ozone attack on the anisole overall the observed ozonation mechanism of all discussed tertiary amines confirm that the following mechanism occur under the tested realistic set up the otp formation of tertiary amines is initiated by the n oxide formation which was observed as main product for nearly all tertiary amines the n oxide formation is followed by further attack of ozone reactive moieties e g anisole by ozone if we assume second order rate constants of k o3 100 m 1s 1 and k oh 5 109 m 1s 1 for the second reactive site e g anisole and a rct 10 8 the fraction of the ozone reaction is 67 therefore both ozone and oh induced higher generation products are possible if no further ozone reactive sites are present the reactions proceed by oh attack generally a preferential site of oh attack are aromatic moieties however due to the fast ozone reactions of the formed phenolic moieties they escape detection nevertheless some potential ring opening products were detected which could be the result of ozone attack on the transient phenols and support the occurrence of this reaction if no aromatic sites are present in the mps or otps oh attack occurs at aliphatic carbons leading mostly to alcohols and carbonyls which are often detected as secondary products 3 1 4 2 secondary amines atenolol ate class i several products are formed directly from ate by ozone attack at the secondary amine k o3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c and the anisole moieties k o3 110 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c benner et al 2008 si1 si2 the first detected product ate299 is a result of an ozone attack on the anisole moiety with the ensuing formation of the muconaldehyde type compound criegee type reaction even though the formation of an imine oxide from an ozone attack on the secondary amine would be kinetically favorable this non detected product is an intermediate to the nitro compound ate255 which is the expected end product from the reaction with ozone k o3 1 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 20 c lim et al 2019 shi and mccurry 2020 for a detailed discussion of the kinetics see section 3 1 3 flecainide fle class i fig 3 fle should react at the dialkoxybenzene ring with a k o3 1 3 105 m 1s 1 for dimethoxybenzene si1 si2 munoz and von sonntag 2000 however the trifluoromethyl groups may reduce the reactivity of the aromatic ring nevertheless the observed abatement kinetics of fle with an estimated k o3 700 m 1s 1 points toward this site because it is significantly more reactive than the piperidine n of fle with a k o3 70 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c tekle röttering et al 2016a nevertheless no products were identified from the reaction of ozone at the aromatic ring because they probably escape detection by the applied analytical procedure fle429 which is most likely an imine n oxide from an ozone attack on the secondary amine has been postulated as an intermediate for the oxidation of secondary amines to nitro compounds lim et al 2019 the further reaction of fle429 proceeds with an estimated from pilot plant data k o3 300 m 1s 1 which is about a factor of two lower than for the analogous imine n oxide of aliphatic amines k o3 608 m 1s 1 for n ethylethanimine oxide calculated at 6 c lim et al 2019 however such differences between an aliphatic and a cyclic imine n oxide seem possible the ensuing products are two nitro compounds with a ring opening on both sides of the imine oxide group and a carbonyl group fle461 the next generation product fle475 is formed by an oh attack on the carbonyl carbon to form an acid the formation of fle443 occurs by oh attack on the piperidine moiety of fle429 with the formation of a carbonyl moiety metoprolol mto class i mto has a very similar abatement profile as ate which is expected from similar reactivities with ozone benner et al 2008 however in this case no otps were observed si1 si2 overall secondary amines react to the expected formation of the n nitro compounds via the intermediate imine oxide which is not always detected if additional ozone reactive sites are present e g activated aromatic moieties some of the ensuing products have also been detected in absence of such moieties or if they are already oxidized further reactions with oh lead to alcohol and carbonyl type compounds 3 1 4 3 primary amines gabapentin gab class iv for gabapentin gab k o3 15 m 1s 1 ph 7 bourgin et al 2017 only one otp was observed which is formed directly from oh attack on the cyclohexyl moiety with the ensuing formation of a carbonyl group gab186 si1 si2 the expected nitro compound from the attack of ozone at the primary amine was not observed sitagliptin sit class iii sitagliptin with a k o3 1 8 103 m 1s 1 at ph 8 20 c hermes et al 2020 is abated somewhat more efficiently than other class iii compounds like bzf and mpn see below with direct and continuous formation of several products from which sit436 is highlighted because it is the expected formation of a nitro compound from the primary amine group si1 si2 lim et al 2019 shi and mccurry 2020 another otp sit422 results from an oh attack on the three methyl groups of the aliphatic heterocycle to form carbonyl amide type compounds hermes et al 2020 the exact location of the carbonyl group is unknown several other primary and secondary products have been observed and also partially described in literature however the mechanisms of their formation are currently unclear overall the compound basis for the assessment of primary amines was quite small nevertheless the expected formation of a nitro compound could be verified in the case of sit 3 1 4 4 olefins carbamazepine cbz class i the kinetics of the reactions of cbz have been discussed in section 3 1 3 there are several previous product studies on the transformation of cbz during ozonation azaïs et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 kråkström et al 2020 mcdowell et al 2005 the primary and fast ozone attack occurs at the olefin moiety and leads to a ring opening with a secondary ring formation cbz251 followed by further oxidations to cbz267 and cbz283 si1 si2 further products cbz163 cbz179 formed from an oh attack were detected here and in another study azaïs et al 2017 we suggest that the previously proposed structure cbz179 is incorrect because a phenolic compound has been proposed with an expected fast ozone reaction which would make its detection unlikely therefore we suggest a hydroxylamide type structure for cbz179 the evidence of our ms2 spectrum is not specific enough and fits to both structures from the build up pattern cbz163 and cbz179 seem to be formed from cbz251 by ozone oh attack on the pyrimidine ring and a cleavage of the c n bond of the amide type moiety furthermore cbz136 and cbz207 previously detected otps are formed azaïs et al 2017 however no detailed mechanism is available in a recent study an even broader range of otps was proposed kråkström et al 2020 caffeine cof class iii the intermediate reactivity of cof with ozone k o3 650 m 1s 1 at ph 8 1 20 c broséus et al 2009 warrants a direct ozone reaction cof has been classified as an olefin present in the imidazole type group which reacts with ozone at the c c double bond to ring opening products tekle röttering et al 2020 however the observed otp cof225 does not result from this reaction but an addition of two oxygen atoms si1 si2 this otp has been reported previously under alkaline conditions in absence of a scavenger for oh hence it is probably formed by oh attack rosal et al 2009 methylprednisolone mpn class iii the second order rate constant for the reaction of mpn with o3 is unknown however it is structurally similar to progesterone which contains also an olefin with an α carbonyl group k o3 480 m 1s 1 18 c barron et al 2006 mpn reacts via a criegee type mechanism with ozone to form a product with two aldehyde moieties this product has not been detected however two further oxidation products were observed si1 si2 mpn393 which has besides the additional aldehyde moieties a cleaved methanol group and an added hydroxyl group at one of the aliphatic carbon sites and mpn437 for which the primary product has been oxidized at the aldehyde to form a carboxylic acid by reactions with oh phenazone phe class i phe165 is formed directly from the parent compound by the fast reaction of ozone with phenazone k o3 5 104 m 1s 1 for aminophenazone zhang et al 2015 si1 si2 compared to pyrazole k o3 56 m 1s 1 tekle röttering et al 2020 the reactivity of phe is much enhanced due to conjugation with the aromatic ring the product formation phe165 occurs by an initial criegee type reaction with an ensuing cleavage of the n c o bond by hydrolysis this hydrolyses might also occur during storage of the samples phe179 is formed by oh attack on the methyl group of n ch3 propyzamide pyz class iii pyz has an ethinyl group as the main ozone reactive site with k o3 160 m 1s 1 at 10 c based on 1 ethinyl 1 cyclochexanol huber et al 2004 two main otps from the ozone attack on the ethinyl group are directly formed from pyz pyz301 pyz320 si1 si2 pyz320 may also be further transformed to pyz301 pyz274 is formed by decarboxylation of pyz301 overall it could be confirmed that the main site of primary attack of olefins and ethinyl groups are the c c double or triple bonds respectively with the formation of the corresponding carbonyl and acid groups in the special case of cbz a secondary ring formation has been observed 3 1 4 5 aromatic compounds 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d class iv 2 4 d does not have any ozone reactive sites and will be abated by oh no otps were detected from this compound si1 si2 this is probably again due to the formation of phenolic compounds by oh attack which are then rapidly abated by ozone to muconic type compounds which escape detection bezafibrate bzf class iii fig 4 bzf240 is the product of two criegee type attacks on the alkoxy aromatic moiety sui et al 2017 si1 si2 thereafter several products are formed from an oh attack initially bzf254 acid from aldehyde followed by the bzf212 by decarboxylation bzf226 acid from aldehyde and finally bzf196 dantas et al 2007 bzf254 can also be formed via formation of a phenol by an initial oh attack followed by a criegee type ring cleavage of the activated aromatic system the pathway to bzf256 is currently unclear but is most likely a combination of ozone and oh reactions bzf156 which has been previously reported sui et al 2017 is again a result of an oh induced cleavage of the c n bond of the amide group which has been observed for several other compounds in this study bzf376 formation is a consequence of a direct oh attack on bzf rivas et al 2019 this otp cannot unambiguously be assigned to a structure but an addition of an oh group on one of the aliphatic carbons is assumed benzophenone 3 bzp class i due to the phenolic moiety its abatement by ozone is very fast see cetirizine si1 this is a confirmation that even if phenolic compounds were formed their lifetime would be too short to be detected furthermore since there were no otps detected for this compound this is another indication that such otps most likely ring opening products from phenol oxidation escape our analytical procedure benzotriazole bzt bzt could not be quantified and no otps were detected for this compound diclofenac dic class i dic reacts with a k o3 6 8 105 1 106 m 1s 1 with ozone at room temperature huber et al 2003 sein et al 2008 based on its formation profile dic282 is the primary otp with a loss of ch2 relative to dic si1 si2 an ozone attack on the dic nitrogen has been proposed previously sein et al 2008 however it is unclear how this may lead to a loss of ch2 furthermore based on high second order rate constants for the reaction of hydroxylamines with ozone lim et al 2019 it should be detected in only very low concentrations based on its formation trend dic259 is a secondary otp formed by two criegee type reactions with a loss of four carbon atoms this product is then further transformed by another criegee type reaction and a decarboxylation to dic189 which was detected previously coelho et al 2009 hydrochlorothiazide hct class i hct is a special sulfonamide which reacts fast with ozone to chlorothiazide hct295 by electron transfer si1 si2 k o3 3 105 m 1s 1 at ph 8 borowska et al 2016 this can be slowly oxidized to the secondary otp hct311 and finally to hct313 and hct341 in very low yields borowska et al 2016 mecoprop mec class iii iv the kinetics of mec abatement is between group iii and iv with a k o3 100 m 1s 1 beltran et al 1994 only one otp mec227 was observed which is formed by oh attack at the toluene methyl group si1 si2 other expected products from an oh attack on the aromatic ring with the ensuing phenol formation will escape detection see cetirizine naproxen nap class i the alkoxynaphtalene group reacts quickly with ozone with k o3 105 m 1s 1 benner et al 2008 no products were found similar to some of the other fast reacting aromatic compounds sulfamethoxazole smx class ii only secondary products were detected for smx si1 si2 smx282 the nitro smx has also been detected in previous studies abellan et al 2008 gao et al 2014 willach et al 2017 and is expected to be formed via the corresponding hydroxylamine lim et al 2019 willach et al 2017 this otp has a much lower expected ozone reactivity k o3 nitrobenzene 0 09 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a therefore no further ozone reaction products from the nitrobenzene moiety were detected smx200 a subsequent product from the oxidation of smx282 is also formed from smz see below it results from a cleavage of the n c bond of the sulfonamide group similar to several other observations of n c bond cleaved of amides smx225 has been reported as a potential otp for the electrochemical transformation of smx martín de vidales et al 2012 therefore this is most likely an otp that is formed by oh attack on smx282 sulfamethazine smz class ii based on the formation profiles of the otps only secondary and later generation otps are detected for smz si1 si2 for smz the same secondary product smz200 is formed as for smx see above via oxidation of the aniline to a nitrobenzene and a slow cleavage of the sulfonamide n c bond it is unclear why the nitro smz was not detected in analogy to the nitro smx smx282 smz144 is the result of a n s bond cleavage and an ozone or an oh attack with ring opening of the pyrimidine tekle röttering et al 2016b this is expected to be a very slow process due to a low ozone and oh reactivity of the pyrimidine moiety k o3 0 5 m 1s 1 k oh 1 6 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 tekle röttering et al 2016b trimethoprim tri class i tri contains two reactive sites and at ph 7 8 the heterocyclic ring is the main moiety of ozone attack k o3 4 3 105 m 1s 1 dodd et al 2006 nevertheless also the trimethoxybenzene moiety reacts quickly with ozone k o3 8 104 m 1s 1 dodd et al 2006 based on the loss of c5h6 the detected otp tri225 is likely a result of ozone attacks on the trimethoxybenzene moiety and the other products escape detection si1 si2 overall activated aromatic compounds react quickly with ozone and it seems difficult to detect the ensuing otps when otps were identified often a ring opening is observed and it can be assumed that such products become too polar and escape the enrichment procedure for aniline type compounds otps with nitro groups have been detected electron transfer is another option of reactions of aromatic compounds with ozone the only example with direct evidence for this reaction path is hydrochlorothiazide furthermore aromatic compounds reacting with oh are expected to yield phenolic compounds which react too quickly with ozone to be detected under the given experimental conditions also the expected ring opening products from the ensuing ozone reactions were rarely detected in this study 3 1 4 6 sulfur containing compounds benzisothiazolone bit class ii there is no second order rate constant available for the bit ozone reaction however reduced sulfur species typically react readily with ozone to the corresponding sulfoxide von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which can explain the fast abatement of this target compound during ozonation in the pilot plant si1 si2 the further reaction of the sulfoxide by ozone to a sulfone type compound is much slower k o3 8 m 1s 1 for dmso von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which would lead to the continuous increase of the corresponding product for bit the formation of sulfoxide was not observed but the formation of the sulfone type product bit181 which has also been detected previously li et al 2016 however a significantly higher k o3 250 m 1s 1 for the reaction of the sulfoxide with ozone would be necessary to explain the relative fast increase of bit181 compared to dmso a higher second order rate constant for the reaction of bit sulfoxide can be expected due to the conjugation with the aromatic ring however its magnitude is unknown bit215 cl adduct of bit179 with a mass difference of h2 o2 the second detected otp is proposed to result from an oh attack on the aromatic ring to form a phenol with an ensuing reaction with ozone to the benzoquinone ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 emtricitabine emt class i emt is abated very quickly during ozonation due to an ozone attack at the thioether group si2 k o3 methionine 4 106 m 1s 1 pryor et al 1984 no otps were detected in this case however the formation of a sulfoxide can be expected as a primary product dodd et al 2010 overall with only two examples in this group it is difficult to draw general conclusions nevertheless due to the high reactivity of thioether groups the formation of sulfoxide and sulfone type otps can be expected 3 1 4 7 compounds with several ozone reactive moieties clindamycin cli 3 amine and thioether class i the primary otp is cli457 which contains a n oxide and a sulfoxide resulting from the parallel ozone reactions at the 3 amine and the thioether si1 si2 the reactivity of cli is expected to be very similar to lincomycin with kapp o3 n 1 58 106 m 1s 1 and kapp o3 s 3 26 105 m 1s 1 at ph 8 room temperature qiang et al 2004 since both k o3 are very high under the experimental conditions at the pilot plant the otps with ozone attack at only one site escape detection cli457 reacts slowly by oh attack to several carbonyl compounds cli427 cli471 further products e g n demethylated cli with a loss of sulfur cli381 were also detected however no mechanistic interpretation of these findings is currently available further otps from cli381 are formed by oh attack to a carbonyl cli395 and an alcohol cli397 cli187 are two products formed from a c n bond cleavage of the amide group followed by a formation of two alcohols on the cyclic structure these reactions are induced by oh attacks cephalexin cpx olefin thioether and 1 amine class ii under the experimental conditions in this study cpx reacts quickly with ozone k o3 9 1 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 7 at room temperature dodd et al 2006 si1 si2 in an ozonation study the main identified products were sulfoxide and carbonyl compounds resulting from the ozone attack on the thioether and the olefin dodd et al 2010 the attack at the 1 amine moiety is quite a bit slower lim et al 2019 the detected otp in this study cpx165 is not a primary product increase after full depletion of the target compound but the result of other otps nitroso moiety resulting from an ozone attack on the primary amine lim et al 2019 cpx165 also is a result from a cleavage of the c n bond at the amide group likely induced by oh attack as described previously mycophenolic acid mya olefin and activated aromatic moiety class i mya is expected to have a very high reactivity with ozone with a primary attack at the phenol moiety and a secondary attack at the olefin since both reactions are fast an otp with products on both sites is expected similar to cli the otp is expected to be very polar and might escape the enrichment procedure therefore no otp was detected for mya si2 oseltamivir ose olefin and 1 amine class i in analogy to the reaction of oseltamivir acid with ozone it is expected that the olefin is the main moiety of attack k o3 1 7 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 at room temperature mestankova et al 2012 the two otps ose303 are a result of this reaction but with an additional loss of c2h2 and addition of o si1 si2 the formation of a second 1 amine is proposed by an oh induced bond cleavage of the acetyl group one of the ose303 products could be a result of a secondary ring formation the other with the two free amine groups both ose303 are abated similarly probably due to an ozone attack on the primary amine moiety possible leading to a nitro compound ose343 ose359 is an otp with a bond cleavage of the olefin and an oxidation of the primary amine to the corresponding nitroso compound lim et al 2019 propranolol pro 2 amine and activated aromatic moiety class i the ozone reactivity of pro at ph 7 8 is governed by the attack on the alkoxynaphtalene moiety k o3 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 benner et al 2008 leading to a criegee type ring opening product this product escapes the analysis because the reaction of the secondary amine with ozone to pro308 is still sufficiently fast k o3 1 7 104 m 1s 1 benner et al 2008 si1 si2 pro308 has been reported previously to be an otp of pro benner and ternes 2009 since it is a hydroxyl amine it is expected to be quickly further oxidized to the ensuing nitro compound which was not detected in this study ranitidine ran 3 amine thioether and furan moiety class i the abatement of ran is very fast and likely products are formed with multiple ozone attacks at various sites none of them were detected in this study si2 resveratrol res resorcinol phenol and olefin class i res is expected to react with ozone at multiple sites and likely small molecular weight otps will be formed which may escape enrichment and or detection si2 overall for compounds with several reactive sites often the time resolution in the pilot ozonation experiments is not sufficient to find otps from the reaction at only one site some otps from multiple ozone attacks are detected others may escape detection since they are small and polar 3 1 4 8 compounds with low ozone reactivity acesulfame ace olefin class iv ace contains a deactivated olefin group k o3 88 m 1s 1 20 c kaiser et al 2013 which is the ozone reactive site of this compound the criegee type ring opening product has been proposed previously with an ensuing hydrolysis to smaller detected compounds scheurer et al 2012 however detection of these low molecular weight compounds is unlikely with the applied analytical procedure in the current study and therefore no otps were detected si2 atrazine atz class iv the kinetic features of atz are discussed in section 3 1 3 and are controlled by mostly oh reactions typical previously reported products were detected such as deisopropylatrazine atz174 deethylatrazine atz188 17 1 4 acetamido 2 chloro 6 isopropylaminos triazine cdit atz230 4 acetamido 2 chloro 6 ethylaminos triazine cdet atz216 and 4 acetamido 6 amino 2 chloro s triazine cdat atz188 12 0 si1 si2 acero et al 2000 barletta et al 2003 beltrán et al 1998 the imine type compounds which are formed in high yields from both ozone and oh reactions were not identified because they hydrolyse with half life times in the order of 4 h at ph 8 and result in the formation of many of the detected otps acero et al 2000 another secondary product atz212 has been detected and is formed by an oh substitution of the cl on the triazine ring even though this product has not been reported during ozonation an oh attack has been demonstrated previously on the triazine ring which may eventually lead to the formation to a hydroxylated otp tauber and von sonntag 2000 diuron diu class iv diu reacts with a k o3 16 5 m 1s 1 with ozone and lies between class iii and class iv benitez et al 2007 its primary otp diu216 is the dealkylated secondary amide which is formed by oh attack solís et al 2016 and is another example of a cleavage of a c n bond of an amide group si1 si2 substitution of cl by oh through oh attack has been reported before during ozonation with the formation of diu215 feng et al 2008 solís et al 2016 however the corresponding phenol type compound should be abated more readily than observed in the pilot plant ozonation as demonstrated by the tested phenolic target compounds e g benzophenone 3 hoigné and bader 1983b it is unclear why this does not happen diu199 is a secondary product most likely formed from diu216 another product with unknown structure diu201 has also been formed ibuprofen ibu class iv ibuprofen ibu has a similar ozone reactivity as atz k o3 9 6 m 1s 1 huber et al 2003 and two direct products have been detected ibu221 ibu240 si1 si2 they are most likely both results of oh attacks ketoprofen ket class iv ketoprofen which has two non activated benzene rings is expected to have a low ozone reactivity therefore it will mostly be abated by oh which possibly leads to a transient formation of phenolic compounds which then are abated very quickly by direct ozone reactions to products escaping detection si2 lamotrigine lam class iv the abatement of lamotrigine lam k o3 4 m 1s 1 keen et al 2014 is very similar to atz which means that oh play an important role in otp formation the two otps lam254 and lam259 were previously described during ozonation of lam si1 si2 bollmann et al 2016 keen et al 2014 even though an oh addition on the aromatic ring has been described before keen et al 2014 the formation of a phenolic compound lam272 is very unlikely and it should not be detectable see cetirizine hoigné and bader 1983b therefore an alternative for lam272 is the formation of an n oxide which should be much more recalcitrant towards further oxidation bollmann et al 2016 which is demonstrated by a steady increase of this otp metformin met class iv met could not be quantified in this study and no otps were detected oxcarbazepine oxc class iv even though there is no k o3 available for this compound it is expected to react slowly with ozone oxc238 is the only otp detected and it is hypothesized that a loss of the amide group and a formation of a carbonyl type compound occurs by oh attack si1 si2 oxc238 is an aniline type compound which reacts quickly with ozone which is reflected in the fast abatement of this otp prometon prm class iv prm which has a triazine structure leads to analogues otps as atz which are mostly formed by oh attack such as deisopropyl prm prm184 and prm240 with a carbonyl group at the methyl c si1 si2 further oh oxidation of the latter leads to carboxylic acid prm256 prm142 the otp without the isopropyl groups is also detected and is slowly formed from prm184 several other products are formed from oh reactions sucralose suc class iv suc has a very low reactivity with ozone k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 bourgin et al 2017 and reacts mostly with oh even though the corresponding k oh 1 56 109 m 1s 1 is quite low as well keen and linden 2013 during the uv h2o2 process several products with substitution of cl by oh have been identified keen and linden 2013 however the structure of suc376 is currently unclear si1 si2 the formation of an olefin type otp was previously proposed gulde et al 2021 keen and linden 2013 however the steady formation of suc376 during ozonation contradicts this assumption an olefin would escape detection because its abatement is faster than its formation thiacloprid thi class iv fig 5 the primary product is thi283 with the thioether oxidized to a sulfone group si1 si2 since the reaction kinetics are relatively low it is expected that this occurs via oh attack it seems that the thioether group is deactivated in this compound based on the patterns of the other otps it can be assumed that they are secondary products from thi283 one case in point is the loss of so2 from thi283 to thi251 further reactions with a loss of ch2s or c2h2s lead to the products thi237 or thi211 respectively the corresponding hypothesized structures are provided in fig 5 for thi211 two products with different retention times were detected only one of them is proposed in the mechanism in fig 5 valsartan val class iv sartan type compounds are known to be quite stable during ozonation bourgin et al 2018 based on the low measured reactivity of irbesartan a structurally similar compound k o3 23 m 1s 1 bourgin et al 2018 and a simulated k o3 34 m 1s 1 for val lee et al 2014 it is abated similarly to ibu and it can be assumed that val reacts mostly with oh an interesting case is val280 which degrades quickly after its formation si1 si2 this is an indication that val280 has a higher ozone reactivity than the parent compound k o3 200 m 1s 1 calculated based on the abatement of val280 this could be due to the formation of a secondary amine k o3 800 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 and 20 c lim et al 2019 for which a lower k o3 in the order of the calculated value at 6 c can be assumed overall the product formation of mps with low ozone reactivity is governed by oh reactions which may lead to a much broader product distribution for non activated aromatic compounds phenolic moieties may be formed which are extremely short lived in one case the formation of an aniline type compound was observed which is then also quickly abated by direct reaction with ozone 3 1 5 bromate formation bromate increased linearly as a function of the contact in the ozonation reactor since the bromide level was low 12 15 µg l the maximum bromate concentration at o3out was only about 2 µg l fig s7 si3 which is well below the drinking water standard of 10 µg l who 2017 the bromate level increased in the sand filter because there was still a significant ozone residual concentration at o3out fig s3 si3 ozone was completely depleted in the first 10 cm of the sand filter fig s3 si3 and bromate still increased in this part of the filter to approximately 3 5 µg l as expected bromate was not degraded in the sand filter because it is only biodegradable under denitrifying conditions which are not common after ozonation with a high residual oxygen concentration hijnen et al 1995 3 2 pilot scale sand filter 3 2 1 general considerations a post treatment with a biologically active sand filter was tested to elucidate the abatement of otps relative to their parent compounds such a treatment often follows ozonation to improve the biostability of the water by degradation of bioavailable bulk organic matter produced in ozonation and it is often assumed that otps are also well abated during this treatment step to test the biological activity of the sand filter four test compounds with known biodegradability were dosed to the filter inlet and their abatement was measured as a function of the filter depth fig s2 si3 carbamazepine low biodegradation valsartan intermediate biodegradation atenolol high biodegradation paracetamol high biodegradation bourgin et al 2018 falås et al 2016 helbling et al 2012 the observed abatement of the selected compounds at a filter depth of 200 cm was in line with the expected efficiency for their biodegradability the biological activity of the sand filter is further illustrated by the abatement of about 25 of doc corresponding to bdoc during sand filtration after ozonation fig s8 si3 this abatement is caused by low molecular weight organic compounds aldehydes ketones organic acids etc formed during ozonation which are degraded during the biological post filtration hammes et al 2006 van der kooij et al 1989 aoc was also measured but was below the quantification limit 10 µg l in all samples furthermore sand samples were taken at different depths of the sand filter and protein analyses were performed to determine the bacterial density semi quantitatively rudolf von rohr et al 2014 the bacterial density decreased from the top of the filter to about 50 cm depth where it leveled off fig s3 si3 even though it can be expected that sorption plays a minor role for the abatement of the mps and otps it cannot be entirely excluded furthermore ion trapping in protozoans which are present in biologically active sand filters webster and fierer 2019 could be another mode of abatement of amine type compounds gulde et al 2018 therefore in the following discussion abatement is often used instead of biotransformation or biodegradation 3 2 2 parent compounds for mps which were abated in the sand filter often an initially faster abatement in the first 50 cm of the sand filter column is observed followed by a slower decrease roughly similar to the protein density distribution in the sand filter fig s3 si3 and si1 indicating slightly enhanced biological activities in the top part of the sand filter from the 34 parent mps for which otps 187 were detected in high enough concentrations to be evaluated in the sandfilter 22 65 were stable and 12 35 were abated by more than 20 in the sand filter si1 in general amine type compounds were better abated than aromatic or olefinic compounds fig 6 abatement in the sand filter for each individual mp is provided in si1 and si5 3 2 3 otps from the 227 otps that were identified 187 otps from 34 parent compounds resulted in meaningful data in the sand filtration si1 table s3 si3 si4 three patterns could be observed for the fate of otps in the biological sand filtration i relevant abatement ii relevant formation or iii stability according to the classification in section 2 4 5 it is often assumed that a partial oxidation of recalcitrant micropollutants leads to a better biodegradability of the corresponding otps lee et al 2012 this perception is based on the efficiency of biological sand filtration for the removal of aoc and bdoc which are formed from the oxidation of dom see discussion in section 3 2 1 and fig s8 si3 the current study shows that this observation does not directly translate to mps and their otps from the 187 detected otps 143 76 were stable 35 19 were abated and 9 5 were formed these results are somewhat biased because as it has been demonstrated in the discussion of reaction mechanisms many expected products especially from aromatic and olefinic compounds escape detection however based on the detected otps it is clear that oxidative transformations of micropollutants does not necessarily lead to otps that are readily abated in biological post treatment this might also be caused by the fact that microorganisms were not adapted to the mps and its otps because the degradation is controlled by a co metabolic pathway benner et al 2013 from a screening of the detected otps abatement can be observed for the following overarching structural features aldehydes carbonyls carboxylic acids alcohols and amides this comparison provides only a rough overview because often several such functional groups can be present in otps and the detected functional groups are not necessarily decisive for the abatement in large molecules therefore it is often unclear which functional group is responsible for the abatement in the following discussion certain otp types are grouped together aldehydes carbonyls and carboxylic acids can be formed from the reactions of olefins and aromatic compounds and sometimes aliphatic groups with ozone and or oh whereas alcohols are mostly formed from the reactions of aliphatic groups with oh the formation of amides is as of yet not clearly related to the classes of functional groups of this study in a previous investigation it has been shown by a theoretical assessment that otps from olefins and aromatic compounds with the formation of the corresponding aldehydes carbonyls and carboxylic acids are expected to have a better biodegradability than the parent compounds hübner et al 2015 furthermore it has been demonstrated that amides are biodegradable in sewage sludge seeded bioreactors helbling et al 2010 table s2 si3 provides an overview over the fate of various newly formed functional groups of otps with clear structures in the biological sand filtration aldehydes carbonyls aliphatic alcohols carboxylic acids 1 2 and 3 amides n s oxides 36 of aldehydes carbonyls alcohols 29 of carboxylic acids and 27 of amides showed abatement for the other functional groups it was 20 10 for n s oxides it has to be noted that relatively low numbers of compounds were tested in this study and therefore these numbers just provide a rough estimate in the following the 35 otps which show a relevant abatement in the sand filter as differentiated in table s3 si3 and si1 from otps that are not abated and for which clear structures could be proposed will be discussed the discussion is based on the functional groups of the otps 3 2 3 1 aldehydes carbonyls alcohols fourteen aldehyde carbonyl alcohol type compounds for which structures could be proposed and which are abated to a relevant extent in the sand filtration are shown in fig 7 they include otps from bezafibrate carbamazepine 2 otps cetirizine fenpropidin 3 otps flecainide prometon propyzamide sitagliptin 2 otps tramadol and valsartan and comprise 36 of all newly formed aldehydes carbonyls and aliphatic alcohols with proposed structures si1 and table s3 si3 these otps are related to various ozone reactive functional groups bzf240 is formed by ring opening of the aromatic ring of bezafibrate with a predicted enhanced biodegradability hübner et al 2015 two products from carbamazepine are induced by an ozone attack on the olefin followed by secondary reactions cbz251 bqm cbz179 cbz251 has been shown previously to have an enhanced biodegradability hübner et al 2014 a dealkylation of one of the tertiary amine groups in cetirizine leads to cet217 borowska et al 2016 with a significant abatement in the sand filtration three otps of fenpropidin fen274 fen288 fen292 containing carbonyls or alcohols formed by oh attack are partially abated in the sand filter one otp of flecainide containing a nitro and an aldehyde group fle461 20 7 or fle461 21 3 fig 3 is abated since the precursor of these products fle429 imine oxide is not abated it can be assumed that the enhancement is due to the formation of the aldehyde moiety in fle461 only one of the two possible products is shown in fig 7 see also fig 3 one of the products of the oxidation of prometon by oh is prm240 with an aldehyde on one of the isopropyl groups this modification leads to an enhanced abatement of this otp an otp as a result from the oxidation of the ethinyl group in propyzamide is formed pyz320 and abated in the sand filter two alcohol containing secondary otps from sitagliptin sit249 sit281 were found to be partially abated in the sand filter the primary otp of tramadol tra280 is further transformed to various other otps mainly by oh attack one case in point is tra328 13 1 an otp with three additional oxygen atoms which is caused by ring opening and addition of an alcohol group this renders it slightly but significantly more biodegradable than tramadol or tra312 with two additional oxygen atoms ion trapping see section 3 2 1 cannot be the cause for the abatement of tra328 13 1 because the tertiary amine group has been transformed to an n oxide the introduction of a carbonyl group on one of the aliphatic carbons of valsartan val450 leads to a relevant abatement of this otp 3 2 3 2 carboxylic acids carboxylic acid type compounds for which structures could be proposed and which are relevantly abated in the sand filtration are shown in fig 8 these 4 otps are derived from bezafibrate flecainide propyzamide and valsartan and comprise 29 of all newly detected carboxylic acids si1 and table s3 si3 for bezafibrate a formation of a carboxylic acid with a carbonyl in α position has been observed as a consequence of a criegee type reaction on the alkoxybenzene moiety bzf254 fig 4 however this product is not biodegradable a related product bzf256 has an enhanced biodegradability it has an oh group in α position to the carboxyl group its formation is not entirely clear however oh reactions most likely play an important role this example illustrates that small differences in molecular structures can have significant effects on the biodegradability of otps for flecainide an otp with a carboxylic acid group fle475 seems to be even more efficiently abated than its precursor fle461 fig 7 with an aldehyde group for the oxidation of the ethinyl group of propyzamide two carboxylic type products have been identified pyz301 pyz274 it is intriguing that pyz301 is not biodegradable whereas pyz274 shows enhanced abatement the carbonyl group in α position to the carboxylic group in the case of pyz301 as in bzf254 enhances the electrophilic character and may hinder the further oxidation of this product other carboxylic compounds are formed from the oxidation of valsartan to the corresponding benzoic acid val336 in fig 8 val450 in fig 7 even though valsartan is also abated during sand filtration already contains a carboxylic acid group the otps val336 and val450 show an enhanced abatement 3 2 3 3 amides six amide type compounds for which structures could be proposed and which are abated in the sand filtration are shown in fig 9 these otps are formed from bezafibrate cephalexin diclofenac diuron 2 otps and phenazone together with other well abated amides which were discussed before as they contain also other functional groups like aldehydes see figs 7 and 8 they comprise 27 of all suggested newly formed amide type compounds si1 and table s3 si3 dealkylation of the amide group of bezafibrate and cephalexin lead to the formation of primary amide structures bzf156 cpx165 dic189 is an amide type secondary product of the oxidation of diclofenac with an enhanced abatement for the formation of diu216 from diuron a dealkylation as for bzf156 can be assumed for diu199 additionally a substitution of cl by oh has been proposed the transformation of the tertiary amide structure in diuron to a secondary amide leads to an enhancement of the biodegradability of diu216 as expected from a previous study helbling et al 2010 the oxidation of phenazone leads to the formation of phe179 which is significantly better abated than the parent compound 3 2 3 4 miscellaneous otp structures three miscellaneous otps for which a structure was proposed and which are abated in the sand filtration are shown in fig 10 these otps are derived from diphenhydramine sulfamethoxazole and thiacloprid an interesting case is the formation of dip167 in small quantities as a secondary otp from diphenhydramine it is most likely formed by oh reactions however a detailed formation mechanism is currently not available smx225 a secondary otp of the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole is significantly better biodegradable than its precursors based on the stability of smx282 nitro smx in the sand filter the nitrobenzene is recalcitrant and thus the secondary ring formation seems to be responsible for this observation thi283 a sulfone type primary otp from thiacloprid has a similar abatement efficiency as the parent compound which indicates that the molecular changes might not be important for biodegradation cla764 the n oxide of clarithromycin not shown in fig 10 has a similar abatement efficiency as its parent compound which indicates again that molecular features in the parent compound control the biodegradation aldehydes carbonyl groups seven further otps were abated to a relevant extent however the proposed structures were not clear enough to assign them to one of the discussed groups these otps are fen276 fle301 fle444 sit171 sit391 smz152 smz222 si1 si2 3 2 4 comparison of the abatement of parent mps with the otps to assess the overall treatment efficiency ozonation combined with biological sand filtration a comparison of the abatement of parent compounds and otps in the sand filter was carried out in the following the abatement of otps relative to the parent compounds is discussed for three types of cases i otps with similar ii worse or iii better abatement than their parent compounds section 2 4 5 and si1 table s3 si3 for similar abatement oxidative transformation might not have altered the biodegradable part of the structure for worse abatement some modifications of the biodegradable part s of the compound might have occurred for better abatement new biodegradable functional groups are formed the otps with no abatement 143 or formation 9 will not be further discussed as this would be beyond the scope of this paper for these otps the oxidative transformation does not introduce biodegradable functional groups and in the case of formation otps from biological and chemical oxidation are the same and further formed from a precursor mp or otp i nine otps with similar and relevant abatement as the corresponding parent compound for some otps with similar abatement efficiency as their parent compounds it can be assumed that the structural features which are responsible for biodegradation are not changed during oxidation or some new moieties are formed which hinder biodegradation at the original site but enable new pathways of biodegradation this was observed for 9 otps from four parent compounds clarithromycin 1 otp fenpropidin 3 otps flecainide 1 otp and sitagliptin 4 otps si1 for example cla764 is an n oxide with a similar abatement efficiency as the parent compound cla si1 therefore it can be hypothesized that the abatement is not related to the tertiary amine group which is oxidized to the n oxide in cla764 but probably due to the carbonyls and alcohols in the unaltered molecule see section 3 2 3 this also excludes the hypothesis of ion trapping for this compound gulde et al 2018 which is based on the protonation of the tertiary amine group for fenpropidin three otps fall in this category two otps fen274 fen 288 fig 7 result from an oxidation at the aliphatic chain the tertiary amine seems to be a critical functional group because the fen n oxide fen290 is not abated anymore nevertheless if the primary n oxide is oxidized to an alcohol on a side chain fen292 fig 7 an abatement is again observed alterations of the tert butyl benzene functional group to a benzoquinone type structure at the aromatic ring e g fen304 fen320 si1 si2 or more significant modifications on the piperidine moiety lead to a decrease of the biodegradability this is of importance since it has been demonstrated that benzoquinones are potentially toxic compounds tentscher et al 2021 wherefore the persistence of these compounds in biological post filtration is not desired for flecainide which is partially biodegradable the formation of the imine oxide fle429 si1 si2 table s3 si3 hinders a biodegradation also most other detected otps have relevant modifications at the piperidine moiety therefore it seems that an intact piperidine moiety is an important feature to enable biodegradation nevertheless further oxidation to one nitro compound fle461 fig 7 enhances the biodegradability again however the second otp with a nitro group and the same mass shows non relevant abatement it is hypothesized that the formation of a carbonyl is responsible for the degradation however the position of it seems decisive several otps of sitagliptin sit171 sit249 sit281 fig 7 have a similar pattern in the sand filter as the parent compound these three otps are significantly smaller molecules and do not contain the parent compound structure anymore furthermore sit391 also has a similar abatement efficiency as the parent compound overall it is unclear why this behavior is observed for these otps and not for other otps from sitagliptin one case in point for a none degradable otp is sit436 nitro compound this may be problematic due to the potential toxicity of nitro compounds lim et al 2019 however it is so far unknown if nitro compounds are generally not abated in biological post treatments overall the case of similar abatement of the parent and otps has been observed for only 9 otps 5 of all 187 otps from 4 parent compounds two tertiary amines one secondary amine and one primary amine the data base for these cases is relatively small wherefore no generalizations are possible at this point ii two otps with worse and relevant abatement than the corresponding parent compound for worse abatement of the otp some modifications of the biodegradable part s of the compound might have occurred only two cases 1 from all 187 otps with worse but relevant abatement of the otps were observed fen276 and thi283 for fen276 derived from fenpropidin modifications at the piperidine moiety seem to reduce the abatement efficiency as already observed for flecainide thi283 fig 10 is derived from thiacloprid with an oxidation of the thioether group this functional group might be at least partially relevant for the biodegradability of this compound iii 24 otps with better and relevant abatement relative to parent compound a biological post treatment is often applied after ozonation to improve the biostability of the water and it would be desirable to get an abatement of otps at the same time it is assumed that for a better abatement new functional groups are introduced to the molecule or existing functional groups are modified overall this case was only observed for 24 otps si1 table s3 si3 figs 7 10 which corresponds to 13 of the detected otps formed from 16 parent compounds namely bezafibrate 3 otps bzf156 bzf240 bzf256 figs 7 9 carbamazepine 2 otps cbz179 cbz251 fig 7 cetirizine 1 otp cet217 fig 7 cephalexin 1 otp cpx165 fig 9 diclofenac 1 otp dic189 fig 9 diphenhydramine 1 otp dip167 fig 10 diuron 2 otps diu199 diu216 fig 9 flecainide 3 otps fle475 fig 8 fle444 and fle301 si1 phenazone 1 otp phe179 fig 9 prometon 1 otp prm240 fig 7 propyzamide 2 otps pyz320 pyz274 figs 7 and 8 sulfamethoxazole 1 otp smx225 fig 10 sulfamethazine 2 otps smz152 smz222 si1 tramadol 1 otp tra328 fig 7 and valsartan 2 otps val336 val450 figs 7 and 8 most of the otps have been discussed in section 3 2 3 except for the 4 otps fle301 fle444 smz152 and smz222 for which no clear structures could be derived from this discussion of the formation and abatement of the otps it becomes evident that higher generation otps are often not related to the primary ozone reactive sites in the mps anymore nevertheless a comparison of the abatement of otps relative to the parent compound based on the primary ozone reactive site is shown in fig 11 in general for amine containing mps the abatement of the otps in the sand filter is only more efficient in rare cases whereas for activated aromatic and olefinic moieties in the parent mp an improvement was achieved for a significant fraction of compounds 36 and 50 respectively nevertheless the general assumption that a partial oxidative transformation of micropollutants leads to better biodegradable compounds could not be confirmed in this study from the discussion above it is evident that the formation of aldehyde carbonyl alcohol carboxylic acid and amide groups may enhance the degradation whereas n oxidation generally leads to more recalcitrant otps unless another site in the molecule is responsible for its biodegradability this also explains the relatively high proportion of worse abatement of otps from amine type compounds the two otps of the sulfur containing benzisothiazolone were abated worse than their parent mps with several ozone reactive sites do not generally lead to otps with a better biodegradability than the parents however for this class of compounds often a similar behavior as for the parent compounds is observed ozone resistant mps react predominantly with oh and also in this case a limited number of otps 6 18 showed a better abatement in the sand filter than the parent compounds this shows that oh oxidation and in general advanced oxidation processes do not seem to be more efficient in terms of the formation of biodegradable otps than conventional ozonation 4 practical implications the combination of lc hrms ms data from laboratory and pilot experiments with kinetic and mechanistic information on ozone and hydroxyl reactions can be applied to elucidate transformation product formation during ozonation with a higher plausibility than lc hrms ms alone this approach should be further developed to make significant advances in understanding the fate of micropollutants during ozonation this information can then be further used to assess the fate of transformation products during biological post treatment which is applied after ozonation to abate easily biodegradable compounds formed during the reactions of ozone and hydroxyl radicals with the dom von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this has been confirmed in the current study by the observed abatement of doc and selected micropollutants with known biodegradability in sand filtration after ozonation the successful combination of ozonation followed by biological filtration has often been assumed to be an equally important barrier for micropollutants and their otps from this study it can be concluded that biological post filtration is not very effective for the abatement of parent compounds and otps there are some trends which may suggest that different classes of otps might differ in biodegradability compared to their parent mps however more information would be needed to further confirm these preliminary observations as a general rule n containing compounds might be less biodegradable after ozonation due to formation of recalcitrant n o bonds whereas compounds with an attack of ozone and or oh on the carbon structure may lead to moieties such as aldehydes carbonyls alcohols and carboxylic acids which have a better chance of being biodegraded another class of compounds are amides which may be formed or transformed by reactions with hydroxyl radicals leading to biodegradable otps with the analytical window applied in this study compounds resulting from activation of aromatic moieties by phenol formation and the ensuing fast reactions with ozone as other small and polar otps might have escaped detection which may distort the overall picture this study demonstrates that ozonation abates micropollutants and forms a multitude of otps which might persist during biological post filtration this process can be considered as an oxidative dilution of the target compounds leading to significantly smaller concentrations of the otps von gunten 2018 other studies have demonstrated that many of the biologically active compounds lose their effects and eco toxicological tests have shown the same dodd et al 2009 escher et al 2009 huber et al 2004 mestankova et al 2011 mestankova et al 2016 however there are also known cases where more toxic otps are formed from target compounds on case in point is the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine from the bromide catalysed reaction of dimethlysulfamide with ozone schmidt and brauch 2008 von gunten et al 2010 nevertheless also due to the smaller concentrations of the otps the risk of enhanced toxicity is relatively small von gunten 2018 a shortcoming of the currently applied analytical approach is that the mass balance is unknown and it is unclear what other otps are formed to this end detailed laboratory studies with e g radiolabeled compounds could yield a better quantification of the otps and close the deficiency in the mass balance 5 conclusions fifty one micropollutants with various ozone reactive sites were spiked to a pilot ozonation system and their abatement with the ensuing formation of transformation products otps was investigated furthermore the fate of the micropollutants and the otps was investigated in a biological post treatment with a sand filter the following conclusions can be drawn 227 otps from 39 parent compounds were identified after solid phase extraction by lc hrms ms based on laboratory and full scale experiments with 187 otps from 34 parent compounds present in meaningful concentrations during the sand filtration a rigorous kinetic and mechanistic interpretation of the chemical structures from the ms ms data was a prerequisite to understand and explain the formation of a large number of otps based on ozone and hydroxyl reactions this approach also allowed to assess the plausibility of otps which were proposed in previous studies however also for a large number of proposed otps no mechanistic interpretation could be provided which warrants detailed studies under controlled conditions 35 otps had a relevant abatement in the biological sand filtration and 24 otps of them showed a better abatement than the corresponding parent compound overall this is a low fraction 13 of all the detected otps it could be shown that degradable otps often contained aldehyde carbonyl carboxylic alcohol or amide functional groups it seems that many of the expected otps from aromatic compounds and olefins escaped detection by the applied analytical approach this may have biased the findings of this study towards a worse outcome in terms of the fraction of biodegradable otps declaration of competing interest

16519,micropollutants mp with varying ozone reactive moieties were spiked to lake water in the influent of a drinking water pilot plant consisting of an ozonation followed by a biological sand filtration during ozonation 227 transformation products otps from 39 of the spiked 51 mps were detected after solid phase extraction by liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms ms based on the ms ms data tentative molecular structures are proposed reaction mechanisms for the formation of a large number of otps are suggested by combination of the kinetics of formation and abatement and state of the art knowledge on ozone and hydroxyl radical chemistry otps forming as primary or higher generation products from the oxidation of mps could be differentiated however some expected products from the reactions of ozone with activated aromatic compounds and olefins were not detected with the applied analytical procedure 187 otps were present in the sand filtration in sufficiently high concentrations to elucidate their fate in this treatment step 35 of these otps 19 were abated in the sand filtration step most likely due to biodegradation only 24 13 of the otps were abated more efficiently than the parent compounds with a dependency on the functional group of the parent mps and otps overall this study provides evidence that the common assumption that otps are easily abated in biological post treatment is not generally valid nevertheless it is unknown how the otps which escaped detection would have behaved in the biological post treatment keywords ozone hydroxyl radical sand filter transformation products abatement lake water 1 introduction oxidation processes have been applied for water disinfection for more than a century von gunten 2018 since several decades such processes are also applied for the oxidative abatement of micropollutants with a strong focus on ozonation and advanced oxidation processes aops von gunten 2018 the efficiency of the abatement of micropollutants during oxidation processes depends on reaction kinetics which is related to the structural features of the target compounds lee and von gunten 2012 typically micropollutants are not mineralized and a suite of transformation products is formed lee et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 during ozonation and aops the formed transformation products have often only limited residual biological activity related to the originally intended effects lee and von gunten 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation processes are currently also applied for enhanced treatment of municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents to protect the aquatic environment or for potable reuse purposes eggen et al 2014 gerrity et al 2013 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2003 olivieri et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 reungoat et al 2010 ternes et al 2003 due to the formation of mostly low molecular weight biodegradable organic compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids summarized as assimilable organic carbon aoc biodegradable organic carbon bdoc during ozonation of waters containing dissolved organic matter dom it is generally followed by a biological post treatment to abate aoc bdoc bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021 hammes et al 2006 marron et al 2020 rosario ortiz et al 2016 van der kooij et al 1989 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 zimmermann et al 2011 it has also been demonstrated that toxicity which can be formed during ozonation probably related to aldehydes ketones etc is mostly abated during biological post filtration prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2010 based on these observations it has often been suggested that biological post treatment will also degrade transformation products otps formed from micropollutants during ozonation the fate of otps from the direct reaction with ozone during biological processes has been theoretically assessed previously hübner et al 2015 it has been concluded in that study that otps from amine containing compounds with a n oxidation are generally less biodegradable than those formed from aromatic ring opening products and olefinic compounds aldehyde and ketone formation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this could be at least partially confirmed in one study on the biodegradability of otps of carbamazepine hübner et al 2014 recently it has been demonstrated that biological post treatment after ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents has little effect on the abatement of many different transformation products bourgin et al 2018 gulde et al 2021 kharel et al 2021 however two of these studies had a partial bias on amine type compounds especially tertiary amines with the ensuing formation of n oxides von sonntag and von gunten 2012 one additional difference between the theoretical study by hübner et al 2015 and ozonation in real water systems is the role of hydroxyl radicals oh which are formed as secondary oxidants from the ozone decomposition hoigné and bader 1975 staehelin et al 1984 since oh are very reactive with organic compounds a significantly higher number and variety of transformation products can be expected in presence of this oxidant von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 so far a systematic evaluation of the formation of otps from target compounds with various ozone reactive functional groups is missing for realistic ozonation conditions furthermore there is only limited experimental information on the fate of micropollutants and the corresponding otps in biological post filtration after ozonation the goal of this study was to systematically evaluate the formation of otps from a large selection of target compounds by kinetic and mechanistic considerations and compare the abatement of otps with their parent micropollutants in a post treatment by a biological sand filter fifty one micropollutants were selected most of them with distinct ozone reactive sites some with only low ozone reactivity the experiments were carried out on a pilot plant for drinking water production consisting of an ozonation reactor with a post treatment by biological sand filtration where the selected micropollutants were spiked to the raw lake water water samples taken at 12 different locations throughout the treatment train were measured after solid phase extraction with liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc hrms ms a screening for the formation of transformation product signals from the selected parent micropollutants was performed based on signals that were detected in laboratory ozonation experiments with a synthetic water matrix mimicking realistic conditions the structures of the otps were elucidated and the formation of the otps was rationalized by kinetic and mechanistic information on ozone and oh radical chemistry furthermore the fate of the otps in the biological sand filtration was compared to the fate of their respective parent compounds which were spiked directly on the sand filter 2 material and methods 2 1 micropollutant selection and preparation of stock solution fifty one micropollutants mps were selected based on the presence of ozone reactive functional groups whereby preferably only one such functional group was present in the structure and based on their abundance in wastewater effluents the structures of the

switzerland was transferred to the sand filter column ozonated ultra filtrated lake zürich water without mp spiking was fed to the sand filter for 12 months prior to the ozonation experiments to enable growth of a stable microbial community the biological activity was tested before the ozonation experiments by spiking and measuring the abatement of paracetamol atenolol valsartan and carbamazepine which are known to be bio transformed to different extents in activated sludge of wastewater treatment plants helbling et al 2012 fig s2 si3 five sampling points were selected at the cylindric sand filter at depths of 20 40 80 120 and 160 cm sf20 sf40 sf80 sf120 sf160 and one at the outlet sfout fig s1 si3 replicate samples were taken at three different time points 17 19 5 and 22 5 h after the start of mp spiking in reverse direction i e from sfout to o3in the sampling tap was opened for approximately 1 min before water samples were taken at each sampling point two water samples were taken first for the analysis of otps via lc hrms ms 100 ml water was added to a 100 ml schott bottle that was spiked with 500 µl of a fresh na2so3 solution 50 mm immediately before sampling to quench ozone these samples were kept at 4 c in the dark until analysis second the residual ozone concentration was determined by the indigo method bader and hoigne 1981 the ph doc concentration and temperature during the experimental campaign were stable at 7 8 1 2 mg l and 6 c respectively to compare the fate of the otps with the corresponding parent mps in sand filtration the experiment was repeated without ozone dosing after the last sampling of the above described experiment the addition of ozone was stopped while the spiking of the mps was continued to ensure steady state conditions sampling was conducted 15 17 5 and 20 5 h after stopping the ozonation sampling was performed similarly at the sampling points sfout sf160 sf120 sf80 sf40 sf20 sfin o3out for the analysis of mps by lc hrms ms additionally sand samples were taken after the last water sampling at a depth of 175 140 105 70 35 20 and 10 cm in triplicates to measure the bacterial abundance via the protein content fig s3 si3 by a slightly adapted method from rudolf von rohr et al 2014 text s1 si3 2 3 ozonation batch experiments o3ball a laboratory ozonation batch experiment was conducted in a matrix constituted of a similar ozone and oh exposure as the lake water but only with surrogate organic matter methanol and acetate to enable otp peak verification in this ozonation batch experiment o3ball all parent mps were spiked together to final concentrations of 1 µg l while methanol and acetate were added as promoters and inhibitors respectively to simulate the ozone decay and oh radical formation elovitz and von gunten 1999 details for these experiments are provided in gulde et al 2021 briefly 1 3 mg l ozone was added to the experimental solution at room temperature containing methanol 0 029 mm and acetate 0 15 mm in a phosphate buffer adjusted to ph 7 5 which corresponds to a oh scavenging rate of a doc concentration of 1 3 mg l aliquots were taken over the course of the experiments before and 53 158 308 488 s after ozone addition quenched with sulfite and kept at 4 c in the dark until lc hrms ms analysis additional experiments performed earlier allowed the backtracking of the parent mp to each of the formed otp see gulde et al 2021 2 4 chemical analysis and evaluation of results 2 4 1 determination of ozone and oh radical exposures in the pilot plant samples ozone exposure ʃ o3 dt could be determined from the area under the measured ozone depletion curves from ozone concentrations at sampling points figs s1 and s4 and table s1 si3 as the ozone reactor in the pilot plant was previously assessed to be close to a plug flow reactor gresch et al 2009 kaiser et al 2013 von gunten and hoigné 1994 the rct ratio of the concentrations of oh o3 elovitz and von gunten 1999 was calculated from the abatement of the ozone resistant compounds atrazine ibuprofen and ketoprofen according to previous studies bourgin et al 2017 elovitz and von gunten 1999 2 4 2 lc hrms ms method for analysis of micropollutants and their otps for the mp and otp analyses an online solid phase extraction spe coupled to a lc hrms ms measurement was applied details on the method including the used internal standard solutions are provided in gulde et al 2021 samples from the pilot plant were centrifuged 10 min 4300 rpm and 19 5 ml were mixed with 0 5 ml ultra purified water barnstead nanopure thermo scientific switzerland containing 16 µl internal standard solution 250 mg l for a final amount of 4 ng on the column for the preparation of the o3ball samples 5 ml of the sulfite quenched sample were mixed with 15 ml ultra purified water containing 16 µl internal standard solution the prepared 20 ml samples were loaded on spe cartridges 9 mg oasis hlb and 9 mg of a mixture of strata x aw strata x cw env 1 1 1 5 which were eluted with methanol containing 0 1 formic acid the chromatographic separation was carried out with an c18 atlantis t3 column particle size 5 µm 3 0 150 mm waters using a gradient of ultra purified water and methanol both acidified with 0 1 formic acid as eluents hr ms and ms ms acquisition were obtained by a q exactive ms instrument thermo scientific with r 140 000 at m z 200 and data dependent ms ms r 17 500 top 7 dynamic exclusion 5 s data dependent ms2 were triggered at otp masses that were identified from a previous study gulde et al 2021 separate runs for positive and negative electrospray ionization mode were acquired 2 4 3 identification of otp signals forming in the pilot plant experiment to identify otp signals the software compound discoverer 2 1 thermo scientific was used separately for positive and negative mode acquisitions all data from the pilot plant experiment were processed together with the data from the o3ball experiment to identify otp signals that form in both the pilot scale ozonation experiment and in the o3ball experiment an automatic filter and a manual selection was used the automatic filter had the following criteria signals had to i be detectable at least at one sampling point in all three replicates from the pilot plant experiments ii be at least 5 times higher than in the raw water before spiking of the mps blind iii be detectable in at least one sampling point of the o3ball experiment iv increase in the o3ball experiment at least two times from the reference sample before ozone addition to a later time point v have a retention time between 4 and 28 min and vi have an area of at least 100 000 or 50 000 in positive or negative mode respectively additionally signals were manually selected based on i reasonable presence clearly distinguishable from noise in the samples of the pilot plant and the laboratory ozonation experiments and absence in blind samples ii presence on the list of previously identified otp signals for each mp determined in an earlier study gulde et al 2021 o3bmix and iii a reasonable peak shape the assignment of parent mps was possible thanks to the earlier experiments o3bmix samples 2 4 4 structure elucidation of identified otps the structure elucidation was performed according to a previous study gulde et al 2021 and is only explained here in brief since an otp can form multiple components different adducts in source fragments related signals were grouped manually based on their rt and peak shapes within compound discoverer 2 1 assumed adducts m h m h m fa h and chemical formula were assigned using xcalibur qualbrowser 4 1 thermo scientific plausible otp structures were proposed based on the information of ms2 spectra and on known ozone reaction pathways using compound discoverer 2 1 and manual interpretation confidence levels were assigned as proposed by schymanski et al 2014 2 4 5 evaluation of the abatement of parent mps and otps the observed abatement of mps and otps in the ozonation reactor was assessed by the general rate law which includes the reactions with ozone and oh eq 1 1 ln c t 2 c t 1 k o 3 t 1 t 2 o 3 dt k oh t 1 t 2 oh dt where c is the concentration of a target compound at times t1 or t2 respectively during ozonation k o3 and k oh are the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the target compound with ozone and oh respectively for the conditions of the experiment ph 7 8 the previously reported second order rate constants k o3 and k oh are provided in si5 to estimate the observed relative abatement or formation of the mps or the otps during sand filtration the relative change of the concentration corrected with internal standards or area as given by compound discoverer respectively from the inlet to the outlet of the sand filter was calculated by eq 2 2 c r c out c in c in where c r is the relative change c is the mean concentration of parent mps or peak area of otps from the replicates out indicates the sampling point at the outlet of the sand filter which was sfout if all three replicate values were available fig s1 si3 if this was not the case the values of sfout and sf160 were combined for five otps that were already abated at these sampling points points closer to the inlet were chosen see si1 in indicates the sampling point at the inlet of the sand filter which was sf20 if all three replicate values were available otherwise the values of sf20 and sf40 were combined theoretically it would be better to use the sampling point after the ozonation reactor as in however ozone was still present at this sampling point residual ozone was degraded at the top layer of the sand filter with a concurrent formation of oh as indicated by the sudden decrease and or increase of some otps to classify the fate of mps and otps during sand filtration the following limits were chosen for the relative change c r abatement if c r 20 no abatement or formation if 20 c r 20 and formation if c r 20 however replicate values can scatter substantially and interpretation of only the mean values might lead to meaningless results therefore to identify relevant abatement or formation the uncertainty of c r was also taken into account by a monte carlo simulation 10 000 samples lognormal distribution empirical mean and standard deviation from the replicates therewith the probability of the relative change c r to be negative c r 0 was calculated an abatement was defined as relevant abatement if this probability was 95 and a formation was defined as relevant formation if the probability was 5 all other combinations i e not relevant abatement not relevant formation not relevant and no abatement or formation and relevant and no abatement or formation were defined as stable to estimate if an otp was better abated than its respective parent mp the difference of the relative change was calculated by eq 3 3 δ c r c r otp c r mp also here a monte carlo simulation 10 000 samples lognormal distribution empirical mean and standard deviation from the replicates was used to point out meaningful results by calculating the probability of δ c r 0 the abatement capacity of an otp in comparison to its respective parent mp was treated as better if this value was 90 as similar if this value was between 10 and 90 and as worse if this value was 10 2 4 6 bromate formation samples were taken before during and after ozonation and quenched with indigo for bromide adapted from salhi and von gunten 1999 and bromate analysis adapted from shah et al 2015 in the ozone reactor and sand filter the limits of quantification for bromide and bromate were 10 µg l and 0 2 µg l respectively with standard deviations of 5 10 3 results and discussion 3 1 pilot scale ozonation reactor 3 1 1 ozonation conditions ozonation in the pilot scale system was performed to elucidate the formation of otps from the selected mps by interpretation of lc hrms ms data of pilot and batch samples and kinetic and mechanistic information the ozonation conditions in the laboratory batch experiments with surrogate organic matter o3ball were similar in terms of the general oxidation conditions specific ozone dose ozone and oh exposure and rct fig s5 si3 as in the pilot scale ozonation reactor rct obtained in the ozonation laboratory batch experiments o3ball was 1 45 0 19 10 8 bottom of fig s5 si3 and in the pilot experiments in the range of 0 5 1 0 10 8 top of fig s5 si3 these values were similar to seven surface waters in a previous study 0 12 5 8 10 8 elovitz et al 2000 therefore in the laboratory system of the current study realistic ozonation conditions were achieved 3 1 2 parent mp abatement and otp formation study design and overview fifty one mps were spiked to the raw lake water before ozonation ozonation resulted in their abatement and formation of 480 otp signals which could be reduced to 274 otps after grouping of multiple signals adducts in source fragments 227 of these otps could be unambiguously related to a parent mp thanks to batch experiments performed earlier gulde et al 2021 for all these otps a structure elucidation was performed and the corresponding data is shown in si1 a summary of this data is also provided in si4 and table s3 si3 only the 187 otps with sufficiently high concentrations in the sand filter the 227 otps can be assigned to 39 parent mps as no otps could be identified for 12 parent otps acesulfame benzophenone 3 benzotriazole 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid emtricitabine ketoprofen metformin metoprolol mycophenolic acid naproxen ranitidine resveratrol the reason for not identifying certain otps can be manifold such as the limited analytical window low concentrations low stabilities of otps low pre concentration efficiency etc the evolution of all spiked mps and the corresponding otps was analyzed as a function of the ozone exposure and is presented in si1 based on this tentative reaction mechanisms for the otp formation are proposed as presented in si2 and for selected examples in figs 1 5 below in the panels presented in si1 for each otp the top two figures show the formation of an otp in the laboratory experiment left and the abatement of the parent mp with the ensuing formation of the otp as a function of the ozone exposure see fig s1 and table s1 si3 for the numerical values in the three pilot plant experiments right in si1 the compounds are ordered alphabetically with the abbreviation of the parent compound provided in section 2 1 and the mode of detection n negative p positive the exact mass with four decimal points and the retention time in min for better reading otps are referred to only by the abbreviation of the parent and the exact mass without decimal points in the following text if they can be unambiguously assigned otherwise also the retention time is provided 3 1 3 parent micropollutant abatement and otp formation kinetic assessment the kinetics of the abatement of mps is a crucial parameter to assess the efficiency of an ozonation and if the primary reaction occurs via ozone and or oh attack eq 1 due to the generally low oh exposure during ozonation only ozone reactive compounds show high abatement kinetics furthermore the rate of the formation of otps provides information about the transformation efficiency and whether the otps are primary secondary or higher level transformation products this information is important for mechanistic considerations to assess to which extent a transformation occurs directly or over several reaction steps and by reactions with ozone or oh or a combination thereof these aspects are crucial for the discussion of the product formation in section 3 1 4 to get a first impression about the agreement of the observed abatement kinetics of the parent mps to kinetic data from literature the abatement of the target mps at the sampling point o3sp2 with an ozone exposure of 14 10 3 ms was compared to the logarithm of the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the parent compounds with ozone k o3 as fig s6 si3 indicates the expected trends for the mp abatement are generally in good agreement with the results from the pilot scale experiments to assess the mp abatement and otp formation systematically a kinetic classification of four different patterns was carried out this was done by visual inspection of the data which allowed to distinguish four major trends for the mp abatement and the formation of the first detected otps i high abatement kinetics of the mp with a fast increase of the otp which is either stable or further abated ii high abatement kinetics of the mp with a slow and steady increase of the otp iii intermediate abatement kinetics of the mp with a parallel increase of the otp and iv low abatement kinetics of the mp with a parallel increase of the otps to illustrate this approach in the following some examples are discussed for each trend class more details are provided in section 3 1 4 where the formation mechanism for otps will be discussed i high abatement kinetics of the mp non detect or very low detect at o3 exposures 8 10 3 ms with fast increase of the otp which is either stable or further abated this is a typical case of a fast reaction of mps with ozone with calculated high second order rate constants k 500 m 1s 1 at 6 c during pilot scale ozonation resulting from a 99 abatement of a mp at an o3 exposure 8 10 3 ms this directly leads to a first generation of transformation products which are ozone resistant or slowly further abated by ozone and oh typically after the first attack of ozone many compounds containing only one ozone reactive functional group have a lower reactivity with ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 one case in point is the oxidation of atenolol ate si1 which reacts with an apparent second order rate constant of k o3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c benner et al 2008 at the secondary amine moiety to form the nitro compound ate255 see si2 which can further react at the aromatic ring with k o3 110 m 1s 1 at 20 c benner et al 2008 if an activation energy of 55 kj mol as for formate with a similar second order rate constant k o3 46 m 1s 1 at 20 c reisz et al 2014 is assumed a k o3 of 35 m 1s 1 at 6 c can be calculated for the aromatic ring in ate by the arrhenius equation von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this would lead to a calculated 43 abatement of ate255 for an ozone exposure of 16 10 3 ms this is very close to the observed ca 50 further abatement of ate255 during ozonation from o3sp1 ozone exposure 8 10 3 ms until o3out ozone exposure 24 10 3 ms therefore it can be hypothesized that most of the further otp transformation occurs by a direct ozone reaction nevertheless oh also plays a certain role 5 10 however as shown for atrazine or ibuprofen si1 and fig s5 si3 an abatement by this route is not very efficient beyond an ozone exposure of about 8 10 3 ms during ozonation in laboratory and pilot experiments a short primary phase with high oh yield by direct electron transfer from dom to ozone is followed by a secondary phase during which oh formation occurs more slowly by the ozone decomposition chain reaction buffle et al 2006a buffle et al 2006b buffle and von gunten 2006 for several mps a similar pattern with a fast abatement of mps and the formation and relatively fast abatement of the otps by predominantly o3 and partially oh were found cephalexin cpx flecainide fle oseltamivir ose propranolol pro trimethoprim tri another example of a fast and direct formation of a transformation product is the oxidation of carbamazepine cbz si1 by ozone attack at the olefin group which leads to bqm cbz251 a previously detected product hübner et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2005 however its further transformation by direct ozone reaction is slow k o3 3 m 1s 1 mcdowell et al 2005 which would lead to an abatement of 10 until o3out based on the measured ozone exposure however since an 80 abatement occurs in the pilot experiment this has to be due to oh reactions for which an overall second order rate constant k oh 7 109 m 1s 1 was estimated mcdowell et al 2005 from the abatement of atrazine an oh exposure of 1 2 10 10 ms can be calculated by considering both k o3 6 m 1s 1 and k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 acero et al 2000 taking into consideration eq 1 and the measured ozone exposure combining the o3 and oh exposure for cbz251 an abatement of ca 65 can be calculated until o3out ca 10 by direct ozone reaction ca 55 by oh reaction which is relatively close to the observed approximatively 80 abatement in the experiment considering the uncertainties of such estimates similar trends with an initial dominant reaction of the mps with ozone followed by an abatement of the otps mostly by oh are also observed for cetirizine cet clarithromycin cla citalopram cit clindamycin cli diclophenac dic diphenhydramine dip fenpropidin fen hydrochlorothiazide hct lidocaine lid phenazone phe sulpiride sul tramadol tra venlaflaxine ven other mps with high ozone reactivity for which no otps were detected are benzophenone 3 bzp emtricitabine emt metoprolol mto mycophenolic acid mya naproxen nap ranitidine ran resveratrol res ii fast abatement of the mp with slow formation of the otp high abatement kinetics followed by a slow increase of the otp is a typical indication for the formation of a secondary product from an un detected primary product formed from the direct reaction with ozone the secondary products still build up from the reaction of the un detected primary product with ozone and or oh even though the target mp has been completely depleted a good example for this category is carbamazepine cbz si1 with its otp baqd cbz283 as discussed above the fast oxidation of cbz leads to the primary product bqm cbz251 which is then further oxidized to bqd cbz267 and finally to baqd cbz283 mcdowell et al 2005 the oxidation of bqd is a slow process which leads to a continuous build up of baqd cbz283 until o3out further cases of this category are benzisothiazolone bit sulfamethazine smz and sulfamethoxazole smx iii intermediate abatement kinetics of the mp non detect or very low in the o3 exposure range above 8 10 3 ms and below 24 10 3 ms with a parallel otp formation compounds with an intermediate ozone reactivity might react with ozone and oh and the primary products can be formed from reactions with either ozone or oh bezafibrate bzf si1 is a representative compound with an intermediate ozone reactivity k o3 590 m 1s 1 at 20 c huber et al 2003 if we assume the same activation energy as above 55 kj mol a k o3 188 m 1s 1 at 6 c can be calculated leading to a predicted 80 abatement at an o3 exposure of 8 10 3 ms this is close to the observed abatement of 82 at the same o3 exposure the main site of ozone attack is the alkoxybenzene moiety which is controlling the ozone reactivity there are several products formed in parallel to its abatement during ozonation which is an indication for their direct formation from the target mp possibly by oh mps with similar reactivity patterns are caffeine cof methylprednisolone mpn propyzamide pyz and sitagliptin sit iv low abatement kinetics of the mp still detectable at o3 exposure of 24 10 3 ms with a parallel otp formation compounds with a low reactivity towards ozone show low abatement kinetics during ozonation which is mainly caused by the reaction with oh atrazine atz si1 is a classical case for this group of compounds with a k o3 6 m 1s 1 and k oh 3 109 m 1s 1 at room temperature acero et al 2000 under the experimental ozonation conditions in the pilot plant about 25 of its abatement is caused by a direct ozone reaction calculated from overall ozone exposure until o3out whereas 75 is due to reaction with oh typical primary products were detected such as deisopropylatrazine atz174 and deethylatrazine atz188 0698 but also secondary products such as atz188 0334 and atz246 several other compounds fall in this class for which otps were detected diuron diu gabapentin gab ibuprofen ibu lamotrigine lam mecoprop mec oxcarbazepine oxc prometon prm sucralose suc thiacloprid thi valsartan val or for which no otps were detected 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d acesulfame ace ketoprofen ket 3 1 4 mechanisms of otp formation in the following sections the detected otps with their proposed structures and mechanisms of their formation will be discussed based on si1 and si2 for the different classes of mps depending on their ozone reactive functional groups and the compounds are ordered alphabetically for each functional group the observed otps will be discussed based on mechanistic and kinetic understanding of ozone and oh reactions mostly gained from controlled laboratory experiments in literature therewith it is possible to test if the generally expected mechanisms occur within this empirical study under more realistic conditions at pilot scale in this section the focus is on all 227 otps from 39 mps which are also summarized in si1 and si2 and all 51 parent compounds are discussed even if no otps could be identified the main components of these otps were detected in positive mode for 158 and in negative mode for 69 otps the discussions include otps for which a formation mechanism can be proposed based on kinetic and mechanistic information however there are also numerous other otps for which the formation is unclear 3 1 4 1 tertiary amines cetirizine cet class i or ii the abatement of cet as a function of the ozone exposure is very efficient si1 and si2 at ph 7 8 cet reacts with an apparent second order rate constant k o3 2 4 105 m 1s 1 with ozone at 20 c borowska et al 2016 the otp cet217 has been detected in a previous mechanistic study from the direct ozone reaction with cet borowska et al 2016 even though it forms directly as a consequence of the abatement of cet a further increase is observed even after cet is completely depleted this points towards a formation of another primary product e g the expected but non detected n oxide which then further reacts to cet217 cet421 the second proposed product is a n oxide which is expected from the direct ozone attack on the tertiary amine moiety borowska et al 2016 but an additional oxygen is added cet421 is formed rapidly but also shows a further formation after cet has been completely depleted this points again towards a formation of a non detected n oxide followed by a secondary oh attack on the rest of the molecule in borowska et al 2016 the n oxide was formed as major otp in batch studies with oh scavengers but was also hardly found in ozonated wastewater supporting the further transformation by oh attack from a kinetic point of view intrinsic rate constants and number of carbons for oh attack a formation of a phenolic compound would be favorable however it would be abated very quickly to non detect during the further ozonation for example phenol has an apparent k o3 107 m 1s 1 at ph 8 and 20 c hoigné and bader 1983b a reaction mechanism over a transient oh induced phenol formation from aromatic moieties with a rapid further transformation by ozone can be generally hypothesized for mps or otps with low ozone reactivity this will not be discussed in detail for each mp again therefore in the case of cet421 a hydroxylation at the tertiary c atom to a tertiary alcohol seems the most likely mechanism citalopram cit class i fig 1 cit is quickly abated during ozonation and cit341 is the expected n oxide which is directly formed from cit si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the secondary otps such as cit245 cit261 and cit355 during ozonation of citalopram cit are formed from cit341 which is slowly oxidized by mostly oh via various mechanisms because no more ozone reactive sites are present in cit341 cit261 and cit355 are a result of an oh attack to form a carbonyl group h2 o von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 adjacent to the heterocyclic oxygen cit261 includes also a loss of the fluorobenzene ring the next generation products cit277 includes a further o addition to a hydroxylated species of cit261 which is most likely again caused by oh attack at the aliphatic side chains von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 because a short lived transient phenol moiety would escape detection clarithromycin cla class i cla is quickly abated with the formation of cla764 si1 si2 a n oxide at the tertiary amine moiety which has been previously reported k o3 4 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 20 c lange et al 2006 merel et al 2017 once the n oxide is formed there are no more ozone reactive moieties in this compound and cla764 can only slowly be further abated by reactions with oh this leads to the formation of carbonyls from alcohols cla762 and hydroxylated species cla794 von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 a second minor mechanism for tertiary amines involves an n dealkylation zimmermann et al 2012 the corresponding product is not observed however a second generation acid cla606 3485 h2 o2 is formed by reactions with oh von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 diphenhydramine dip class i dip is quickly abated with a formation of the n oxide dip272 by direct ozone reaction si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 dip210 is a secondary product which is formed slowly most likely by oh attack on the aromatic ring which may lead to a loss of one of the benzene rings and formation of a carboxyl group via several reaction routes pan et al 1993 the formation of dip278 from the ozonation of dip272 is characterized by a slow criegee type reaction on one of the aromatic rings k o3 benzene 2 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a which might be enhanced by a transient phenol formation the formation mechanism of dip167 is unclear it involves several reaction steps with oh finally leading to an intramolecular coupling coupling reactions of aromatic systems during ozonation have been observed before in low yields for phenol mainly in experiments with relatively high parent compound concentrations mvula and von sonntag 2003 this could be enhanced in the current study because of the higher ozone stability of benzene and the proximity of the two benzene rings fenpropidin fen class i abatement of fen leads to the primary n oxide product fen290 which is formed quickly during ozonation si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 further otps from fen290 are formed by an o addition fen292 most likely alcohol formation at the aliphatic chain and fen320 with a mass difference of h2 o2 the latter could be a result of a phenol formation with an ensuing further fast reaction to a benzoquinone by ozone ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 benzoquinones are less reactive with ozone k o3 benzoquinone 2 5 103 m 1s 1 mvula and von sonntag 2003 which explains why this compound can still be detected during ozonation benzoquinones are toxicologically relevant otps which need to be taken into consideration tentscher et al 2018 tentscher et al 2021 a direct oh attack on fen leads to two carboxylated products fen288 and a benzoquinone fen304 via a transient phenol which undergoes further reaction to the n oxide fen320 lidocaine lid class i fig 2 also for this tertiary amine the n oxide lid251 is the primary product si1 si2 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the next generation otp from the oxidation of lid251 by oh is lid265 containing a carbonyl group von sonntag and schuchmann 1997 another product lid221 is an imine n oxide formed via the n desethyl lid by ozone attack lid221 is readily further degraded which is expected for imine n oxides k o3 n ethylethanimine oxide 1 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 room temperature lim et al 2019 the product of this reaction lid207 is assumed to be the corresponding nitro compound lim et al 2019 which has not been detected in this study in contrast the build up and slow further reactions of lid249 two products show that the secondary amine is deactivated by a formation of amide type compounds they are formed by oxidation of one of the three carbon atoms adjacent to the n by oh attack since there are two sites which lead to the same product and the third site is deactivated by an adjacent carbonyl group it is proposed that the higher peak areas are related to lid249 13 4 whereas lid249 13 9 accounts for the other peak sulpiride sul class i the n oxide sul358 is directly formed by ozone attack merel et al 2017 followed by the minor formation of sul231 by cleavage of a side chain si1 si2 because of the low ozone reactivity of the amide nitrogen the latter is probably formed by oh attack a c n bond cleavage at the amide has also been observed for other mps in this study see below for sul359 the sulfonamide group in sul358 is fully oxidized to a sulfonic acid which is probably due to oh attack lee et al 2004 tramadol tra class i for tra again the n oxide tra280 is the main otp merel et al 2017 zimmermann et al 2012 and the parent compound for further next generation otps such as carbonyl compounds tra294 11 9 12 7 and alcohols tra296 10 7 11 8 12 1 which are formed by oh attack on tra280 si1 si2 these products can further react by oh attack to tra310 and tra328 two further very minor tra296 13 1 13 8 products are formed from an ozone attack on the anisole of tra which has a k o3 77 m 1s 1 at 22 c zimmermann et al 2012 tra312 can either be formed from tra280 by ozone attack on the anisole or from tra296 13 1 13 8 by ozone attack on the tertiary amine moiety the n demethylated tra has also been detected tra250 but it is expected to be formed only in minor quantities zimmermann et al 2012 further oxidation of tra250 by oh leads to several alcohols and carbonyl type compounds tra264 tra266 some products have been formed from the oh attack of tra with an intact tertiary secondary amine group however further reactions of these compounds with ozone are expected to lead to the corresponding n oxides or nitro compounds lim et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2012 venlafaxine ven class i ven leads to a formation of the n oxide by ozone attack ven294 lajeunesse et al 2013 lester et al 2013 zucker et al 2018 which is followed by several otps formed by oh attack such as the alcohols ven310 three otps and the carbonyls ven308 two otps si1 si2 ven212 is a product formed by a loss of the cyclohexanol group induced by oh attack all these products still contain an anisole group which reacts with ozone with k o3 290 m 1s 1 at 20 c hoigné and bader 1983a and lead to their further abatement by direct ozone reaction to ring opening products see tra if an activation energy of 55 kj mol is assumed see section 3 1 3 at 6 c a k o3 anisole 92 m 1s 1 can be calculated which is very close to k o3 ven294 82 m 1s 1 which was calculated from the available abatement data since many of the otps have similar abatement patterns as ven294 it can be concluded that their abatement kinetics is also controlled by an ozone attack on the anisole group however the expected ring opening products have not been detected most likely because these more polar transformation products may not be retained on the spe cartridge an interesting side reaction is the formation of ven292 an amide which is recalcitrant at the nitrogen to further ozone attack this compound reacts by oh attack further to ven308 alcohol on hexyl ring and by ozone at the anisole group to other products finally also the n demethylated form of ven was detected ven264 and further oxidized to the amide ven278 which is then further abated by ozone attack on the anisole overall the observed ozonation mechanism of all discussed tertiary amines confirm that the following mechanism occur under the tested realistic set up the otp formation of tertiary amines is initiated by the n oxide formation which was observed as main product for nearly all tertiary amines the n oxide formation is followed by further attack of ozone reactive moieties e g anisole by ozone if we assume second order rate constants of k o3 100 m 1s 1 and k oh 5 109 m 1s 1 for the second reactive site e g anisole and a rct 10 8 the fraction of the ozone reaction is 67 therefore both ozone and oh induced higher generation products are possible if no further ozone reactive sites are present the reactions proceed by oh attack generally a preferential site of oh attack are aromatic moieties however due to the fast ozone reactions of the formed phenolic moieties they escape detection nevertheless some potential ring opening products were detected which could be the result of ozone attack on the transient phenols and support the occurrence of this reaction if no aromatic sites are present in the mps or otps oh attack occurs at aliphatic carbons leading mostly to alcohols and carbonyls which are often detected as secondary products 3 1 4 2 secondary amines atenolol ate class i several products are formed directly from ate by ozone attack at the secondary amine k o3 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c and the anisole moieties k o3 110 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c benner et al 2008 si1 si2 the first detected product ate299 is a result of an ozone attack on the anisole moiety with the ensuing formation of the muconaldehyde type compound criegee type reaction even though the formation of an imine oxide from an ozone attack on the secondary amine would be kinetically favorable this non detected product is an intermediate to the nitro compound ate255 which is the expected end product from the reaction with ozone k o3 1 9 103 m 1s 1 at ph 7 0 20 c lim et al 2019 shi and mccurry 2020 for a detailed discussion of the kinetics see section 3 1 3 flecainide fle class i fig 3 fle should react at the dialkoxybenzene ring with a k o3 1 3 105 m 1s 1 for dimethoxybenzene si1 si2 munoz and von sonntag 2000 however the trifluoromethyl groups may reduce the reactivity of the aromatic ring nevertheless the observed abatement kinetics of fle with an estimated k o3 700 m 1s 1 points toward this site because it is significantly more reactive than the piperidine n of fle with a k o3 70 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 20 c tekle röttering et al 2016a nevertheless no products were identified from the reaction of ozone at the aromatic ring because they probably escape detection by the applied analytical procedure fle429 which is most likely an imine n oxide from an ozone attack on the secondary amine has been postulated as an intermediate for the oxidation of secondary amines to nitro compounds lim et al 2019 the further reaction of fle429 proceeds with an estimated from pilot plant data k o3 300 m 1s 1 which is about a factor of two lower than for the analogous imine n oxide of aliphatic amines k o3 608 m 1s 1 for n ethylethanimine oxide calculated at 6 c lim et al 2019 however such differences between an aliphatic and a cyclic imine n oxide seem possible the ensuing products are two nitro compounds with a ring opening on both sides of the imine oxide group and a carbonyl group fle461 the next generation product fle475 is formed by an oh attack on the carbonyl carbon to form an acid the formation of fle443 occurs by oh attack on the piperidine moiety of fle429 with the formation of a carbonyl moiety metoprolol mto class i mto has a very similar abatement profile as ate which is expected from similar reactivities with ozone benner et al 2008 however in this case no otps were observed si1 si2 overall secondary amines react to the expected formation of the n nitro compounds via the intermediate imine oxide which is not always detected if additional ozone reactive sites are present e g activated aromatic moieties some of the ensuing products have also been detected in absence of such moieties or if they are already oxidized further reactions with oh lead to alcohol and carbonyl type compounds 3 1 4 3 primary amines gabapentin gab class iv for gabapentin gab k o3 15 m 1s 1 ph 7 bourgin et al 2017 only one otp was observed which is formed directly from oh attack on the cyclohexyl moiety with the ensuing formation of a carbonyl group gab186 si1 si2 the expected nitro compound from the attack of ozone at the primary amine was not observed sitagliptin sit class iii sitagliptin with a k o3 1 8 103 m 1s 1 at ph 8 20 c hermes et al 2020 is abated somewhat more efficiently than other class iii compounds like bzf and mpn see below with direct and continuous formation of several products from which sit436 is highlighted because it is the expected formation of a nitro compound from the primary amine group si1 si2 lim et al 2019 shi and mccurry 2020 another otp sit422 results from an oh attack on the three methyl groups of the aliphatic heterocycle to form carbonyl amide type compounds hermes et al 2020 the exact location of the carbonyl group is unknown several other primary and secondary products have been observed and also partially described in literature however the mechanisms of their formation are currently unclear overall the compound basis for the assessment of primary amines was quite small nevertheless the expected formation of a nitro compound could be verified in the case of sit 3 1 4 4 olefins carbamazepine cbz class i the kinetics of the reactions of cbz have been discussed in section 3 1 3 there are several previous product studies on the transformation of cbz during ozonation azaïs et al 2017 hübner et al 2014 kråkström et al 2020 mcdowell et al 2005 the primary and fast ozone attack occurs at the olefin moiety and leads to a ring opening with a secondary ring formation cbz251 followed by further oxidations to cbz267 and cbz283 si1 si2 further products cbz163 cbz179 formed from an oh attack were detected here and in another study azaïs et al 2017 we suggest that the previously proposed structure cbz179 is incorrect because a phenolic compound has been proposed with an expected fast ozone reaction which would make its detection unlikely therefore we suggest a hydroxylamide type structure for cbz179 the evidence of our ms2 spectrum is not specific enough and fits to both structures from the build up pattern cbz163 and cbz179 seem to be formed from cbz251 by ozone oh attack on the pyrimidine ring and a cleavage of the c n bond of the amide type moiety furthermore cbz136 and cbz207 previously detected otps are formed azaïs et al 2017 however no detailed mechanism is available in a recent study an even broader range of otps was proposed kråkström et al 2020 caffeine cof class iii the intermediate reactivity of cof with ozone k o3 650 m 1s 1 at ph 8 1 20 c broséus et al 2009 warrants a direct ozone reaction cof has been classified as an olefin present in the imidazole type group which reacts with ozone at the c c double bond to ring opening products tekle röttering et al 2020 however the observed otp cof225 does not result from this reaction but an addition of two oxygen atoms si1 si2 this otp has been reported previously under alkaline conditions in absence of a scavenger for oh hence it is probably formed by oh attack rosal et al 2009 methylprednisolone mpn class iii the second order rate constant for the reaction of mpn with o3 is unknown however it is structurally similar to progesterone which contains also an olefin with an α carbonyl group k o3 480 m 1s 1 18 c barron et al 2006 mpn reacts via a criegee type mechanism with ozone to form a product with two aldehyde moieties this product has not been detected however two further oxidation products were observed si1 si2 mpn393 which has besides the additional aldehyde moieties a cleaved methanol group and an added hydroxyl group at one of the aliphatic carbon sites and mpn437 for which the primary product has been oxidized at the aldehyde to form a carboxylic acid by reactions with oh phenazone phe class i phe165 is formed directly from the parent compound by the fast reaction of ozone with phenazone k o3 5 104 m 1s 1 for aminophenazone zhang et al 2015 si1 si2 compared to pyrazole k o3 56 m 1s 1 tekle röttering et al 2020 the reactivity of phe is much enhanced due to conjugation with the aromatic ring the product formation phe165 occurs by an initial criegee type reaction with an ensuing cleavage of the n c o bond by hydrolysis this hydrolyses might also occur during storage of the samples phe179 is formed by oh attack on the methyl group of n ch3 propyzamide pyz class iii pyz has an ethinyl group as the main ozone reactive site with k o3 160 m 1s 1 at 10 c based on 1 ethinyl 1 cyclochexanol huber et al 2004 two main otps from the ozone attack on the ethinyl group are directly formed from pyz pyz301 pyz320 si1 si2 pyz320 may also be further transformed to pyz301 pyz274 is formed by decarboxylation of pyz301 overall it could be confirmed that the main site of primary attack of olefins and ethinyl groups are the c c double or triple bonds respectively with the formation of the corresponding carbonyl and acid groups in the special case of cbz a secondary ring formation has been observed 3 1 4 5 aromatic compounds 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d class iv 2 4 d does not have any ozone reactive sites and will be abated by oh no otps were detected from this compound si1 si2 this is probably again due to the formation of phenolic compounds by oh attack which are then rapidly abated by ozone to muconic type compounds which escape detection bezafibrate bzf class iii fig 4 bzf240 is the product of two criegee type attacks on the alkoxy aromatic moiety sui et al 2017 si1 si2 thereafter several products are formed from an oh attack initially bzf254 acid from aldehyde followed by the bzf212 by decarboxylation bzf226 acid from aldehyde and finally bzf196 dantas et al 2007 bzf254 can also be formed via formation of a phenol by an initial oh attack followed by a criegee type ring cleavage of the activated aromatic system the pathway to bzf256 is currently unclear but is most likely a combination of ozone and oh reactions bzf156 which has been previously reported sui et al 2017 is again a result of an oh induced cleavage of the c n bond of the amide group which has been observed for several other compounds in this study bzf376 formation is a consequence of a direct oh attack on bzf rivas et al 2019 this otp cannot unambiguously be assigned to a structure but an addition of an oh group on one of the aliphatic carbons is assumed benzophenone 3 bzp class i due to the phenolic moiety its abatement by ozone is very fast see cetirizine si1 this is a confirmation that even if phenolic compounds were formed their lifetime would be too short to be detected furthermore since there were no otps detected for this compound this is another indication that such otps most likely ring opening products from phenol oxidation escape our analytical procedure benzotriazole bzt bzt could not be quantified and no otps were detected for this compound diclofenac dic class i dic reacts with a k o3 6 8 105 1 106 m 1s 1 with ozone at room temperature huber et al 2003 sein et al 2008 based on its formation profile dic282 is the primary otp with a loss of ch2 relative to dic si1 si2 an ozone attack on the dic nitrogen has been proposed previously sein et al 2008 however it is unclear how this may lead to a loss of ch2 furthermore based on high second order rate constants for the reaction of hydroxylamines with ozone lim et al 2019 it should be detected in only very low concentrations based on its formation trend dic259 is a secondary otp formed by two criegee type reactions with a loss of four carbon atoms this product is then further transformed by another criegee type reaction and a decarboxylation to dic189 which was detected previously coelho et al 2009 hydrochlorothiazide hct class i hct is a special sulfonamide which reacts fast with ozone to chlorothiazide hct295 by electron transfer si1 si2 k o3 3 105 m 1s 1 at ph 8 borowska et al 2016 this can be slowly oxidized to the secondary otp hct311 and finally to hct313 and hct341 in very low yields borowska et al 2016 mecoprop mec class iii iv the kinetics of mec abatement is between group iii and iv with a k o3 100 m 1s 1 beltran et al 1994 only one otp mec227 was observed which is formed by oh attack at the toluene methyl group si1 si2 other expected products from an oh attack on the aromatic ring with the ensuing phenol formation will escape detection see cetirizine naproxen nap class i the alkoxynaphtalene group reacts quickly with ozone with k o3 105 m 1s 1 benner et al 2008 no products were found similar to some of the other fast reacting aromatic compounds sulfamethoxazole smx class ii only secondary products were detected for smx si1 si2 smx282 the nitro smx has also been detected in previous studies abellan et al 2008 gao et al 2014 willach et al 2017 and is expected to be formed via the corresponding hydroxylamine lim et al 2019 willach et al 2017 this otp has a much lower expected ozone reactivity k o3 nitrobenzene 0 09 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a therefore no further ozone reaction products from the nitrobenzene moiety were detected smx200 a subsequent product from the oxidation of smx282 is also formed from smz see below it results from a cleavage of the n c bond of the sulfonamide group similar to several other observations of n c bond cleaved of amides smx225 has been reported as a potential otp for the electrochemical transformation of smx martín de vidales et al 2012 therefore this is most likely an otp that is formed by oh attack on smx282 sulfamethazine smz class ii based on the formation profiles of the otps only secondary and later generation otps are detected for smz si1 si2 for smz the same secondary product smz200 is formed as for smx see above via oxidation of the aniline to a nitrobenzene and a slow cleavage of the sulfonamide n c bond it is unclear why the nitro smz was not detected in analogy to the nitro smx smx282 smz144 is the result of a n s bond cleavage and an ozone or an oh attack with ring opening of the pyrimidine tekle röttering et al 2016b this is expected to be a very slow process due to a low ozone and oh reactivity of the pyrimidine moiety k o3 0 5 m 1s 1 k oh 1 6 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 tekle röttering et al 2016b trimethoprim tri class i tri contains two reactive sites and at ph 7 8 the heterocyclic ring is the main moiety of ozone attack k o3 4 3 105 m 1s 1 dodd et al 2006 nevertheless also the trimethoxybenzene moiety reacts quickly with ozone k o3 8 104 m 1s 1 dodd et al 2006 based on the loss of c5h6 the detected otp tri225 is likely a result of ozone attacks on the trimethoxybenzene moiety and the other products escape detection si1 si2 overall activated aromatic compounds react quickly with ozone and it seems difficult to detect the ensuing otps when otps were identified often a ring opening is observed and it can be assumed that such products become too polar and escape the enrichment procedure for aniline type compounds otps with nitro groups have been detected electron transfer is another option of reactions of aromatic compounds with ozone the only example with direct evidence for this reaction path is hydrochlorothiazide furthermore aromatic compounds reacting with oh are expected to yield phenolic compounds which react too quickly with ozone to be detected under the given experimental conditions also the expected ring opening products from the ensuing ozone reactions were rarely detected in this study 3 1 4 6 sulfur containing compounds benzisothiazolone bit class ii there is no second order rate constant available for the bit ozone reaction however reduced sulfur species typically react readily with ozone to the corresponding sulfoxide von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which can explain the fast abatement of this target compound during ozonation in the pilot plant si1 si2 the further reaction of the sulfoxide by ozone to a sulfone type compound is much slower k o3 8 m 1s 1 for dmso von sonntag and von gunten 2012 which would lead to the continuous increase of the corresponding product for bit the formation of sulfoxide was not observed but the formation of the sulfone type product bit181 which has also been detected previously li et al 2016 however a significantly higher k o3 250 m 1s 1 for the reaction of the sulfoxide with ozone would be necessary to explain the relative fast increase of bit181 compared to dmso a higher second order rate constant for the reaction of bit sulfoxide can be expected due to the conjugation with the aromatic ring however its magnitude is unknown bit215 cl adduct of bit179 with a mass difference of h2 o2 the second detected otp is proposed to result from an oh attack on the aromatic ring to form a phenol with an ensuing reaction with ozone to the benzoquinone ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 emtricitabine emt class i emt is abated very quickly during ozonation due to an ozone attack at the thioether group si2 k o3 methionine 4 106 m 1s 1 pryor et al 1984 no otps were detected in this case however the formation of a sulfoxide can be expected as a primary product dodd et al 2010 overall with only two examples in this group it is difficult to draw general conclusions nevertheless due to the high reactivity of thioether groups the formation of sulfoxide and sulfone type otps can be expected 3 1 4 7 compounds with several ozone reactive moieties clindamycin cli 3 amine and thioether class i the primary otp is cli457 which contains a n oxide and a sulfoxide resulting from the parallel ozone reactions at the 3 amine and the thioether si1 si2 the reactivity of cli is expected to be very similar to lincomycin with kapp o3 n 1 58 106 m 1s 1 and kapp o3 s 3 26 105 m 1s 1 at ph 8 room temperature qiang et al 2004 since both k o3 are very high under the experimental conditions at the pilot plant the otps with ozone attack at only one site escape detection cli457 reacts slowly by oh attack to several carbonyl compounds cli427 cli471 further products e g n demethylated cli with a loss of sulfur cli381 were also detected however no mechanistic interpretation of these findings is currently available further otps from cli381 are formed by oh attack to a carbonyl cli395 and an alcohol cli397 cli187 are two products formed from a c n bond cleavage of the amide group followed by a formation of two alcohols on the cyclic structure these reactions are induced by oh attacks cephalexin cpx olefin thioether and 1 amine class ii under the experimental conditions in this study cpx reacts quickly with ozone k o3 9 1 104 m 1s 1 at ph 7 7 at room temperature dodd et al 2006 si1 si2 in an ozonation study the main identified products were sulfoxide and carbonyl compounds resulting from the ozone attack on the thioether and the olefin dodd et al 2010 the attack at the 1 amine moiety is quite a bit slower lim et al 2019 the detected otp in this study cpx165 is not a primary product increase after full depletion of the target compound but the result of other otps nitroso moiety resulting from an ozone attack on the primary amine lim et al 2019 cpx165 also is a result from a cleavage of the c n bond at the amide group likely induced by oh attack as described previously mycophenolic acid mya olefin and activated aromatic moiety class i mya is expected to have a very high reactivity with ozone with a primary attack at the phenol moiety and a secondary attack at the olefin since both reactions are fast an otp with products on both sites is expected similar to cli the otp is expected to be very polar and might escape the enrichment procedure therefore no otp was detected for mya si2 oseltamivir ose olefin and 1 amine class i in analogy to the reaction of oseltamivir acid with ozone it is expected that the olefin is the main moiety of attack k o3 1 7 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 at room temperature mestankova et al 2012 the two otps ose303 are a result of this reaction but with an additional loss of c2h2 and addition of o si1 si2 the formation of a second 1 amine is proposed by an oh induced bond cleavage of the acetyl group one of the ose303 products could be a result of a secondary ring formation the other with the two free amine groups both ose303 are abated similarly probably due to an ozone attack on the primary amine moiety possible leading to a nitro compound ose343 ose359 is an otp with a bond cleavage of the olefin and an oxidation of the primary amine to the corresponding nitroso compound lim et al 2019 propranolol pro 2 amine and activated aromatic moiety class i the ozone reactivity of pro at ph 7 8 is governed by the attack on the alkoxynaphtalene moiety k o3 105 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 benner et al 2008 leading to a criegee type ring opening product this product escapes the analysis because the reaction of the secondary amine with ozone to pro308 is still sufficiently fast k o3 1 7 104 m 1s 1 benner et al 2008 si1 si2 pro308 has been reported previously to be an otp of pro benner and ternes 2009 since it is a hydroxyl amine it is expected to be quickly further oxidized to the ensuing nitro compound which was not detected in this study ranitidine ran 3 amine thioether and furan moiety class i the abatement of ran is very fast and likely products are formed with multiple ozone attacks at various sites none of them were detected in this study si2 resveratrol res resorcinol phenol and olefin class i res is expected to react with ozone at multiple sites and likely small molecular weight otps will be formed which may escape enrichment and or detection si2 overall for compounds with several reactive sites often the time resolution in the pilot ozonation experiments is not sufficient to find otps from the reaction at only one site some otps from multiple ozone attacks are detected others may escape detection since they are small and polar 3 1 4 8 compounds with low ozone reactivity acesulfame ace olefin class iv ace contains a deactivated olefin group k o3 88 m 1s 1 20 c kaiser et al 2013 which is the ozone reactive site of this compound the criegee type ring opening product has been proposed previously with an ensuing hydrolysis to smaller detected compounds scheurer et al 2012 however detection of these low molecular weight compounds is unlikely with the applied analytical procedure in the current study and therefore no otps were detected si2 atrazine atz class iv the kinetic features of atz are discussed in section 3 1 3 and are controlled by mostly oh reactions typical previously reported products were detected such as deisopropylatrazine atz174 deethylatrazine atz188 17 1 4 acetamido 2 chloro 6 isopropylaminos triazine cdit atz230 4 acetamido 2 chloro 6 ethylaminos triazine cdet atz216 and 4 acetamido 6 amino 2 chloro s triazine cdat atz188 12 0 si1 si2 acero et al 2000 barletta et al 2003 beltrán et al 1998 the imine type compounds which are formed in high yields from both ozone and oh reactions were not identified because they hydrolyse with half life times in the order of 4 h at ph 8 and result in the formation of many of the detected otps acero et al 2000 another secondary product atz212 has been detected and is formed by an oh substitution of the cl on the triazine ring even though this product has not been reported during ozonation an oh attack has been demonstrated previously on the triazine ring which may eventually lead to the formation to a hydroxylated otp tauber and von sonntag 2000 diuron diu class iv diu reacts with a k o3 16 5 m 1s 1 with ozone and lies between class iii and class iv benitez et al 2007 its primary otp diu216 is the dealkylated secondary amide which is formed by oh attack solís et al 2016 and is another example of a cleavage of a c n bond of an amide group si1 si2 substitution of cl by oh through oh attack has been reported before during ozonation with the formation of diu215 feng et al 2008 solís et al 2016 however the corresponding phenol type compound should be abated more readily than observed in the pilot plant ozonation as demonstrated by the tested phenolic target compounds e g benzophenone 3 hoigné and bader 1983b it is unclear why this does not happen diu199 is a secondary product most likely formed from diu216 another product with unknown structure diu201 has also been formed ibuprofen ibu class iv ibuprofen ibu has a similar ozone reactivity as atz k o3 9 6 m 1s 1 huber et al 2003 and two direct products have been detected ibu221 ibu240 si1 si2 they are most likely both results of oh attacks ketoprofen ket class iv ketoprofen which has two non activated benzene rings is expected to have a low ozone reactivity therefore it will mostly be abated by oh which possibly leads to a transient formation of phenolic compounds which then are abated very quickly by direct ozone reactions to products escaping detection si2 lamotrigine lam class iv the abatement of lamotrigine lam k o3 4 m 1s 1 keen et al 2014 is very similar to atz which means that oh play an important role in otp formation the two otps lam254 and lam259 were previously described during ozonation of lam si1 si2 bollmann et al 2016 keen et al 2014 even though an oh addition on the aromatic ring has been described before keen et al 2014 the formation of a phenolic compound lam272 is very unlikely and it should not be detectable see cetirizine hoigné and bader 1983b therefore an alternative for lam272 is the formation of an n oxide which should be much more recalcitrant towards further oxidation bollmann et al 2016 which is demonstrated by a steady increase of this otp metformin met class iv met could not be quantified in this study and no otps were detected oxcarbazepine oxc class iv even though there is no k o3 available for this compound it is expected to react slowly with ozone oxc238 is the only otp detected and it is hypothesized that a loss of the amide group and a formation of a carbonyl type compound occurs by oh attack si1 si2 oxc238 is an aniline type compound which reacts quickly with ozone which is reflected in the fast abatement of this otp prometon prm class iv prm which has a triazine structure leads to analogues otps as atz which are mostly formed by oh attack such as deisopropyl prm prm184 and prm240 with a carbonyl group at the methyl c si1 si2 further oh oxidation of the latter leads to carboxylic acid prm256 prm142 the otp without the isopropyl groups is also detected and is slowly formed from prm184 several other products are formed from oh reactions sucralose suc class iv suc has a very low reactivity with ozone k o3 0 1 m 1s 1 bourgin et al 2017 and reacts mostly with oh even though the corresponding k oh 1 56 109 m 1s 1 is quite low as well keen and linden 2013 during the uv h2o2 process several products with substitution of cl by oh have been identified keen and linden 2013 however the structure of suc376 is currently unclear si1 si2 the formation of an olefin type otp was previously proposed gulde et al 2021 keen and linden 2013 however the steady formation of suc376 during ozonation contradicts this assumption an olefin would escape detection because its abatement is faster than its formation thiacloprid thi class iv fig 5 the primary product is thi283 with the thioether oxidized to a sulfone group si1 si2 since the reaction kinetics are relatively low it is expected that this occurs via oh attack it seems that the thioether group is deactivated in this compound based on the patterns of the other otps it can be assumed that they are secondary products from thi283 one case in point is the loss of so2 from thi283 to thi251 further reactions with a loss of ch2s or c2h2s lead to the products thi237 or thi211 respectively the corresponding hypothesized structures are provided in fig 5 for thi211 two products with different retention times were detected only one of them is proposed in the mechanism in fig 5 valsartan val class iv sartan type compounds are known to be quite stable during ozonation bourgin et al 2018 based on the low measured reactivity of irbesartan a structurally similar compound k o3 23 m 1s 1 bourgin et al 2018 and a simulated k o3 34 m 1s 1 for val lee et al 2014 it is abated similarly to ibu and it can be assumed that val reacts mostly with oh an interesting case is val280 which degrades quickly after its formation si1 si2 this is an indication that val280 has a higher ozone reactivity than the parent compound k o3 200 m 1s 1 calculated based on the abatement of val280 this could be due to the formation of a secondary amine k o3 800 m 1s 1 at ph 7 8 and 20 c lim et al 2019 for which a lower k o3 in the order of the calculated value at 6 c can be assumed overall the product formation of mps with low ozone reactivity is governed by oh reactions which may lead to a much broader product distribution for non activated aromatic compounds phenolic moieties may be formed which are extremely short lived in one case the formation of an aniline type compound was observed which is then also quickly abated by direct reaction with ozone 3 1 5 bromate formation bromate increased linearly as a function of the contact in the ozonation reactor since the bromide level was low 12 15 µg l the maximum bromate concentration at o3out was only about 2 µg l fig s7 si3 which is well below the drinking water standard of 10 µg l who 2017 the bromate level increased in the sand filter because there was still a significant ozone residual concentration at o3out fig s3 si3 ozone was completely depleted in the first 10 cm of the sand filter fig s3 si3 and bromate still increased in this part of the filter to approximately 3 5 µg l as expected bromate was not degraded in the sand filter because it is only biodegradable under denitrifying conditions which are not common after ozonation with a high residual oxygen concentration hijnen et al 1995 3 2 pilot scale sand filter 3 2 1 general considerations a post treatment with a biologically active sand filter was tested to elucidate the abatement of otps relative to their parent compounds such a treatment often follows ozonation to improve the biostability of the water by degradation of bioavailable bulk organic matter produced in ozonation and it is often assumed that otps are also well abated during this treatment step to test the biological activity of the sand filter four test compounds with known biodegradability were dosed to the filter inlet and their abatement was measured as a function of the filter depth fig s2 si3 carbamazepine low biodegradation valsartan intermediate biodegradation atenolol high biodegradation paracetamol high biodegradation bourgin et al 2018 falås et al 2016 helbling et al 2012 the observed abatement of the selected compounds at a filter depth of 200 cm was in line with the expected efficiency for their biodegradability the biological activity of the sand filter is further illustrated by the abatement of about 25 of doc corresponding to bdoc during sand filtration after ozonation fig s8 si3 this abatement is caused by low molecular weight organic compounds aldehydes ketones organic acids etc formed during ozonation which are degraded during the biological post filtration hammes et al 2006 van der kooij et al 1989 aoc was also measured but was below the quantification limit 10 µg l in all samples furthermore sand samples were taken at different depths of the sand filter and protein analyses were performed to determine the bacterial density semi quantitatively rudolf von rohr et al 2014 the bacterial density decreased from the top of the filter to about 50 cm depth where it leveled off fig s3 si3 even though it can be expected that sorption plays a minor role for the abatement of the mps and otps it cannot be entirely excluded furthermore ion trapping in protozoans which are present in biologically active sand filters webster and fierer 2019 could be another mode of abatement of amine type compounds gulde et al 2018 therefore in the following discussion abatement is often used instead of biotransformation or biodegradation 3 2 2 parent compounds for mps which were abated in the sand filter often an initially faster abatement in the first 50 cm of the sand filter column is observed followed by a slower decrease roughly similar to the protein density distribution in the sand filter fig s3 si3 and si1 indicating slightly enhanced biological activities in the top part of the sand filter from the 34 parent mps for which otps 187 were detected in high enough concentrations to be evaluated in the sandfilter 22 65 were stable and 12 35 were abated by more than 20 in the sand filter si1 in general amine type compounds were better abated than aromatic or olefinic compounds fig 6 abatement in the sand filter for each individual mp is provided in si1 and si5 3 2 3 otps from the 227 otps that were identified 187 otps from 34 parent compounds resulted in meaningful data in the sand filtration si1 table s3 si3 si4 three patterns could be observed for the fate of otps in the biological sand filtration i relevant abatement ii relevant formation or iii stability according to the classification in section 2 4 5 it is often assumed that a partial oxidation of recalcitrant micropollutants leads to a better biodegradability of the corresponding otps lee et al 2012 this perception is based on the efficiency of biological sand filtration for the removal of aoc and bdoc which are formed from the oxidation of dom see discussion in section 3 2 1 and fig s8 si3 the current study shows that this observation does not directly translate to mps and their otps from the 187 detected otps 143 76 were stable 35 19 were abated and 9 5 were formed these results are somewhat biased because as it has been demonstrated in the discussion of reaction mechanisms many expected products especially from aromatic and olefinic compounds escape detection however based on the detected otps it is clear that oxidative transformations of micropollutants does not necessarily lead to otps that are readily abated in biological post treatment this might also be caused by the fact that microorganisms were not adapted to the mps and its otps because the degradation is controlled by a co metabolic pathway benner et al 2013 from a screening of the detected otps abatement can be observed for the following overarching structural features aldehydes carbonyls carboxylic acids alcohols and amides this comparison provides only a rough overview because often several such functional groups can be present in otps and the detected functional groups are not necessarily decisive for the abatement in large molecules therefore it is often unclear which functional group is responsible for the abatement in the following discussion certain otp types are grouped together aldehydes carbonyls and carboxylic acids can be formed from the reactions of olefins and aromatic compounds and sometimes aliphatic groups with ozone and or oh whereas alcohols are mostly formed from the reactions of aliphatic groups with oh the formation of amides is as of yet not clearly related to the classes of functional groups of this study in a previous investigation it has been shown by a theoretical assessment that otps from olefins and aromatic compounds with the formation of the corresponding aldehydes carbonyls and carboxylic acids are expected to have a better biodegradability than the parent compounds hübner et al 2015 furthermore it has been demonstrated that amides are biodegradable in sewage sludge seeded bioreactors helbling et al 2010 table s2 si3 provides an overview over the fate of various newly formed functional groups of otps with clear structures in the biological sand filtration aldehydes carbonyls aliphatic alcohols carboxylic acids 1 2 and 3 amides n s oxides 36 of aldehydes carbonyls alcohols 29 of carboxylic acids and 27 of amides showed abatement for the other functional groups it was 20 10 for n s oxides it has to be noted that relatively low numbers of compounds were tested in this study and therefore these numbers just provide a rough estimate in the following the 35 otps which show a relevant abatement in the sand filter as differentiated in table s3 si3 and si1 from otps that are not abated and for which clear structures could be proposed will be discussed the discussion is based on the functional groups of the otps 3 2 3 1 aldehydes carbonyls alcohols fourteen aldehyde carbonyl alcohol type compounds for which structures could be proposed and which are abated to a relevant extent in the sand filtration are shown in fig 7 they include otps from bezafibrate carbamazepine 2 otps cetirizine fenpropidin 3 otps flecainide prometon propyzamide sitagliptin 2 otps tramadol and valsartan and comprise 36 of all newly formed aldehydes carbonyls and aliphatic alcohols with proposed structures si1 and table s3 si3 these otps are related to various ozone reactive functional groups bzf240 is formed by ring opening of the aromatic ring of bezafibrate with a predicted enhanced biodegradability hübner et al 2015 two products from carbamazepine are induced by an ozone attack on the olefin followed by secondary reactions cbz251 bqm cbz179 cbz251 has been shown previously to have an enhanced biodegradability hübner et al 2014 a dealkylation of one of the tertiary amine groups in cetirizine leads to cet217 borowska et al 2016 with a significant abatement in the sand filtration three otps of fenpropidin fen274 fen288 fen292 containing carbonyls or alcohols formed by oh attack are partially abated in the sand filter one otp of flecainide containing a nitro and an aldehyde group fle461 20 7 or fle461 21 3 fig 3 is abated since the precursor of these products fle429 imine oxide is not abated it can be assumed that the enhancement is due to the formation of the aldehyde moiety in fle461 only one of the two possible products is shown in fig 7 see also fig 3 one of the products of the oxidation of prometon by oh is prm240 with an aldehyde on one of the isopropyl groups this modification leads to an enhanced abatement of this otp an otp as a result from the oxidation of the ethinyl group in propyzamide is formed pyz320 and abated in the sand filter two alcohol containing secondary otps from sitagliptin sit249 sit281 were found to be partially abated in the sand filter the primary otp of tramadol tra280 is further transformed to various other otps mainly by oh attack one case in point is tra328 13 1 an otp with three additional oxygen atoms which is caused by ring opening and addition of an alcohol group this renders it slightly but significantly more biodegradable than tramadol or tra312 with two additional oxygen atoms ion trapping see section 3 2 1 cannot be the cause for the abatement of tra328 13 1 because the tertiary amine group has been transformed to an n oxide the introduction of a carbonyl group on one of the aliphatic carbons of valsartan val450 leads to a relevant abatement of this otp 3 2 3 2 carboxylic acids carboxylic acid type compounds for which structures could be proposed and which are relevantly abated in the sand filtration are shown in fig 8 these 4 otps are derived from bezafibrate flecainide propyzamide and valsartan and comprise 29 of all newly detected carboxylic acids si1 and table s3 si3 for bezafibrate a formation of a carboxylic acid with a carbonyl in α position has been observed as a consequence of a criegee type reaction on the alkoxybenzene moiety bzf254 fig 4 however this product is not biodegradable a related product bzf256 has an enhanced biodegradability it has an oh group in α position to the carboxyl group its formation is not entirely clear however oh reactions most likely play an important role this example illustrates that small differences in molecular structures can have significant effects on the biodegradability of otps for flecainide an otp with a carboxylic acid group fle475 seems to be even more efficiently abated than its precursor fle461 fig 7 with an aldehyde group for the oxidation of the ethinyl group of propyzamide two carboxylic type products have been identified pyz301 pyz274 it is intriguing that pyz301 is not biodegradable whereas pyz274 shows enhanced abatement the carbonyl group in α position to the carboxylic group in the case of pyz301 as in bzf254 enhances the electrophilic character and may hinder the further oxidation of this product other carboxylic compounds are formed from the oxidation of valsartan to the corresponding benzoic acid val336 in fig 8 val450 in fig 7 even though valsartan is also abated during sand filtration already contains a carboxylic acid group the otps val336 and val450 show an enhanced abatement 3 2 3 3 amides six amide type compounds for which structures could be proposed and which are abated in the sand filtration are shown in fig 9 these otps are formed from bezafibrate cephalexin diclofenac diuron 2 otps and phenazone together with other well abated amides which were discussed before as they contain also other functional groups like aldehydes see figs 7 and 8 they comprise 27 of all suggested newly formed amide type compounds si1 and table s3 si3 dealkylation of the amide group of bezafibrate and cephalexin lead to the formation of primary amide structures bzf156 cpx165 dic189 is an amide type secondary product of the oxidation of diclofenac with an enhanced abatement for the formation of diu216 from diuron a dealkylation as for bzf156 can be assumed for diu199 additionally a substitution of cl by oh has been proposed the transformation of the tertiary amide structure in diuron to a secondary amide leads to an enhancement of the biodegradability of diu216 as expected from a previous study helbling et al 2010 the oxidation of phenazone leads to the formation of phe179 which is significantly better abated than the parent compound 3 2 3 4 miscellaneous otp structures three miscellaneous otps for which a structure was proposed and which are abated in the sand filtration are shown in fig 10 these otps are derived from diphenhydramine sulfamethoxazole and thiacloprid an interesting case is the formation of dip167 in small quantities as a secondary otp from diphenhydramine it is most likely formed by oh reactions however a detailed formation mechanism is currently not available smx225 a secondary otp of the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole is significantly better biodegradable than its precursors based on the stability of smx282 nitro smx in the sand filter the nitrobenzene is recalcitrant and thus the secondary ring formation seems to be responsible for this observation thi283 a sulfone type primary otp from thiacloprid has a similar abatement efficiency as the parent compound which indicates that the molecular changes might not be important for biodegradation cla764 the n oxide of clarithromycin not shown in fig 10 has a similar abatement efficiency as its parent compound which indicates again that molecular features in the parent compound control the biodegradation aldehydes carbonyl groups seven further otps were abated to a relevant extent however the proposed structures were not clear enough to assign them to one of the discussed groups these otps are fen276 fle301 fle444 sit171 sit391 smz152 smz222 si1 si2 3 2 4 comparison of the abatement of parent mps with the otps to assess the overall treatment efficiency ozonation combined with biological sand filtration a comparison of the abatement of parent compounds and otps in the sand filter was carried out in the following the abatement of otps relative to the parent compounds is discussed for three types of cases i otps with similar ii worse or iii better abatement than their parent compounds section 2 4 5 and si1 table s3 si3 for similar abatement oxidative transformation might not have altered the biodegradable part of the structure for worse abatement some modifications of the biodegradable part s of the compound might have occurred for better abatement new biodegradable functional groups are formed the otps with no abatement 143 or formation 9 will not be further discussed as this would be beyond the scope of this paper for these otps the oxidative transformation does not introduce biodegradable functional groups and in the case of formation otps from biological and chemical oxidation are the same and further formed from a precursor mp or otp i nine otps with similar and relevant abatement as the corresponding parent compound for some otps with similar abatement efficiency as their parent compounds it can be assumed that the structural features which are responsible for biodegradation are not changed during oxidation or some new moieties are formed which hinder biodegradation at the original site but enable new pathways of biodegradation this was observed for 9 otps from four parent compounds clarithromycin 1 otp fenpropidin 3 otps flecainide 1 otp and sitagliptin 4 otps si1 for example cla764 is an n oxide with a similar abatement efficiency as the parent compound cla si1 therefore it can be hypothesized that the abatement is not related to the tertiary amine group which is oxidized to the n oxide in cla764 but probably due to the carbonyls and alcohols in the unaltered molecule see section 3 2 3 this also excludes the hypothesis of ion trapping for this compound gulde et al 2018 which is based on the protonation of the tertiary amine group for fenpropidin three otps fall in this category two otps fen274 fen 288 fig 7 result from an oxidation at the aliphatic chain the tertiary amine seems to be a critical functional group because the fen n oxide fen290 is not abated anymore nevertheless if the primary n oxide is oxidized to an alcohol on a side chain fen292 fig 7 an abatement is again observed alterations of the tert butyl benzene functional group to a benzoquinone type structure at the aromatic ring e g fen304 fen320 si1 si2 or more significant modifications on the piperidine moiety lead to a decrease of the biodegradability this is of importance since it has been demonstrated that benzoquinones are potentially toxic compounds tentscher et al 2021 wherefore the persistence of these compounds in biological post filtration is not desired for flecainide which is partially biodegradable the formation of the imine oxide fle429 si1 si2 table s3 si3 hinders a biodegradation also most other detected otps have relevant modifications at the piperidine moiety therefore it seems that an intact piperidine moiety is an important feature to enable biodegradation nevertheless further oxidation to one nitro compound fle461 fig 7 enhances the biodegradability again however the second otp with a nitro group and the same mass shows non relevant abatement it is hypothesized that the formation of a carbonyl is responsible for the degradation however the position of it seems decisive several otps of sitagliptin sit171 sit249 sit281 fig 7 have a similar pattern in the sand filter as the parent compound these three otps are significantly smaller molecules and do not contain the parent compound structure anymore furthermore sit391 also has a similar abatement efficiency as the parent compound overall it is unclear why this behavior is observed for these otps and not for other otps from sitagliptin one case in point for a none degradable otp is sit436 nitro compound this may be problematic due to the potential toxicity of nitro compounds lim et al 2019 however it is so far unknown if nitro compounds are generally not abated in biological post treatments overall the case of similar abatement of the parent and otps has been observed for only 9 otps 5 of all 187 otps from 4 parent compounds two tertiary amines one secondary amine and one primary amine the data base for these cases is relatively small wherefore no generalizations are possible at this point ii two otps with worse and relevant abatement than the corresponding parent compound for worse abatement of the otp some modifications of the biodegradable part s of the compound might have occurred only two cases 1 from all 187 otps with worse but relevant abatement of the otps were observed fen276 and thi283 for fen276 derived from fenpropidin modifications at the piperidine moiety seem to reduce the abatement efficiency as already observed for flecainide thi283 fig 10 is derived from thiacloprid with an oxidation of the thioether group this functional group might be at least partially relevant for the biodegradability of this compound iii 24 otps with better and relevant abatement relative to parent compound a biological post treatment is often applied after ozonation to improve the biostability of the water and it would be desirable to get an abatement of otps at the same time it is assumed that for a better abatement new functional groups are introduced to the molecule or existing functional groups are modified overall this case was only observed for 24 otps si1 table s3 si3 figs 7 10 which corresponds to 13 of the detected otps formed from 16 parent compounds namely bezafibrate 3 otps bzf156 bzf240 bzf256 figs 7 9 carbamazepine 2 otps cbz179 cbz251 fig 7 cetirizine 1 otp cet217 fig 7 cephalexin 1 otp cpx165 fig 9 diclofenac 1 otp dic189 fig 9 diphenhydramine 1 otp dip167 fig 10 diuron 2 otps diu199 diu216 fig 9 flecainide 3 otps fle475 fig 8 fle444 and fle301 si1 phenazone 1 otp phe179 fig 9 prometon 1 otp prm240 fig 7 propyzamide 2 otps pyz320 pyz274 figs 7 and 8 sulfamethoxazole 1 otp smx225 fig 10 sulfamethazine 2 otps smz152 smz222 si1 tramadol 1 otp tra328 fig 7 and valsartan 2 otps val336 val450 figs 7 and 8 most of the otps have been discussed in section 3 2 3 except for the 4 otps fle301 fle444 smz152 and smz222 for which no clear structures could be derived from this discussion of the formation and abatement of the otps it becomes evident that higher generation otps are often not related to the primary ozone reactive sites in the mps anymore nevertheless a comparison of the abatement of otps relative to the parent compound based on the primary ozone reactive site is shown in fig 11 in general for amine containing mps the abatement of the otps in the sand filter is only more efficient in rare cases whereas for activated aromatic and olefinic moieties in the parent mp an improvement was achieved for a significant fraction of compounds 36 and 50 respectively nevertheless the general assumption that a partial oxidative transformation of micropollutants leads to better biodegradable compounds could not be confirmed in this study from the discussion above it is evident that the formation of aldehyde carbonyl alcohol carboxylic acid and amide groups may enhance the degradation whereas n oxidation generally leads to more recalcitrant otps unless another site in the molecule is responsible for its biodegradability this also explains the relatively high proportion of worse abatement of otps from amine type compounds the two otps of the sulfur containing benzisothiazolone were abated worse than their parent mps with several ozone reactive sites do not generally lead to otps with a better biodegradability than the parents however for this class of compounds often a similar behavior as for the parent compounds is observed ozone resistant mps react predominantly with oh and also in this case a limited number of otps 6 18 showed a better abatement in the sand filter than the parent compounds this shows that oh oxidation and in general advanced oxidation processes do not seem to be more efficient in terms of the formation of biodegradable otps than conventional ozonation 4 practical implications the combination of lc hrms ms data from laboratory and pilot experiments with kinetic and mechanistic information on ozone and hydroxyl reactions can be applied to elucidate transformation product formation during ozonation with a higher plausibility than lc hrms ms alone this approach should be further developed to make significant advances in understanding the fate of micropollutants during ozonation this information can then be further used to assess the fate of transformation products during biological post treatment which is applied after ozonation to abate easily biodegradable compounds formed during the reactions of ozone and hydroxyl radicals with the dom von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this has been confirmed in the current study by the observed abatement of doc and selected micropollutants with known biodegradability in sand filtration after ozonation the successful combination of ozonation followed by biological filtration has often been assumed to be an equally important barrier for micropollutants and their otps from this study it can be concluded that biological post filtration is not very effective for the abatement of parent compounds and otps there are some trends which may suggest that different classes of otps might differ in biodegradability compared to their parent mps however more information would be needed to further confirm these preliminary observations as a general rule n containing compounds might be less biodegradable after ozonation due to formation of recalcitrant n o bonds whereas compounds with an attack of ozone and or oh on the carbon structure may lead to moieties such as aldehydes carbonyls alcohols and carboxylic acids which have a better chance of being biodegraded another class of compounds are amides which may be formed or transformed by reactions with hydroxyl radicals leading to biodegradable otps with the analytical window applied in this study compounds resulting from activation of aromatic moieties by phenol formation and the ensuing fast reactions with ozone as other small and polar otps might have escaped detection which may distort the overall picture this study demonstrates that ozonation abates micropollutants and forms a multitude of otps which might persist during biological post filtration this process can be considered as an oxidative dilution of the target compounds leading to significantly smaller concentrations of the otps von gunten 2018 other studies have demonstrated that many of the biologically active compounds lose their effects and eco toxicological tests have shown the same dodd et al 2009 escher et al 2009 huber et al 2004 mestankova et al 2011 mestankova et al 2016 however there are also known cases where more toxic otps are formed from target compounds on case in point is the formation of n nitrosodimethylamine from the bromide catalysed reaction of dimethlysulfamide with ozone schmidt and brauch 2008 von gunten et al 2010 nevertheless also due to the smaller concentrations of the otps the risk of enhanced toxicity is relatively small von gunten 2018 a shortcoming of the currently applied analytical approach is that the mass balance is unknown and it is unclear what other otps are formed to this end detailed laboratory studies with e g radiolabeled compounds could yield a better quantification of the otps and close the deficiency in the mass balance 5 conclusions fifty one micropollutants with various ozone reactive sites were spiked to a pilot ozonation system and their abatement with the ensuing formation of transformation products otps was investigated furthermore the fate of the micropollutants and the otps was investigated in a biological post treatment with a sand filter the following conclusions can be drawn 227 otps from 39 parent compounds were identified after solid phase extraction by lc hrms ms based on laboratory and full scale experiments with 187 otps from 34 parent compounds present in meaningful concentrations during the sand filtration a rigorous kinetic and mechanistic interpretation of the chemical structures from the ms ms data was a prerequisite to understand and explain the formation of a large number of otps based on ozone and hydroxyl reactions this approach also allowed to assess the plausibility of otps which were proposed in previous studies however also for a large number of proposed otps no mechanistic interpretation could be provided which warrants detailed studies under controlled conditions 35 otps had a relevant abatement in the biological sand filtration and 24 otps of them showed a better abatement than the corresponding parent compound overall this is a low fraction 13 of all the detected otps it could be shown that degradable otps often contained aldehyde carbonyl carboxylic alcohol or amide functional groups it seems that many of the expected otps from aromatic compounds and olefins escaped detection by the applied analytical approach this may have biased the findings of this study towards a worse outcome in terms of the fraction of biodegradable otps declaration of competing interest
