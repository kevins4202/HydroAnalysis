23250,this work proposed a novel hybrid cooling system that applies the mist spraying technology to improve the thermal conditions and loading capacity of refrigerated containers reefers in the cargo holds of ultra large container ships thorough studies were carried out via both experiments and simulations first effects of the air supply rate and the mist spray rate on the reefer s exhaust temperature and the ambient temperature of the reefer lab were investigated in comparison with the simulation models then the possible operating conditions of the air and mist flow rates were clarified and the cargo hold from a practical container ship was adopted as the example to verify their feasibility finally the possible capacity improvement for loading reefers was discussed while the method of determining the operating range of mist spray rates and air supply rates was also established it was found that great benefits were generated by the proposed system in lowering the reefer s exhaust temperature and improving the thermal conditions inside the cargo hold in addition a substantial capacity improvement for loading reefers in the cargo hold was also achieved in the present study the study will help in enhancing the efficiency and economic benefits for the reefer transportation keywords loading capacity improvement refrigerated containers ultra large container ship mist spray 1 introduction container shipping is playing a vital role in the global trade since it can realize the loading and unloading of goods in a swift and safe way levinson 2016 in particular transportation of refrigerated containers i e reefers which are self equipped with the refrigeration systems has become increasingly popular and important this is because they can keep the temperature sensitive goods such as fruits vegetables and meat chilled and fresh after long distance transport in addition the costs are usually lower than other transportation methods levinson 2016 all of these advantages together with the increasing demand of global shipping of the fresh goods have raised an urgent requirement of enhancing the loading capacity of reefers on container ships kremer 2013 in general the reefers can be placed either on the deck or inside the cargo hold however considering the limited number of sockets and the possible poor weather conditions that may occur on the deck such as the strong sunshine and significant temperature variance between day and night it is preferred to load as many reefers as possible inside the cargo as a result better cooling performance and longer service life of reefers can be achieved rodríguez bermejo et al 2007 nevertheless this also raises another serious challenge for the container ship designers and builders i e how to effectively remove the heat released by the reefers from the cargo holds the current popular strategy is to install the ventilation systems that are mainly composed of blowers air ducts and vents in the cargo hold to exhaust the heat however as the number of reefers loaded inside the cargo is growing significantly increasingly powerful ventilation systems would be required especially in the ultra large container ships which are able to hold more than 14 500 twenty foot equivalent units teu evangelos 2006 this will not only lead to an enormous rise of power consumption cao et al 2016 and construction cost of the ventilation system but also take up more space which is already severely limited inside the cargo hold the size growth of the ductwork could also make it even narrower and harder for the personnel in the cargo hold to operate or walk therefore it is critical to come up with ideas to improve the cooling capacity of the ventilation systems inside the cargo holds without significant rise of space occupation or retrofitting costs one potential approach to achieve this goal could be the application of mist spraying cooling technology in this condition a great amount of heat can be absorbed during the evaporation process of the water mist the technology has been widely applied to various systems and achieved promising cooling effects for example yang et al 2012 investigated the performance improvement of air cooled chillers after employing the water mist system they reported a significant improvement 51 5 in the chillers coefficient of performance cop while the annual electricity consumption was found reduced by 14 1 yang et al 2012 meanwhile application study of mist cooling system into the railway tunnels was conducted by barrow and pope etc barrow and pope 1995 2007 to lower both the local and overall average tunnel air temperatures they pointed out that the costs of installation maintenance and operation of the mist spraying system were relatively smaller furthermore log torgrim cannon brookes and peter etc made use of the water mist cooling system to the fire protection of historic buildings and museums log and cannon brookes 1995 while the cooling effects of mist flow in a heated horizontal tube was thoroughly studied by guo wang and gaddis etc guo et al 1999 in addition small droplets with the micron level diameter could facilitate the heat and mass transfer effectively yang et al 2014 2015 2016a 2016b this will also guarantee a fast and adequate evaporation for the mist spraying technology however few studies have been carried out to investigate the feasibility of applying the mist evaporation cooling technology to improve the loading capacity for reefers inside the cargo holds to address this under explored topic this study aims to answer the following technical questions 1 is it possible to lower the airflow rates in the cargo hold with the application of the mist spraying cooling system how much air supply can be reduced while the cooling effects remain the same 2 how much mist should be sprayed for each reefer what is the relationship between the mist spray rates and the cooling effects inside the cargo hold 3 what are the feasible flow rate combinations of airflow and mist are there any other combinations how to determine the optimal one 4 how many improvements in the loading capacity of cargo holds for reefers can be achieved to address the above issues a novel hybrid cooling system in which the existing air supplying system was reinforced with the water mist spraying for each reefer was proposed in this work thorough studies on the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system were conducted via both simulation and experimental tests to begin with the simulation study was carried out to predict the cooling performance and guide the design of the possible operating conditions of the system then numerous experimental runs were conducted to validate the simulation model furthermore the above results were adopted to a practical cargo hold and the method to figure out the potential flow rate combinations of mist and airflow was established this work verified the feasibility of applying the mist spraying cooling technology to improve the loading capacity of reefer ships and may generate significant economic benefits for container ship transportation 2 prototype of the experimental system to validate the cooling effects of the proposed system a novel experimental setup see fig 1 was built in the comprehensive laboratory of refrigerated containers in shanghai maritime university as shown in fig 1 apart from the conventional air supplying system a mist spraying system that mainly consist of the water supply the pressure pump the high pressure hose the nozzles and regulating valves was added to build up the hybrid system besides a mist and air handling system as well as a reefer controlling system was also included in the current study for handling the conditions of the fluids and the reefer these components were distributed in three different chambers fig 1 which can be introduced as follows the field test chamber chamber 1 is the most important part of the whole system in this chamber a standard 20 foot thermo king reefer was employed for the experimental tests and positioned at the middle of the test site a hot air machine with the heating power up to 10 kw was placed inside the reefer to simulate the cooling load generated by the goods such as fruits during the shipping the hybrid cooling system composed of air supplying system and the mist spraying system was equipped in the chamber with the vent directly facing the front face of the reefer at 70 cm meanwhile spray nozzles were installed evenly along the edge of the vent after being pressurized to 5 5 mpa by the pump the supplied water was atomized into numerous tiny mist droplets by the mist nozzles with the diameter around 150 μm according to the manufacture these droplets mixed well and flew together with the airstream towards the inlet of the reefer condenser with the help of a background air conditioning system and other auxiliary facilities such as the fan the duct the water pipe and valve chamber 2 was employed as the transit site to handle the air and water to the desired conditions meanwhile an intelligent electronic control system was set up in chamber 3 to realize the effective control of the hot air machine inside the reefer additionally the control system in chamber 3 was also taking charge of the start and stop of the reefer s refrigeration module and the initial temperatures inside chamber 1 and chamber 2 detailed operating process of the experiments can be seen in section 3 2 3 performance study of the hybrid system for single reefer as a first step simulation tests via the computational fluid dynamics cfd were conducted prior to the experimental study to guide the design of the system s operating conditions then experiments were carried out under the operating conditions predicted from the simulations within the test setup shown in fig 1 the simulation results were then compared with the experimental data to validate the model s reliability 3 1 simulation study 3 1 1 model prototype and meshing in this work the simulation model was built based on the practical experimental setup fig 2 in the ratio of 1 1 the geometric parameters of the reefer lab were 10 m in length 6 m in width and 3 5 m in height other parts of the model geometry were also strictly built based on the practical measurements or the manufacture data of the reefer once the model s geometry well built it was carefully meshed with the unstructured hexagonal grids as shown in fig 3 a in addition the mesh was further refined for the critical zones such as the space between the outlet of the duct and the inlet of the reefer s condenser where significant heat cooling process and mass mist evaporation transfer would occur 3 1 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions for the present simulation were set up as shown in table 1 fig 3 b according to the practical situation of the reefer lab where the experimental tests would be conducted as suggested by the operation manual of the reefer the cooling load produced by the hot air machine inside the reefer was set as 7 kw for present study airflow rates tested under different opening degrees of the control valve were employed in the simulation while the mist spray rates were ranging from 5 kg h 1 to 25 kg h 1 with the interval of 5 kg h 1 since the latent heat from the mist evaporation process takes up the predominant part of the cooling effects the influence of normal changes of water temperature can be negligible yuan et al 2009 in view of this the tap water from the municipal pipe with temperature around 28 c was adopted as the water source for the mist spraying system meanwhile the initial temperature inside the reefer lab was set as 43 c based on the study results of reference an et al 2008 and the diameter of mist droplets was set as 150 μm in the model in accordance with the nozzle manufacture since the wall of the reefer lab was well covered with the thermal insulation material it was set as adiabatic in present simulation 3 1 3 simulation model apparently with the mist involved in the airflow the current study belonged to the two phase flow and there exist some computational models for such problems e g the volume of fluid vof model and the discrete phase model dpm as to the present work the mist was dispersed in the air the continuous phase after being sprayed strong interaction between the gas phase and the droplets phase would occur such as the possible mist evaporation together with the heat and mass transfer between the mist and the airflow in addition as inferred from the operating conditions shown in table 1 the volume ratio of the mist to the airflow was smaller than 10 this indicates the mist was slightly loaded in the air and can be treated as the discrete phase ragab and wang 2012 owing to the above features the dpm model which tended to be more eligible bhattacharya et al 2009 was adopted in this paper simulation runs were performed under different flow rate combinations of airflow and mist table 1 to reveal the cooling effects of the hybrid system the simulation results will be presented in comparison with the experiment data as shown in section 4 3 2 experimental study a novel hybrid cooling system for reefers was constructed see fig 4 in this work extensive experimental tests were carried out to investigate the cooling performance of the hybrid system and compared with the simulation results 3 2 1 measuring instruments during the experimental runs various instruments were adopted to test the system conditions the major components and their specifications are list in table 2 among the tested parameters the airflow rates under different opening degrees of the fan valve were measured in advance with a hot wire anemometer according to reference caré et al 2014 four air temperature sensors were installed at the outlet of condenser vent to obtain the temperatures of the air exhausted from the reefer s condenser the ambient temperature and humidity inside the reefer lab were simultaneously measured via five rotronic probes model hc2 s distributed at the location shown in fig 1 in addition the temperature and humidity ratio of the supplied air were monitored while slight adjustments can be made by the background air conditioning system or the humidifiers equipped in chamber 2 the power of the reefer as well as the hot air machine installed inside can be adjusted by the controlling system in chamber 3 a pc based data acquisition system keithley 2700 7700 was adopted to record the tested data during the whole experimental process multiple tests were conducted for each operating condition and the average value was obtained for the result analysis 3 2 2 test conditions and procedures to validate the simulation model in section 3 1 experiments were carried out under the initial conditions same with the simulation runs see table 1 considering the required massive airflow rates up to 4200 m3 h 1 it can hardly make significant changes to airflow s temperature and humidity ratio therefore experimental runs were performed from 1 00 p m to 4 30 p m in the sunny days of late july when the outdoor conditions of the experimental site were stable and almost same to the designed operating conditions 35 c 20 g kg 1 dry air with the slight adjustments by the background heating or air conditioning system equipped in chamber 2 the desired inlet temperature and the humidity ratio for the air supplying system can be achieved in operation the basic procedure of the experiments was as follows beforehand the air supplying system and mist spraying system were adjusted to the initial conditions shown in table 1 with the background heating or air conditioning system in chamber 2 after this the heater in chamber 1 was turned on to warm up the ambient environment of the reefer lab and the door of reefer lab was closed to keep the lab isolated when the ambient temperature of the reefer lab reached 43 c turn off the ambient heater in chamber 1 and switch on the reefer s refrigeration system as soon as the temperature inside the reefer decreased to the design value switch on the hot air machine inside the reefer to simulate the cooling load from chilled goods just then switch on the hybrid cooling system i e turn on the air supplying and the mist spraying system to start the cooling process for the reefer s condenser finally the steady state was realized when the air temperature exhausted from the reefer s condenser and the thermal conditions inside the reefer lab remained constant and the experimental data was saved by the daq system for the upcoming results analysis after one experimental run was finished parameters of the airflow and water mist were reverted to the initial values with one parameter changed within table 1 for the next round of the experiments 3 3 performance indices to evaluate the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system three indicators namely the reefer s exhaust temperature the ambient temperature inside reefer lab and the loading capacity improvement were adopted in this work 3 3 1 reefer s exhaust temperature the exhaust air temperature from the reefer s condenser i e t a ex was directly determined by the cooling performance of the ventilation system besides with a lower air temperature exhausted from the reefer s condenser which indicates a lower running temperature for the condenser a better working condition can be realized for the reefer s refrigeration system therefore it was used as one of the performance indices 3 3 2 ambient temperature of reefer lab to evaluate the effects of the proposed hybrid cooling system in removing the heat from the ambient space the ambient thermal conditions inside the reefer lab which can be represented by the tested ambient temperatures ab t a amb was adopted as one of the performance indices apparently with the lower t a amb better cooling effects of the hybrid system will be achieved 3 3 3 loading capacity improvement of container ships to assess the benefits of the proposed hybrid cooling system in improving the loading capacity of the container ship for reefers the indicator loading capacity improvement ab lci is employed in present work it can be calculated as follows 1 l c i l c crnt l c prev l c prev 100 evidently with better cooling performance of the hybrid system less airflow would be required for each reefer to meet the cooling demand of the reefer s condensers thus more reefers can ideally be loaded in the container cargo holds without enlarging the existing ventilation system in addition the average absolute difference ab aad between the predicted values and the experimental results was employed in this work to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the simulation model under different conditions it was defined as eq 2 shows 2 a a d x 1 n i 1 n x expt x pred where x refers to the system performance indices such as ta ex and ta amb n stands for the number of the simulation or experimental tests under each condition 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between the experimental performance and the simulation results the predicted cooling performance of the hybrid system by the simulation model is compared with the experimental results in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a the predicted values of the reefer s exhaust temperature are in good agreement with the experimental finding with the clear majority of the results fall into a deviation range of 3 meanwhile with a maximum discrepancy less than 8 good accuracy was also realized in predicting the ambient temperature of the cargo hold fig 5 b therefore it can be concluded that the present simulation model is reliable to predict the cooling effects of the hybrid system on reefers 4 2 effect of flow rate combinations of airstream and mist 4 2 1 in terms of reefer s exhaust temperature fig 6 demonstrates the effects of mist spray rates on the reefer s exhaust temperature under different air supply rates the experimental value of the exhaust temperature obtained under the conventional operating condition namely v air sply 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist is employed as the baseline obviously applied with the mist spraying cooling technology the air exhaust temperature dropped remarkably furthermore the necessary air supply rate was found decreasing simultaneously as shown in fig 6 a this manifests that owing to the benefits of the mist evaporation process a great deal of airflow can be saved for each reefer to figure out how much air flow on earth can be reduced another two groups of experiments were conducted with the further decrease of the air supply rate namely v air sply 2850 m3 h 1 and v air sply 1950 m3 h 1 the results were displayed in fig 6 b and c respectively as shown in fig 6 b and c the reefer s exhaust air temperature was falling continuously with the mass growth of the sprayed mist in particular the exhaust air temperature became even lower than the baseline condition i e v air sply 4200 m3 h 1 without mist when the sprayed mist was about more than 5 kg h 1 in the case of v air sply 2850 m3 h 1 fig 6 b similar results can also be observed in the case of v air sply 1950 m3 h 1 as shown fig 6 c when mist flow rate was higher than 22 5 kg h 1 compared to the baseline condition the necessary air supply rate was reduced substantially from 4200 m3 h 1 to 1950 m3 h 1 with the reduction amplitude reached 53 57 as the consequence it seems to be highly possible and promising to increase the capacity of container ships for loading reefers with just minor reforms which can be realized via supplementing the mist cooling system inside the cargo hold with few changes in the air supplying system this will be validated and discussed in section 5 meanwhile with the growth of the mist spray rate the air exhaust temperature was dropping rapidly at the beginning and leveled off at the end the decreasing trends were well fitted as exponential with the r2 0 92 under experimental conditions see table 3 this manifests that significant cooling effect can be achieved when the mist spraying system was applied however with the further growth of the mist spray rate a continuing but weakening decrease trend of reefer s exhaust temperature was observed under all the operating conditions the reefer s exhaust temperature was lowered effectively with consuming a small amount of the mist which also contributed to the feasibility of the proposed hybrid system in the real ultra large container ships from another perspective of view the relationship shown in fig 6 also indicates that the mist spray rate can be designed within a reasonable range to achieve an optimal cooling effects this will be further discussed with a case study for the entire cargo hold in section 5 2 4 2 2 in terms of reefer lab s ambient temperature fig 7 illustrates the relationships between the mist spray rate and the ambient temperature inside the reefer s lab under various air supply rates the experimental ambient temperatures obtained under the baseline condition v air sply 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist was adopted for comparison as can be seen in fig 7 the ambient temperatures declined significantly which were well fit as exponential as shown in table 3 and much less air supply rate was required after applying the mist cooling technology for instance with the mist spray rate reached 5 kg h 1 the necessary air supply rate was reduced significantly from 4200 kg h 1 in the baseline condition to 3650 m3 h 1 as shown in fig 7 a when the mist spray rate kept increasing to 22 5 kg h 1 it was found that the necessary air supply rate fell dramatically to only 1950 m3 h 1 to achieve the same cooling effect all the relationships shown in fig 7 prove that the ambient temperature of the reefer lab can be lowered effectively with the application of the mist spraying system while the necessary air supply rate decreased remarkably at the same time it is noticed in fig 7 c that the predicted ambient temperature was somewhat higher than the experimental values the reason for this may be due to the slight difference on thermal property of the lab wall which was set adequate in simulation models but hardly to be fully achieved in experimental sites though it was well covered with thermal isolation materials however with the maximum deviation less than 8 the difference was negligible 4 2 3 in terms of ambient humidity fig 8 displays the humidity conditions represented by the relative humidity and the humidity ratio in the reefer lab as shown in fig 8 both the relative humidity and the corresponding humidity ratio were growing continuously in exponential trends as shown in table 4 with the rise of mist spray rate however the highest relative humidity and humidity ratio in present study was lower than 60 and 30 g kg 1 dry air respectively which is far from its saturation level and possible condensation problems can be avoided therefore it can be inferred that few issues on the undesired water condensation inside the cargo hold would arise after introducing the mist spraying system 5 validation of loading capacity improvement for reefer ship the results shown in section 4 confirmed that the application of mist spraying cooling can make a great contribution to lowering the exhaust air temperature and the ambient temperatures of the single reefer lab without raising risks of the excessive humidity or the undesired condensation however since the experiments were conducted on one reefer in the laboratory whereas there would be many reefers loaded in a practical cargo hold a validation study was performed as follows 5 1 validation background to validate the cooling effects of the proposed hybrid system for the reefer cargo hold the layout of a real cargo hold see fig 9 of a practical ultra large container ship designed by the china state shipbuilding corporation was employed as the study case as shown in fig 9 the cargo hold which consist of three bays and was symmetrical in the b b direction was 44 74 m long 43 48 m wide and 24 4 m high initially it was designed to load 453 of 40 foot standard containers among which only 150 containers were reefers due to the over sized ventilation ductworks and the corresponding space conflicts while 303 containers were non refrigerated evidently this led to a severe limitation to the ability of the container ship in carrying reefers to clarify the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system for the cargo hold a simulation model was built as displayed in fig 9 the model geometry and the meshing result is shown in fig 10 a and b respectively operating conditions that were potentially satisfying in the single reefer lab as investigated in section 4 3 were adopted here to validate their theoretical feasibility for the cargo hold 5 2 feasibility of the potential mist and air combinations for the cargo hold after clarifying the effects of the mist spray rate on the reefer s exhaust temperature in section 4 3 1 the operating conditions of the hybrid system that could achieve the same or better cooling effects with the baseline condition 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist were selected as the potential options for the cargo hold then their feasibility for cooling the whole cargo hold was verified at the end possible improvement of the ship s loading capacity was figured out 5 2 1 the potential design for cargo hold since the hot air exhausted from the reefer s condensers was heat source in the cargo hold the thermal conditions inside the cargo hold may be improved when the reefer s exhaust air temperature is equal to or lower than the temperature of the baseline condition 52 5 c in present study thus according to the results shown in section 4 3 nine operating conditions of air and mist flow rate were selected as the potential options these airflow mist flow rate combinations to be validated were 1950 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 3650 m3 h 1 5 kg h 1 3650 m3 h 1 10 kg h 1 3650 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 5 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 10 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 15 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 2250 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 simulations were carried out under the above operating conditions to validate their cooling effects for the hold cargo while the initial ventilation design 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist was employed as the baseline the validation results can be shown and discussed as follows 5 2 2 validation for the cargo hold during the running process of the refrigerated containers it is suggested that the inlet temperature of the cooling air sucked by the reefer s condenser should be lower than 45 c this temperature requirement consequently was adopted as the criterion to verify the feasibility of the operating options for the cargo hold in the practical cargo hold reefers are usually placed one above another owing to this packed loading pattern and the buoyant effect of hot air the inlet temperature of cooling air for the upper reefers as well as the thermal condition at the top of the cargo hold can be significantly affected by the lower and the nearby reefers therefore feasibility of the potential operating conditions was carefully verified from different aspects of the cargo hold which can be introduced as follows a in terms of the air let temperature for the reefers table 5 summarizes the air inlet temperatures for all the 150 reefer condensers in the cargo hold under the aforementioned potential air and mist supply rate designs as shown in the table most of the cooling air s inlet temperatures except for the case 1950 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 were lower than 45 c which seems to meet the set criterion nevertheless with the low airflow rate for instance v air 1950 m3 h 1 the hot air cannot be circulated sufficiently and excessive heat may be accumulated in the cargo hold which could lead the inlet temperature of the upper reefers to be much higher the detailed thermal condition inside the cargo hold can be seen in the following section b thermal conditions inside the cargo hold during the laboratory research on the single reefer section 4 3 it was found that the reefer s exhaust temperatures under the operating conditions namely 1950 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 and 3650 m3 h 1 5 kg h 1 were almost same with the baseline condition 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist as a comparison their temperature distributions for the whole cargo hold were illustrated in figs 11 and12 three featured cross sections see fig 9 were selected to demonstrate the contours namely 1 the view perspective perpendicular to the front face of middle reefers cross section a a x 16750 mm 2 the view perpendicular to the middle reefers cross section b b z 11647 mm 3 the horizontal perspective crossing through the top exhaust vents of the cargo hold cross section c c y 24400 mm however considering the space limitation of the manuscript contours detail of air temperature distribution from the view of cross section a a can be found in the supplemental materials as shown in figs 11 and12 though similar exhaust temperature was achieved during the single reefer research their cooling effects for the cargo hold differed remarkably in particular the cooling effect shown in fig 11 c was apparently unfavorable even though the mean inlet air temperature for reefers was around 45 52 c the reason for this was due to effect of heat accumulation at the upper layers in the cargo hold as can displayed in fig 11 the hot air exhausted from the lower layer reefers flew upwards and led the massive hot air to accumulate at the upper position of the cargo hold with less fresh cooling air supplied a bigger amount of hot air from the lower reefers would be involved into the airflow supplied to the upper reefers resulting in the poor thermal conditions inside the cargo hold the different thermal conditions shown in fig 11 also manifests that spraying mist did help a lot in reducing the necessary air supply rates however it cannot completely replace the effects of airflow in other words there should be a balanced range during the design process of air supply rates and the mist spray rates this will be discussed in section 5 3 c effects of the mist spray rate on the inlet air temperatures for reefers in cargo hold fig 13 demonstrates the effects of the mist spray rate on the inlet temperatures of the air sucked by reefer condensers taking the air supply rate of 2900 m3 h 1 as the example as shown in fig 13 the air inlet temperatures the maximum value the minimum value and the facet average for the condensers decreased continuously with the increase of the mist flow rate when the mist flow rate was enhanced from 5 kg h 1 to 10 kg h 1 the mean intake temperature of the condensers dropped significantly by 0 76 c this proves that significant cooling effect can be realized by raising the mist flow rate at its lower level however with more mist sprayed weakening cooling effects were observed for instance with the further increase of mist flow rate from 15 kg h 1 to 25 kg h 1 temperature drop 0 2 c of the facet average value was limited as the consequence it can be inferred that there should exist an optimal design range of mist spray rate in which balance between the mist consumption rate and cooling performance can be achieved further discussion is conducted in section 5 2 d effects of air supply rates on the inlet air temperatures for reefers in cargo hold fig 14 shows the effects of the air supply rate on the air inlet temperatures for the reefer condensers in the cargo hold with the mist flow rate of 25 kg h 1 set as the example as can be seen in the figure the air temperatures for cooling the reefer s condensers decrease significantly with the growth of airflow rates in particular when the air supply rates increased from 1950 m3 h 1 to 2900 m3 h 1 a remarkable temperature drop 3 2 c of the cooling air that flows into the condensers was observed with the further increase of the air supply rate though the significant temperature drop of the cooling air can still be observed its decreasing trends became moderate however it should be noted that the enhanced air supply rate could also raise the electricity consumption and more space would be occupied by the enlarged ventilation system considering the cooling effects via spraying mist fig 13 or enhancing the air supply rates fig 14 it seems that there may exist an optimal operating range for the hybrid system to achieve the balance this will be further discussed in section 5 3 5 3 method for determining the mist and airflow rates range based on the study results shown in section 5 2 the effects of mist spray rate as well as the air supply rate on the maximum inlet temperature of the cooling air for reefer condensers can be regressed as eq 3 shows 3 t a inlet max 37 205 28 127 exp 0 010728 m mist 0 000492 v a supplied with r 2 0 930 the accuracy of eq 3 was validated with the experimental data as shown in table 6 the predicted values by eq 3 were found parallel to the tested results thus when different inlet temperatures of cooling air t a i max were set for the reefer condensers in present study the corresponding operating conditions of the proposed hybrid system can be obtained by eq 3 for instance if the maximum temperature of cooling air t a i max was set as 45 c and the maximum ability of the water supplying system was 25 kg h 1 for each reefer then the necessary design range of mist and airflow rates can be obtained as the green section shown in fig 15 a similarly if lower temperature of the cooling air t a i max was required for example 43 c the corresponding flow rate combinations of the mist and airflow would then fall into the green section displayed in fig 15 b with the same method the operating conditions of the proposed hybrid cooling system for other design targets can be easily determined in the present study the maximum temperature of the cooling air for each reefer s condenser was lower than 45 c efforts were made to achieve a balance between reducing the air supply rate and consumption of the water mist according to the practical water supplying ability of the container ship studied in this work which could provide 10 kg h 1 pressured water for each reefer the corresponding air supply rate was found to be only 2400 m3 h 1 via eq 3 as the result great capacity improvement of the container ships for loading reefers can be achieved this is to be discussed in the following section 5 4 potential improvement on the reefer loading capacity of the container ship within the optimal operating conditions i e 2400 m3 h 1 10 kg h 1 for each reefer obtained in section 5 3 the airflow rate was reduced dramatically from the original 4200 m3 h 1 to only 2400 m3 h 1 while the mist consumption 10 kg h 1 tends to be moderate and affordable for most of the reefer ships as the consequence much less energy would be cost by the blowers for supplying the fresh air into the cargo hold and the necessary space taken up by the bulky ventilation system can be reduced simultaneously from another point of view the loading capacity for reefers can be improved significantly without expanding the size of the existing air supplying system for the cargo hold studied in this paper see fig 9 the capacity of the air supplying system which was mainly limited by the space conflicting of the bulky ductwork and the excessive energy consumption by blowers was designed as 420 000 m3 h 1 for each hold in this condition the loading capacity in each cargo hold was set to be 100 reefers while the rest of the space was filled with the non refrigerated containers however after applying the proposed hybrid cooling system that added the mist spraying system the necessary air supply rate was reduced significantly to only 2400 m3 h 1 for each reefer as the consequence compared with the original 100 boxes the number of reefers that can be loaded inside each cargo hold is significantly raised to as many as 175 reefers in theory based on the same air supplying system this indicates that the loading capacity of the container ships for reefers could be dramatically improved considering the significantly improved capacity for loading extra reefers and minor build or reform costs of the system it can be inferred that enormous economic benefits will also be produced by the proposed hybrid cooling system for the container shipping industry detailed study on this issue should be carried out in the future work 6 conclusions in this work a novel hybrid cooling system that applied the mist spraying cooling system to the reefers cargo hold was proposed and its feasibility in improving the capacity of container ships to load reefers was carefully validated the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the cooling effects for the reefer condensers can be improved significantly with the application of the mist spraying technology in the present study case it was found that the air temperature exhausted from the reefer condenser was lowered from the original 52 5 c the baseline condition to only 47 4 c 3650 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 with the temperature drop of 5 1 c 2 the airflow rates for cooling the reefers in the cargo hold can be reduced remarkably after applying the mist spraying technology in this work the necessary demand of airflow for each reefer decreased from the original volume of 4200 m3 h 1 to only 2400 m3 h 1 3 the loading capacity of the reefer ships can be enhanced dramatically with application of the mist spraying technology in the case study of current work the loading capacity was enhanced from 100 reefers to 175 reefers per cargo hold theoretically without enlarging the ventilation system 4 it is feasible and reliable to adopt the dpm model to simulate the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system good agreement was achieved between the predicted performance and the experimental results with the maximum deviation less than 3 for reefer s exhaust temperature and 8 for the ambient temperature 5 a method for determining the operating conditions of the mist spray rates and air supply rates at different cooling demands was established instead of the scattered operating conditions a continuous design range of air supply rate and mist spray rate was obtained it should however be noted that the loading capacity improvement lci was figured out theoretically this should be further validated via thorough field tests in a real container ship in future work acknowledgement this work is financially supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities

23250,this work proposed a novel hybrid cooling system that applies the mist spraying technology to improve the thermal conditions and loading capacity of refrigerated containers reefers in the cargo holds of ultra large container ships thorough studies were carried out via both experiments and simulations first effects of the air supply rate and the mist spray rate on the reefer s exhaust temperature and the ambient temperature of the reefer lab were investigated in comparison with the simulation models then the possible operating conditions of the air and mist flow rates were clarified and the cargo hold from a practical container ship was adopted as the example to verify their feasibility finally the possible capacity improvement for loading reefers was discussed while the method of determining the operating range of mist spray rates and air supply rates was also established it was found that great benefits were generated by the proposed system in lowering the reefer s exhaust temperature and improving the thermal conditions inside the cargo hold in addition a substantial capacity improvement for loading reefers in the cargo hold was also achieved in the present study the study will help in enhancing the efficiency and economic benefits for the reefer transportation keywords loading capacity improvement refrigerated containers ultra large container ship mist spray 1 introduction container shipping is playing a vital role in the global trade since it can realize the loading and unloading of goods in a swift and safe way levinson 2016 in particular transportation of refrigerated containers i e reefers which are self equipped with the refrigeration systems has become increasingly popular and important this is because they can keep the temperature sensitive goods such as fruits vegetables and meat chilled and fresh after long distance transport in addition the costs are usually lower than other transportation methods levinson 2016 all of these advantages together with the increasing demand of global shipping of the fresh goods have raised an urgent requirement of enhancing the loading capacity of reefers on container ships kremer 2013 in general the reefers can be placed either on the deck or inside the cargo hold however considering the limited number of sockets and the possible poor weather conditions that may occur on the deck such as the strong sunshine and significant temperature variance between day and night it is preferred to load as many reefers as possible inside the cargo as a result better cooling performance and longer service life of reefers can be achieved rodríguez bermejo et al 2007 nevertheless this also raises another serious challenge for the container ship designers and builders i e how to effectively remove the heat released by the reefers from the cargo holds the current popular strategy is to install the ventilation systems that are mainly composed of blowers air ducts and vents in the cargo hold to exhaust the heat however as the number of reefers loaded inside the cargo is growing significantly increasingly powerful ventilation systems would be required especially in the ultra large container ships which are able to hold more than 14 500 twenty foot equivalent units teu evangelos 2006 this will not only lead to an enormous rise of power consumption cao et al 2016 and construction cost of the ventilation system but also take up more space which is already severely limited inside the cargo hold the size growth of the ductwork could also make it even narrower and harder for the personnel in the cargo hold to operate or walk therefore it is critical to come up with ideas to improve the cooling capacity of the ventilation systems inside the cargo holds without significant rise of space occupation or retrofitting costs one potential approach to achieve this goal could be the application of mist spraying cooling technology in this condition a great amount of heat can be absorbed during the evaporation process of the water mist the technology has been widely applied to various systems and achieved promising cooling effects for example yang et al 2012 investigated the performance improvement of air cooled chillers after employing the water mist system they reported a significant improvement 51 5 in the chillers coefficient of performance cop while the annual electricity consumption was found reduced by 14 1 yang et al 2012 meanwhile application study of mist cooling system into the railway tunnels was conducted by barrow and pope etc barrow and pope 1995 2007 to lower both the local and overall average tunnel air temperatures they pointed out that the costs of installation maintenance and operation of the mist spraying system were relatively smaller furthermore log torgrim cannon brookes and peter etc made use of the water mist cooling system to the fire protection of historic buildings and museums log and cannon brookes 1995 while the cooling effects of mist flow in a heated horizontal tube was thoroughly studied by guo wang and gaddis etc guo et al 1999 in addition small droplets with the micron level diameter could facilitate the heat and mass transfer effectively yang et al 2014 2015 2016a 2016b this will also guarantee a fast and adequate evaporation for the mist spraying technology however few studies have been carried out to investigate the feasibility of applying the mist evaporation cooling technology to improve the loading capacity for reefers inside the cargo holds to address this under explored topic this study aims to answer the following technical questions 1 is it possible to lower the airflow rates in the cargo hold with the application of the mist spraying cooling system how much air supply can be reduced while the cooling effects remain the same 2 how much mist should be sprayed for each reefer what is the relationship between the mist spray rates and the cooling effects inside the cargo hold 3 what are the feasible flow rate combinations of airflow and mist are there any other combinations how to determine the optimal one 4 how many improvements in the loading capacity of cargo holds for reefers can be achieved to address the above issues a novel hybrid cooling system in which the existing air supplying system was reinforced with the water mist spraying for each reefer was proposed in this work thorough studies on the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system were conducted via both simulation and experimental tests to begin with the simulation study was carried out to predict the cooling performance and guide the design of the possible operating conditions of the system then numerous experimental runs were conducted to validate the simulation model furthermore the above results were adopted to a practical cargo hold and the method to figure out the potential flow rate combinations of mist and airflow was established this work verified the feasibility of applying the mist spraying cooling technology to improve the loading capacity of reefer ships and may generate significant economic benefits for container ship transportation 2 prototype of the experimental system to validate the cooling effects of the proposed system a novel experimental setup see fig 1 was built in the comprehensive laboratory of refrigerated containers in shanghai maritime university as shown in fig 1 apart from the conventional air supplying system a mist spraying system that mainly consist of the water supply the pressure pump the high pressure hose the nozzles and regulating valves was added to build up the hybrid system besides a mist and air handling system as well as a reefer controlling system was also included in the current study for handling the conditions of the fluids and the reefer these components were distributed in three different chambers fig 1 which can be introduced as follows the field test chamber chamber 1 is the most important part of the whole system in this chamber a standard 20 foot thermo king reefer was employed for the experimental tests and positioned at the middle of the test site a hot air machine with the heating power up to 10 kw was placed inside the reefer to simulate the cooling load generated by the goods such as fruits during the shipping the hybrid cooling system composed of air supplying system and the mist spraying system was equipped in the chamber with the vent directly facing the front face of the reefer at 70 cm meanwhile spray nozzles were installed evenly along the edge of the vent after being pressurized to 5 5 mpa by the pump the supplied water was atomized into numerous tiny mist droplets by the mist nozzles with the diameter around 150 μm according to the manufacture these droplets mixed well and flew together with the airstream towards the inlet of the reefer condenser with the help of a background air conditioning system and other auxiliary facilities such as the fan the duct the water pipe and valve chamber 2 was employed as the transit site to handle the air and water to the desired conditions meanwhile an intelligent electronic control system was set up in chamber 3 to realize the effective control of the hot air machine inside the reefer additionally the control system in chamber 3 was also taking charge of the start and stop of the reefer s refrigeration module and the initial temperatures inside chamber 1 and chamber 2 detailed operating process of the experiments can be seen in section 3 2 3 performance study of the hybrid system for single reefer as a first step simulation tests via the computational fluid dynamics cfd were conducted prior to the experimental study to guide the design of the system s operating conditions then experiments were carried out under the operating conditions predicted from the simulations within the test setup shown in fig 1 the simulation results were then compared with the experimental data to validate the model s reliability 3 1 simulation study 3 1 1 model prototype and meshing in this work the simulation model was built based on the practical experimental setup fig 2 in the ratio of 1 1 the geometric parameters of the reefer lab were 10 m in length 6 m in width and 3 5 m in height other parts of the model geometry were also strictly built based on the practical measurements or the manufacture data of the reefer once the model s geometry well built it was carefully meshed with the unstructured hexagonal grids as shown in fig 3 a in addition the mesh was further refined for the critical zones such as the space between the outlet of the duct and the inlet of the reefer s condenser where significant heat cooling process and mass mist evaporation transfer would occur 3 1 2 boundary conditions boundary conditions for the present simulation were set up as shown in table 1 fig 3 b according to the practical situation of the reefer lab where the experimental tests would be conducted as suggested by the operation manual of the reefer the cooling load produced by the hot air machine inside the reefer was set as 7 kw for present study airflow rates tested under different opening degrees of the control valve were employed in the simulation while the mist spray rates were ranging from 5 kg h 1 to 25 kg h 1 with the interval of 5 kg h 1 since the latent heat from the mist evaporation process takes up the predominant part of the cooling effects the influence of normal changes of water temperature can be negligible yuan et al 2009 in view of this the tap water from the municipal pipe with temperature around 28 c was adopted as the water source for the mist spraying system meanwhile the initial temperature inside the reefer lab was set as 43 c based on the study results of reference an et al 2008 and the diameter of mist droplets was set as 150 μm in the model in accordance with the nozzle manufacture since the wall of the reefer lab was well covered with the thermal insulation material it was set as adiabatic in present simulation 3 1 3 simulation model apparently with the mist involved in the airflow the current study belonged to the two phase flow and there exist some computational models for such problems e g the volume of fluid vof model and the discrete phase model dpm as to the present work the mist was dispersed in the air the continuous phase after being sprayed strong interaction between the gas phase and the droplets phase would occur such as the possible mist evaporation together with the heat and mass transfer between the mist and the airflow in addition as inferred from the operating conditions shown in table 1 the volume ratio of the mist to the airflow was smaller than 10 this indicates the mist was slightly loaded in the air and can be treated as the discrete phase ragab and wang 2012 owing to the above features the dpm model which tended to be more eligible bhattacharya et al 2009 was adopted in this paper simulation runs were performed under different flow rate combinations of airflow and mist table 1 to reveal the cooling effects of the hybrid system the simulation results will be presented in comparison with the experiment data as shown in section 4 3 2 experimental study a novel hybrid cooling system for reefers was constructed see fig 4 in this work extensive experimental tests were carried out to investigate the cooling performance of the hybrid system and compared with the simulation results 3 2 1 measuring instruments during the experimental runs various instruments were adopted to test the system conditions the major components and their specifications are list in table 2 among the tested parameters the airflow rates under different opening degrees of the fan valve were measured in advance with a hot wire anemometer according to reference caré et al 2014 four air temperature sensors were installed at the outlet of condenser vent to obtain the temperatures of the air exhausted from the reefer s condenser the ambient temperature and humidity inside the reefer lab were simultaneously measured via five rotronic probes model hc2 s distributed at the location shown in fig 1 in addition the temperature and humidity ratio of the supplied air were monitored while slight adjustments can be made by the background air conditioning system or the humidifiers equipped in chamber 2 the power of the reefer as well as the hot air machine installed inside can be adjusted by the controlling system in chamber 3 a pc based data acquisition system keithley 2700 7700 was adopted to record the tested data during the whole experimental process multiple tests were conducted for each operating condition and the average value was obtained for the result analysis 3 2 2 test conditions and procedures to validate the simulation model in section 3 1 experiments were carried out under the initial conditions same with the simulation runs see table 1 considering the required massive airflow rates up to 4200 m3 h 1 it can hardly make significant changes to airflow s temperature and humidity ratio therefore experimental runs were performed from 1 00 p m to 4 30 p m in the sunny days of late july when the outdoor conditions of the experimental site were stable and almost same to the designed operating conditions 35 c 20 g kg 1 dry air with the slight adjustments by the background heating or air conditioning system equipped in chamber 2 the desired inlet temperature and the humidity ratio for the air supplying system can be achieved in operation the basic procedure of the experiments was as follows beforehand the air supplying system and mist spraying system were adjusted to the initial conditions shown in table 1 with the background heating or air conditioning system in chamber 2 after this the heater in chamber 1 was turned on to warm up the ambient environment of the reefer lab and the door of reefer lab was closed to keep the lab isolated when the ambient temperature of the reefer lab reached 43 c turn off the ambient heater in chamber 1 and switch on the reefer s refrigeration system as soon as the temperature inside the reefer decreased to the design value switch on the hot air machine inside the reefer to simulate the cooling load from chilled goods just then switch on the hybrid cooling system i e turn on the air supplying and the mist spraying system to start the cooling process for the reefer s condenser finally the steady state was realized when the air temperature exhausted from the reefer s condenser and the thermal conditions inside the reefer lab remained constant and the experimental data was saved by the daq system for the upcoming results analysis after one experimental run was finished parameters of the airflow and water mist were reverted to the initial values with one parameter changed within table 1 for the next round of the experiments 3 3 performance indices to evaluate the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system three indicators namely the reefer s exhaust temperature the ambient temperature inside reefer lab and the loading capacity improvement were adopted in this work 3 3 1 reefer s exhaust temperature the exhaust air temperature from the reefer s condenser i e t a ex was directly determined by the cooling performance of the ventilation system besides with a lower air temperature exhausted from the reefer s condenser which indicates a lower running temperature for the condenser a better working condition can be realized for the reefer s refrigeration system therefore it was used as one of the performance indices 3 3 2 ambient temperature of reefer lab to evaluate the effects of the proposed hybrid cooling system in removing the heat from the ambient space the ambient thermal conditions inside the reefer lab which can be represented by the tested ambient temperatures ab t a amb was adopted as one of the performance indices apparently with the lower t a amb better cooling effects of the hybrid system will be achieved 3 3 3 loading capacity improvement of container ships to assess the benefits of the proposed hybrid cooling system in improving the loading capacity of the container ship for reefers the indicator loading capacity improvement ab lci is employed in present work it can be calculated as follows 1 l c i l c crnt l c prev l c prev 100 evidently with better cooling performance of the hybrid system less airflow would be required for each reefer to meet the cooling demand of the reefer s condensers thus more reefers can ideally be loaded in the container cargo holds without enlarging the existing ventilation system in addition the average absolute difference ab aad between the predicted values and the experimental results was employed in this work to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the simulation model under different conditions it was defined as eq 2 shows 2 a a d x 1 n i 1 n x expt x pred where x refers to the system performance indices such as ta ex and ta amb n stands for the number of the simulation or experimental tests under each condition 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between the experimental performance and the simulation results the predicted cooling performance of the hybrid system by the simulation model is compared with the experimental results in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a the predicted values of the reefer s exhaust temperature are in good agreement with the experimental finding with the clear majority of the results fall into a deviation range of 3 meanwhile with a maximum discrepancy less than 8 good accuracy was also realized in predicting the ambient temperature of the cargo hold fig 5 b therefore it can be concluded that the present simulation model is reliable to predict the cooling effects of the hybrid system on reefers 4 2 effect of flow rate combinations of airstream and mist 4 2 1 in terms of reefer s exhaust temperature fig 6 demonstrates the effects of mist spray rates on the reefer s exhaust temperature under different air supply rates the experimental value of the exhaust temperature obtained under the conventional operating condition namely v air sply 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist is employed as the baseline obviously applied with the mist spraying cooling technology the air exhaust temperature dropped remarkably furthermore the necessary air supply rate was found decreasing simultaneously as shown in fig 6 a this manifests that owing to the benefits of the mist evaporation process a great deal of airflow can be saved for each reefer to figure out how much air flow on earth can be reduced another two groups of experiments were conducted with the further decrease of the air supply rate namely v air sply 2850 m3 h 1 and v air sply 1950 m3 h 1 the results were displayed in fig 6 b and c respectively as shown in fig 6 b and c the reefer s exhaust air temperature was falling continuously with the mass growth of the sprayed mist in particular the exhaust air temperature became even lower than the baseline condition i e v air sply 4200 m3 h 1 without mist when the sprayed mist was about more than 5 kg h 1 in the case of v air sply 2850 m3 h 1 fig 6 b similar results can also be observed in the case of v air sply 1950 m3 h 1 as shown fig 6 c when mist flow rate was higher than 22 5 kg h 1 compared to the baseline condition the necessary air supply rate was reduced substantially from 4200 m3 h 1 to 1950 m3 h 1 with the reduction amplitude reached 53 57 as the consequence it seems to be highly possible and promising to increase the capacity of container ships for loading reefers with just minor reforms which can be realized via supplementing the mist cooling system inside the cargo hold with few changes in the air supplying system this will be validated and discussed in section 5 meanwhile with the growth of the mist spray rate the air exhaust temperature was dropping rapidly at the beginning and leveled off at the end the decreasing trends were well fitted as exponential with the r2 0 92 under experimental conditions see table 3 this manifests that significant cooling effect can be achieved when the mist spraying system was applied however with the further growth of the mist spray rate a continuing but weakening decrease trend of reefer s exhaust temperature was observed under all the operating conditions the reefer s exhaust temperature was lowered effectively with consuming a small amount of the mist which also contributed to the feasibility of the proposed hybrid system in the real ultra large container ships from another perspective of view the relationship shown in fig 6 also indicates that the mist spray rate can be designed within a reasonable range to achieve an optimal cooling effects this will be further discussed with a case study for the entire cargo hold in section 5 2 4 2 2 in terms of reefer lab s ambient temperature fig 7 illustrates the relationships between the mist spray rate and the ambient temperature inside the reefer s lab under various air supply rates the experimental ambient temperatures obtained under the baseline condition v air sply 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist was adopted for comparison as can be seen in fig 7 the ambient temperatures declined significantly which were well fit as exponential as shown in table 3 and much less air supply rate was required after applying the mist cooling technology for instance with the mist spray rate reached 5 kg h 1 the necessary air supply rate was reduced significantly from 4200 kg h 1 in the baseline condition to 3650 m3 h 1 as shown in fig 7 a when the mist spray rate kept increasing to 22 5 kg h 1 it was found that the necessary air supply rate fell dramatically to only 1950 m3 h 1 to achieve the same cooling effect all the relationships shown in fig 7 prove that the ambient temperature of the reefer lab can be lowered effectively with the application of the mist spraying system while the necessary air supply rate decreased remarkably at the same time it is noticed in fig 7 c that the predicted ambient temperature was somewhat higher than the experimental values the reason for this may be due to the slight difference on thermal property of the lab wall which was set adequate in simulation models but hardly to be fully achieved in experimental sites though it was well covered with thermal isolation materials however with the maximum deviation less than 8 the difference was negligible 4 2 3 in terms of ambient humidity fig 8 displays the humidity conditions represented by the relative humidity and the humidity ratio in the reefer lab as shown in fig 8 both the relative humidity and the corresponding humidity ratio were growing continuously in exponential trends as shown in table 4 with the rise of mist spray rate however the highest relative humidity and humidity ratio in present study was lower than 60 and 30 g kg 1 dry air respectively which is far from its saturation level and possible condensation problems can be avoided therefore it can be inferred that few issues on the undesired water condensation inside the cargo hold would arise after introducing the mist spraying system 5 validation of loading capacity improvement for reefer ship the results shown in section 4 confirmed that the application of mist spraying cooling can make a great contribution to lowering the exhaust air temperature and the ambient temperatures of the single reefer lab without raising risks of the excessive humidity or the undesired condensation however since the experiments were conducted on one reefer in the laboratory whereas there would be many reefers loaded in a practical cargo hold a validation study was performed as follows 5 1 validation background to validate the cooling effects of the proposed hybrid system for the reefer cargo hold the layout of a real cargo hold see fig 9 of a practical ultra large container ship designed by the china state shipbuilding corporation was employed as the study case as shown in fig 9 the cargo hold which consist of three bays and was symmetrical in the b b direction was 44 74 m long 43 48 m wide and 24 4 m high initially it was designed to load 453 of 40 foot standard containers among which only 150 containers were reefers due to the over sized ventilation ductworks and the corresponding space conflicts while 303 containers were non refrigerated evidently this led to a severe limitation to the ability of the container ship in carrying reefers to clarify the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system for the cargo hold a simulation model was built as displayed in fig 9 the model geometry and the meshing result is shown in fig 10 a and b respectively operating conditions that were potentially satisfying in the single reefer lab as investigated in section 4 3 were adopted here to validate their theoretical feasibility for the cargo hold 5 2 feasibility of the potential mist and air combinations for the cargo hold after clarifying the effects of the mist spray rate on the reefer s exhaust temperature in section 4 3 1 the operating conditions of the hybrid system that could achieve the same or better cooling effects with the baseline condition 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist were selected as the potential options for the cargo hold then their feasibility for cooling the whole cargo hold was verified at the end possible improvement of the ship s loading capacity was figured out 5 2 1 the potential design for cargo hold since the hot air exhausted from the reefer s condensers was heat source in the cargo hold the thermal conditions inside the cargo hold may be improved when the reefer s exhaust air temperature is equal to or lower than the temperature of the baseline condition 52 5 c in present study thus according to the results shown in section 4 3 nine operating conditions of air and mist flow rate were selected as the potential options these airflow mist flow rate combinations to be validated were 1950 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 3650 m3 h 1 5 kg h 1 3650 m3 h 1 10 kg h 1 3650 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 5 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 10 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 15 kg h 1 2900 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 2250 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 simulations were carried out under the above operating conditions to validate their cooling effects for the hold cargo while the initial ventilation design 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist was employed as the baseline the validation results can be shown and discussed as follows 5 2 2 validation for the cargo hold during the running process of the refrigerated containers it is suggested that the inlet temperature of the cooling air sucked by the reefer s condenser should be lower than 45 c this temperature requirement consequently was adopted as the criterion to verify the feasibility of the operating options for the cargo hold in the practical cargo hold reefers are usually placed one above another owing to this packed loading pattern and the buoyant effect of hot air the inlet temperature of cooling air for the upper reefers as well as the thermal condition at the top of the cargo hold can be significantly affected by the lower and the nearby reefers therefore feasibility of the potential operating conditions was carefully verified from different aspects of the cargo hold which can be introduced as follows a in terms of the air let temperature for the reefers table 5 summarizes the air inlet temperatures for all the 150 reefer condensers in the cargo hold under the aforementioned potential air and mist supply rate designs as shown in the table most of the cooling air s inlet temperatures except for the case 1950 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 were lower than 45 c which seems to meet the set criterion nevertheless with the low airflow rate for instance v air 1950 m3 h 1 the hot air cannot be circulated sufficiently and excessive heat may be accumulated in the cargo hold which could lead the inlet temperature of the upper reefers to be much higher the detailed thermal condition inside the cargo hold can be seen in the following section b thermal conditions inside the cargo hold during the laboratory research on the single reefer section 4 3 it was found that the reefer s exhaust temperatures under the operating conditions namely 1950 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 and 3650 m3 h 1 5 kg h 1 were almost same with the baseline condition 4200 m3 h 1 without spraying mist as a comparison their temperature distributions for the whole cargo hold were illustrated in figs 11 and12 three featured cross sections see fig 9 were selected to demonstrate the contours namely 1 the view perspective perpendicular to the front face of middle reefers cross section a a x 16750 mm 2 the view perpendicular to the middle reefers cross section b b z 11647 mm 3 the horizontal perspective crossing through the top exhaust vents of the cargo hold cross section c c y 24400 mm however considering the space limitation of the manuscript contours detail of air temperature distribution from the view of cross section a a can be found in the supplemental materials as shown in figs 11 and12 though similar exhaust temperature was achieved during the single reefer research their cooling effects for the cargo hold differed remarkably in particular the cooling effect shown in fig 11 c was apparently unfavorable even though the mean inlet air temperature for reefers was around 45 52 c the reason for this was due to effect of heat accumulation at the upper layers in the cargo hold as can displayed in fig 11 the hot air exhausted from the lower layer reefers flew upwards and led the massive hot air to accumulate at the upper position of the cargo hold with less fresh cooling air supplied a bigger amount of hot air from the lower reefers would be involved into the airflow supplied to the upper reefers resulting in the poor thermal conditions inside the cargo hold the different thermal conditions shown in fig 11 also manifests that spraying mist did help a lot in reducing the necessary air supply rates however it cannot completely replace the effects of airflow in other words there should be a balanced range during the design process of air supply rates and the mist spray rates this will be discussed in section 5 3 c effects of the mist spray rate on the inlet air temperatures for reefers in cargo hold fig 13 demonstrates the effects of the mist spray rate on the inlet temperatures of the air sucked by reefer condensers taking the air supply rate of 2900 m3 h 1 as the example as shown in fig 13 the air inlet temperatures the maximum value the minimum value and the facet average for the condensers decreased continuously with the increase of the mist flow rate when the mist flow rate was enhanced from 5 kg h 1 to 10 kg h 1 the mean intake temperature of the condensers dropped significantly by 0 76 c this proves that significant cooling effect can be realized by raising the mist flow rate at its lower level however with more mist sprayed weakening cooling effects were observed for instance with the further increase of mist flow rate from 15 kg h 1 to 25 kg h 1 temperature drop 0 2 c of the facet average value was limited as the consequence it can be inferred that there should exist an optimal design range of mist spray rate in which balance between the mist consumption rate and cooling performance can be achieved further discussion is conducted in section 5 2 d effects of air supply rates on the inlet air temperatures for reefers in cargo hold fig 14 shows the effects of the air supply rate on the air inlet temperatures for the reefer condensers in the cargo hold with the mist flow rate of 25 kg h 1 set as the example as can be seen in the figure the air temperatures for cooling the reefer s condensers decrease significantly with the growth of airflow rates in particular when the air supply rates increased from 1950 m3 h 1 to 2900 m3 h 1 a remarkable temperature drop 3 2 c of the cooling air that flows into the condensers was observed with the further increase of the air supply rate though the significant temperature drop of the cooling air can still be observed its decreasing trends became moderate however it should be noted that the enhanced air supply rate could also raise the electricity consumption and more space would be occupied by the enlarged ventilation system considering the cooling effects via spraying mist fig 13 or enhancing the air supply rates fig 14 it seems that there may exist an optimal operating range for the hybrid system to achieve the balance this will be further discussed in section 5 3 5 3 method for determining the mist and airflow rates range based on the study results shown in section 5 2 the effects of mist spray rate as well as the air supply rate on the maximum inlet temperature of the cooling air for reefer condensers can be regressed as eq 3 shows 3 t a inlet max 37 205 28 127 exp 0 010728 m mist 0 000492 v a supplied with r 2 0 930 the accuracy of eq 3 was validated with the experimental data as shown in table 6 the predicted values by eq 3 were found parallel to the tested results thus when different inlet temperatures of cooling air t a i max were set for the reefer condensers in present study the corresponding operating conditions of the proposed hybrid system can be obtained by eq 3 for instance if the maximum temperature of cooling air t a i max was set as 45 c and the maximum ability of the water supplying system was 25 kg h 1 for each reefer then the necessary design range of mist and airflow rates can be obtained as the green section shown in fig 15 a similarly if lower temperature of the cooling air t a i max was required for example 43 c the corresponding flow rate combinations of the mist and airflow would then fall into the green section displayed in fig 15 b with the same method the operating conditions of the proposed hybrid cooling system for other design targets can be easily determined in the present study the maximum temperature of the cooling air for each reefer s condenser was lower than 45 c efforts were made to achieve a balance between reducing the air supply rate and consumption of the water mist according to the practical water supplying ability of the container ship studied in this work which could provide 10 kg h 1 pressured water for each reefer the corresponding air supply rate was found to be only 2400 m3 h 1 via eq 3 as the result great capacity improvement of the container ships for loading reefers can be achieved this is to be discussed in the following section 5 4 potential improvement on the reefer loading capacity of the container ship within the optimal operating conditions i e 2400 m3 h 1 10 kg h 1 for each reefer obtained in section 5 3 the airflow rate was reduced dramatically from the original 4200 m3 h 1 to only 2400 m3 h 1 while the mist consumption 10 kg h 1 tends to be moderate and affordable for most of the reefer ships as the consequence much less energy would be cost by the blowers for supplying the fresh air into the cargo hold and the necessary space taken up by the bulky ventilation system can be reduced simultaneously from another point of view the loading capacity for reefers can be improved significantly without expanding the size of the existing air supplying system for the cargo hold studied in this paper see fig 9 the capacity of the air supplying system which was mainly limited by the space conflicting of the bulky ductwork and the excessive energy consumption by blowers was designed as 420 000 m3 h 1 for each hold in this condition the loading capacity in each cargo hold was set to be 100 reefers while the rest of the space was filled with the non refrigerated containers however after applying the proposed hybrid cooling system that added the mist spraying system the necessary air supply rate was reduced significantly to only 2400 m3 h 1 for each reefer as the consequence compared with the original 100 boxes the number of reefers that can be loaded inside each cargo hold is significantly raised to as many as 175 reefers in theory based on the same air supplying system this indicates that the loading capacity of the container ships for reefers could be dramatically improved considering the significantly improved capacity for loading extra reefers and minor build or reform costs of the system it can be inferred that enormous economic benefits will also be produced by the proposed hybrid cooling system for the container shipping industry detailed study on this issue should be carried out in the future work 6 conclusions in this work a novel hybrid cooling system that applied the mist spraying cooling system to the reefers cargo hold was proposed and its feasibility in improving the capacity of container ships to load reefers was carefully validated the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the cooling effects for the reefer condensers can be improved significantly with the application of the mist spraying technology in the present study case it was found that the air temperature exhausted from the reefer condenser was lowered from the original 52 5 c the baseline condition to only 47 4 c 3650 m3 h 1 25 kg h 1 with the temperature drop of 5 1 c 2 the airflow rates for cooling the reefers in the cargo hold can be reduced remarkably after applying the mist spraying technology in this work the necessary demand of airflow for each reefer decreased from the original volume of 4200 m3 h 1 to only 2400 m3 h 1 3 the loading capacity of the reefer ships can be enhanced dramatically with application of the mist spraying technology in the case study of current work the loading capacity was enhanced from 100 reefers to 175 reefers per cargo hold theoretically without enlarging the ventilation system 4 it is feasible and reliable to adopt the dpm model to simulate the cooling performance of the proposed hybrid system good agreement was achieved between the predicted performance and the experimental results with the maximum deviation less than 3 for reefer s exhaust temperature and 8 for the ambient temperature 5 a method for determining the operating conditions of the mist spray rates and air supply rates at different cooling demands was established instead of the scattered operating conditions a continuous design range of air supply rate and mist spray rate was obtained it should however be noted that the loading capacity improvement lci was figured out theoretically this should be further validated via thorough field tests in a real container ship in future work acknowledgement this work is financially supported by the fundamental research funds for the central universities

numerical simulation 1 introduction more recently there has been an increasing interest in parametric roll motion which is a common cause of ship capsizing and is one of the failure mode in the second generation of integrity stability bassler et al 2011 today s ship stability and safety are facing enormous challenges and this has put forward higher requirements for the ship design and technical specifications thus how to improve ship stability and safety has become an important issue bačkalov et al 2016 the multi scale method is often used to study the dynamic stability of parametric roll

soares 2013 however the traditional monte carlo method and the path integral method do not focus on the wave group height and the group length in view of the above research most researchers have little focus on influence of wave group on parametric roll parametric roll is the result of successive wave effect belenky et al 2011 so in the model test it is easy to simulate the parametric roll phenomenon under the regular wave but it is difficult to observe in the irregular wave the tests show that in long peak irregular waves the initial transient and the effective time of the waves are the key factors that can trigger the parameter roll19 20 which depends on the frequency composition of the random wave for more than one frequency of excitation at the same time embodies the group

determined by the wave height and period of the central wave anastopoulos and spyrou 2016 therefore the wave composition of stochastic waves is very important for parametric roll motion the group height factor g f h has more obvious effects on the mooring ship than the group length factor g l f ma et al 2011 in this paper the group height and the group length of the wave are controlled by two parameters gfh and glf and the random wave group is simulated by the wave envelope spectrum liu et al 2013 and then the influence of group height factor and group length factor on the parametric roll

wave spectrum δ ω n is interval frequency ω n is wave frequency ε n is random phase angles uniformly distributed in 0 2 π the waves with different groupiness have large differences in their envelope spectrums although the wave spectrum is the same therefore it is not enough to simulate the wave only with wave spectrum and another spectrum or parameter is needed to simulate the phase spectrum the wave envelope contains important information of the wave group the traditional method for the simulation of the envelope amplitude function is introduced by rice 1944 in this paper to specify the wave groups the group height factor and length factor are defined in terms of parameters of both wave and envelope spectral parameters the advantage of the approach is that for a given sea state the intensity of wave grouping phenomena is controlled by the parameters gfh and gfl of the empirical spectrum xu et al 1993 funke and mansard 1980 used the instantaneous wave energy process line siweh to simulate the phase spectrum but that just includes the group s height features g f h in this paper the wave envelope is used to describe the wave group the wave spectrum is used as the target spectrum

paper the hull lines is shown in fig 3 and the main parameters are shown in table 1 in order to study the effect of length factor and height factor on waves some conditions are simulated in this paper the course angle is 5 heading wave the speed of ship is 5kn h 1 3 4 m t 1 3 13s the results are shown in figs 4 6 7 9 10 in general the wave elevation has changed significantly when considering the wave length factor and the wave height factor from figs 5 7 with the same wave spectrum and g l f equals 13 5 while g f h increase the area of wave envelope spectrum increases the peak frequency unchanged the fluctuation of the wave elevation envelope becomes larger therefore the group height has a significant difference it demonstrates that the wave height factor controls the fluctuation of the wave envelope from figs 8 10 with the same g f h 0 8 while g l f increase the area of the wave envelope spectrum is basically the same as the peak frequency decreases the envelope of the wave elevation becomes flat that is the group length increase it concludes that the wave length factor controls the period of the wave envelope glf represents the sequence of high waves in the groups it can be seen that as expected although the wave simulated with the same spectrum through the two parameters g f h and g l f the wave elevation show different characteristics these factors represent the height characteristics and length characteristics of the wave group respectively it can be seen that the above simulation method is effective in addition in order to further study the influence of wave group on parametric roll a lot of numerical simulations and statistical analysis have been done such as the maximum roll angle and the standard deviation of roll angle the results are shown in fig 11 14 according to the results in figs 11 and 12 the differences between the black line original method and the red line or the blue line different glf are larger than the green line or the magenta line different gfh it can concludes that the wave group has an obvious effect on the parametric roll motion of ship in most cases the maximum value of the roll angle is very different from the original method at the meanwhile the differences between the red line and the blue line is larger than the green line and the magenta line therefore the differences becomes larger as the wave length factor increased while the glf changes than the wave height factor therefore it is supposed to be the parametric roll motion is very sensitive to wave group parameters glf and gfh especially wave length factor because of glf representing the periods of the waves and the sequence of high waves in the groups the parametric roll motion is much more sensitive to the wave length factor than the wave height factor besides although the maximum value varies greatly it may be larger than the original value or may be smaller than the original value because parametric roll is a resonant phenomenon although the wave factors greatly influenced the wave elevation there is a limit for this method that it can not describe the duration of the sequence of high waves moreover according to the previous studies parametric roll motion will occur when the natural period of roll is equal to approximately twice the wave encounter period the wave length is on the order of the ship length the wave height exceeds a critical level and the roll damping is low france et al 2003 as a result in random waves the sequence of waves that could trigger parametric roll in a few cycles would be worth concerned in wave elevation in the future it may focuses on the intelligent monitoring wave surface is very important for stability and safety of ships in some dangerous situations the crew can change the navigation strategy of the vessel in order to guarantee the ship safety 5 conclusion in this paper the 1dof differential equations of the parametric roll motion is established and the group height and the group length of the wave are controlled by two parameters g f h and g l f the random wave is simulated by the wave envelope spectrum on this basis the stochastic parametric excitation and forced random wave excitation are calculated then the parametric roll motion of the ship are simulated and the influence of wave group height factor and wave group length factor on the roll motion of ship are studied the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the parametric roll motion of ship is obviously changed when the ship under the wave group 2 the parametric roll motion of the ship is a slow generation process which is affected by the effective duration of the wave the group length factor has more obvious effects on parametric roll therefore when the ship sailing in the wave special attention should be paid to observe the continuous waves that may occur parametric roll motion in the present analysis there is a limit that this research method can not describe the duration of the sequence of high waves as a research for future study model test could be applied to study the effect of the wave group acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from

paper the hull lines is shown in fig 3 and the main parameters are shown in table 1 in order to study the effect of length factor and height factor on waves some conditions are simulated in this paper the course angle is 5 heading wave the speed of ship is 5kn h 1 3 4 m t 1 3 13s the results are shown in figs 4 6 7 9 10 in general the wave elevation has changed significantly when considering the wave length factor and the wave height factor from figs 5 7 with the same wave spectrum and g l f equals 13 5 while g f h increase the area of wave envelope spectrum increases the peak frequency unchanged the fluctuation of the wave elevation envelope becomes larger therefore the group height has a significant difference it demonstrates that the wave height factor controls the fluctuation of the wave envelope from figs 8 10 with the same g f h 0 8 while g l f increase the area of the wave envelope spectrum is basically the same as the peak frequency decreases the envelope of the wave elevation becomes flat that is the group length increase it concludes that the wave length factor controls the period of the wave envelope glf represents the sequence of high waves in the groups it can be seen that as expected although the wave simulated with the same spectrum through the two parameters g f h and g l f the wave elevation show different characteristics these factors represent the height characteristics and length characteristics of the wave group respectively it can be seen that the above simulation method is effective in addition in order to further study the influence of wave group on parametric roll a lot of numerical simulations and statistical analysis have been done such as the maximum roll angle and the standard deviation of roll angle the results are shown in fig 11 14 according to the results in figs 11 and 12 the differences between the black line original method and the red line or the blue line different glf are larger than the green line or the magenta line different gfh it can concludes that the wave group has an obvious effect on the parametric roll motion of ship in most cases the maximum value of the roll angle is very different from the original method at the meanwhile the differences between the red line and the blue line is larger than the green line and the magenta line therefore the differences becomes larger as the wave length factor increased while the glf changes than the wave height factor therefore it is supposed to be the parametric roll motion is very sensitive to wave group parameters glf and gfh especially wave length factor because of glf representing the periods of the waves and the sequence of high waves in the groups the parametric roll motion is much more sensitive to the wave length factor than the wave height factor besides although the maximum value varies greatly it may be larger than the original value or may be smaller than the original value because parametric roll is a resonant phenomenon although the wave factors greatly influenced the wave elevation there is a limit for this method that it can not describe the duration of the sequence of high waves moreover according to the previous studies parametric roll motion will occur when the natural period of roll is equal to approximately twice the wave encounter period the wave length is on the order of the ship length the wave height exceeds a critical level and the roll damping is low france et al 2003 as a result in random waves the sequence of waves that could trigger parametric roll in a few cycles would be worth concerned in wave elevation in the future it may focuses on the intelligent monitoring wave surface is very important for stability and safety of ships in some dangerous situations the crew can change the navigation strategy of the vessel in order to guarantee the ship safety 5 conclusion in this paper the 1dof differential equations of the parametric roll motion is established and the group height and the group length of the wave are controlled by two parameters g f h and g l f the random wave is simulated by the wave envelope spectrum on this basis the stochastic parametric excitation and forced random wave excitation are calculated then the parametric roll motion of the ship are simulated and the influence of wave group height factor and wave group length factor on the roll motion of ship are studied the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 the parametric roll motion of ship is obviously changed when the ship under the wave group 2 the parametric roll motion of the ship is a slow generation process which is affected by the effective duration of the wave the group length factor has more obvious effects on parametric roll therefore when the ship sailing in the wave special attention should be paid to observe the continuous waves that may occur parametric roll motion in the present analysis there is a limit that this research method can not describe the duration of the sequence of high waves as a research for future study model test could be applied to study the effect of the wave group acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from

23252,local scour around pile foundations is a major factor affecting the foundation stability in ocean engineering a series of experiments has been conducted to study the time development of scour around pile groups under the unidirectional and tidal currents 49 cylindrical model piles were arranged in a typical dumbbell shaped configuration and 20 micro cameras as well as a 3d laser scanner were used to capture the local scour topography in the unidirectional current test the scour pit was spoon shaped and the maximum scour depth was located in the central part of upstream pile group in the tidal tests two similar shallow scour pits existed in the upstream and downstream pile group during the initial stage of tide induced local scour the increase of scour depth was similar to that under unidirectional current but the repetitive scour and backfill process led to obvious fluctuations of scour depth especially for the piles at the rear of upstream pile group and in the front of downstream pile group it was found that the tidal cycle number had obvious effect on the scour depth development the final scour depth after sufficient tidal cycles could reach up to 77 1 of the maximum scour depth under unidirectional current keywords unidirectional current tidal current local scour pile group camera monitoring laser scanner 1 introduction piles are commonly used as the foundations of marine structures such as sea crossing bridges and offshore platforms in ocean environment the stability of pile foundation is mainly threatened by the phenomenon of local scour local scour around a single pile which is caused by the downflow in pile front along with horseshoe vortex shedding in the lee wake has attracted numerous attentions in the last decades for the pile group the development of local scour becomes quite complicated sumer and fredsøe 2002 pointed out that due to the flow interference between adjacent piles the scour around pile group obviously differed from that occurring around a single pile exposed to continuous water flow two kinds of scour will take place around the pile group one is local scour around each individual pile and the other is global scour around the whole pile group in the form of a bowl shaped depression to assess the effect of pile arrangements on the scour depth some studies have been conducted by hannah 1978 breusers 1972 salim and jones 1996 and sumer et al 2005 richardson and davis 2001 modified the empirical formula for a single pile to predict the scour depth around pile group the effects of other factors such as pile diameter spacing submergence ratio flow rate and skew angle were studied by ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 amini et al 2012 and lança et al 2013 successful application of gmdh group method of data handing has been introduced in the works of najafzadeh and barani 2011 najafzadeh and azamathulla 2013 najafzadeh 2015 and najafzadeh et al 2016 it was found that gmdh showed more accurate prediction than traditional equations recently solaimani et al 2017 studied the local scour around pile group by experimentally investigating the effect of the various pile spacing on the bed formation area and volume of the scour pit previous studies focused mainly on some simple pile arrangements mostly in matrix configurations and unidirectional current conditions moreover some studies on local scour around a single pile under tidal current have been performed escarameia and may 1999 found that the scour depth under a square tide velocity was equal and opposite for each half cycle was smaller than that under unidirectional current due to the backfilling of the scour hole during flow reversals which was opposite to the works by jensen et al 2006 and margheritini et al 2006 but supported by mcgovern et al 2014 porter et al 2014 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the scour characteristics around a circular pile under unidirectional current a square tide and a spring neap tide respectively it was found that the scour depth under a spring neap tidal cycle was considerably less than that under the unidirectional current in fact the pile foundations for the sea crossing bridges are usually arranged in complex configurations typically dumbbell shaped and the piles are often subjected to strong tidal currents in ocean environments so far the influences of complex configurations and tidal currents have not been well understood the objective of this study is to provide an insight of the characteristics of local scour around a typical dumbbell shaped pile group under unidirectional and tidal currents based on a series of experimental studies 2 laboratory tests 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in a pool 50 0 m in length 30 0 m in width and 1 0 m in height at zhejiang university the pool is equipped with nine parallel electric pumps and two honeycomb matrices to ensure a uniform flow into the middle test section as shown in fig 1 a sand basin 6 0 m 4 0 m 0 3 m was built in the middle of the pool two ramps with plexiglass plates were constructed on the upstream and downstream sides of the sand basin the model piles were scaled down from a sea crossing bridge in china with a scaling factor of 1 40 the model pile group consisted of 49 plexiglass circular piles with the diameter d 7 0 cm and the spacing ratio l d 2 37 l is the center to center distance between adjacent piles all the piles were embedded vertically in the sand basin and fixed on the bottom in fig 1 c the model piles in the upstream middle and downstream of the pile group were labeled using symbols u m and d plus a number respectively twenty micro cameras were installed inside specific model piles to monitor the development of scour depth surrounding these piles fujian sand a standard sand in china with a median diameter d 50 0 16 mm and density ρ 2 65 g cm3 was used in the experiment the sand coarseness d d 50 437 5 far exceeded the critical value of 50 suggested by ettema 1980 and thus it was believed that the local scour around each individual pile was independent of the sediment diameter d 50 2 2 test conditions the test conditions for the scour around pile group in unidirectional and tidal currents were summarized in table 1 the water depth h was kept 30 cm above the sediment surface the ratio h d 4 29 was larger than the critical value of 2 6 proposed by melville and sutherland 1988 and thus the free water surface was expected to have little effect on the scour development the flow velocity at the water surface was measured to be 0 34 m s the sand ripples in fig 2 illustrated the live bed condition under this flow velocity as shown in fig 3 the tidal current was simplified to a series of flow reversals the velocity magnitude was the same to that in the unidirectional test while the velocity direction was reversed periodically the model pile group was scaled with a factor of 1 40 according to the froude s law the time scale ratio between the prototype and the model was t p t m 40 t p and t m were the time for the prototype and model respectively tidal periods t1 2 h and t2 4 h in the tidal tests were 12 h and 24 h in the prototype corresponding to semi diurnal tide and diurnal tide respectively the durations in all tests for pile group were 112 h for comparisons the scour development around a single pile in the unidirectional current was also studied this single pile test was carried out in a water flume of 69 0 m in length 1 2 m in width and 1 6 m in height the diameter of the single pile was 0 11 m the water depth was 0 5 m and the flow velocity at the water surface was 0 321 m s hancu 1971 breusers et al 1977 ettema 1980 chiew 1984 melville and sutherland 1988 sheppard et al 1995 have pointed out that the normalized scour depth s d s is scour depth around a single pile is a function of water depth h d flow intensity u u c u c is the critical velocity and sediment coarseness d d 50 for the pile group according to amini et al 2012 and lança et al 2013 the normalized scour depth is dominated by many parameters such as h d u u c ud 50 v d d 50 r d α v r α are kinematic viscosity pile spacing and group skew angle respectively as shown in table 1 three respective tests for the pile group were conducted in all the three tests the configuration of the pile group and the test conditions water depth flow velocity sediment median diameter kept the same for all the three tests the froude number is f r u g h 0 19 g is the gravitational acceleration and the reynolds number is re u d v 3 3 10 4 the water depth h d and flow velocity u u c in the cases of the single pile and the pile group were almost the same another factor affecting the scour characteristics around the pile group was the regular changeable flow directions in tidal tests and the effect of this difference on the scour depth would be analyzed in section 3 and section 4 2 3 method for the measurement of local scour 2 3 1 scour depth around an individual pile as shown in fig 4 the scour development surrounding each individual pile was recorded by a micro camera installed inside the pile the camera was vertically mounted aligning with the pile center before the test the calibration was performed with a black and white striped paper which was attached to the surface of the model pile fig 5 each black white edge on the calibration paper could be viewed from inside of the model pile as a circle and its center was coincided with the pile center a function was established to link the circle radius with the corresponding vertical length in the calibration paper more details of the calibration procedure were presented by brink 2014 fig 5 d gives an example of the established function for the circle radius r and the normalized vertical length s d in the case of the single pile 2 3 2 final bed topography the laser scanner faro laser scanner focus3d x330 was used to obtain the three dimensional bed topography near the piles the simple layout of the laser scanner was shown in fig 6 four scan reference spheres were positioned at the four corners of the sand basin to calibrate the section dimensions and the center point to minimize the shield effect of adjacent piles the sand bed was scanned from eight directions and eventually all the data were assembled into one whole bed topography 3 results and interpretations 3 1 unidirectional current tests 3 1 1 single pile fig 7 a g show the camera images for the scour development surrounding the single pile at different time instants the border between the sand and the transparent pile is marked by a red line which could then be converted to the non dimensional scour depth s d in fig 7 h based on the proposed function in fig 6 d fig 8 a shows the temporal variation of scour depth at four directions while fig 8 b shows the maximum and minimum scour depth around the pile the local scour initiates in front of the single pile and gradually propagates along the pile circumference the sediment is gradually deposited and washed away in the rear wake of the pile this scour process around the pile occurs quite fast for the live bed condition the scour depth increases rapidly at the early stage within approximately 2 h and then the increasing rate slows down when the scour pit was extended to the edge of the sand basin the test was stopped and the final local scour pit was shown in fig 9 the final scour depths at four directions around the single pile are also manually measured and used to compare with the data through camera monitoring it should be noted that the final scour depth corresponds to the depth when the tests were stopped this depth is different from the equilibrium scour depth when the scour process reaches its equilibrium state table 2 lists the relative errors maximum 2 9 of the final non dimensional scour depth s d this validates the accuracy of the proposed camera monitoring method 3 1 2 pile group 3 1 2 1 final bed topography fig 10 shows a photo of the bed topography at the end of the unidirectional test uni 0 it can be seen that there exist two scour types which are similar to those observed by sumer and fredsøe 2002 one is the local scour around each individual pile i e a small scour pit around each pile the other one is the global scour around the whole model which is the large scour pit around the upstream pile group fig 11 shows the 3d topography of the sand bed in the unidirectional test uni 0 it can be seen that the bed topography is approximately symmetrical about the flow direction displaying a spoon shaped profile with a large scour pit among the upstream pile group the maximum scour depth is about 0 239 m 3 41d which is located in the central part of the upstream pile group due to the shelter effect of upstream pile group the flow velocity and turbulent intensity downstream are weak resulting in low bed shear stress and weak sand transport capacity therefore the global scour pit of the downstream pile group is much smaller than that of the upstream pile group furthermore it can be observed that the sand is deposited at the rear of the whole model and forms an obvious u shaped sand dune the maximum height of the sand dune is about 0 231 m 3 38d located at the rear zone of the downstream pile group and this height is close to the maximum scour depth of entire pile group fig 12 shows the maximum and minimum scour depths around the individual piles obtained from the camera monitoring for the upstream pile group pile u 1 to u 24 the scour phenomenon appears to be severe the maximum scour depth is 0 250 m 3 57d which is located at the edge of pile u 10 the discrepancy between the maximum scour depth 3 57d in fig 12 and that obtained by the laser scanning 3 41d in fig 11 is 4 7 for the downstream pile group piles d 26 to d 49 the scour depth for each pile is relatively small and decreases along the flow direction especially sand deposition rather than scour is observed around the rear pile d 49 3 1 2 2 temporal variations of scour depth around individual piles fig 13 shows the temporal variations of the maximum scour depths for the piles with cameras inside due to the migration of the sand ripples considerable fluctuations of the scour depths for some piles are observed for the upstream pile group in fig 13 a and b the temporal variation of scour depth around each pile displays a similar pattern where the scour depth increases rapidly at the early stage and then progressively develops at a much slower rate for individual piles located at different positions in the upstream pile group the scour depth around each pile is different local scour first exists around the frontal piles u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 and u 6 followed by the middle piles u 10 u 11 u 13 u 15 and u 16 and finally the rear piles u 21 u 23 and u 24 in the meanwhile the scour rate at the early stage is rapid for the frontal piles and relatively slow for the rear piles however at the end of the test the scour depths around the middle piles u 10 u 13 and u 15 are the largest and the scour depths around the rear piles u 21 u 23 and u 24 are the smallest as shown in fig 13 c the temporal variations of scour depths for the downstream pile group show similar patterns where the sand around each pile appears to be deposited at the early stage and then is washed away it could also be observed that the scour depths for the downstream pile group are smaller than those for the upstream pile group during the entire scour process 3 2 tidal tests 3 2 1 final bed topography figs 14 and 15 show the three dimensional topographies of the sand bed in tidal current conditions tide 1 and tide 2 respectively it is shown that the bed topography in the tidal tests is significantly different from that in the unidirectional test which is attributed to the effect of the continuous change of flow direction there are two similar shallow scour pits existing among the upstream and downstream pile group the maximum scour depths in the two tidal tests are different which are about 2 69d 0 188 m for tide 1 and 2 27d 0 159 m for tide 2 respectively figs 16 and 17 show the maximum and minimum scour depths around individual piles for the tidal tests tide 1 and tide 2 respectively in the case of tide 1 the maximum scour depth is 2 63d located around pile u 10 while in the case of tide 2 it is 2 39d near pile u 40 which is relatively smaller than that in tide 1 the difference of the maximum and minimum scour depths is the largest for the piles u 24 and d 26 the piles u 24 and d 26 as shown in figs 14 and 15 both lie in the slopes of the scour pits in the upstream and downstream 3 2 2 temporal variations of scour depth around individual piles figs 18 and 19 show the temporal variations of scour depths in tidal tests it is noted that in the first few cycles the scour depth of each pile increases rapidly especially for the piles u 1 u 6 u 10 u 13 u 15 d 35 d 38 d 40 d 46 and d 49 then the scour depth exhibits a creeping development until reaching an equilibrium value in the end the maximum scour depths appear to be near the piles u 10 u 13 u 15 d 35 d 38 and d 40 it is shown in figs 18 and 19 that all the curves show obvious fluctuations with time where the largest fluctuations are observed around the piles u 21 u 24 d 26 and d 31 and the smallest fluctuations are near the piles u 1 u 6 d 46 and d 49 this is significantly different from the migration of sand ripples in the unidirectional test uni 0 and mainly attributed to the tide induced scour and backfill process in the first half cycle with positive flow direction the scour characteristics around each pile is similar to those in the unidirectional test because of the same flow condition in the second half cycle with negative flow direction the downstream pile group is directly subjected to the current and the scour depth around each downstream pile increases rapidly at the same time the scour depth around each upstream pile decreases with the sand backfill into the local scour pit this kind of scour and backfill process will be repeated throughout the following tidal cycles 4 discussions in this section the time development of maximum scour depth around a single pile has been firstly studied and then considering the effect of pile group the maximum scour depth of representative pile under unidirectional and tidal currents are compared with each other this section aims to investigate and build up the relationship for the scour depths under different current conditions 4 1 unidirectional current tests fig 20 shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour depth for a single pile as suggested by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the dimensionless time t is defined as 1 t g s 1 d 50 3 d 2 t where t is the test duration and s is the specific gravity of sand to predict the variation of scour depth around a pile in the unidirectional current both the exponential function eq 2 by sumer and fredsøe 2002 and four parameter function eq 3 by sheppard et al 2004 are used 2 s s 1 exp t t 0 3 s a 1 exp b t c 1 exp d t where s is the equilibrium scour depth t 0 is the time scale a b c and d are the coefficients all the test data were fitted based on the non linear least square method as shown in fig 20 the four parameter function eq 3 fits the experimental data better the equilibrium scour depth derived from eq 3 is 2 08d when t 420 or t 173 h while at the end of the test the maximum scour depth obtained from the camera video is 1 76d reaching 84 6 of the equilibrium scour depth in the unidirectional current the main scour pit is located among the upstream pile group as shown in fig 21 four representative variations of scour depths around piles u 1 u 10 u 15 and u 24 are selected for the illustration of scour depths around pile group as shown in fig 1 these four piles are in the symmetric line and at the front middle and rear of the upstream pile group the scour curves of the four piles show similar characteristics and the maximum scour depth is much larger than that for a single pile fig 22 gives the fitting curves of the data for the four piles it can be observed that eq 3 fits the data better than eq 2 the predicted scour depth for the four piles at the end of the test based on eq 3 is shown in table 3 and the maximum error is up to 4 5 4 2 tidal tests as shown in fig 23 all the experimental data in tidal tests are presented and the blue dots maximum of scour depth fluctuations are fitted well by eq 3 to estimate the scour development with time for the tidal tests the final scour depths of tests tide 1 and tide 2 in table 4 are about 73 6 and 66 9 of the scour depth in the unidirectional test respectively fig 24 shows the temporal variation of the scour ratio s d t i d e pr e d i c t e d s d u n i pr e d i c t e d which is the ratio of the fitting curves for the tidal tests to the fitting curves for the unidirectional test in fig 23 table 4 gives the final ratios 77 1 for tide 1 and 69 8 for tide 2 at the end of the tests moreover equilibrium scour depth of each test extrapolated from eq 3 is shown in table 5 it is found that the final scour depths of the unidirectional test and tidal test tide 2 almost reaches their equilibrium depths while the final scour depth of tide 1 is 84 1 of its equilibrium depth given sufficient test duration the equilibrium scour depth in unidirectional test is 3 45d which is relatively larger than those in tide 1 2 90d and tide 2 2 39d this could be attributed to the sand backfilling in tidal tests the equilibrium scour depth 2 90d of tide 1 is larger than that 2 39d of tide 2 which is mainly due to different tidal periods it is also noted that in table 5 the final scour depth of tide 1 is a little bigger than that of tide 2 with the same test duration the positive or negative flow time for the two tidal tests is the same and the only difference is that the tidal period of tide 1 t1 2 h is half of tide 2 t2 4 h so the tidal cycle number of tide 1 is twice that of tide 2 thus it may be concluded that doubled tidal cycle number in tide 1 with respect to tide 2 leads to small difference in the scour depths of the two tidal tests fig 25 gives the comparison of the maximum scour depths for each selected pile in tidal tests it can be noted that for the same cycle numbers n 28 namely t 56 h for tide 1 and t 112 h for tide 2 there is no significant difference between their final maximum scour depth 2 31d for tide 1 versus 2 39d for tide 2 in fig 25 however with the same test duration t 112 h for both tide 1 and tide 2 in fig 25 the maximum scour depth of each pile in tide 1 is obviously larger than that in tide 2 besides the total tidal cycle numbers for tide 1 and tide 2 are n 28 and n 56 respectively it is observed in fig 23 that the tidal scour depths increase slowly since t 240 t 40 h and simultaneously the cycle numbers for tide 1 and tide 2 are n 20 and n 10 respectively thus to better illustrate the effect of tidal cycle number fig 26 shows the variation of the maximum scour depth with tidal cycle number n 20 28 in the two tidal tests with the same tidal cycle number the scour depth in tide 2 is larger than that in tide 1 while in figs 24 and 25 with the same test duration the scour depth in tide 1 is bigger than that in tide 2 thus with the same tidal cycle number the scour depth in tide 2 is larger than that in tide 1 with the increase of tidal cycle number until reaching the same test duration the difference of scour depth in the two tidal tests becomes decreased 5 conclusions a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate the time development of local scour around a typical dumbbell shaped pile group in tidal currents twenty micro cameras were placed inside specific piles to monitor the scour development with time around these piles and a laser scanner was used to obtain the final bed topography based on the test data the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 for the unidirectional test the sand bed shows a spoon shaped profile with a large scour pit around the upstream pile group and a u shaped sand dune in the lee wake region the maximum scour depth is located in the central part of the upstream pile group compared to the unidirectional test two similar shallow scour pits are developed around the upstream and downstream pile groups in the tidal tests and the maximum scour depth is located in the central part of each pile group 2 the maximum scour depth in the unidirectional test 3 57d is found to be obvious larger than those in the tidal tests 2 63d for the tidal test tide 1 and 2 39d for the tidal test tide 2 this is due to the longer time for the one direction flow in the unidirectional test than those in the tidal tests however regardless of the test duration the equilibrium scour depth 3 45d in unidirectional test is still larger than those in the tidal tests 2 90d for the tidal test tide 1 and 2 39d for the tidal test tide 2 and this could be attributed to the sand backfilling in the tidal tests 3 in the tidal tests the fluctuations of the scour depths around the piles are significantly different with the variation of pile position largest fluctuations are observed to be around the rear piles of the upstream pile group and the frontal piles of the downstream pile group while smallest fluctuations exist near the frontal piles of the upstream pile group and rear piles of the downstream pile group these are associated to their corresponding scour and backfill processes 4 based on two tidal tests with identical flow velocity but different tidal periods it is found that with the increase of tidal cycle number until reaching the same test duration the difference of scour depth in the two tidal tests becomes decreased acknowledgement the

scour around the whole pile group in the form of a bowl shaped depression to assess the effect of pile arrangements on the scour depth some studies have been conducted by hannah 1978 breusers 1972 salim and jones 1996 and sumer et al 2005 richardson and davis 2001 modified the empirical formula for a single pile to predict the scour depth around pile group the effects of other factors such as pile diameter spacing submergence ratio flow rate and skew angle were studied by ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 amini et al 2012 and lança et al 2013 successful application of gmdh group method of data handing has been introduced in the works of najafzadeh and barani 2011 najafzadeh and azamathulla 2013 najafzadeh 2015 and najafzadeh et al 2016 it was found that gmdh showed more accurate prediction than traditional equations recently solaimani et al 2017 studied the local scour around pile group by experimentally investigating the effect of the various pile spacing on the bed formation area and volume of the scour pit previous studies focused mainly on some simple pile arrangements mostly in matrix configurations and unidirectional current conditions moreover some studies on local scour around a single pile under tidal current have been performed escarameia and may 1999 found that the scour depth under a square tide velocity was equal and opposite for each half cycle was smaller than that under unidirectional current due to the backfilling of the scour hole during flow reversals which was opposite to the works by jensen et al 2006 and margheritini et al 2006 but supported by mcgovern et al 2014 porter et al 2014 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the scour characteristics around a circular pile under unidirectional current a square tide and a spring neap tide respectively it was found that the scour depth under a spring neap tidal cycle was considerably less than that under the unidirectional current in fact the pile foundations for the sea crossing bridges are usually arranged in complex configurations typically dumbbell shaped and the piles are often subjected to strong tidal currents in ocean environments so far the influences of complex configurations and tidal currents have not been well understood the objective of this study is to provide an insight of the characteristics of local scour around a typical dumbbell shaped pile group under unidirectional and tidal currents based on a series of experimental studies 2 laboratory tests 2 1 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in a pool 50 0 m in length 30 0 m in width and 1 0 m in height at zhejiang university the pool is equipped with nine parallel electric pumps and two honeycomb matrices to ensure a uniform flow into the middle test section as shown in fig 1 a sand basin 6 0 m 4 0 m 0 3 m was built in the middle of the pool two ramps with plexiglass plates were constructed on the upstream and downstream sides of the sand basin the model piles were scaled down from a sea crossing bridge in china with a scaling factor of 1 40 the model pile group consisted of 49 plexiglass circular piles with the diameter d 7 0 cm and the spacing ratio l d 2 37 l is the center to center distance between adjacent piles all the piles were embedded vertically in the sand basin and fixed on the bottom in fig 1 c the model piles in the upstream middle and downstream of the pile group were labeled using symbols u m and d plus a number respectively twenty micro cameras were installed inside specific model piles to monitor the development of scour depth surrounding these piles fujian sand a standard sand in china with a median diameter d 50 0 16 mm and density ρ 2 65 g cm3 was used in the experiment the sand coarseness d d 50 437 5 far exceeded the critical value of 50 suggested by ettema 1980 and thus it was believed that the local scour around each individual pile was independent of the sediment diameter d 50 2 2 test conditions the test conditions for the scour around pile group in unidirectional and tidal currents were summarized in table 1 the water depth h was kept 30 cm above the sediment surface the ratio h d 4 29 was larger than the critical value of 2 6 proposed by melville and sutherland 1988 and thus the free water surface was expected to have little effect on the scour development the flow velocity at the water surface was measured to be 0 34 m s the sand ripples in fig 2 illustrated the live bed condition under this flow velocity as shown in fig 3 the tidal current was simplified to a series of flow reversals the velocity magnitude was the same to that in the unidirectional test while the velocity direction was reversed periodically the model pile group was scaled with a factor of 1 40 according to the froude s law the time scale ratio between the prototype and the model was t p t m 40 t p and t m were the time for the prototype and model respectively tidal periods t1 2 h and t2 4 h in the tidal tests were 12 h and 24 h in the prototype corresponding to semi diurnal tide and diurnal tide respectively the durations in all tests for pile group were 112 h for comparisons the scour development around a single pile in the unidirectional current was also studied this single pile test was carried out in a water flume of 69 0 m in length 1 2 m in width and 1 6 m in height the diameter of the single pile was 0 11 m the water depth was 0 5 m and the flow velocity at the water surface was 0 321 m s hancu 1971 breusers et al 1977 ettema 1980 chiew 1984 melville and sutherland 1988 sheppard et al 1995 have pointed out that the normalized scour depth s d s is scour depth around a single pile is a function of water depth h d flow intensity u u c u c is the critical velocity and sediment coarseness d d 50 for the pile group according to amini et al 2012 and lança et al 2013 the normalized scour depth is dominated by many parameters such as h d u u c ud 50 v d d 50 r d α v r α are kinematic viscosity pile spacing and group skew angle respectively as shown in table 1 three respective tests for the pile group were conducted in all the three tests the configuration of the pile group and the test conditions water depth flow velocity sediment median diameter kept the same for all the three tests the froude number is f r u g h 0 19 g is the gravitational acceleration and the reynolds number is re u d v 3 3 10 4 the water depth h d and flow velocity u u c in the cases of the single pile and the pile group were almost the same another factor affecting the scour characteristics around the pile group was the regular changeable flow directions in tidal tests and the effect of this difference on the scour depth would be analyzed in section 3 and section 4 2 3 method for the measurement of local scour 2 3 1 scour depth around an individual pile as shown in fig 4 the scour development surrounding each individual pile was recorded by a micro camera installed inside the pile the camera was vertically mounted aligning with the pile center before the test the calibration was performed with a black and white striped paper which was attached to the surface of the model pile fig 5 each black white edge on the calibration paper could be viewed from inside of the model pile as a circle and its center was coincided with the pile center a function was established to link the circle radius with the corresponding vertical length in the calibration paper more details of the calibration procedure were presented by brink 2014 fig 5 d gives an example of the established function for the circle radius r and the normalized vertical length s d in the case of the single pile 2 3 2 final bed topography the laser scanner faro laser scanner focus3d x330 was used to obtain the three dimensional bed topography near the piles the simple layout of the laser scanner was shown in fig 6 four scan reference spheres were positioned at the four corners of the sand basin to calibrate the section dimensions and the center point to minimize the shield effect of adjacent piles the sand bed was scanned from eight directions and eventually all the data were assembled into one whole bed topography 3 results and interpretations 3 1 unidirectional current tests 3 1 1 single pile fig 7 a g show the camera images for the scour development surrounding the single pile at different time instants the border between the sand and the transparent pile is marked by a red line which could then be converted to the non dimensional scour depth s d in fig 7 h based on the proposed function in fig 6 d fig 8 a shows the temporal variation of scour depth at four directions while fig 8 b shows the maximum and minimum scour depth around the pile the local scour initiates in front of the single pile and gradually propagates along the pile circumference the sediment is gradually deposited and washed away in the rear wake of the pile this scour process around the pile occurs quite fast for the live bed condition the scour depth increases rapidly at the early stage within approximately 2 h and then the increasing rate slows down when the scour pit was extended to the edge of the sand basin the test was stopped and the final local scour pit was shown in fig 9 the final scour depths at four directions around the single pile are also manually measured and used to compare with the data through camera monitoring it should be noted that the final scour depth corresponds to the depth when the tests were stopped this depth is different from the equilibrium scour depth when the scour process reaches its equilibrium state table 2 lists the relative errors maximum 2 9 of the final non dimensional scour depth s d this validates the accuracy of the proposed camera monitoring method 3 1 2 pile group 3 1 2 1 final bed topography fig 10 shows a photo of the bed topography at the end of the unidirectional test uni 0 it can be seen that there exist two scour types which are similar to those observed by sumer and fredsøe 2002 one is the local scour around each individual pile i e a small scour pit around each pile the other one is the global scour around the whole model which is the large scour pit around the upstream pile group fig 11 shows the 3d topography of the sand bed in the unidirectional test uni 0 it can be seen that the bed topography is approximately symmetrical about the flow direction displaying a spoon shaped profile with a large scour pit among the upstream pile group the maximum scour depth is about 0 239 m 3 41d which is located in the central part of the upstream pile group due to the shelter effect of upstream pile group the flow velocity and turbulent intensity downstream are weak resulting in low bed shear stress and weak sand transport capacity therefore the global scour pit of the downstream pile group is much smaller than that of the upstream pile group furthermore it can be observed that the sand is deposited at the rear of the whole model and forms an obvious u shaped sand dune the maximum height of the sand dune is about 0 231 m 3 38d located at the rear zone of the downstream pile group and this height is close to the maximum scour depth of entire pile group fig 12 shows the maximum and minimum scour depths around the individual piles obtained from the camera monitoring for the upstream pile group pile u 1 to u 24 the scour phenomenon appears to be severe the maximum scour depth is 0 250 m 3 57d which is located at the edge of pile u 10 the discrepancy between the maximum scour depth 3 57d in fig 12 and that obtained by the laser scanning 3 41d in fig 11 is 4 7 for the downstream pile group piles d 26 to d 49 the scour depth for each pile is relatively small and decreases along the flow direction especially sand deposition rather than scour is observed around the rear pile d 49 3 1 2 2 temporal variations of scour depth around individual piles fig 13 shows the temporal variations of the maximum scour depths for the piles with cameras inside due to the migration of the sand ripples considerable fluctuations of the scour depths for some piles are observed for the upstream pile group in fig 13 a and b the temporal variation of scour depth around each pile displays a similar pattern where the scour depth increases rapidly at the early stage and then progressively develops at a much slower rate for individual piles located at different positions in the upstream pile group the scour depth around each pile is different local scour first exists around the frontal piles u 1 u 2 u 3 u 4 and u 6 followed by the middle piles u 10 u 11 u 13 u 15 and u 16 and finally the rear piles u 21 u 23 and u 24 in the meanwhile the scour rate at the early stage is rapid for the frontal piles and relatively slow for the rear piles however at the end of the test the scour depths around the middle piles u 10 u 13 and u 15 are the largest and the scour depths around the rear piles u 21 u 23 and u 24 are the smallest as shown in fig 13 c the temporal variations of scour depths for the downstream pile group show similar patterns where the sand around each pile appears to be deposited at the early stage and then is washed away it could also be observed that the scour depths for the downstream pile group are smaller than those for the upstream pile group during the entire scour process 3 2 tidal tests 3 2 1 final bed topography figs 14 and 15 show the three dimensional topographies of the sand bed in tidal current conditions tide 1 and tide 2 respectively it is shown that the bed topography in the tidal tests is significantly different from that in the unidirectional test which is attributed to the effect of the continuous change of flow direction there are two similar shallow scour pits existing among the upstream and downstream pile group the maximum scour depths in the two tidal tests are different which are about 2 69d 0 188 m for tide 1 and 2 27d 0 159 m for tide 2 respectively figs 16 and 17 show the maximum and minimum scour depths around individual piles for the tidal tests tide 1 and tide 2 respectively in the case of tide 1 the maximum scour depth is 2 63d located around pile u 10 while in the case of tide 2 it is 2 39d near pile u 40 which is relatively smaller than that in tide 1 the difference of the maximum and minimum scour depths is the largest for the piles u 24 and d 26 the piles u 24 and d 26 as shown in figs 14 and 15 both lie in the slopes of the scour pits in the upstream and downstream 3 2 2 temporal variations of scour depth around individual piles figs 18 and 19 show the temporal variations of scour depths in tidal tests it is noted that in the first few cycles the scour depth of each pile increases rapidly especially for the piles u 1 u 6 u 10 u 13 u 15 d 35 d 38 d 40 d 46 and d 49 then the scour depth exhibits a creeping development until reaching an equilibrium value in the end the maximum scour depths appear to be near the piles u 10 u 13 u 15 d 35 d 38 and d 40 it is shown in figs 18 and 19 that all the curves show obvious fluctuations with time where the largest fluctuations are observed around the piles u 21 u 24 d 26 and d 31 and the smallest fluctuations are near the piles u 1 u 6 d 46 and d 49 this is significantly different from the migration of sand ripples in the unidirectional test uni 0 and mainly attributed to the tide induced scour and backfill process in the first half cycle with positive flow direction the scour characteristics around each pile is similar to those in the unidirectional test because of the same flow condition in the second half cycle with negative flow direction the downstream pile group is directly subjected to the current and the scour depth around each downstream pile increases rapidly at the same time the scour depth around each upstream pile decreases with the sand backfill into the local scour pit this kind of scour and backfill process will be repeated throughout the following tidal cycles 4 discussions in this section the time development of maximum scour depth around a single pile has been firstly studied and then considering the effect of pile group the maximum scour depth of representative pile under unidirectional and tidal currents are compared with each other this section aims to investigate and build up the relationship for the scour depths under different current conditions 4 1 unidirectional current tests fig 20 shows the temporal variation of the maximum scour depth for a single pile as suggested by sumer and fredsøe 2002 the dimensionless time t is defined as 1 t g s 1 d 50 3 d 2 t where t is the test duration and s is the specific gravity of sand to predict the variation of scour depth around a pile in the unidirectional current both the exponential function eq 2 by sumer and fredsøe 2002 and four parameter function eq 3 by sheppard et al 2004 are used 2 s s 1 exp t t 0 3 s a 1 exp b t c 1 exp d t where s is the equilibrium scour depth t 0 is the time scale a b c and d are the coefficients all the test data were fitted based on the non linear least square method as shown in fig 20 the four parameter function eq 3 fits the experimental data better the equilibrium scour depth derived from eq 3 is 2 08d when t 420 or t 173 h while at the end of the test the maximum scour depth obtained from the camera video is 1 76d reaching 84 6 of the equilibrium scour depth in the unidirectional current the main scour pit is located among the upstream pile group as shown in fig 21 four representative variations of scour depths around piles u 1 u 10 u 15 and u 24 are selected for the illustration of scour depths around pile group as shown in fig 1 these four piles are in the symmetric line and at the front middle and rear of the upstream pile group the scour curves of the four piles show similar characteristics and the maximum scour depth is much larger than that for a single pile fig 22 gives the fitting curves of the data for the four piles it can be observed that eq 3 fits the data better than eq 2 the predicted scour depth for the four piles at the end of the test based on eq 3 is shown in table 3 and the maximum error is up to 4 5 4 2 tidal tests as shown in fig 23 all the experimental data in tidal tests are presented and the blue dots maximum of scour depth fluctuations are fitted well by eq 3 to estimate the scour development with time for the tidal tests the final scour depths of tests tide 1 and tide 2 in table 4 are about 73 6 and 66 9 of the scour depth in the unidirectional test respectively fig 24 shows the temporal variation of the scour ratio s d t i d e pr e d i c t e d s d u n i pr e d i c t e d which is the ratio of the fitting curves for the tidal tests to the fitting curves for the unidirectional test in fig 23 table 4 gives the final ratios 77 1 for tide 1 and 69 8 for tide 2 at the end of the tests moreover equilibrium scour depth of each test extrapolated from eq 3 is shown in table 5 it is found that the final scour depths of the unidirectional test and tidal test tide 2 almost reaches their equilibrium depths while the final scour depth of tide 1 is 84 1 of its equilibrium depth given sufficient test duration the equilibrium scour depth in unidirectional test is 3 45d which is relatively larger than those in tide 1 2 90d and tide 2 2 39d this could be attributed to the sand backfilling in tidal tests the equilibrium scour depth 2 90d of tide 1 is larger than that 2 39d of tide 2 which is mainly due to different tidal periods it is also noted that in table 5 the final scour depth of tide 1 is a little bigger than that of tide 2 with the same test duration the positive or negative flow time for the two tidal tests is the same and the only difference is that the tidal period of tide 1 t1 2 h is half of tide 2 t2 4 h so the tidal cycle number of tide 1 is twice that of tide 2 thus it may be concluded that doubled tidal cycle number in tide 1 with respect to tide 2 leads to small difference in the scour depths of the two tidal tests fig 25 gives the comparison of the maximum scour depths for each selected pile in tidal tests it can be noted that for the same cycle numbers n 28 namely t 56 h for tide 1 and t 112 h for tide 2 there is no significant difference between their final maximum scour depth 2 31d for tide 1 versus 2 39d for tide 2 in fig 25 however with the same test duration t 112 h for both tide 1 and tide 2 in fig 25 the maximum scour depth of each pile in tide 1 is obviously larger than that in tide 2 besides the total tidal cycle numbers for tide 1 and tide 2 are n 28 and n 56 respectively it is observed in fig 23 that the tidal scour depths increase slowly since t 240 t 40 h and simultaneously the cycle numbers for tide 1 and tide 2 are n 20 and n 10 respectively thus to better illustrate the effect of tidal cycle number fig 26 shows the variation of the maximum scour depth with tidal cycle number n 20 28 in the two tidal tests with the same tidal cycle number the scour depth in tide 2 is larger than that in tide 1 while in figs 24 and 25 with the same test duration the scour depth in tide 1 is bigger than that in tide 2 thus with the same tidal cycle number the scour depth in tide 2 is larger than that in tide 1 with the increase of tidal cycle number until reaching the same test duration the difference of scour depth in the two tidal tests becomes decreased 5 conclusions a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate the time development of local scour around a typical dumbbell shaped pile group in tidal currents twenty micro cameras were placed inside specific piles to monitor the scour development with time around these piles and a laser scanner was used to obtain the final bed topography based on the test data the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 for the unidirectional test the sand bed shows a spoon shaped profile with a large scour pit around the upstream pile group and a u shaped sand dune in the lee wake region the maximum scour depth is located in the central part of the upstream pile group compared to the unidirectional test two similar shallow scour pits are developed around the upstream and downstream pile groups in the tidal tests and the maximum scour depth is located in the central part of each pile group 2 the maximum scour depth in the unidirectional test 3 57d is found to be obvious larger than those in the tidal tests 2 63d for the tidal test tide 1 and 2 39d for the tidal test tide 2 this is due to the longer time for the one direction flow in the unidirectional test than those in the tidal tests however regardless of the test duration the equilibrium scour depth 3 45d in unidirectional test is still larger than those in the tidal tests 2 90d for the tidal test tide 1 and 2 39d for the tidal test tide 2 and this could be attributed to the sand backfilling in the tidal tests 3 in the tidal tests the fluctuations of the scour depths around the piles are significantly different with the variation of pile position largest fluctuations are observed to be around the rear piles of the upstream pile group and the frontal piles of the downstream pile group while smallest fluctuations exist near the frontal piles of the upstream pile group and rear piles of the downstream pile group these are associated to their corresponding scour and backfill processes 4 based on two tidal tests with identical flow velocity but different tidal periods it is found that with the increase of tidal cycle number until reaching the same test duration the difference of scour depth in the two tidal tests becomes decreased acknowledgement the

23253,flow induced vibration fiv of a flexible plate located in the wake of a rigid circular cylinder is investigated numerically in this study computations are performed at two reynolds numbers re 100 and 200 with the plate bending stiffness k b varying from 0 00563 to 0 36 the gap spacing between the cylinder and the plate varies within the range of 2 0 s d 5 0 d is the cylinder diameter numerical results show that the optimum location with the maximum vibration response is found to be the medium spacing within which the vortex structures are fully formed in the gap and impinge on the plate successively the maximum peak amplitude of the tip appears at the smallest k b where the plate experiences the first and second bending motions accordingly the orbit of the tip presents a clear figure 8 pattern indicating that the bending deformation has strong nonlinearity it is also found that there are two mechanisms driving the plate to vibrate in both first and second bending modes the first mechanism is the vortex impingement with the low pressure core while the second is the high pressure region induced by the stagnation of flow near the turn up part of the plate keywords flow induced vibration flexible plate gap spacing bending stiffness peak amplitude 1 introduction a flexible structure immersed in a fluid flow may deform and vibrate owing to the fluid forces acting on its surface this in turn changes the flow field resulting in a coupling process between the fluid and the structure over the past few decades flow induced vibration fiv of a thin flexible structure has received increasing attention due to its importance in applications such as surgical techniques for snoring huang 1995 paper processing watanabe et al 2002 fish locomotion lauder 2015 and ocean energy harvesting jbaily and jeung 2015 although these applications are widespread the fiv phenomenon still puzzles people due to its complicated coupling dynamics as a multi physics issue fiv of a thin flexible structure involves the interactions of an elastic body with surrounding fluid flow the structural deformation and vibration are physically determined by not only the fluid condition but also the material and geometric properties to obtain the physical insights on the underlying mechanisms the present model of fluid structure interaction fsi is usually treated as a cantilevered flexible plate placed in an undisturbed uniform flow for scientific research during the past decades numerous studies have been performed to deal with this issue kornecki et al 1976 huang 1995 guo and paїdoussis 2000 balint and lucey 2005 eloy et al 2007 tang and paїdoussis 2007 the common results predict that the flexible plate suddenly loses stability and attains an intensified flapping motion beyond a critical flow speed this change is usually attributed to a broken compromise between the unsteady pressure forces of the fluid and the bending stiffness of the plate moreover tang and paїdoussis 2009 studied the coupled dynamics of two cantilevered flexible plates aligned parallel to each other in open axial flow they found that the flapping threshold is a function of the separation between the two plates the two plate system can oscillate in both in phase and out of phase modes a further work by gurugubelli et al 2014 noticed that there exists an optimum spacing between the plates for which the flexible plates experience greater resonance amplitude additionally motivated by the fiv energy harvesting mechanism of the piezoelectric material quite a few investigations have been conducted on a flexible plate behind a bluff body taylor et al 2001 experimentally demonstrated continuous extraction of electrical energy from a plate made of piezoelectric membrane behind a bluff body in which an alternative variation of the kármán vortex street excites periodic flapping of the membrane subsequently allen and smits 2001 claimed that the optimal coupling between an energy harvesting process and the wake flow is best defined as a resonance condition in which the membrane has a negligible damping effect on the original kármán vortex street lee and you 2013 numerically analyzed the vortex shedding induced vibration of a splitter plate fixed to the lee side of a fixed circular cylinder the results documented that the deflection shape of a splitter plate is dependent on the length of the plate while the deflection magnitude is a function of the bending stiffness and natural frequency of the corresponding plate nayer et al 2014 performed a complementary experimental numerical investigation on flow past a cylinder with a trailing flexible plate they claimed that the ratio of structural density to fluid density has the least effect on the plate response compared with young s modulus and material thickness furquan and mittal 2015 conducted a preliminary study of flow past two square cylinders with deformable splitter plates it was found that the two coupled plates initially undergo small amplitude out of phase oscillations but later they settle into in phase vibrations when the dominant vibration frequency is close to the structural natural frequency lock in occurs for certain values of flexibility a recent study by purohit et al 2018 focused on the influence of flow velocity and flexural rigidity on fiv of a flexible plate attached to a square bluff body the results present a nonlinear relation between vibration level and flow velocity as well as structural flexibility for a particular combination of flow velocity and plate stiffness the coupled fluid structure system shows resonance condition all the configurations mentioned above are closely associated with an extraneously induced excitation which is characterized by the unsteady pressure force due to the vortex shedding from the upstream bluff body allen and smits 2001 lee and you 2013 however little research has been performed on the influence of the bluff body on the vortex shedding near the critical gap spacing beyond which the plate response may differ significantly in this study flow past a rigid circular cylinder with an unattached flexible plate is investigated numerically the plate is located in the cylinder wake and the gap spacing is defined as the distance between the trailing point of the cylinder and the leading point of the plate a series of numerical calculations are performed by using a strongly coupled finite element model this study aims at exploring the effects of both gap spacing and bending stiffness on the modification of vortex shedding and the fiv behavior of the plate particular attention is paid to the vibration amplitude the frequency characteristics and the dynamic mechanisms behind the vortex plate interactions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the details of the computational methodology it is followed by the numerical validation in section 3 and the problem definition in section 4 section 5 presents the numerical results of fiv of the flexible plate behind the cylinder finally concluding remarks are drawn in section 6 2 numerical methods 2 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd the governing equations for the incompressible fluid flow are the navier stokes ns equations and the continuity equation in this study the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme donea et al 1982 is adopted to deal with the moving boundaries the ns equations and the continuity equation in ale form can be written as 1 ρ f u f t ρ f u f u m u f σ f 2 u f 0 in the above equations ρ f is the density of the fluid u f is the fluid velocity t is the time and u m is the mesh velocity computed by solving a modified laplace equation wang et al 2014 in this study the fluid stress tensor σ f is defined as 3 σ f p ι ρ f ν f u f u f t where p is the pressure i is the identity tensor and ν f is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the temporal discretization of the ns equation is performed by the semi implicit four step fractional method the streamline upwind petrov galerkin supg finite element scheme is applied to the spatial discretization more details about the solution of the ns equation can be found in wang et al 2014 2 2 computational structural dynamics csd deformation of the flexible structure is governed by the equation of momentum

plate attached to a circular cylinder a benchmark widely used for the validation of fluid structure interaction solvers turek and hron 2006 bhardwaj and mittal 2012 lee and you 2013 gurugubelli et al 2014 is simulated to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model prescribed above the computational configuration is schematically shown in fig 1 a parabolic velocity profile is applied at the inlet while a neumann condition is imposed at the outlet a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the lateral boundaries of the flow domain the reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter d and the mean inflow velocity is 100 the dimensionless physical parameters for this test are the ratio of structural density to fluid density ρ s ρ f 10 young s modulus e ρ f u 2 1400 and poisson s ratio ν s 0 4 the time step is set to δt 0 005 the fluid and solid domains are discretized using quadrilateral elements for the csd simulation 1700 elements and 1881 nodes are employed to increase the numerical resolution of cfd mesh concentration for the fluid flow is arranged locally near the structure surface as shown in fig 2 a mesh independence study is carried out on three fluid mesh systems i e g1 coarse g2 medium and g3 fine with the minimum mesh sizes of δh 0 04d 0 02d and 0 01d respectively the tested mesh parameters and the computed values are listed in table 1 along with the percentage changes it is found that the variations of the tip displacements between g2 and g3 are negligible fig 3 depicts the vorticity contours at different time points as well as the plate deformation it can be seen that the flow over the circular cylinder sheds vortices to downstream thereby exciting the plate to vibrate such fiv phenomenon is also observed by lee and you 2013 fig 4 plots the evolutions of the displacements of the plate tip based on g2 mesh the maximum values of the vertical displacement obtained in this study are close to those from the literature turek and hron 2006 lee and you 2013 the maximum differences between the calculated and the published results for the horizontal displacement are about 8 which is owing to the smaller overall magnitude of this quantity this test case indicates that the present numerical method is adequate enough to settle the fiv problem of a flexible plate 4 problem description this study mainly focuses on the fiv of a flexible plate located in the wake of a circular cylinder at re 100 and 200 the computational configuration is shown in fig 5 a uniform flow velocity u is imposed at the inlet the upstream end of the plate is fixed while the downstream end is free to vibrate according to sivadas and wickenheiser 2011 the cantilever structure with medium length has higher strain compared to the longer and shorter structures because the vortex streets form at the right position along the structure to excite the fundamental mode and the l d l is the length of cantilever structure d is the diameter of the bluff body in the range of 2 2 5 gives a maximum strain in this study the plate length l is considered as 2d and the thickness h is 0 06d the gap spacing varies in the range of 2 0 s d 5 0 which is expected to excite stronger vortex structure interactions akaydın et al 2010 the dimensionless material parameters are given as the ratio of structural density to fluid density ρ s ρ f 10 and poisson s ratio ν s 0 4 the young s modulus of the plate varies in the range of 2500 e ρ f u 2 160000 which produces the bending stiffness k b k b eh 3 12ρ f u 2l3 in the range of 0 00563 k b 0 36 as listed in table 2 the first and second mode natural frequencies of the plate normalized by d and u are also shown in this table fig 6 plots the fluid mesh refinement near the structure surfaces a mesh independence test is performed for a typical case of re 200 k b 0 00563 and s d 3 0 as shown in table 3 the solid domain is discretized with 300 quadrilateral elements and 404 nodes according to this test the mesh with the minimum size of 0 02d is employed in the following numerical simulations 5 results and discussions for comparison flow over a circular cylinder with a rigid plate is first simulated figs 7 and 8 show the vorticity fields for re 100 and 200 in a wide spacing range of 0 0 s d 5 0 as well known a classic kármán vortex street appears in the wake of flow over a single cylinder at low re norberg 2003 however if a plate is placed behind the cylinder the flow pattern may show different behaviors as can be seen in the case of re 100 at s d 0 0 3 0 the flow separated from the cylinder envelops the plate surprisingly no vortex sheds in the wake and the flow presents steady state kwon and choi 1996 simulated the laminar vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder with an attached plate and they also found that the vortex shedding completely disappears at lower re and larger plate length in this study with the increase of gap spacing to 4 0 5 0 the vortices from the upstream cylinder shed freely in the gap and impinge on the plate finally developing into two row opposite sign vortex streets on the upper and lower sides of the plate different from the case of re 100 at s d 0 0 3 0 for re 200 the separated shear layer from the cylinder envelops the plate and finally forms vortex shedding in the wake consequently the cylinder plate system behaves like fish motion when the gap spacing increases to 4 0 and 5 0 the vortex shedding appears in the gap and then impinges on the plate inducing a disturbed wake flow as discussed above the reynolds number and the gap spacing have significant effects on the flow pattern in fact we performed supplementary simulations within the range re 100 200 in increments of 10 and observed that the steady flow appears only when re 120 therefore two typical cases of re 100 and 200 are selected in this study and the fiv of a flexible plate behind the cylinder is simulated within the spacing range s d 2 0 5 0 which is large enough to capture the modification of vortex shedding fig 9 shows the vorticity contours and the vibration responses of the flexible plate at s d 2 0 5 0 for re 100 as can be seen in fig 9 a at s d 2 0 the flow remains steady at most k b where no structural vibration occurs however at k b 0 09 the shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder envelop the plate and then shed vortices in the wake meanwhile it is found that the flexible plate vibrates with a small amplitude y max d 0 274 this can be ascribed to the occurrence of lock in resonance when the vibration frequency f v 0 142 is close to the first mode natural frequency of the plate f n1 0 153 at s d 3 0 shown in fig 9 b the vortices originated from the cylinder plate system are shed behind the plate at k b 0 00563 and 0 0225 and small amplitude vibrations of the plate can be observed it is also noted that the vibration frequencies deviate noticeably from the strouhal number st 0 164 and shift toward the corresponding first mode natural frequencies this phenomenon can be called soft lock in which has been previously reported for fiv of circular cylinders khalak and williamson 1999 mittal and kumar 2001 as stated by mittal and kumar 2001 this is one of the physical mechanisms through which the nonlinear oscillator self limits its vibration amplitude with the increase of bending stiffness to k b 0 09 the plate experiences resonance with the peak amplitude of y max d 0 283 and the vortices from the cylinder are shed freely in the gap enhancing the vortex plate interactions however at k b 0 36 since the vibration frequency f v 0 137 is far from the first mode natural frequency f n1 0 306 both of the wake flow and the flexible plate oscillate slightly at s d 4 0 the vortex shedding occurs in the gap all over the k b range tested and the vibration frequency of the plate is completely dominated by the strouhal number as shown in fig 9 c the structural vibration response rises to a very high level the peak amplitude appears at the smallest bending stiffness k b 0 00563 and obtains a value of y max d 0 851 much larger than that y max d 0 455 at k b 0 09 where resonance occurs this can be explained by that the plate vibration is controlled by both first and second bending modes at k b 0 00563 where the vibration frequency is found to be 0 161 while the first and second mode natural frequencies of the plate are 0 038 and 0 24 respectively another feature worth noting is that at the largest bending stiffness k b 0 36 the amplitude response is still significant y max d 0 254 due to the vortex impingement on the plate the vibration response of s d 5 0 is similar to that of s d 4 0 as shown in fig 9 d however ascribed to the weakening of the vortex plate interactions at large gap spacing the amplitude response curve shows a small drop as shown above the maximum peak amplitude of the plate tip for re 100 is y max d 0 851 and it appears at k b 0 00563 and s d 4 0 the maximum vibration response does not occur close to the cylinder since the vortex structures are not fully formed at these locations fig 10 shows the vorticity fields and the structural vibration responses at s d 2 0 5 0 for re 200 as shown in fig 10 a at s d 2 0 although the plate is completely wrapped by the upper and lower shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder the plate vibration is obvious all over the k b range it is found that the vibration amplitude decreases with the increase of k b the peak amplitude reaches y max d 0 61 at k b 0 00563 where the plate vibration is mainly controlled by the second bending mode and meanwhile influenced by the first bending mode the vibration frequency is 0 191 nearly equal to the strouhal number 0 195 while the first and second mode natural frequencies of the plate are 0 038 and 0 24 respectively at k b 0 0225 the vibration frequency gets rid of the strouhal law and approaches the corresponding first mode natural frequency i e soft lock in occurs with k b increasing to 0 09 and 0 1463 the lock in appears since the vibration frequency nearly matches the first mode natural frequency the vortex shedding pattern and the structural response present similar characteristics in the cases of s d 3 0 5 0 for re 200 as shown in fig 10 b d in the k b range tested the vortices from the upstream cylinder are fully developed in the gap and then interact with the plate actively inducing obvious structural vibration and the vibration frequency is always controlled by the strouhal number due to the combinations of the first and second bending modes the vibration amplitude of the plate tip obtains its main peak at k b 0 00563 while a secondary peak appears at k b 0 09 caused by the resonance compared with the vibration responses at s d 4 0 and 5 0 the amplitude curve rises to a higher level at s d 3 0 and the maximum peak reaches y max d 0 958 this indicates that the gap spacing of s d 3 0 is the optimum location which can intensify the vortex plate interactions in order to explore the variation trend of the structural vibration with re we also performed additional simulations of fiv of the flexible plate in the range of 100 re 200 with an increment of 10 the results indicate that the vibration responses of the flexible plate at re 110 show similar behaviors to those of re 100 while the structural response characteristics for 120 re 200 are essentially similar to those of re 200 thus it is reasonable to say that the selected two cases of re 100 and 200 are representative in the present test bhardwaj and mittal 2012 studied the flow induced deformation of an elastic plate attached to the lee side of a circular cylinder at re 100 300 they observed that the trajectories of the plate tip present a figure 8 pattern due to the effect of the geometry nonlinearity this pattern is also reproduced in this study fig 11 shows the superimposed view of the plate vibration mode for a typical case of s d 2 0 and re 200 and the orbital trajectories of the plate tip are plotted in fig 12 it is found that at k b 0 00563 the plate vibration appears to be a combination of the first and second mode bending motions which is consistent with the frequency analysis in fig 10 the tip moves in an orbit with an unrepeated figure 8 shape indicating that the bending vibration deformation of the plate owns obvious nonlinear characteristics at k b 0 0225 0 36 the deflection shape of the plate is similar to the first bending mode of the plate under free vibration as a result the geometry nonlinearity diminishes and the orbit of the tip is nearly flattened into an arc fig 13 shows the superimposed view of the plate vibration mode at s d 4 0 and re 200 fig 14 plots the orbital trajectories of the plate tip as expected the orbit with a figure 8 shape appears at k b 0 00563 and 0 0225 where the plate vibrates in both first and second modes differently at k b 0 1463 and 0 36 the first mode bending motion generates an arc orbit the dynamic characteristics of the flexible plate can be explained by analyzing the interactions between the flow and the structure fig 15 plots the pressure fields and streamlines for some typical cases the fluid forces acting on the plate in the first bending mode are mainly associated with the low pressure cores induced by the shear layers or vortex structures from the upstream cylinder by contrast there are two mechanisms exciting both first and second bending modes the first is the impingement of the low pressure core while the second is the high pressure region induced by the stagnation of flow around the turn up part of the plate fig 16 shows the vorticity and pressure fields at different time instants for k b 0 1463 s d 3 0 and re 200 it is seen that the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder accompanied by the low pressure cores impinge on the plate successively in a when the plate fully bends upward the low pressure core l1 on the upper side of the plate is just shed from the free end while the low pressure core l2 forms on the lower side of the fixed end in b the l2 grows up and moves along the lower side of the plate which provides the primary bending moment to deflect the plate downward in c the l2 arrives at the free end meanwhile the l3 appears at the upper side of the fixed end it can be seen that in d when the l2 is shed from the free end the plate has been fully deflected downward at this time the l3 starts pulling the plate back upward the sequence of these events combined with the first mode resonance condition results in a powerful vibration of the plate fig 17 shows the vorticity and pressure fields at different time points for k b 0 00563 s d 3 0 and re 200 where the flexible plate experiences both first and second mode motions as the plate fully bends upward see a the structural vibration is mainly subjected to the low pressure core l1 on the lower side and the high pressure core h1 on the upper side dominated by the two fluid dynamic mechanisms the plate bends downward see b when the plate is fully deflected downward the l2 and the h2 shift close to the tip and they are further intensified by the vortex impingement and the flow stagnation see c consequently the plate starts to bend upward see d 6 conclusions in the present study flow induced vibration fiv of a flexible plate behind a circular cylinder has been numerically investigated at re 100 and 200 the partitioned strong coupling strategy is applied to the fsi simulation the effects of the gap spacing and the bending stiffness on fiv are discussed main findings are summarized as follows at s d 2 0 and s d 3 0 for re 100 the peak amplitude of the plate tip appears at k b 0 09 due to the occurrence of the first mode resonance however at s d 4 0 and 5 0 for re 100 and all gap spacings for re 200 the vibration response curve reaches a very high level and obtains the peak amplitude at the smallest bending stiffness k b 0 00563 this can be ascribed to the combination of the first and second bending motions the optimum locations at which the maximum peak amplitude appears are found to be s d 4 0 for re 100 and s d 3 0 for re 200 where the vortices from the cylinder are shed in the gap and impinge on the plate successively the maximum vibration response does not occur close to or far from the cylinder since the vortex and structure interactions are not strong enough at these locations the results also show that when the plate experiences the first mode and second mode bending motions the structural vibrations are mainly driven by both low and high pressure cores the orbit of the tip presents a figure 8 pattern indicating that the bending vibration deformation of the plate owns obvious nonlinear characteristics differently as the deflection shape of the plate appears to be the first bending mode the geometry nonlinearity diminishes and the orbit of the tip is nearly flattened into an arc at this time only the low pressure core drives the plate to bend downward and upward acknowledgment supports from the natural science foundation of jiangsu province no bk20160870 no bk20160865 and the national natural science foundation of

23253,flow induced vibration fiv of a flexible plate located in the wake of a rigid circular cylinder is investigated numerically in this study computations are performed at two reynolds numbers re 100 and 200 with the plate bending stiffness k b varying from 0 00563 to 0 36 the gap spacing between the cylinder and the plate varies within the range of 2 0 s d 5 0 d is the cylinder diameter numerical results show that the optimum location with the maximum vibration response is found to be the medium spacing within which the vortex structures are fully formed in the gap and impinge on the plate successively the maximum peak amplitude of the tip appears at the smallest k b where the plate experiences the first and second bending motions accordingly the orbit of the tip presents a clear figure 8 pattern indicating that the bending deformation has strong nonlinearity it is also found that there are two mechanisms driving the plate to vibrate in both first and second bending modes the first mechanism is the vortex impingement with the low pressure core while the second is the high pressure region induced by the stagnation of flow near the turn up part of the plate keywords flow induced vibration flexible plate gap spacing bending stiffness peak amplitude 1 introduction a flexible structure immersed in a fluid flow may deform and vibrate owing to the fluid forces acting on its surface this in turn changes the flow field resulting in a coupling process between the fluid and the structure over the past few decades flow induced vibration fiv of a thin flexible structure has received increasing attention due to its importance in applications such as surgical techniques for snoring huang 1995 paper processing watanabe et al 2002 fish locomotion lauder 2015 and ocean energy harvesting jbaily and jeung 2015 although these applications are widespread the fiv phenomenon still puzzles people due to its complicated coupling dynamics as a multi physics issue fiv of a thin flexible structure involves the interactions of an elastic body with surrounding fluid flow the structural deformation and vibration are physically determined by not only the fluid condition but also the material and geometric properties to obtain the physical insights on the underlying mechanisms the present model of fluid structure interaction fsi is usually treated as a cantilevered flexible plate placed in an undisturbed uniform flow for scientific research during the past decades numerous studies have been performed to deal with this issue kornecki et al 1976 huang 1995 guo and paїdoussis 2000 balint and lucey 2005 eloy et al 2007 tang and paїdoussis 2007 the common results predict that the flexible plate suddenly loses stability and attains an intensified flapping motion beyond a critical flow speed this change is usually attributed to a broken compromise between the unsteady pressure forces of the fluid and the bending stiffness of the plate moreover tang and paїdoussis 2009 studied the coupled dynamics of two cantilevered flexible plates aligned parallel to each other in open axial flow they found that the flapping threshold is a function of the separation between the two plates the two plate system can oscillate in both in phase and out of phase modes a further work by gurugubelli et al 2014 noticed that there exists an optimum spacing between the plates for which the flexible plates experience greater resonance amplitude additionally motivated by the fiv energy harvesting mechanism of the piezoelectric material quite a few investigations have been conducted on a flexible plate behind a bluff body taylor et al 2001 experimentally demonstrated continuous extraction of electrical energy from a plate made of piezoelectric membrane behind a bluff body in which an alternative variation of the kármán vortex street excites periodic flapping of the membrane subsequently allen and smits 2001 claimed that the optimal coupling between an energy harvesting process and the wake flow is best defined as a resonance condition in which the membrane has a negligible damping effect on the original kármán vortex street lee and you 2013 numerically analyzed the vortex shedding induced vibration of a splitter plate fixed to the lee side of a fixed circular cylinder the results documented that the deflection shape of a splitter plate is dependent on the length of the plate while the deflection magnitude is a function of the bending stiffness and natural frequency of the corresponding plate nayer et al 2014 performed a complementary experimental numerical investigation on flow past a cylinder with a trailing flexible plate they claimed that the ratio of structural density to fluid density has the least effect on the plate response compared with young s modulus and material thickness furquan and mittal 2015 conducted a preliminary study of flow past two square cylinders with deformable splitter plates it was found that the two coupled plates initially undergo small amplitude out of phase oscillations but later they settle into in phase vibrations when the dominant vibration frequency is close to the structural natural frequency lock in occurs for certain values of flexibility a recent study by purohit et al 2018 focused on the influence of flow velocity and flexural rigidity on fiv of a flexible plate attached to a square bluff body the results present a nonlinear relation between vibration level and flow velocity as well as structural flexibility for a particular combination of flow velocity and plate stiffness the coupled fluid structure system shows resonance condition all the configurations mentioned above are closely associated with an extraneously induced excitation which is characterized by the unsteady pressure force due to the vortex shedding from the upstream bluff body allen and smits 2001 lee and you 2013 however little research has been performed on the influence of the bluff body on the vortex shedding near the critical gap spacing beyond which the plate response may differ significantly in this study flow past a rigid circular cylinder with an unattached flexible plate is investigated numerically the plate is located in the cylinder wake and the gap spacing is defined as the distance between the trailing point of the cylinder and the leading point of the plate a series of numerical calculations are performed by using a strongly coupled finite element model this study aims at exploring the effects of both gap spacing and bending stiffness on the modification of vortex shedding and the fiv behavior of the plate particular attention is paid to the vibration amplitude the frequency characteristics and the dynamic mechanisms behind the vortex plate interactions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the details of the computational methodology it is followed by the numerical validation in section 3 and the problem definition in section 4 section 5 presents the numerical results of fiv of the flexible plate behind the cylinder finally concluding remarks are drawn in section 6 2 numerical methods 2 1 computational fluid dynamics cfd the governing equations for the incompressible fluid flow are the navier stokes ns equations and the continuity equation in this study the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale scheme donea et al 1982 is adopted to deal with the moving boundaries the ns equations and the continuity equation in ale form can be written as 1 ρ f u f t ρ f u f u m u f σ f 2 u f 0 in

increment in per iteration step and α is the implicitly controlled weighting value which is set to 0 25 the parameter β is not given here because the structural damping is neglected in this study 2 3 interface conditions on the fluid structure interface γ the velocity field and the normal stress field must be continuous this physical requirement gives rise to the following set of boundary

2014 is simulated to evaluate the accuracy of the numerical model prescribed above the computational configuration is schematically shown in fig 1 a parabolic velocity profile is applied at the inlet while a neumann condition is imposed at the outlet a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the lateral boundaries of the flow domain the reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter d and the mean inflow velocity is 100 the dimensionless physical parameters for this test are the ratio of structural density to fluid density ρ s ρ f 10 young s modulus e ρ f u 2 1400 and poisson s ratio ν s 0

resolution of cfd mesh concentration for the fluid flow is arranged locally near the structure surface as shown in fig 2 a mesh independence study is carried out on three fluid mesh systems i e g1 coarse g2 medium and g3 fine with the minimum mesh sizes of δh 0 04d 0 02d and 0 01d respectively the tested mesh parameters and the computed values are listed in table 1 along with the percentage changes it is found that the variations of the tip displacements between g2 and g3 are negligible fig 3 depicts the vorticity contours at different time points as well as the plate deformation it can be seen that the flow over the circular cylinder sheds vortices to downstream thereby exciting the plate to vibrate such fiv phenomenon is also observed by lee and you 2013 fig 4 plots the evolutions of the displacements of the plate tip based on g2 mesh the maximum values of the vertical displacement obtained in this study are close to those from the literature turek and hron 2006 lee and you 2013 the maximum differences between the calculated and the published results for the horizontal displacement are about 8 which is owing to the smaller overall magnitude of this quantity this test case indicates that the present numerical method is adequate enough to settle the fiv problem of a flexible plate 4 problem description this study mainly focuses on the fiv of a flexible plate located in the wake of a circular cylinder at re 100 and 200 the computational configuration is shown in fig 5 a uniform flow velocity u is imposed at the inlet the upstream end of the plate is fixed while the downstream end is free to vibrate according to sivadas and wickenheiser 2011 the cantilever structure with medium length has higher strain compared to the longer and shorter structures because the vortex streets form at the right position along the structure to excite the fundamental mode and the l d l is the length of cantilever structure d is the diameter of the bluff body in the range of 2 2

size of 0 02d is employed in the following numerical simulations 5 results and discussions for comparison flow over a circular cylinder with a rigid plate is first simulated figs 7 and 8 show the vorticity fields for re 100 and 200 in a wide spacing range of 0 0 s d 5 0 as well known a classic kármán vortex street appears in the wake of flow over a single cylinder at low re norberg 2003 however if a plate is placed behind the cylinder the flow pattern may show different behaviors as can be seen in the case of re 100 at s d 0 0 3 0 the flow separated from the cylinder envelops the plate surprisingly no vortex sheds in the wake and the flow presents steady state kwon and choi 1996 simulated the laminar vortex shedding behind a circular cylinder with an attached plate and they also found that the vortex shedding completely disappears at lower re and larger plate length in this study with the increase of gap spacing to 4 0 5 0 the vortices from the upstream cylinder shed freely in the gap and impinge on the plate finally developing into two row opposite sign vortex streets on the upper and lower sides of the plate different from the case of re 100 at s d 0 0 3 0 for re 200 the separated shear layer from the cylinder envelops the plate and finally forms vortex shedding in the wake consequently the cylinder plate system behaves like fish motion when the gap spacing increases to 4 0 and 5 0 the vortex shedding appears in the gap and then impinges on the plate inducing a disturbed wake flow as discussed above the reynolds number and the gap spacing have significant effects on the flow pattern in fact we performed supplementary simulations within the range re 100 200 in increments of 10 and observed that the steady flow appears only when re 120 therefore two typical cases of re 100 and 200 are selected in this study and the fiv of a flexible plate behind the cylinder is simulated within the spacing range s d 2 0 5 0 which is large enough to capture the modification of vortex shedding fig 9 shows the vorticity contours and the vibration responses of the flexible plate at s d 2 0 5 0 for re 100 as can be seen in fig 9 a at s d 2 0 the flow remains steady at most k b where no structural vibration occurs however at k b 0 09 the shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder envelop the plate and then shed vortices in the wake meanwhile it is found that the flexible plate vibrates with a small amplitude y max d 0 274 this can be ascribed to the occurrence of lock in resonance when the vibration frequency f v 0 142 is close to the first mode natural frequency of the plate f n1 0 153 at s d 3 0 shown in fig 9 b the vortices originated from the cylinder plate system are shed behind the plate at k b 0 00563 and 0 0225 and small amplitude vibrations of the plate can be observed it is also noted that the vibration frequencies deviate noticeably from the strouhal number st 0 164 and shift toward the corresponding first mode natural frequencies this phenomenon can be called soft lock in which has been previously reported for fiv of circular cylinders khalak and williamson 1999 mittal and kumar 2001 as stated by mittal and kumar 2001 this is one of the physical mechanisms through which the nonlinear oscillator self limits its vibration amplitude with the increase of bending stiffness to k b 0 09 the plate experiences resonance with the peak amplitude of y max d 0 283 and the vortices from the cylinder are shed freely in the gap enhancing the vortex plate interactions however at k b 0 36 since the vibration frequency f v 0 137 is far from the first mode natural frequency f n1 0 306 both of the wake flow and the flexible plate oscillate slightly at s d 4 0 the vortex shedding occurs in the gap all over the k b range tested and the vibration frequency of the plate is completely dominated by the strouhal number as shown in fig 9 c the structural vibration response rises to a very high level the peak amplitude appears at the smallest bending stiffness k b 0 00563 and obtains a value of y max d 0 851 much larger than that y max d 0 455 at k b 0 09 where resonance occurs this can be explained by that the plate vibration is controlled by both first and second bending modes at k b 0 00563 where the vibration frequency is found to be 0 161 while the first and second mode natural frequencies of the plate are 0 038 and 0 24 respectively another feature worth noting is that at the largest bending stiffness k b 0 36 the amplitude response is still significant y max d 0 254 due to the vortex impingement on the plate the vibration response of s d 5 0 is similar to that of s d 4 0 as shown in fig 9 d however ascribed to the weakening of the vortex plate interactions at large gap spacing the amplitude response curve shows a small drop as shown above the maximum peak amplitude of the plate tip for re 100 is y max d 0 851 and it appears at k b 0 00563 and s d 4 0 the maximum vibration response does not occur close to the cylinder since the vortex structures are not fully formed at these locations fig 10 shows the vorticity fields and the structural vibration responses at s d 2 0 5 0 for re 200 as shown in fig 10 a at s d 2 0 although the plate is completely wrapped by the upper and lower shear layers separated from the upstream cylinder the plate vibration is obvious all over the k b range it is found that the vibration amplitude decreases with the increase of k b the peak amplitude reaches y max d 0 61 at k b 0 00563 where the plate vibration is mainly controlled by the second bending mode and meanwhile influenced by the first bending mode the vibration frequency is 0 191 nearly equal to the strouhal number 0 195 while the first and second mode natural frequencies of the plate are 0 038 and 0 24 respectively at k b 0 0225 the vibration frequency gets rid of the strouhal law and approaches the corresponding first mode natural frequency i e soft lock in occurs with k b increasing to 0 09 and 0 1463 the lock in appears since the vibration frequency nearly matches the first mode natural frequency the vortex shedding pattern and the structural response present similar characteristics in the cases of s d 3 0 5 0 for re 200 as shown in fig 10 b d in the k b range tested the vortices from the upstream cylinder are fully developed in the gap and then interact with the plate actively inducing obvious structural vibration and the vibration frequency is always controlled by the strouhal number due to the combinations of the first and second bending modes the vibration amplitude of the plate tip obtains its main peak at k b 0 00563 while a secondary peak appears at k b 0 09 caused by the resonance compared with the vibration responses at s d 4 0 and 5 0 the amplitude curve rises to a higher level at s d 3 0 and the maximum peak reaches y max d 0 958 this indicates that the gap spacing of s d 3 0 is the optimum location which can intensify the vortex plate interactions in order to explore the variation trend of the structural vibration with re we also performed additional simulations of fiv of the flexible plate in the range of 100 re 200 with an increment of 10 the results indicate that the vibration responses of the flexible plate at re 110 show similar behaviors to those of re 100 while the structural response characteristics for 120 re 200 are essentially similar to those of re 200 thus it is reasonable to say that the selected two cases of re 100 and 200 are representative in the present test bhardwaj and mittal 2012 studied the flow induced deformation of an elastic plate attached to the lee side of a circular cylinder at re 100 300 they observed that the trajectories of the plate tip present a figure 8 pattern due to the effect of the geometry nonlinearity this pattern is also reproduced in this study fig 11 shows the superimposed view of the plate vibration mode for a typical case of s d 2 0 and re 200 and the orbital trajectories of the plate tip are plotted in fig 12 it is found that at k b 0 00563 the plate vibration appears to be a combination of the first and second mode bending motions which is consistent with the frequency analysis in fig 10 the tip moves in an orbit with an unrepeated figure 8 shape indicating that the bending vibration deformation of the plate owns obvious nonlinear characteristics at k b 0 0225 0 36 the deflection shape of the plate is similar to the first bending mode of the plate under free vibration as a result the geometry nonlinearity diminishes and the orbit of the tip is nearly flattened into an arc fig 13 shows the superimposed view of the plate vibration mode at s d 4 0 and re 200 fig 14 plots the orbital trajectories of the plate tip as expected the orbit with a figure 8 shape appears at k b 0 00563 and 0 0225 where the plate vibrates in both first and second modes differently at k b 0 1463 and 0 36 the first mode bending motion generates an arc orbit the dynamic characteristics of the flexible plate can be explained by analyzing the interactions between the flow and the structure fig 15 plots the pressure fields and streamlines for some typical cases the fluid forces acting on the plate in the first bending mode are mainly associated with the low pressure cores induced by the shear layers or vortex structures from the upstream cylinder by contrast there are two mechanisms exciting both first and second bending modes the first is the impingement of the low pressure core while the second is the high pressure region induced by the stagnation of flow around the turn up part of the plate fig 16 shows the vorticity and pressure fields at different time instants for k b 0 1463 s d 3 0 and re 200 it is seen that the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder accompanied by the low pressure cores impinge on the plate successively in a when the plate fully bends upward the low pressure core l1 on the upper side of the plate is just shed from the free end while the low pressure core l2 forms on the lower side of the fixed end in b the l2 grows up and moves along the lower side of the plate which provides the primary bending moment to deflect the plate downward in c the l2 arrives at the free end meanwhile the l3 appears at the upper side of the fixed end it can be seen that in d when the l2 is shed from the free end the plate has been fully deflected downward at this time the l3 starts pulling the plate back upward the sequence of these events combined with the first mode resonance condition results in a powerful vibration of the plate fig 17 shows the vorticity and pressure fields at different time points for k b 0 00563 s d 3 0 and re 200 where the flexible plate experiences both first and second mode motions as the plate fully bends upward see a the structural vibration is mainly subjected to the low pressure core l1 on the lower side and the high pressure core h1 on the upper side dominated by the two fluid dynamic mechanisms the plate bends downward see b when the plate is fully deflected downward the l2 and the h2 shift close to the tip and they are further intensified by the vortex impingement and the flow stagnation see c consequently the plate starts to bend upward see d 6 conclusions in the present study flow induced vibration fiv of a flexible plate behind a circular cylinder has been numerically investigated at re 100 and 200 the partitioned strong coupling strategy is applied to the fsi simulation the effects of the gap spacing and the bending stiffness on fiv are discussed main findings are summarized as follows at s d 2 0 and s d 3 0 for re 100 the peak amplitude of the plate tip appears at k b 0 09 due to the occurrence of the first mode resonance however at s d 4 0 and 5 0 for re 100 and all gap spacings for re 200 the vibration response curve reaches a very high level and obtains the peak amplitude at the smallest bending stiffness k b 0 00563 this can be ascribed to the combination of the first and second bending motions the optimum locations at which the maximum peak amplitude appears are found to be s d 4 0 for re 100 and s d 3 0 for re 200 where the vortices from the cylinder are shed in the gap and impinge on the plate successively the maximum vibration response does not occur close to or far from the cylinder since the vortex and structure interactions are not strong enough at these locations the results also show that when the plate experiences the first mode and second mode bending motions the structural vibrations are mainly driven by both low and high pressure cores the orbit of the tip presents a figure 8 pattern indicating that the bending vibration deformation of the plate owns obvious nonlinear characteristics differently as the deflection shape of the plate appears to be the first bending mode the geometry nonlinearity diminishes and the orbit of the tip is nearly flattened into an arc at this time only the low pressure core drives the plate to bend downward and upward acknowledgment supports from the natural science foundation of jiangsu province no bk20160870 no bk20160865 and the national natural science foundation of

23254,this paper is the third of a series covering investigations of the wave induced force and motion behavior of ice masses near a fixed structure the objective of this phase of the study was to determine whether the effects observed in regular waves sayeed et al 2017b 2018 still held in irregular seas in the present case wave characteristics measured in front of the fixed structure showed that the significant wave heights follow a standing wave pattern generated by the superposition of the incident and reflected peak frequency wave thus it may be inferred that the significant surge and heave forces and motions will be increased or decreased at the node and antinode locations in front of the structure as previously observed for regular waves force spectra generated from regular wave force data sayeed et al 2017b and wave measurements from the present study showed that beyond the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 the significant surge force goes down and significant heave force goes up as the body gets close to the structure direct measurements of irregular wave forces on a fixed berg model at different proximity to the fixed structure demonstrate the change in significant wave forces based on the ratio of separation distance to peak wavelength when the berg body is positioned closer to the fixed structure the normalized significant forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the normalized significant forces in the vertical direction increase significant differences were found between the directly measured force spectra and those produced by linear superposition of regular wave force transfer functions this is attributed to non linear effects arising from the iceberg profile and low freeboard free floating motion experiments showed smaller differences in the surge and heave velocity spectra due to the presence of the structure this is because there is insufficient motion data at any specific location to capture the motion responses for all the frequencies in the spectrum the proximity effect on wave loads and wave induced motions in the vertical direction is found to be more pronounced than the same in the horizontal direction numerical simulations using rans based commercial cfd code flow3d are compared to the experimental results selected test cases from both force and motion experiments are simulated in irregular waves generated from selected experimental wave spectra numerical results for irregular waves demonstrate the ability to simulate random waves and resulting forces and motions with trends comparable to the experimental results keywords iceberg bergy bit irregular waves hydrodynamic interaction offshore structure wave body interaction 1 introduction fixed and floating offshore structures in arctic and sub arctic regions face unique challenge in their structural design because of the unique environmental loading by various glacial ice fragments fixed structures are designed to withstand large iceberg impacts whereas floating structures can avoid interaction with large icebergs by moving off location wave driven small 1 000t 20 000t pieces of glacial ice bergy bit or growler are a potential hazard for offshore installations operating in ice infested waters smaller ice masses are also harder to detect in bad weather at night or in heavy seas the wave induced motion of smaller ice masses can substantially exceed their mean drift speed attwood 1987 estimation of impact load arising from wave driven ice masses with offshore structures is heavily dependent on the input collision energy and collision energy is largely dependent on the final velocity prior to impact the close proximity hydrodynamic interaction between an iceberg or a bergy bit and an offshore structure is an important factor that influences the impact velocity sayeed et al 2017a conducted a comprehensive review to identify the significance of hydrodynamic interaction of ice masses in close proximity with arctic offshore structures just prior to impact and also to identify related research gaps in this area a potential research gap exists in the study of the viscosity dominated very near field region where several complicated phenomena such as negative wave drift force against the direction of propagation of the waves fluid cushioning wave shadowing reduction in impact velocity change in added mass hydrodynamic damping eccentric impact etc have been observed in several physical model test programs these effects are more obvious for less transparent fixed or floating offshore structures such as gravity base structures or large ship shaped production platforms and for smaller ice masses and bergy bits change in impact velocity could conceivably change the failure mode of ice ductile transition or brittle thus changing the effective pressure ignoring these effects may result in an overestimation in impact load which will ultimately affect the design and cost of the structure a considerable volume of experimental work has been directed towards the iceberg structure interaction problem attwood 1987 and lever et al 1988a 1988b carried out a series of experiments and found that small icebergs behaved like a fluid particle for wave length iceberg size ratios greater than 13 salvalaggio and rojansky 1986 observed that no impact occurred if the iceberg diameter was less than approximately half the structure diameter lever et al 1990a extended their impact velocity probability statistics to include a number of different iceberg shapes lever et al 1990b conducted model tests of wave driven bergy bits impacting with a semi submersible in irregular waves mak et al 1990 conducted a similar study in regular and irregular waves with a floating oil production platform with larger physical dimensions than the transparent semi submersible tested by lever et al 1990b open water significant velocities were found to be 10 40 higher than significant impact velocities mctaggart 1989 and isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990c investigated the hydrodynamic forces during iceberg drift in proximity with an offshore structure through model tests and numerical analysis for the waves only condition no impact occurred when the ratio of iceberg diameter and structure diameter is less than or equal to 0 2 whereas salvalaggio and rojansky 1986 in their experiments found the ratio to be 0 5 it was reported that the presence of the structure can result in 10 or more velocity reduction for smaller icebergs iceberg structure diameter ratio less than 0 2 approaching the structure model experiments of the terra nova fpso in collision with an iceberg 100 000t and a bergy bit 3 600t conducted by colbourne et al 1998 revealed that impact energies may be reduced for the smaller bergs in higher sea states and it was speculated that the radiated waves in very near field region results in confused collision trends colbourne 2000 indicated that increased input wave energy did not lead to increasing impact energy for small ice pieces and postulated that the effect may be due to reflection of waves where the reflected wave energy reduced the berg velocity klopman and van der meer 1999 investigated the spatial variation of wave spectrum and significant wave height in front of a vertical wall and a rubble mound breakwater in random waves the significant wave heights show a standing wave pattern extending over two times the peak wavelength for the given jonswap spectrum the findings of nodal and antinodal frequencies follow the patterns of linear wave theory gagnon 2004 conducted physical model tests to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between a floating ice mass and a tanker passing at speed this study indicated that the radiation proximity effect arising from radiated waves and underwater pressure generated by the passing hull can be significant but this work did not directly consider collisions an increase in maximum sway motion of the ice mass was also observed and the author attributed this to negative added mass and drift force because of standing waves between the tanker and the ice mass tsarau et al 2014 towed a cylinder structure past a fixed submerged sphere ice mass at different speeds and separation distances in calm water the associated hydrodynamic forces varied between positive and negative depending on the separation distance between the cylinder and the sphere kim 2014 conducted drop tests of laboratory grown ice blocks onto stiffened steel panels in air and impact tests in water with a moored structure and ice blocks towed at two different speeds the objective was to investigate simultaneous inelastic deformations of ice and steel structure and the drop tests in air helped to separate associated hydrodynamic aspects mcgovern and bai 2014a conducted model tests to investigate the kinematics of isolated ice floes of different sizes and shapes in regular waves the motions observed for ice floes were found to be different than those of icebergs because of flat low draft geometry of ice floes at wavelength to characteristic length ratio of 3 3 5 the floe behaved like a fluid particle mcgovern and bai 2014b also investigated the presence of a circular cylinder on the kinematics of ice floes in regular and irregular waves at separation distance to cylinder diameter ratio less than 10 increase in heave response and significant reduction in surge response was observed the mean drift velocities also showed low and negative values as the ice floe approached head on towards the cylinder sayeed et al 2017b measured the wave loads on different sized spherical ice masses at different proximity to a fixed structure using a six component dynamometer the experimental results showed that the separation distance to wavelength ratio dictates the corresponding wave loads in surge and heave directions the mean drift force in the horizontal direction becomes negative against the direction of wave propagation for most of the cases when the body is close to the structure also as the body is positioned closer to the structure the non dimensional rms forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the non dimensional rms forces in the vertical direction increase sayeed et al 2018 measured the wave induced motions of different sized free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure the experimental results of motion data showed excellent correlation with the force data gathered in the first phase sayeed et al 2017b similar to previous studies the separation distance to wavelength ratio is shown to dictate the corresponding wave induced motions the motions are increased or decreased at nodes and antinodes of the standing wave in front of the structure at nodes the surge motions are increased and heave motions are decreased and at antinodes the surge motions are decreased and heave motions are increased as the body gets close to the structure the surge motion slows and at the same time the heave motion is increased most of the numerical studies that have been used to model the near field hydrodynamic interaction problem have utilized potential flow theory which assumes inviscid and irrotational flow isaacson and stritto 1986 developed a diffraction theory model with oscillatory and drift motions to investigate the two body interaction problem cheung 1987 and isaacson and cheung 1988a 1988b used their potential flow code and observed an increase in added mass as separation distance decreased lever and sen 1987 utilized linear potential flow theory developed by sen 1983 to conduct risk analysis of iceberg impact considering wave induced motions into account lever et al 1988a and attwood 1987 validated the results from linear potential theory using wave induced motion data from wave tank experiments various hydrodynamic aspects such as added mass wave induced oscillatory motion and modification of iceberg motion due to the presence of a structure during iceberg impact are investigated by mctaggart 1989 using a potential flow numerical model isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b conducted experiments to investigate iceberg drift in proximity with offshore structures and compared the results with a potential flow based numerical model for the current only cases agreement was reasonable for velocity ratios but the numerical model under predicted impact eccentricities for the cases with waves only the numerical results followed the experimental trend except for one condition for a case of combined wave current specifically with larger waves the numerical results significantly under predicted the berg velocity when compared with the experimental data chernetsov et al 2008 proposed two types of spar substructure spar classic and spar ring equipped with mooring systems that can resist ice floe and iceberg impact diffraction theory used in dynamic simulation showed considerable reduction in iceberg approach velocity before contact and impact force was further reduced because of hydrodynamic interaction during contact tsarau et al 2014 combined discrete element and boundary element methods to predict body movements with potential flow in multi body dynamics the numerical model when compared with experimental data predicted qualitative results for large separation distance accurate estimates for moderate distance and overestimates for very small 0 01 m separation distance su et al 2016 investigated the kinematics of an ice floe approaching a circular cylinder using a time domain potential flow model and compared the results with mcgovern and bai 2014b the added mass and damping forces are calculated using the commercial potential flow code wamit and diffraction forces are approximated assuming a small body in waves the simulation results agreed quite well with experiments except in the close proximity to the cylinder prior to impact the numerical model cannot capture the reductions in surge velocity due to near vicinity hydrodynamic interaction few studies are found using commercial software ls dyna and its ale formulation to model the hydrodynamic behavior of floating bergy bits during a collision lee et al 2010 investigated the effects of the geometry of the iceberg striking face and the water layer entrapped between an iceberg and a lngc during the collision process lee and nguyen 2011 modeled bow shoulder and side collision responses between a lngc and a cubic iceberg considering wave making of the lngc and relative drift velocity taking the hydrodynamic water pressure into account gagnon and wang 2012 conducted numerical simulations of a tanker collision with a bergy bit including hydrodynamics a crushable foam ice model and a collision model sustaining deformation and damage song et al 2015 used the ale formulation in ls dyna to model a towed bergy bit deformable body impact with a target structural panel rigid body all of these simulations were conducted in calm water wave driven iceberg and bergy bit interaction and impact with a structure is far more complicated tsarau et al 2015 some potential alternative numerical methods to model iceberg structure hydrodynamic interaction are presented by sayeed et al 2017a only three cases of rans based cfd codes used for studying iceberg drift are found in the literature bai et al 2017 studied the kinematics of small ice floes in regular waves and compared with the experimental results of mcgovern and bai 2014a using linear potential flow model hydrostar and viscous flow cfd model openfoam it was found that the surge and heave raos are overestimated by the linear potential flow model whereas the cfd results showed reasonably accurate comparison with experimental data sayeed et al 2017b 2018 compared some of the experimental test cases with rans based cfd code flow3d the force results match quite well with experimental data showing the highest and lowest forces at different locations from the structure for the motion simulations flow3d shows good ability to capture the hydrodynamic interaction effect of a small moving body approaching a fixed structure the velocity changes at node and antinode locations in front of the structure are also well captured by the numerical simulations all of these cfd simulations are conducted in regular waves and no reference was found in the literature that studied the iceberg structure interaction in random waves using viscous flow cfd models design codes such as iso 19906 iso 19906 2010 stipulate that ice movement due to waves should be considered but they do not have specific guidelines for hydrodynamic effects in close vicinity to structure for example iso 19906 states hydrodynamic effects associated with ice feature motions in the vicinity of the structure can be considerable especially in conditions where the ice concentration is low and relatively small ice features are impacting wide structures due to hydrodynamic effects smaller ice features can slow down as they approach and tend to move around the structure consideration should be given to added mass of the impacting ice feature with due account for the presence of the seabed and the structure when the structure moves sufficiently during the course of the interaction its added mass should also be considered thus it is evident that the prediction of iceberg impact forces could be substantially improved through a better understanding of the influence of hydrodynamic interaction in the very near field region in summary the literature indicates that wave and hydrodynamic effects do influence the motions of small bodies in proximity to larger bodies the purpose of this study is to establish whether or not wave reflection is a significant factor in influencing impact velocities for small iceberg impacts with structures and to establish the relative magnitude of these effects with this objective in mind multi phase experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate near field hydrodynamic interaction of a small moving body towards a large fixed structure the present study is a continuation of previous works by sayeed et al 2017b 2018 both of these works were conducted in regular waves the next logical step after investigating the wave forces and wave induced motions in regular waves is to investigate the phenomenon in irregular waves it is also interesting to know whether the observations found in regular waves will still hold in irregular sea and whether linear superposition theory may be applicable to identify the motion statistics in irregular waves similar to previous studies sayeed et al 2017b 2018 flow science inc version 11 1 complimentary numerical simulations are conducted in irregular waves for selected test cases using the commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 as this study is exploratory in nature and seeks to identify and quantify the phenomena all data is maintained at model scale but non dimensionalized for scaling 2 experimental program the current set of experiments involved the measurement of wave forces on ice masses at different proximity to a fixed structure and the measurement of motions of the free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure in irregular waves the objective of these experiments is to identify the change in wave forces and velocity profiles due to the presence of the structure some tests are also conducted to measure the spatial distribution of significant wave heights up to a distance of 2 m in front of the structure at locations 10 cm apart 2 1 facility the experiments were conducted in the towing tank of the ocean engineering research center oerc at memorial university of newfoundland mun in st john s nl canada the towing tank is 58 m long and 4 5 m wide with maximum still water depth of 2 2 m the tank is equipped with a hydraulically actuated wave board on one side and a wave absorbing beach on the other side 2 2 models and instrumentation a hexagonal aluminium cylinder of 0 5 m diameter was used as the fixed offshore structure the scale ratio is nominally 1 50 thus a notional full scale structure diameter is 25 m three spheres with diameters of 0 152 m 0 203 m and 0 305 m were used to represent different size ice masses the ratios of ice mass diameters to the fixed structure diameter are 0 3 0 4 and 0 6 respectively for the force experiments a six component global force balance referred to as the nserc global dynamometer macneil 2011 macneil 2011 was used the dynamometer consists of six load cells of 4447 n 1 in x direction 2 in y direction and 3 in z direction each individual load cell of the dynamometer was calibrated and the predicted load by each load cell had less than 1 error a rigid adapter was fabricated to attach the sphere to the dynamometer without introducing vibration two capacitance type wave probes were used to measure the wave profile of the incoming and reflected stationary waves as part of a data quality check before conducting experiments both the dynamometer and the required waves were calibrated for the motion experiments the same spheres and fixed structure were used in addition a cylindrical model of the same diameter of the medium sphere and 0 098 m high was tested to investigate possible shape effect the center of gravity for each model was experimentally measured and theoretically calculated table 1 shows the vertical center of gravity for each model from the top of the model being considered qualisys optical tracking system was used to measure the rigid body motions in 6 degrees of freedom qualisys is an optical tracking system that utilizes infrared cameras to track target markers to measure the 6 dof motions of the model three infrared cameras were mounted and calibrated to cover the desired field view three capacitance type wave probes were used to measure the wave profile of the incoming and reflected stationary waves one wave probe was placed far upstream to measure the incoming wave profile and two probes were used on two sides in front of the structure so that the models do not touch the probes during the experiment as part of a data quality check before conducting experiments both the qualisys cameras and the required waves were calibrated fig 1 shows the layout of the experimental set up in the towing tank with dimensions and coordinate system the top figure shows the schematic of the force experiments and the bottom figure shows the schematic for motion experiments the forces and distances are considered positive in the direction of wave propagation in x direction and positive upward in z direction in addition videos were recorded during motion experiments and digital still photographs were taken for both experiments 2 3 environment the towing tank water depth was 1 8 m five irregular waves of different significant wave heights and periods were used jonswap spectrum was used to generate the irregular sea as used by several researchers mak et al 1990 isaacson and mctaggart 1990b mcgovern and bai 2014b mak et al 1990 isaacson and mctaggart 1990b mcgovern and bai 2014b the peak enhancement factor γ of 2 2 was used the wave spectra were selected to cover the range of dominant wavelengths covered by the regular wave tests but were not otherwise matched to any particular wave condition the duration of the generated spectrums was 2 min the irregular wave particulars are given in table 2 both the results of spectral and zero crossing analyses are given here the spectral density is obtained by smoothing the modified periodogram of the total record the results of the spectral analysis are considered for the further data analysis the peak frequency wavelength λ p is calculated using the dispersion relationship of linear wave theory 2 4 methodology the fixed structure model was placed in the tank and filled with water ballast the structure was also clamped against a fixed cross tank platform to avoid any movement the spheres were ballasted with paraffin wax of density 870 k g m 3 to provide neutral buoyancy at the correct draft the cylindrical model was made by stacking and bonding polypropylene circular blocks in the present study an array of four stationary wave probes as shown in fig 2 were used to measure the spatial distribution of wave heights in front of the structure the closest distance was 4 cm ahead of the structure and the probes were 10 cm apart another wave probe was placed far upstream and close to the wave board the probes were attached to the carriage and the carriage was moved to change the locations of the probes a total distance of 2 m in front of the structure was covered for the force experiments the sphere was mounted with the rigid adapter to the dynamometer and the draft was adjusted to the required level of submersion when filled with wax there was little gap on top inside the sphere and there was a small socket on top of the sphere which was used to attach the rod the iceberg freeboard was approximately 0 2 diameter of the sphere from top of the sphere experiments were carried out for the spheres alone and for each sphere at different separation distances from the fixed structure besides experiments in irregular waves several calm water cases were tested to measure the static load on the sphere and also the load of the adapter only the number of distances covered for large medium and small spheres are six five and four respectively the separation distance was measured from the face of the fixed structure to the center of the sphere the closest distance to the structure for each sphere was determined by moving the carriage as close to the structure as possible without the live end beam of the dynamometer touching the structure several repeat experiments were conducted for data validation for the motion experiments the ice model motions are restrained to vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and a light weight carbon rod on top of the sphere moreover the spheres were ballasted by inserting a rod at the bottom of the spheres with small weights at the end to avoid excessive pitch motions and to extract controlled surge and heave motions subjected to irregular waves optical tracking system qualysis was used to track the motions in six degrees of freedom four light weight reflective passive marker balls were installed on the rod attached to the sphere the marker balls were arranged in such a manner that there is no shadowing of multiple markers when the model rotates and the markers can be seen distinctively by the cameras the model was held at the release distance from the structure and then was let go after few seconds the initial release distance was measured from the face of the fixed structure to the center of the sphere the release distances were 2 m for the cylinder medium and large spheres and 1 6 m for the small sphere since this sphere takes longer time to travel than the other two spheres each test duration was about 2 min to avoid possible contamination of the data due to reflections coming from the beach the waiting time in between tests was about 15 min to let the tank settle and minimize the residual current once the tests with the structure were finished the structure was taken out of the tank and the models were tested in a similar fashion without the presence of the structure the release locations for no structure cases were maintained to be the same as for the test cases with the structure a number of repeat tests were conducted to validate and to identify reliability on motion results froude scaling was used as this is the most suitable scaling law where surface waves are the dominant mechanism all of the studies related to free floating ice masses and ice floes used the same scaling law isaacson and mctaggart 1990a lever et al 1990a 1990b mak et al 1990 colbourne et al 1998 mcgovern and bai 2014a 2014b etc also since three identical shapes of sphere of different sizes are tested it is expected that the damping effects associated with reynolds dissimilitude would be small attwood 1987 lever et al 1988a mcgovern and bai 2014a attwood 1987 lever et al 1988a mcgovern and bai 2014a the test matrices for both experiments are given in tables 3 and 4 fig 3 shows the experimental set up for both force and motion experiments the left figure shows the set up for force experiments including the dynamometer the fixed structure the large sphere attached by the adapter and the wave probe for reflected waves the right figure shows the set up for motion experiments including the fixed structure the medium sphere with qualisys markers arranged on top and the wave probes for reflected waves 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave data fig 4 shows the spatial variation of non dimensional significant wave heights in front of the structure significant wave height is calculated as 4 t o t a l s p e c t r a l v a r i a n c e it is obvious the presence of the structure has significant influence on the measured significant wave heights at different locations away from the structure this influence decays after a distance of d λ p 0 5 it is to be noted that the significant wave height increases significantly close to the structure this is due to the standing wave in front of the structure generated by the superposition of incident and reflected peak frequency wave the standing wave pattern is also similar to linear wave theory demonstrating the nodes and antinodes at expected locations the pattern becomes less pronounced as the waves get longer and this can be associated with lower levels of reflection from the structure for the longer waves fig 5 shows the change in wave spectrum at five different locations away from the structure for wave λ p d s 6 4 it also includes the wave spectrum for no structure case d λ p it is evident that there is significant change in wave energy content spatially due to the structure presence wave energy is lower at node d λ p 0 25 and comparatively higher at antinode d λ p 0 51 also beyond d λ p 0 25 the wave energy keeps increasing as we go close to the structure these observations are comparable to those reported in klopman and van der meer 1999 it may be inferred from the present analysis that at the tested stationary locations in front of the structure the significant forces and motions for surge and heave will be increased or decreased at the node and antinode locations in front of the structure also the significant heave forces and motions will increase and significant surge forces and motions will decrease as the body gets close to the structure 3 2 rao analysis from regular wave data sayeed et al 2017b in this section the force measurements of the sphere d i d s 0 6 tested at six different locations away from the structure in regular waves sayeed et al 2017b are utilized along with the wave measurements in irregular waves presented in section 3 1 to derive the corresponding force spectrum in irregular waves the square of the force rao of a particular frequency is multiplied by the wave energy at that frequency same procedure is followed for all the frequencies and surge and heave force spectrums are obtained finally from the surge and heave force spectrum the significant surge and heave forces are calculated figs 6 and 7 show the variation of non dimensional significant surge and heave forces respectively as a function of d λ p for the five irregular waves it is evident that beyond the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 the significant surge force goes down and significant heave force goes up as the body gets close to the structure 3 3 analysis of force data the data measured included time series of forces in x y and z directions from the dynamometer and the wave profiles from the wave probes the fx force is considered positive in the direction of wave travel and the fz force is positive upward for analyzing the data a segment time series of raw data of fx and fz forces were selected after initial transient values had passed any static offset was removed to yield wave loads only since the waves were symmetrical about the centreline of the tank the forces in y direction were negligible and not analyzed as part of the study a butterworth low pass filter was applied to the raw data to filter out high frequency noise fig 8 shows two typical wave cases during the experiment fig 9 shows the analyzed time series segment of raw fx and fz force data for sphere d i d s 0 6 located at d d i 7 2 tested in wave λ p d s 4 9 the mean fz forces are acting downwards since the majority portion of the sphere is submerged these results are typical in form for all the raw data collected during the experiments figs 10 and 11 show the time series segment of filtered data of fx and fz forces for sphere d i d s 0 4 for the no structure case d d i and the with structure case when the sphere is located at d d i 1 5 respectively both tested in wave λ p d s 6 4 there are some difference in force magnitude and profile for both cases but no attempt was made to compare the results in time domain for the frequency domain analysis fx and fz force spectrums were calculated from the corresponding filtered time segment of fx and fz force data figs 12 and 13 show the fx and fz force spectrum at five different locations away from the structure for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested in wave λ p d s 8 4 these figures also include the force spectrums for no structure case d λ p there is not much change in energy content of fx force spectrum due to the proximity effect at the same time it is evident that there is significant change in energy content spatially in fz force spectrum due to the structure presence finally from the force spectrum the significant surge and heave forces were calculated and the results were compared to investigate the changes in significant wave load on the sphere at different separation distances from the structure the significant forces are normalized with respect to the significant forces measured with no structure case and the separation distance is considered as a fraction of the peak frequency wavelength figs 14 and 15 show these non dimensional results for all the spheres tested in five irregular waves it is apparent from these plots that the non dimensional significant forces depend on the separation distance normalized by the peak frequency wavelength this finding is similar to the findings of sayeed et al 2017b where non dimensional wave forces in regular waves were dictated by separation distance to wavelength ratio this can be explained in terms of standing wave theory which also exists in irregular waves by the superposition of incident and reflected peak frequency wave the normalized forces are also increased or decreased at nodal location d λ p 0 25 and when the sphere is positioned closer to the structure beyond this nodal point the non dimensional significant surge force goes down and the non dimensional significant heave force goes up this proximity effect seems to be more dominant in vertical forces than the horizontal forces and the effect decays gradually when d λ p 0 5 3 4 analysis of free floating motion data experiments are conducted with the three spherical and one cylindrical model subjected to five irregular waves the models are tested with and without structure and motions are captured using qualisys the data measured included time series of full 6 dof motions and the wave profiles from the wave probes the models are restrained to vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and also further ballasted to minimize pitch motions only surge and heave motion data are considered for the present analysis the distance in the surge direction is considered positive in the direction of wave travel and the heave displacement is positive upward a butterworth low pass filter was applied to the raw data to filter out high frequency noise fig 16 shows two typical irregular wave cases during the experiment the 6 dof motion data are resolved to the center of gravity for each model the structure face location in x direction is considered as the origin the time series of raw data for surge and heave motions for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested without the structure in wave λ p d s 6 8 is shown in fig 17 surge and heave displacements are differentiated to calculate corresponding surge and heave velocity figs 18 and 19 show the time series of surge and heave velocity for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without structure and sphere d i d s 0 3 tested with structure respectively in wave λ p d s 6 4 both figures also include results from repeat tests it is to be noted that during these experiments the wave phases were not matched while releasing the models as part of the experimental procedure each model was placed in the initial starting position and held for few seconds to let a few wave cycles pass by and insure that reflections are developed from the structure in all test cases in irregular waves the models eventually go forward and hit the structure from these free floating tests there is not enough data at specific location in front of structure to compare the spatial velocity change due to the presence of the structure this is because of the insufficient data at specific location to collect the motion responses for all the frequencies in the spectrum figs 20 and 21 show the comparison of surge and heave velocity plotted against d d i for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested with and without structure in wave λ p d s 3 9 and for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested with and without structure in wave λ p d s 8 4 since release conditions were not matched except for the initial starting location this time series comparison doesn t provide much quantifiable information regarding the spatial velocity change because of the structure presence there is a local discrepancy in the separation distance when the value is very small close to the structure as the minimum value should be d di 0 5 but smaller values are present due to errors from the motion measuring system in the region near the structure these errors are thought to be associated with the motions of the qualisys reflectors close to the structure next from the time series of surge and heave velocity the velocity spectrums were calculated and the significant surge and heave velocities were compared for with and without structure conditions figs 22 and 23 show the comparison of surge and heave velocity spectrum for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested in wave λ p d s 6 8 the corresponding significant velocities v h for surge and heave are also given in table 5 it is to be noted that there is small difference in velocity spectrum due to the presence of the structure figs 24 and 25 show the non dimensional significant velocities for surge and heave respectively for all the tested models in all irregular wave conditions the significant velocities are non dimensinalized by the significant velocities of no structure cases although the differences are small in general the significant surge velocities go down and the significant heave velocities increase due to structure presence and the effect is more dominant in heave direction 4 numerical investigation some numerical simulations have been conducted for selected experimental test cases using commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 the objective is to investigate the capability of a cfd tool to capture close proximity multi body hydrodynamic problem flow3d is a general purpose cfd code which utilizes the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to solve the fluid flow problems the computational flow domain divides the physical space into a number of small rectangular volumes called cells or brick elements the cells are connected with several nodes which store the values of unknown variables such as pressure temperature and velocity using a finite difference approach a structured type computational mesh block is formed flow 3d also allows non uniform grid spacing which helps to mesh complex flow domains solid body geometry is defined by a technique named favor fractional area volume obstacle representation using this technique the area fraction on the cell faces and the volume fraction available for fluid flow are calculated for each cell flow3d utilizes volume of fluid method called truvof for free surface tracking a general moving object gmo modeling option allows rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom which is used in the present study the wave boundary condition allows wave generation of linear stokes waves and random irregular waves at the inlet boundary flow science inc version 11 1 a wave damping region called the sponge layer can be used in the outlet to absorb waves and reduce reflections at the outflow boundary flow3d has been used by several researchers for different fluid flow and free surface problems e g bhinder et al 2009 thanyamanta et al 2011 maguire 2011 sayeed et al 2017b bhinder et al 2009 sayeed et al 2017b 2018 numerical results from flow3d are compared with the current experimental data 4 1 numerical test case set up the sphere d i d s 0 6 and three irregular waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 are selected as test cases for the present numerical study the width and height of the numerical tank was 4 5 and 2 5 m respectively and initial fluid elevation was 1 8 m the boundary conditions applied are xmin wave xmax outflow ymin and ymax wall zmin wall and zmax specified pressure an additional wave absorbing component was added before outflow boundary to reduce wave reflections from the boundary and to maintain fluid volume in the domain a uniform grid size of 0 025 m was used in the free surface region first of all a 2d simulation was conducted to match the significant heights and peak periods of irregular waves once the desired waves were matched then 3d simulation was conducted using the hexagonal fixed structure as a non moving object and the sphere as a moving object fig 26 shows the mesh grid for 2d simulation top and the computational domain with sphere and hexagonal structure along with boundary conditions bottom the general moving object gmo modeling option was used to allow coupled motions in x and z translation only surge and heave the mass properties of the sphere were edited accordingly without modeling the top or bottom rods used in the experiment incompressible one fluid flow mode was selected with free surface or sharp interface tracking the implicit gmres pressure solver and explicit viscous stress solver was used first order momentum advection was selected and the split lagrangian method was used to resolve volume of fluid advection two equation k ε model was used as turbulence model with dynamically computed maximum turbulent mixing length the built in automatic time step control in flow3d was used which ensures the stability limits for the solver 4 2 numerical results the total number of cells was 4 4 million and associated simulation time varied between 17 and 20 h the numerical simulations were run for 60 s and compared with time series of the corresponding experimental data fig 27 shows the time series comparison of wave height and corresponding spectrum for wave λ p d s 6 4 between experiment and 2d simulation of flow3d table 6 shows the comparison of significant wave heights and peak periods between experiment and 2d simulation of flow3d for the three selected irregular wave cases there are small differences in flow3d generated irregular wave time series when compared with experimental data it is not possible in flow 3d to provide a time series irregular wave input it is only possible to provide the wave spectral characteristics and the program then generates a time series that matches the specified spectrum thus a direct wave by wave comparison is not possible between the experimental and numerical cases 4 2 1 force simulation results at the beginning of numerical investigation and before conducting the force experiments one test case sphere d i d s 0 6 and irregular wave λ p d s 6 4 was simulated without structure and at nine different locations away from the structure when the force experiments were conducted later the distances were not same as the numerical test cases and the computer resources for flow3d were not available after the experiments figs 28 and 29 show the comparison of the non dimensional significant surge and heave forces plotted against d λ p for the sphere d i d s 0 6 in irregular wave λ p d s 6 4 the comparisons between the experimental data and numerical simulations at different locations match reasonably well especially when the sphere is located at close proximity to the structure d λ p 0 3 the numerical simulations also capture the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 and the corresponding fx and fz force trends quite well it is to be noted that numerical simulations did not include the attached rod used during experiments besides there are differences in wave heights generated between the experimental facility and the numerical wave tank also the numerical results in the far field d λ p 0 3 show large differences especially in fz force when compared with experimental data 4 2 2 free floating motion simulation results fig 30 shows the time series comparison of surge displacement of the sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without structure in irregular waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 the results show some difference in average drift velocity between experiment and numerical simulation which is expected due to the modeling difference in the numerical simulations the numerical simulations were conducted for surge and heave only without allowing any pitch motion whereas the physical model experienced some pitch motions also the physical model has a rod and small mass attached to it at the bottom of the model which is not practical to model numerically due to the requirement of very small grid size it is also to be noted that only initial starting locations were matched between the experiment and numerical simulations the other factor of initial wave phase was not experimentally tracked and thus not necessarily the same as the numerical simulations figs 31 33 show the time series comparison of surge and heave velocities between experiment and numerical simulation for the sphere tested without structure in waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 respectively the corresponding surge and heave significant velocities are also given in the plots the numerical results show reasonable agreement with experimental results despite the modeling difference in the numerical simulations the discrepancy with the experimental results in heave velocities is generally more significant than the discrepancy in surge velocities the numerical predictions are generally thought to be lower in surge due to the previously mentioned keel on the physical model and in heave because of the highly non linear heave force associated with the low freeboard of the iceberg model which appears to be not well captured in the numerical model fig 34 shows the time series comparison of surge displacement of the sphere tested with structure in waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 the results show reasonable agreement except for the wave λ p d s 4 9 for which the difference in average drift velocity between experiment and numerical simulation is high figs 35 37 show the surge and heave velocities as a function of d d i between experiment and numerical simulation for the sphere tested with structure in waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 respectively the corresponding surge and heave significant velocities are also given in the plots the numerical results show some discrepancy with experiment which is more pronounced for heave velocities in addition to the previously identified differences in the physical and numerical models another reason for this discrepancy is that the wave phases are not matched between experiment and numerical simulations 5 summary and conclusions the hydrodynamic interaction between an iceberg or a bergy bit and an offshore structure when the two are in close proximity is an important factor that governs the impact speed and consequently the input energy of potential collisions in order to understand the phenomenon both experimental and numerical studies have been conducted by sayeed et al 2017b 2018 to investigate the changes in wave loads and wave induced motions of ice masses near a fixed structure in regular waves this study completes the next logical step in investigating the phenomenon in irregular waves the objective is to investigate whether the observations found in regular waves will still hold in irregular sea and whether linear superposition theory may be applicable to identify the motion statistics in irregular waves first of all wave data is measured in front of the fixed structure for a total distance of 2 m and spatial distribution of significant wave heights are obtained for five irregular waves the significant wave heights follow a standing wave pattern generated by the superposition of incident and reflected peak frequency wave thus it may be inferred that the significant surge and heave forces and motions will be increased or decreased at the node and antinode locations in front of the structure the measured wave data is then utilized along with regular wave force data sayeed et al 2017b to generate force spectrums at the six tested locations of the sphere d i d s 0 6 non dimensional significant forces in horizontal and vertical directions obtained from these force spectra showed that the significant surge force goes down and significant heave force goes up as the body gets closer to the structure beyond the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 measurements of wave forces on three spherical ice masses at different proximity to the fixed structure in irregular waves demonstrate the change in significant wave loads is based on separation distance to peak wavelength ratio also as the body is positioned closer to the structure the normalized significant forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the normalized significant forces in the vertical direction increase the proximity effect on wave loads in the vertical direction is found to be more dominant than the same in the horizontal direction both the force data derived from linear superposition and the force data measured directly show similar trends but significantly different magnitudes with the directly measured data showing lower force magnitudes in the near structure regions we attribute this to non linear effects when multiple wave frequencies act simultaneously leading to reduced forces thus the increase in fz and the decrease in fx tend to be smoothed in the irregular wave cases and linear superposition in neglecting non linearities and cross frequency effects tends to over predict the force changes free floating motion experiments of three spherical and one cylindrical ice masses approaching a fixed structure showed small difference in surge and heave velocity spectrum due to the presence of the structure this is because there is not enough data at specific location to collect the motion responses for all the frequencies in the spectrum again the proximity effect appears to be more on heave motions than in surge motions numerical investigations were conducted using rans based commercial cfd code flow3d selected test cases from both force and motion experiments are simulated in irregular waves generated from selected experimental spectrum some differences were observed between experimental and simulated results especially in drift velocities the challenges currently lie in the proper modeling of geometry and mass properties of the physical model considering the limitations of computational resources associated with large mesh requirements and the associated long computational times however the simulation results for irregular waves show the capability to simulate random waves and force and motion results in irregular waves are also reasonable showing the expected trends the effects of proximity in irregular seas are not as pronounced as those observed for regular waves due to the multiple frequencies and wavelengths present in an irregular wave train however the effects remain and are discernible with slight decrease in surge force motions and significant increase in heave force motions for proximities very close to the fixed structure reductions in surge drift and wave induced motions could lead to reduced impact forces while increases in heave motions may have implications for potential impacts with topsides and overhanging structures acknowledgements the authors would

michael hinchey for their valuable technical discussions finally supports from national research council ocre research center are highly appreciated 
23254,this paper is the third of a series covering investigations of the wave induced force and motion behavior of ice masses near a fixed structure the objective of this phase of the study was to determine whether the effects observed in regular waves sayeed et al 2017b 2018 still held in irregular seas in the present case wave characteristics measured in front of the fixed structure showed that the significant wave heights follow a standing wave pattern generated by the superposition of the incident and reflected peak frequency wave thus it may be inferred that the significant surge and heave forces and motions will be increased or decreased at the node and antinode locations in front of the structure as previously observed for regular waves force spectra generated from regular wave force data sayeed et al 2017b and wave measurements from the present study showed that beyond the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 the significant surge force goes down and significant heave force goes up as the body gets close to the structure direct measurements of irregular wave forces on a fixed berg model at different proximity to the fixed structure demonstrate the change in significant wave forces based on the ratio of separation distance to peak wavelength when the berg body is positioned closer to the fixed structure the normalized significant forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the normalized significant forces in the vertical direction increase significant differences were found between the directly measured force spectra and those produced by linear superposition of regular wave force transfer functions this is attributed to non linear effects arising from the iceberg profile and low freeboard free floating motion experiments showed smaller differences in the surge and heave velocity spectra due to the presence of the structure this is because there is insufficient motion data at any specific location to capture the motion responses for all the frequencies in the spectrum the proximity effect on wave loads and wave induced motions in the vertical direction is found to be more pronounced than the same in the horizontal direction numerical simulations using rans based commercial cfd code flow3d are compared to the experimental results selected test cases from both force and motion experiments are simulated in irregular waves generated from selected experimental wave spectra numerical results for irregular waves demonstrate the ability to simulate random waves and resulting forces and motions with trends comparable to the experimental results keywords iceberg bergy bit irregular waves hydrodynamic interaction offshore structure wave body interaction 1 introduction fixed and floating offshore structures in arctic and sub arctic regions face unique challenge in their structural design because of the unique environmental loading by various glacial ice fragments fixed structures are designed to withstand large iceberg impacts whereas floating structures can avoid interaction with large icebergs by moving off location wave driven small 1 000t 20 000t pieces of glacial ice bergy bit or growler are a potential hazard for offshore installations operating in ice infested waters smaller ice masses are also harder to detect in bad weather at night or in heavy seas the wave induced motion of smaller ice masses can substantially exceed their mean drift speed attwood 1987 estimation of impact load arising from wave driven ice masses with offshore structures is heavily dependent on the input collision energy and collision energy is largely dependent on the final velocity prior to impact the close proximity hydrodynamic interaction between an iceberg or a bergy bit and an offshore structure is an important factor that influences the impact velocity sayeed et al 2017a conducted a comprehensive review to identify the significance of hydrodynamic interaction of ice masses in close proximity with arctic offshore structures just prior to impact and also to identify related research gaps in this area a potential research gap exists in the study of the viscosity dominated very near field region where several complicated phenomena such as negative wave drift force against the direction of propagation of the waves fluid cushioning wave shadowing reduction in impact velocity change in added mass hydrodynamic damping eccentric impact etc have been observed in several physical model test programs these effects are more obvious for less transparent fixed or floating offshore structures such as gravity base structures or large ship shaped production platforms and for smaller ice masses and bergy bits change in impact velocity could conceivably change the failure mode of ice ductile transition or brittle thus changing the effective pressure ignoring these effects may result in an overestimation in impact load which will ultimately affect the design and cost of the structure a considerable volume of experimental work has been directed towards the iceberg structure interaction problem attwood 1987 and lever et al 1988a 1988b carried out a series of experiments and found that small icebergs behaved like a fluid particle for wave length iceberg size ratios greater than 13 salvalaggio and rojansky 1986 observed that no impact occurred if the iceberg diameter was less than approximately half the structure diameter lever et al 1990a extended their impact velocity probability statistics to include a number of different iceberg shapes lever et al 1990b conducted model tests of wave driven bergy bits impacting with a semi submersible in irregular waves mak et al 1990 conducted a similar study in regular and irregular waves with a floating oil production platform with larger physical dimensions than the transparent semi submersible tested by lever et al 1990b open water significant velocities were found to be 10 40 higher than significant impact velocities mctaggart 1989 and isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990c investigated the hydrodynamic forces during iceberg drift in proximity with an offshore structure through model tests and numerical analysis for the waves only condition no impact occurred when the ratio of iceberg diameter and structure diameter is less than or equal to 0 2 whereas salvalaggio and rojansky 1986 in their experiments found the ratio to be 0 5 it was reported that the presence of the structure can result in 10 or more velocity reduction for smaller icebergs iceberg structure diameter ratio less than 0 2 approaching the structure model experiments of the terra nova fpso in collision with an iceberg 100 000t and a bergy bit 3 600t conducted by colbourne et al 1998 revealed that impact energies may be reduced for the smaller bergs in higher sea states and it was speculated that the radiated waves in very near field region results in confused collision trends colbourne 2000 indicated that increased input wave energy did not lead to increasing impact energy for small ice pieces and postulated that the effect may be due to reflection of waves where the reflected wave energy reduced the berg velocity klopman and van der meer 1999 investigated the spatial variation of wave spectrum and significant wave height in front of a vertical wall and a rubble mound breakwater in random waves the significant wave heights show a standing wave pattern extending over two times the peak wavelength for the given jonswap spectrum the findings of nodal and antinodal frequencies follow the patterns of linear wave theory gagnon 2004 conducted physical model tests to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between a floating ice mass and a tanker passing at speed this study indicated that the radiation proximity effect arising from radiated waves and underwater pressure generated by the passing hull can be significant but this work did not directly consider collisions an increase in maximum sway motion of the ice mass was also observed and the author attributed this to negative added mass and drift force because of standing waves between the tanker and the ice mass tsarau et al 2014 towed a cylinder structure past a fixed submerged sphere ice mass at different speeds and separation distances in calm water the associated hydrodynamic forces varied between positive and negative depending on the separation distance between the cylinder and the sphere kim 2014 conducted drop tests of laboratory grown ice blocks onto stiffened steel panels in air and impact tests in water with a moored structure and ice blocks towed at two different speeds the objective was to investigate simultaneous inelastic deformations of ice and steel structure and the drop tests in air helped to separate associated hydrodynamic aspects mcgovern and bai 2014a conducted model tests to investigate the kinematics of isolated ice floes of different sizes and shapes in regular waves the motions observed for ice floes were found to be different than those of icebergs because of flat low draft geometry of ice floes at wavelength to characteristic length ratio of 3 3 5 the floe behaved like a fluid particle mcgovern and bai 2014b also investigated the presence of a circular cylinder on the kinematics of ice floes in regular and irregular waves at separation distance to cylinder diameter ratio less than 10 increase in heave response and significant reduction in surge response was observed the mean drift velocities also showed low and negative values as the ice floe approached head on towards the cylinder sayeed et al 2017b measured the wave loads on different sized spherical ice masses at different proximity to a fixed structure using a six component dynamometer the experimental results showed that the separation distance to wavelength ratio dictates the corresponding wave loads in surge and heave directions the mean drift force in the horizontal direction becomes negative against the direction of wave propagation for most of the cases when the body is close to the structure also as the body is positioned closer to the structure the non dimensional rms forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the non dimensional rms forces in the vertical direction increase sayeed et al 2018 measured the wave induced motions of different sized free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure the experimental results of motion data showed excellent correlation with the force data gathered in the first phase sayeed et al 2017b similar to previous studies the separation distance to wavelength ratio is shown to dictate the corresponding wave induced motions the motions are increased or decreased at nodes and antinodes of the standing wave in front of the structure at nodes the surge motions are increased and heave motions are decreased and at antinodes the surge motions are decreased and heave motions are increased as the body gets close to the structure the surge motion slows and at the same time the heave motion is increased most of the numerical studies that have been used to model the near field hydrodynamic interaction problem have utilized potential flow theory which assumes inviscid and irrotational flow isaacson and stritto 1986 developed a diffraction theory model with oscillatory and drift motions to investigate the two body interaction problem cheung 1987 and isaacson and cheung 1988a 1988b used their potential flow code and observed an increase in added mass as separation distance decreased lever and sen 1987 utilized linear potential flow theory developed by sen 1983 to conduct risk analysis of iceberg impact considering wave induced motions into account lever et al 1988a and attwood 1987 validated the results from linear potential theory using wave induced motion data from wave tank experiments various hydrodynamic aspects such as added mass wave induced oscillatory motion and modification of iceberg motion due to the presence of a structure during iceberg impact are investigated by mctaggart 1989 using a potential flow numerical model isaacson and mctaggart 1990a 1990b conducted experiments to investigate iceberg drift in proximity with offshore structures and compared the results with a potential flow based numerical model for the current only cases agreement was reasonable for velocity ratios but the numerical model under predicted impact eccentricities for the cases with waves only the numerical results followed the experimental trend except for one condition for a case of combined wave current specifically with larger waves the numerical results significantly under predicted the berg velocity when compared with the experimental data chernetsov et al 2008 proposed two types of spar substructure spar classic and spar ring equipped with mooring systems that can resist ice floe and iceberg impact diffraction theory used in dynamic simulation showed considerable reduction in iceberg approach velocity before contact and impact force was further reduced because of hydrodynamic interaction during contact tsarau et al 2014 combined discrete element and boundary element methods to predict body movements with potential flow in multi body dynamics the numerical model when compared with experimental data predicted qualitative results for large separation distance accurate estimates for moderate distance and overestimates for very small 0 01 m separation distance su et al 2016 investigated the kinematics of an ice floe approaching a circular cylinder using a time domain potential flow model and compared the results with mcgovern and bai 2014b the added mass and damping forces are calculated using the commercial potential flow code wamit and diffraction forces are approximated assuming a small body in waves the simulation results agreed quite well with experiments except in the close proximity to the cylinder prior to impact the numerical model cannot capture the reductions in surge velocity due to near vicinity hydrodynamic interaction few studies are found using commercial software ls dyna and its ale formulation to model the hydrodynamic behavior of floating bergy bits during a collision lee et al 2010 investigated the effects of the geometry of the iceberg striking face and the water layer entrapped between an iceberg and a lngc during the collision process lee and nguyen 2011 modeled bow shoulder and side collision responses between a lngc and a cubic iceberg considering wave making of the lngc and relative drift velocity taking the hydrodynamic water pressure into account gagnon and wang 2012 conducted numerical simulations of a tanker collision with a bergy bit including hydrodynamics a crushable foam ice model and a collision model sustaining deformation and damage song et al 2015 used the ale formulation in ls dyna to model a towed bergy bit deformable body impact with a target structural panel rigid body all of these simulations were conducted in calm water wave driven iceberg and bergy bit interaction and impact with a structure is far more complicated tsarau et al 2015 some potential alternative numerical methods to model iceberg structure hydrodynamic interaction are presented by sayeed et al 2017a only three cases of rans based cfd codes used for studying iceberg drift are found in the literature bai et al 2017 studied the kinematics of small ice floes in regular waves and compared with the experimental results of mcgovern and bai 2014a using linear potential flow model hydrostar and viscous flow cfd model openfoam it was found that the surge and heave raos are overestimated by the linear potential flow model whereas the cfd results showed reasonably accurate comparison with experimental data sayeed et al 2017b 2018 compared some of the experimental test cases with rans based cfd code flow3d the force results match quite well with experimental data showing the highest and lowest forces at different locations from the structure for the motion simulations flow3d shows good ability to capture the hydrodynamic interaction effect of a small moving body approaching a fixed structure the velocity changes at node and antinode locations in front of the structure are also well captured by the numerical simulations all of these cfd simulations are conducted in regular waves and no reference was found in the literature that studied the iceberg structure interaction in random waves using viscous flow cfd models design codes such as iso 19906 iso 19906 2010 stipulate that ice movement due to waves should be considered but they do not have specific guidelines for hydrodynamic effects in close vicinity to structure for example iso 19906 states hydrodynamic effects associated with ice feature motions in the vicinity of the structure can be considerable especially in conditions where the ice concentration is low and relatively small ice features are impacting wide structures due to hydrodynamic effects smaller ice features can slow down as they approach and tend to move around the structure consideration should be given to added mass of the impacting ice feature with due account for the presence of the seabed and the structure when the structure moves sufficiently during the course of the interaction its added mass should also be considered thus it is evident that the prediction of iceberg impact forces could be substantially improved through a better understanding of the influence of hydrodynamic interaction in the very near field region in summary the literature indicates that wave and hydrodynamic effects do influence the motions of small bodies in proximity to larger bodies the purpose of this study is to establish whether or not wave reflection is a significant factor in influencing impact velocities for small iceberg impacts with structures and to establish the relative magnitude of these effects with this objective in mind multi phase experimental and numerical studies have been undertaken to investigate near field hydrodynamic interaction of a small moving body towards a large fixed structure the present study is a continuation of previous works by sayeed et al 2017b 2018 both of these works were conducted in regular waves the next logical step after investigating the wave forces and wave induced motions in regular waves is to investigate the phenomenon in irregular waves it is also interesting to know whether the observations found in regular waves will still hold in irregular sea and whether linear superposition theory may be applicable to identify the motion statistics in irregular waves similar to previous studies sayeed et al 2017b 2018 flow science inc version 11 1 complimentary numerical simulations are conducted in irregular waves for selected test cases using the commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 as this study is exploratory in nature and seeks to identify and quantify the phenomena all data is maintained at model scale but non dimensionalized for scaling 2 experimental program the current set of experiments involved the measurement of wave forces on ice masses at different proximity to a fixed structure and the measurement of motions of the free floating ice masses approaching a fixed structure in irregular waves the objective of these experiments is to identify the change in wave forces and velocity profiles due to the presence of the structure some tests are also conducted to measure the spatial distribution of significant wave heights up to a distance of 2 m in front of the structure at locations 10 cm apart 2 1 facility the experiments were conducted in the towing tank of the ocean engineering research center oerc at memorial university of newfoundland mun in st john s nl canada the towing tank is 58 m long and 4 5 m wide with maximum still water depth of 2 2 m the tank is equipped with a hydraulically actuated wave board on one side and a wave absorbing beach on the other side 2 2 models and instrumentation a hexagonal aluminium cylinder of 0 5 m diameter was used as the fixed offshore structure the scale ratio is nominally 1 50 thus a notional full scale structure diameter is 25 m three spheres with diameters of 0 152 m 0 203 m and 0 305 m were used to represent different size ice masses the ratios of ice mass diameters to the fixed structure diameter are 0 3 0 4 and 0 6 respectively for the force experiments a six component global force balance referred to as the nserc global dynamometer macneil 2011 macneil 2011 was used the dynamometer consists of six load cells of 4447 n 1 in x direction 2 in y direction and 3 in z direction each individual load cell of the dynamometer was calibrated and the predicted load by each load cell had less than 1 error a rigid adapter was fabricated to attach the sphere to the dynamometer without introducing vibration two capacitance type wave probes were used to measure the wave profile of the incoming and reflected stationary waves as part of a data quality check before conducting experiments both the dynamometer and the required waves were calibrated for the motion experiments the same spheres and fixed structure were used in addition a cylindrical model of the same diameter of the medium sphere and 0 098 m high was tested to investigate possible shape effect the center of gravity for each model was experimentally measured and theoretically calculated table 1 shows the vertical center of gravity for each model from the top of the model being considered qualisys optical tracking system was used to measure the rigid body motions in 6 degrees of freedom qualisys is an optical tracking system that utilizes infrared cameras to track target markers to measure the 6 dof motions of the model three infrared cameras were mounted and calibrated to cover the desired field view three capacitance type wave probes were used to measure the wave profile of the incoming and reflected stationary waves one wave probe was placed far upstream to measure the incoming wave profile and two probes were used on two sides in front of the structure so that the models do not touch the probes during the experiment as part of a data quality check before conducting experiments both the qualisys cameras and the required waves were calibrated fig 1 shows the layout of the experimental set up in the towing tank with dimensions and coordinate system the top figure shows the schematic of the force experiments and the bottom figure shows the schematic for motion experiments the forces and distances are considered positive in the direction of wave propagation in x direction and positive upward in z direction in addition videos were recorded during motion experiments and digital still photographs were taken for both experiments 2 3 environment the towing tank water depth was 1 8 m five irregular waves of different significant wave heights and periods were used jonswap spectrum was used to generate the irregular sea as used by several researchers mak et al 1990 isaacson and mctaggart 1990b mcgovern and bai 2014b mak et al 1990 isaacson and mctaggart 1990b mcgovern and bai 2014b the peak enhancement factor γ of 2 2 was used the wave spectra were selected to cover the range of dominant wavelengths covered by the regular wave tests but were not otherwise matched to any particular wave condition the duration of the generated spectrums was 2 min the irregular wave particulars are given in table 2 both the results of spectral and zero crossing analyses are given here the spectral density is obtained by smoothing the modified periodogram of the total record the results of the spectral analysis are considered for the further data analysis the peak frequency wavelength λ p is calculated using the dispersion relationship of linear wave theory 2 4 methodology the fixed structure model was placed in the tank and filled with water ballast the structure was also clamped against a fixed cross tank platform to avoid any movement the spheres were ballasted with paraffin wax of density 870 k g m 3 to provide neutral buoyancy at the correct draft the cylindrical model was made by stacking and bonding polypropylene circular blocks in the present study an array of four stationary wave probes as shown in fig 2 were used to measure the spatial distribution of wave heights in front of the structure the closest distance was 4 cm ahead of the structure and the probes were 10 cm apart another wave probe was placed far upstream and close to the wave board the probes were attached to the carriage and the carriage was moved to change the locations of the probes a total distance of 2 m in front of the structure was covered for the force experiments the sphere was mounted with the rigid adapter to the dynamometer and the draft was adjusted to the required level of submersion when filled with wax there was little gap on top inside the sphere and there was a small socket on top of the sphere which was used to attach the rod the iceberg freeboard was approximately 0 2 diameter of the sphere from top of the sphere experiments were carried out for the spheres alone and for each sphere at different separation distances from the fixed structure besides experiments in irregular waves several calm water cases were tested to measure the static load on the sphere and also the load of the adapter only the number of distances covered for large medium and small spheres are six five and four respectively the separation distance was measured from the face of the fixed structure to the center of the sphere the closest distance to the structure for each sphere was determined by moving the carriage as close to the structure as possible without the live end beam of the dynamometer touching the structure several repeat experiments were conducted for data validation for the motion experiments the ice model motions are restrained to vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and a light weight carbon rod on top of the sphere moreover the spheres were ballasted by inserting a rod at the bottom of the spheres with small weights at the end to avoid excessive pitch motions and to extract controlled surge and heave motions subjected to irregular waves optical tracking system qualysis was used to track the motions in six degrees of freedom four light weight reflective passive marker balls were installed on the rod attached to the sphere the marker balls were arranged in such a manner that there is no shadowing of multiple markers when the model rotates and the markers can be seen distinctively by the cameras the model was held at the release distance from the structure and then was let go after few seconds the initial release distance was measured from the face of the fixed structure to the center of the sphere the release distances were 2 m for the cylinder medium and large spheres and 1 6 m for the small sphere since this sphere takes longer time to travel than the other two spheres each test duration was about 2 min to avoid possible contamination of the data due to reflections coming from the beach the waiting time in between tests was about 15 min to let the tank settle and minimize the residual current once the tests with the structure were finished the structure was taken out of the tank and the models were tested in a similar fashion without the presence of the structure the release locations for no structure cases were maintained to be the same as for the test cases with the structure a number of repeat tests were conducted to validate and to identify reliability on motion results froude scaling was used as this is the most suitable scaling law where surface waves are the dominant mechanism all of the studies related to free floating ice masses and ice floes used the same scaling law isaacson and mctaggart 1990a lever et al 1990a 1990b mak et al 1990 colbourne et al 1998 mcgovern and bai 2014a 2014b etc also since three identical shapes of sphere of different sizes are tested it is expected that the damping effects associated with reynolds dissimilitude would be small attwood 1987 lever et al 1988a mcgovern and bai 2014a attwood 1987 lever et al 1988a mcgovern and bai 2014a the test matrices for both experiments are given in tables 3 and 4 fig 3 shows the experimental set up for both force and motion experiments the left figure shows the set up for force experiments including the dynamometer the fixed structure the large sphere attached by the adapter and the wave probe for reflected waves the right figure shows the set up for motion experiments including the fixed structure the medium sphere with qualisys markers arranged on top and the wave probes for reflected waves 3 results and discussion 3 1 wave data fig 4 shows the spatial variation of non dimensional significant wave heights in front of the structure significant wave height is calculated as 4 t o t a l s p e c t r a l v a r i a n c e it is obvious the presence of the structure has significant influence on the measured significant wave heights at different locations away from the structure this influence decays after a distance of d λ p 0 5 it is to be noted that the significant wave height increases significantly close to the structure this is due to the standing wave in front of the structure generated by the superposition of incident and reflected peak frequency wave the standing wave pattern is also similar to linear wave theory demonstrating the nodes and antinodes at expected locations the pattern becomes less pronounced as the waves get longer and this can be associated with lower levels of reflection from the structure for the longer waves fig 5 shows the change in wave spectrum at five different locations away from the structure for wave λ p d s 6 4 it also includes the wave spectrum for no structure case d λ p it is evident that there is significant change in wave energy content spatially due to the structure presence wave energy is lower at node d λ p 0 25 and comparatively higher at antinode d λ p 0 51 also beyond d λ p 0 25 the wave energy keeps increasing as we go close to the structure these observations are comparable to those reported in klopman and van der meer 1999 it may be inferred from the present analysis that at the tested stationary locations in front of the structure the significant forces and motions for surge and heave will be increased or decreased at the node and antinode locations in front of the structure also the significant heave forces and motions will increase and significant surge forces and motions will decrease as the body gets close to the structure 3 2 rao analysis from regular wave data sayeed et al 2017b in this section the force measurements of the sphere d i d s 0 6 tested at six different locations away from the structure in regular waves sayeed et al 2017b are utilized along with the wave measurements in irregular waves presented in section 3 1 to derive the corresponding force spectrum in irregular waves the square of the force rao of a particular frequency is multiplied by the wave energy at that frequency same procedure is followed for all the frequencies and surge and heave force spectrums are obtained finally from the surge and heave force spectrum the significant surge and heave forces are calculated figs 6 and 7 show the variation of non dimensional significant surge and heave forces respectively as a function of d λ p for the five irregular waves it is evident that beyond the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 the significant surge force goes down and significant heave force goes up as the body gets close to the structure 3 3 analysis of force data the data measured included time series of forces in x y and z directions from the dynamometer and the wave profiles from the wave probes the fx force is considered positive in the direction of wave travel and the fz force is positive upward for analyzing the data a segment time series of raw data of fx and fz forces were selected after initial transient values had passed any static offset was removed to yield wave loads only since the waves were symmetrical about the centreline of the tank the forces in y direction were negligible and not analyzed as part of the study a butterworth low pass filter was applied to the raw data to filter out high frequency noise fig 8 shows two typical wave cases during the experiment fig 9 shows the analyzed time series segment of raw fx and fz force data for sphere d i d s 0 6 located at d d i 7 2 tested in wave λ p d s 4 9 the mean fz forces are acting downwards since the majority portion of the sphere is submerged these results are typical in form for all the raw data collected during the experiments figs 10 and 11 show the time series segment of filtered data of fx and fz forces for sphere d i d s 0 4 for the no structure case d d i and the with structure case when the sphere is located at d d i 1 5 respectively both tested in wave λ p d s 6 4 there are some difference in force magnitude and profile for both cases but no attempt was made to compare the results in time domain for the frequency domain analysis fx and fz force spectrums were calculated from the corresponding filtered time segment of fx and fz force data figs 12 and 13 show the fx and fz force spectrum at five different locations away from the structure for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested in wave λ p d s 8 4 these figures also include the force spectrums for no structure case d λ p there is not much change in energy content of fx force spectrum due to the proximity effect at the same time it is evident that there is significant change in energy content spatially in fz force spectrum due to the structure presence finally from the force spectrum the significant surge and heave forces were calculated and the results were compared to investigate the changes in significant wave load on the sphere at different separation distances from the structure the significant forces are normalized with respect to the significant forces measured with no structure case and the separation distance is considered as a fraction of the peak frequency wavelength figs 14 and 15 show these non dimensional results for all the spheres tested in five irregular waves it is apparent from these plots that the non dimensional significant forces depend on the separation distance normalized by the peak frequency wavelength this finding is similar to the findings of sayeed et al 2017b where non dimensional wave forces in regular waves were dictated by separation distance to wavelength ratio this can be explained in terms of standing wave theory which also exists in irregular waves by the superposition of incident and reflected peak frequency wave the normalized forces are also increased or decreased at nodal location d λ p 0 25 and when the sphere is positioned closer to the structure beyond this nodal point the non dimensional significant surge force goes down and the non dimensional significant heave force goes up this proximity effect seems to be more dominant in vertical forces than the horizontal forces and the effect decays gradually when d λ p 0 5 3 4 analysis of free floating motion data experiments are conducted with the three spherical and one cylindrical model subjected to five irregular waves the models are tested with and without structure and motions are captured using qualisys the data measured included time series of full 6 dof motions and the wave profiles from the wave probes the models are restrained to vertical plane motions only surge heave and pitch by two guide wires and also further ballasted to minimize pitch motions only surge and heave motion data are considered for the present analysis the distance in the surge direction is considered positive in the direction of wave travel and the heave displacement is positive upward a butterworth low pass filter was applied to the raw data to filter out high frequency noise fig 16 shows two typical irregular wave cases during the experiment the 6 dof motion data are resolved to the center of gravity for each model the structure face location in x direction is considered as the origin the time series of raw data for surge and heave motions for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested without the structure in wave λ p d s 6 8 is shown in fig 17 surge and heave displacements are differentiated to calculate corresponding surge and heave velocity figs 18 and 19 show the time series of surge and heave velocity for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without structure and sphere d i d s 0 3 tested with structure respectively in wave λ p d s 6 4 both figures also include results from repeat tests it is to be noted that during these experiments the wave phases were not matched while releasing the models as part of the experimental procedure each model was placed in the initial starting position and held for few seconds to let a few wave cycles pass by and insure that reflections are developed from the structure in all test cases in irregular waves the models eventually go forward and hit the structure from these free floating tests there is not enough data at specific location in front of structure to compare the spatial velocity change due to the presence of the structure this is because of the insufficient data at specific location to collect the motion responses for all the frequencies in the spectrum figs 20 and 21 show the comparison of surge and heave velocity plotted against d d i for sphere d i d s 0 4 tested with and without structure in wave λ p d s 3 9 and for cylinder d i d s 0 4 tested with and without structure in wave λ p d s 8 4 since release conditions were not matched except for the initial starting location this time series comparison doesn t provide much quantifiable information regarding the spatial velocity change because of the structure presence there is a local discrepancy in the separation distance when the value is very small close to the structure as the minimum value should be d di 0 5 but smaller values are present due to errors from the motion measuring system in the region near the structure these errors are thought to be associated with the motions of the qualisys reflectors close to the structure next from the time series of surge and heave velocity the velocity spectrums were calculated and the significant surge and heave velocities were compared for with and without structure conditions figs 22 and 23 show the comparison of surge and heave velocity spectrum for sphere d i d s 0 6 tested in wave λ p d s 6 8 the corresponding significant velocities v h for surge and heave are also given in table 5 it is to be noted that there is small difference in velocity spectrum due to the presence of the structure figs 24 and 25 show the non dimensional significant velocities for surge and heave respectively for all the tested models in all irregular wave conditions the significant velocities are non dimensinalized by the significant velocities of no structure cases although the differences are small in general the significant surge velocities go down and the significant heave velocities increase due to structure presence and the effect is more dominant in heave direction 4 numerical investigation some numerical simulations have been conducted for selected experimental test cases using commercial cfd software flow3d flow science inc version 11 1 the objective is to investigate the capability of a cfd tool to capture close proximity multi body hydrodynamic problem flow3d is a general purpose cfd code which utilizes the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations to solve the fluid flow problems the computational flow domain divides the physical space into a number of small rectangular volumes called cells or brick elements the cells are connected with several nodes which store the values of unknown variables such as pressure temperature and velocity using a finite difference approach a structured type computational mesh block is formed flow 3d also allows non uniform grid spacing which helps to mesh complex flow domains solid body geometry is defined by a technique named favor fractional area volume obstacle representation using this technique the area fraction on the cell faces and the volume fraction available for fluid flow are calculated for each cell flow3d utilizes volume of fluid method called truvof for free surface tracking a general moving object gmo modeling option allows rigid body motions in six degrees of freedom which is used in the present study the wave boundary condition allows wave generation of linear stokes waves and random irregular waves at the inlet boundary flow science inc version 11 1 a wave damping region called the sponge layer can be used in the outlet to absorb waves and reduce reflections at the outflow boundary flow3d has been used by several researchers for different fluid flow and free surface problems e g bhinder et al 2009 thanyamanta et al 2011 maguire 2011 sayeed et al 2017b bhinder et al 2009 sayeed et al 2017b 2018 numerical results from flow3d are compared with the current experimental data 4 1 numerical test case set up the sphere d i d s 0 6 and three irregular waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 are selected as test cases for the present numerical study the width and height of the numerical tank was 4 5 and 2 5 m respectively and initial fluid elevation was 1 8 m the boundary conditions applied are xmin wave xmax outflow ymin and ymax wall zmin wall and zmax specified pressure an additional wave absorbing component was added before outflow boundary to reduce wave reflections from the boundary and to maintain fluid volume in the domain a uniform grid size of 0 025 m was used in the free surface region first of all a 2d simulation was conducted to match the significant heights and peak periods of irregular waves once the desired waves were matched then 3d simulation was conducted using the hexagonal fixed structure as a non moving object and the sphere as a moving object fig 26 shows the mesh grid for 2d simulation top and the computational domain with sphere and hexagonal structure along with boundary conditions bottom the general moving object gmo modeling option was used to allow coupled motions in x and z translation only surge and heave the mass properties of the sphere were edited accordingly without modeling the top or bottom rods used in the experiment incompressible one fluid flow mode was selected with free surface or sharp interface tracking the implicit gmres pressure solver and explicit viscous stress solver was used first order momentum advection was selected and the split lagrangian method was used to resolve volume of fluid advection two equation k ε model was used as turbulence model with dynamically computed maximum turbulent mixing length the built in automatic time step control in flow3d was used which ensures the stability limits for the solver 4 2 numerical results the total number of cells was 4 4 million and associated simulation time varied between 17 and 20 h the numerical simulations were run for 60 s and compared with time series of the corresponding experimental data fig 27 shows the time series comparison of wave height and corresponding spectrum for wave λ p d s 6 4 between experiment and 2d simulation of flow3d table 6 shows the comparison of significant wave heights and peak periods between experiment and 2d simulation of flow3d for the three selected irregular wave cases there are small differences in flow3d generated irregular wave time series when compared with experimental data it is not possible in flow 3d to provide a time series irregular wave input it is only possible to provide the wave spectral characteristics and the program then generates a time series that matches the specified spectrum thus a direct wave by wave comparison is not possible between the experimental and numerical cases 4 2 1 force simulation results at the beginning of numerical investigation and before conducting the force experiments one test case sphere d i d s 0 6 and irregular wave λ p d s 6 4 was simulated without structure and at nine different locations away from the structure when the force experiments were conducted later the distances were not same as the numerical test cases and the computer resources for flow3d were not available after the experiments figs 28 and 29 show the comparison of the non dimensional significant surge and heave forces plotted against d λ p for the sphere d i d s 0 6 in irregular wave λ p d s 6 4 the comparisons between the experimental data and numerical simulations at different locations match reasonably well especially when the sphere is located at close proximity to the structure d λ p 0 3 the numerical simulations also capture the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 and the corresponding fx and fz force trends quite well it is to be noted that numerical simulations did not include the attached rod used during experiments besides there are differences in wave heights generated between the experimental facility and the numerical wave tank also the numerical results in the far field d λ p 0 3 show large differences especially in fz force when compared with experimental data 4 2 2 free floating motion simulation results fig 30 shows the time series comparison of surge displacement of the sphere d i d s 0 6 tested without structure in irregular waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 the results show some difference in average drift velocity between experiment and numerical simulation which is expected due to the modeling difference in the numerical simulations the numerical simulations were conducted for surge and heave only without allowing any pitch motion whereas the physical model experienced some pitch motions also the physical model has a rod and small mass attached to it at the bottom of the model which is not practical to model numerically due to the requirement of very small grid size it is also to be noted that only initial starting locations were matched between the experiment and numerical simulations the other factor of initial wave phase was not experimentally tracked and thus not necessarily the same as the numerical simulations figs 31 33 show the time series comparison of surge and heave velocities between experiment and numerical simulation for the sphere tested without structure in waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 respectively the corresponding surge and heave significant velocities are also given in the plots the numerical results show reasonable agreement with experimental results despite the modeling difference in the numerical simulations the discrepancy with the experimental results in heave velocities is generally more significant than the discrepancy in surge velocities the numerical predictions are generally thought to be lower in surge due to the previously mentioned keel on the physical model and in heave because of the highly non linear heave force associated with the low freeboard of the iceberg model which appears to be not well captured in the numerical model fig 34 shows the time series comparison of surge displacement of the sphere tested with structure in waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 the results show reasonable agreement except for the wave λ p d s 4 9 for which the difference in average drift velocity between experiment and numerical simulation is high figs 35 37 show the surge and heave velocities as a function of d d i between experiment and numerical simulation for the sphere tested with structure in waves λ p d s 4 9 6 4 a n d 6 8 respectively the corresponding surge and heave significant velocities are also given in the plots the numerical results show some discrepancy with experiment which is more pronounced for heave velocities in addition to the previously identified differences in the physical and numerical models another reason for this discrepancy is that the wave phases are not matched between experiment and numerical simulations 5 summary and conclusions the hydrodynamic interaction between an iceberg or a bergy bit and an offshore structure when the two are in close proximity is an important factor that governs the impact speed and consequently the input energy of potential collisions in order to understand the phenomenon both experimental and numerical studies have been conducted by sayeed et al 2017b 2018 to investigate the changes in wave loads and wave induced motions of ice masses near a fixed structure in regular waves this study completes the next logical step in investigating the phenomenon in irregular waves the objective is to investigate whether the observations found in regular waves will still hold in irregular sea and whether linear superposition theory may be applicable to identify the motion statistics in irregular waves first of all wave data is measured in front of the fixed structure for a total distance of 2 m and spatial distribution of significant wave heights are obtained for five irregular waves the significant wave heights follow a standing wave pattern generated by the superposition of incident and reflected peak frequency wave thus it may be inferred that the significant surge and heave forces and motions will be increased or decreased at the node and antinode locations in front of the structure the measured wave data is then utilized along with regular wave force data sayeed et al 2017b to generate force spectrums at the six tested locations of the sphere d i d s 0 6 non dimensional significant forces in horizontal and vertical directions obtained from these force spectra showed that the significant surge force goes down and significant heave force goes up as the body gets closer to the structure beyond the nodal location at d λ p 0 25 measurements of wave forces on three spherical ice masses at different proximity to the fixed structure in irregular waves demonstrate the change in significant wave loads is based on separation distance to peak wavelength ratio also as the body is positioned closer to the structure the normalized significant forces in the horizontal direction decrease and the normalized significant forces in the vertical direction increase the proximity effect on wave loads in the vertical direction is found to be more dominant than the same in the horizontal direction both the force data derived from linear superposition and the force data measured directly show similar trends but significantly different magnitudes with the directly measured data showing lower force magnitudes in the near structure regions we attribute this to non linear effects when multiple wave frequencies act simultaneously leading to reduced forces thus the increase in fz and the decrease in fx tend to be smoothed in the irregular wave cases and linear superposition in neglecting non linearities and cross frequency effects tends to over predict the force changes free floating motion experiments of three spherical and one cylindrical ice masses approaching a fixed structure showed small difference in surge and heave velocity spectrum due to the presence of the structure this is because there is not enough data at specific location to collect the motion responses for all the frequencies in the spectrum again the proximity effect appears to be more on heave motions than in surge motions numerical investigations were conducted using rans based commercial cfd code flow3d selected test cases from both force and motion experiments are simulated in irregular waves generated from selected experimental spectrum some differences were observed between experimental and simulated results especially in drift velocities the challenges currently lie in the proper modeling of geometry and mass properties of the physical model considering the limitations of computational resources associated with large mesh requirements and the associated long computational times however the simulation results for irregular waves show the capability to simulate random waves and force and motion results in irregular waves are also reasonable showing the expected trends the effects of proximity in irregular seas are not as pronounced as those observed for regular waves due to the multiple frequencies and wavelengths present in an irregular wave train however the effects remain and are discernible with slight decrease in surge force motions and significant increase in heave force motions for proximities very close to the fixed structure reductions in surge drift and wave induced motions could lead to reduced impact forces while increases in heave motions may have implications for potential impacts with topsides and overhanging structures acknowledgements the authors would
