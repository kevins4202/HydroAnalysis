scarcity and rising water demand due to urban population growth is a worldwide reality 1 freshwater resources are continuously influenced by municipal and industrial pollutants increasing chemical contamination and disinfection by products have created a grave concern during recent years 2 3 water shortage worldwide is calling for efficient technologies for water purification and reuse 4 the development of cost effective and robust treatment technologies with the capability of treating lower quality waters such as municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent for reuse applications is becoming an important component of water resource management 2 advanced treatment units are highly recommended for industrial wastewater reuse in developing countries especially in arid and semi arid areas 5 the choice of a particular operation process or combination depends on the application of the treated effluent the nature of the wastewater the competitiveness of the various operations and processes available final waste disposal options and the economic and environmental feasibility of the various systems 6 seven distinct groups of tertiary treatment processes are ozonation ultraviolet catalyst based pressure driven activated carbon adsorption electrochemical and irradiation treatments the combination of two or more treatment processes is essential to meet the effluent requirements 7 combining membrane filtration with another water wastewater treatment method in a hybrid process is a promising way of improving the overall membrane operation membrane based processes are well recognized treatment methods for waters and wastewaters of different origins however the most serious drawback connected with membranes filtration is their severe fouling which deteriorates the process s effectiveness the experimental results indicated that ozonation can be used to mitigate membrane fouling 8 ozone is a strong oxidant applied in water treatment for disinfection and organic and inorganic pollutants removal it can be coupled with membrane processes as a pre treatment or post treatment as well as in a hybrid configuration 9 in general the consumption of o3 in water can be classified into two stages of reactions the instantaneous o3 demand iod 0 the 20s typically the time required for the first measurement of o3 concentration and the slow decay stage that can be expressed as a pseudo first order reaction 4 pre ozonation of the surface water systematically increases the hydrophilic fraction and anionic charge of nom and changes their size distributions 10 yu et al examined the mechanisms for reducing the fouling of ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes with natural organic materials using ozone depletion and ph the difference in the behavior of nanofiltration seems to be related to the ozone body and the nanofiltration pores and the same size of the ozone organic parts and nanofiltration pores cause significant depletion 10 francesco et al conducted a study on advanced industrial wastewater treatment by a membrane and ozone filtering it shows that the best way to reduce cod and biodegradability is to ozonate and then return to the physicochemical stage the results obtained from the percentage of nf deletion were 31 tds 94 cod 9 cl 47 surfactant 66 phenol and 91 so4 2 11 the effects of oxidation with pre treatment coagulation and ceramic microfiltration cmf on reverse osmosis for desalination of recycled wastewater have been studied the results showed that oxidation and coagulation before cmf increase the membrane flow but pretreatment of reverse osmosis is unconventional using coagulation ozone or ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uvh stable currents of cmf were confirmed the new findings show a reduction in the risk of ro biofouling by oxidation and coagulation as high current cmf pre treatment 12 vatankhah et al investigated the effect of pre ozone effluent on nanofiltration chiding during reusable applications the results showed that ozone depletion on sbmbr output was associated with a low ozonation dose 0 2 mg o3 mg doc and significantly reduces membrane h compared to pre ozone filtration if the dose of ozone is increased it does not have a significant effect 4 schollée et al found that ozone depletion and subsequent purification were widely used to increase the removal of micropollutants and while the technology was effective micro pollution led to oxidation the formation of ozonation transformation products otps was consulted to evaluate 4 doses of ozone and 5 subsequent purifications there was about 54 83 removal of ozonation products which is the best among the five options ozonation two granular activated carbon filters 13 zhipeng et al investigated advanced wastewater treatment of the coal chemical industry with catalytic ozonation with a gas liquid solid liquid bed reactor the results show that if ozonation is alone for 60 min the elimination efficiency of cod will be 34 and if the catalyst is used the removal function of cod will improve compared to before 14 a study on hybrid systems that analyzed the failure performance of these systems shows that the most reliable alternative to the system is a combination of sand filter activated carbon microfilter ultra filtering and ion exchange with 74 82 reliability 5 butkovskyi et al worked on the removal of soluble organic compounds docs from the returned water with a combined system including floating with soluble air coagulation ozonation adsorption on granular carbon and aerobic decomposition the results showed that ozonation was ineffective in removing organic compounds and aerobic decomposition of about 70 eliminated doc as low molecular weight organic compounds mainly 15 random forest rf technique has been used for estimating the environmental variables 16 17 rf is utilized to convey the non linear relationship between no2 concentrations and predictor variables and the obtained results are compared with a linear regression model the research was conducted to estimate spatial patterns of canopy n in european forests 17 the degree to which including environmental variables among the predictors would improve the models compared to using remotely sensed products alone also was investigated the included environmental variables 17 were climate soil properties altitude n deposition and land cover while the remote sensing products were vegetation indices and nir reflectance from modis and meris sensors the mod13q1 and mtci products respectively the objective of this study was advanced treatment of industrial estate effluent using ozone membrane processes for reduction of the organic load and water reuse furthermore value of uv254 was estimated via random forest model optimized using the bayesian optimization algorithm rf bo 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the industrial estate was started up in 2009 fig s1 supporting information indicates a schematic diagram and table 1 reveals the specification of the wwtp 2 2 pilot scale system in this study the performance of a pilot scale system including chemical treatment coagulation flocculation sedimentation coag floc sed sand filtration sf ultrafiltration uf activated carbon ac and reverse osmosis ro was evaluated with and without ozonation at three different points of the set up fig 1 the three points of ozone injection were before chemical treatment before uf and before ro ozone injection condition was 24 ppm at the reaction time of 30 min important indicators and operating parameters such as uv254 cod toc tss tds ph and turbidity from the input and output points of the pilot plant were determined also ozone efficiency was evaluated the specifications of membranes uf and ro used in the pilot plant of this study are presented in table 2 the operation and chemical washing ph range were 2 3 membranes length and diameter were 40 and 4 in respectively 2 3 feed water quality and analysis the concentration of key feed water quality parameters is summarized in table 1 feed water samples were analyzed for total organic matter toc using a carbon analyzer shimadzu model toc vcsh chemical oxygen demand cod was measured through the method of spectrophotometry unico 2100 uv absorption at 254 nm uv254 also was used to estimate the organic matter content of the samples the samples were filtered using a filter with a nominal pore size 0 45 μm routine analyses were conducted according to standard methods 18 2 4 the rf bo model for uv254 estimation in random forest rf model for building the decision trees each time a split in a tree is considered a random sample of predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of predictors 19 the complexity of the trees in the forest is another parameter to be included in this method deep trees tend to over fit while shallow trees tend to under fit therefore the minimum number of observations per leaf should be specified the solution to this problem is to use the bayesian optimization bo algorithm to find the optimal number of observations per leaf in many scientific and engineering applications we need to deal with design choices such as algorithm hyper parameter tuning 20 or engineering design 21 23 this design process can be seen as the optimization of a black box function which is expensive to evaluate due to computational reasons 23 1 x arg max x χ f x bo finds a solution for the objective function presented in eq 1 by making a series of evaluations x1 xt of f such that the optimum of f is found with the fewest number of iterations a surrogate for the objective is determined by the bo and the gaussian process is used to quantify the uncertainty of the surrogate 24 then bo uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to suggest the next sample bayesian optimization argues about f by building a gaussian process 24 through evaluations this flexible distribution allows associating a normally distributed random variable at every point in the continuous input space a predictive distribution for a new observation x that also follows a gaussian distribution is obtained 24 its mean and variance functions are given in eqs 2 and 3 2 μ x k x x k x x 1 y 3 σ 2 x k x x k x x k x x 1 k x x t where k u v is a covariance matrix whose element i j is calculated as k i j k x i x j with x i u and x j v as the original function f x is expensive to evaluate we will build a cheaper function called the acquisition function α x from the surrogate model to determine a next point to evaluate 23 therefore instead of maximizing the original function the acquisition function is maximized to select the next point x t 1 arg max x χ α t x in this auxiliary maximization problem the acquisition function form is known and can be easily optimized by standard numerical techniques consider the utility function u ℝ d ℝ θ ℝwhich maps an arbitrary query point x its corresponding function value v f x and a setting of the model hyper parameters θ 25 given some accumulated data the unseen outcome y and the unknown model hyper parameters θ can be marginalized to obtain the expected utility of a query point x eq 4 4 α x d n e θ e v x θ u x v θ in experimental design and decision theory the function α is called the expected utility and in bo it is often called the acquisition function the pseudocode of the bo is presented in algorithm 1 23 table 3 d is the data in the following algorithm and t is the total number of iterations to determine the optimal dose of ozone after the startup of ozone injection into the reservoir a sample was taken every 5 min and was continued for 30 min 2 5 supervised learning training uv254 estimation model is based on supervised learning input vector and target desired output value must be defined for the model in supervised learning and a pair of input and target creating a training sample in the training stage the model learns to map inputs to targets using training samples so the model can generalize to estimate uv254 using new input data therefore the available data should be divided into training data and test data the training data is used to train the uv254 estimation model and the test data is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in the estimation stage fig 2 illustrates the input and targets proposed for uv254 estimation in this study ozonation or non ozonation in the water treatment process is considered using a variable called step and the ozonation location is considered using the location variable the other variables that complete the input vector are ph temperature electrical conductivity and turbidity respectively and the target is the value of uv254 in the training stage the rf model learns to estimate the uv254 value from the input vector while the optimal mean leaf size is obtained during iterations of the bo algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of optimum ozone dose the effects of ozone doses on cod removal at the pilot scale are shown in fig 3 as it can be seen in fig 3 in the first 10 min at all of the doses there was either an increase in cod or a slight decrease in cod this is due to the reaction of o3 with organic compounds which leads to the formation of low molecular weight compounds and increases the dose of ozone in general higher amount of low molecular weight compounds can lead to a decrease in complete elimination doc by membranes 4 the data in fig 3 reveal that the highest percentage of cod removal was observed in the two doses of 24 ppm and 32 ppm with a further review of the results the difference in removal in these two doses is small so the 24 ppm dose is considered as optimal based on previous studies pre ozonation sbmbr with relatively low specific ozone dose 0 2 mg o3 mg doc can effectively compare a significant portion of membrane deposition however increasing the specific dose of ozone to 0 4 mg o3 mg doc does not provide a significant additional benefit 4 hybrid ozonation can be more cost effective than single ozonation process in the oxidation of some pollutants it depends on pollutant properties ozone and pollutant concentration experimental variables reactor design etc 26 3 2 performance of the pilot plant in this study membrane fouling poses an operational challenge in the application of membrane processes in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewaters for reuse goals however to increase the life and efficiency improvement of the membrane systems the pre treatment is required with proper pre treatment costs can be reduced and the life of the treatment plant and thus the performance of the system can be increased the overall performance of the pilot plant used in the present study including chemical treatment coag floc sed sf uf ac and ro with and without ozonation in the four steps are summarized in tables 4 7 3 3 ozonation efficiency on reducing organic matters large amounts of nom in water systems are considered the main cause of fouling ozonation is a powerful process that can effectively degrade organic compounds 16 tables 5 6 and 7 reveal 43 70 and 64 removal efficiency of organic matters measured as uv254 for three steps ozonation before chemical treatment step 2 ozonation before uf step 3 and ozonation before ro step 4 respectively the ozone concentration was 24 ppm and the contact time was 30 min the residue of organic matters as uv254 that enter the membrane systems uf and ro were 0 125 0 080 and 0 198 cm 1 respectively which is desirable compared to the ozone free state at 0 251 cm 1 in step 3 the lowest value was observed in addition the percentage of organic matter removal by examining the other organic load index cod shows 61 63 76 and 53 for steps 1 4 respectively tables 1 4 also indicate effluent cod which enters the membrane system after going through other stages of pre treatment during each of the pilot operation steps 1 to 4 in the step 3 the cod removal 76 was more efficient than the other steps myat et al found that coagulation reduced uv254 absorbance by only 13 but any combination with oxidation led to significant reductions between 44 and 63 where the highest was measured in the ozone cases 11 enhanced dom removal and simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc has been used as a novel electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof process in the emdof process the removal efficiencies of doc uv254 and color from the wwtp effluent reached 35 22 71 48 and 62 38 respectively 27 in a study feed doc was gradually reduced at higher ozone dose the maximum removal of doc was 20 2 at an ozone dose of 15 mg l however the permeate doc gradually increased with larger ozone dose the rejection of doc by uf ceramic membrane decreased from 43 4 to 18 1 with increasing ozone dose from 0 to 15 mg l these results showed that pre ozonation in eom solution decomposed high molecular weight organic matter into low molecular weight compounds and reduced clogging of the uf 1 oxidation by ozone or uvh also removed biopolymers but had a further effect on reducing humic substances concentration 11 ozone is a strong oxidant applied in water treatment for disinfection and organic and inorganic pollutants removal it can be coupled with membrane processes as a pre treatment or post treatment as well as in a hybrid configuration 8 pre ozonation before membrane filtration has been widely investigated for the mitigation of membrane fouling by biopolymers nevertheless the application of ozone pre treatment on reverse osmosis ro membrane is limited in summary organic fouling of ro membrane caused by biopolymers could be efficiently mitigated by pre ozonation 28 ozonation of nom has been shown to attack carbon carbon double bonds e g in aromatic structures and form low mw compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids 9 in step 3 table 6 uv254 in sf effluent was 0 208 cm 1 and after ozonation it was 0 08 cm 1 with 61 removal also the remained organic matter enters the uf membrane in step 4 table 7 uv254 for sf effluent was 0 198 cm 1 and for uf produced water it was 0 191 cm 1 with a slight effect and the removal efficiency of 4 then by ozonation uv254 reduced from 0 191 to 0 07 cm 1 with 61 removal according to the results the same reduction occurred for cod this proves the importance of the role of ozonation before uf because organic load is a major factor in membrane fouling reduction of organic matters by ozonation plays a protective role for the membrane system the results of pre ozonation at a specific ozone dose of 0 2 mg o3 mg doc showed a significant reduction in fouling compared to the filtration with no pre ozonation 2 also the uf membrane experienced a slight reduction around 4 to 11 and removal for uv254 as soluble organic matters will pass via the uf membrane in addition disinfecting properties of ozone and its role in reducing microbial load cause the reduction of membrane clogging via biological foaling most biopolymers in proportion to their high molecular weight and sticky properties were removed by the membrane filtration humic substances had almost the same concentrations in the membrane permeate and the feed they can easily pass through the membrane pores of 0 1 μm in size a small portion of large humic substances may remain due to the effects of tortuosity 11 these results were confirmed by the toc results which showed a minor removal 10 by the uf membrane and near 90 removal by the nf membranes while biopolymers in the surface water could be removed by the uf membrane smaller molecular weight mw fractions of nom were poorly removed confirming the importance of membrane pore size pre ozonation of the surface water increased the hydrophilic fraction and anionic charge of nom and altered their size distributions this resulted in a lower fouling less flux decline for the uf 9 membranes are a separation process enabling micropollutants concentration while ozonation is a destructive technique able to eliminate micropollutants and break down membrane foulants effectively 8 molecular weight physical size is not the only parameter that determines the removal of organic matter by membranes other properties such as molecular charge zeta potential and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of organic matter play major roles organic matter was slightly removed by uf membranes excluding biopolymers subsequent water filtration experiments were performed mainly with nf membranes the findings indicated that without the addition of ozone most biopolymers were successfully removed from the uf membrane by the backwash but a slight amount of smaller organic matter 10 kda was removed indicating that the biopolymers determined the fouling of the uf membrane likewise after pretreatment with 1 mg l o3 some biopolymers at lower concentrations were observed in the backwash water of the uf membrane 9 ozonation is known for removing rare organic pollutants from secondary wastewater effluent however its implementation and overall efficiency on a large scale depend on effluent characteristics which can vary both in time and across treatment plants 4 the highest efficiency was observed in the third stage table 6 with cod uv254 and toc removal of 76 70 and 7 7 respectively ozone showed enhanced performance than chlorine and permanganate in removing micro pollutants and uv254 29 the percentage of uv254 removal in step 1 without ozonation was far smaller than all of the other phases and only in this phase where the uf effluent enters the activated carbon the reduction percentage was significant at about 63 the hybrid coagulation ozonation process improved micro pollutants and effluent organic matter doc and uv254 removal a specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc was able to almost completely remove selected micro pollutants and protect the uf membrane 29 3 4 turbidity removal removal of turbidity is an important indicator in this study through ozonation macromolecular organic compounds are decomposed into lighter molecules thus increasing ozone dosage could improve turbidity removal 17 the effect of chemical treatment on turbidity removal in all of the 4 steps according to tables 4 7 were 80 63 67 and 67 respectively the remained amount of turbidity that enter the sand filter is 11 62 7 35 12 51 and 8 24 ntu respectively chemical treatment removes high molecular weight compounds and can effectively remove most fine contaminants 29 in step 2 table 5 where ozonation occurred before chemical treatment the turbidity of the inlet to the sand filter was reduced to 12 78 ntu the results of turbidity measurement in tables 4 7 reveal that the turbidity of the influent to the membrane system was 3 28 2 09 5 81 2 90 ntu and the effluent from ro was 0 32 0 31 0 23 0 27 ntu respectively as observed in step 3 although the average influent turbidity to the sand filter was higher than other steps the average turbidity of the effluent of the ro membrane had the lowest amount ozone can polymerize meta stable organics which leads to particle accumulation through bridging reactions 17 the hybrid coagulation ozonation process is effective as an alternative to the individual pac to remove high mw organic compounds in the coagulation stage and micropollutants and uv254 aromatic low mw compounds in the subsequent ozonation treatment 29 ozone treatment can reduce particulate stability and lead to increased aggregation 17 us ultrasound removal efficiency alone under optimal condition was 25 and 5 ozone performance alone under optimal condition was 60 and 10 individual coagulation effectiveness under optimal condition was 65 and 15 but the performance efficiency of us o3 in the removal of nom and turbidity optimal condition was 84 and 33 respectively however the us o3 coagulation efficiency optimal condition was 95 and 50 for nom and turbidity removal respectively 17 3 5 sdi changes the mean values of sdi for the four steps were 1 13 1 02 0 94 and 1 04 respectively tables 4 7 with lower values for steps 2 and 3 pre ozonation was examined to reduce the fouling potential of a highly concentrated surface water nf brine doc 18 mg l with relatively low ozone doses employed in this study 0 1 and 0 4 mg o3 mg doc ratios a significant reduction was achieved in fouling potential quantified by mfi 29 microfiltration and uf membranes have been wetted by phase inversion method to reduce membrane fouling it provides desirable condition for reducing the occurrence of membrane deposition 30 31 improvement of membrane performance resulted in upgrading of the parameters such as porosity hydrophilicity permeability behavior sediment resistance and sediment characteristics after conditioning the membrane was suitable for wastewater treatment 30 3 6 tds changes conventional wastewater treatment processes provide significant removals of nutrients and particles however these conventional processes do not effectively remove salinity i e tds on the other hand membrane separation processes such as nf and ro are commonly used in the water treatment industry to remove divalent and monovalent ions respectively therefore to achieve a degree of desalination these membranes must be incorporated into the wastewater treatment train 32 as seen in tables 4 7 the tds removal efficiency in the effluent of ro in the steps of 1 to 4 were 97 5 95 5 98 and 95 respectively mostly membrane treated wastewaters can produce water of acceptable tds level for irrigation 33 3 7 ph changes tables 4 7 show that in step 1 without ozonation the ph of ro produced water was increased by about 4 but this ph increase for three steps of 2 3 and 4 with ozonation were 10 12 and 14 in ro produced water respectively the addition of ozone decreased the zeta potential more negative of the hyde park organic matter by degrading or modifying organic matter through changes to their folding ability and tertiary structures and increasing carboxylic acid groups in principle decreasing the zeta potential of nom should enhance electrostatic repulsion between the organic matter and the membrane surface thereby mitigating fouling the results showed that the zeta potential of both waters decreased at higher ph 9 3 8 coagulation efficiency on turbidity removal the effect of the coagulants on turbidity using jar test is shown in table s1 supporting information as can be seen the turbidity decreased in all of the samples at larger coagulants doses of alum poly aluminum chloride pac and ferric chloride with lime in the range of 40 to 90 mg l turbidity reduction efficiencies were 62 76 76 92 and 25 45 respectively the hydrophobic part of nom is mostly removed by the coagulation process and other treatment methods are necessary to remove the remaining nom from water resources 16 the coagulation and flocculation processes are major components of the conventional water treatment process 17 in table s2 supporting information using the obtained data in table s1 supporting information the coagulant dose of 70 mg l was considered as optimum and parameters such as residual turbidity ec ph cod and sludge settling after 30 min for all the three coagulants were determined alum turbidity reduction efficiency is higher compared to other coagulants and the volume of settled sludge after 30 min also for alum was less than the others integration of electrocoagulation ec process with other treatment processes including membranes chemical and oxidation could improve the process efficiency several advantages of using ec as pretreatment process are increase of permeate water volume enhance permeate water quality mitigate membrane fouling and extend the membrane lifecycle and reduce the overall operational cost of the hybrid process 34 the ozonation can reduce repulsive forces between particles which further improves sedimentation rate and turbidity removal 17 3 9 trans membrane pressure tmp changes there were no tmp changes during the operation of the pilot plant in this study on the barometers installed on the membrane system to achieve these changes and membrane clogging it is suggested to increase the pilot operation time to compare the results when the membrane reaches the clogging stage for improvement of membrane performance and that deposition reduction the membrane structure can be changed 30 31 35 the innovative nanocomposite polyethersulfone cu fe3o4 membrane indicated good ultrafiltration performance 43 3 lmhbar pwp rejection 80 90 for dyes and proteins and antifouling properties up to 77 2 frr 35 in one study no significant change of graph trends for both applied pressures was for 25 bar and 10 bar found after ozonation which indicates that ozonation did not alter the main fouling mechanism 19 3 10 total suspended solids tss removal tss is considered a main pollutant that contributes to the deterioration of water quality causing higher costs for water treatment depleting fish resources and compromising aesthetics of the water 36 tss were removed in the early stages when passing through chemical treatment and sf therefore the remained concentration of tss after chemical treatment and sf measured via a gravimetric method were negligible tables 4 7 indicate the tss concentration in each step 3 11 uv254 estimation in this part of the paper the results of the uv254 estimation model are presented the rf bo model was used for supervised training the obtained results were compared with two other optimized models i e optimized support vector machine svm and gaussian process regression gpr the dataset should be divided into two subsets i e training subset 60 and test subset 40 the training sub set is used to find the optimal leaf size and train the estimation model the objective function model of the under study problem is illustrated in fig 4 the objective is to find the minimum leaf size that must be used to train the rf model which results in the best accuracy of uv254 estimation in fig 4 the x axis represents the minimum leaf size the y axis represents the number of elements in the input vector and the z axis represents the numerical value of the objective function fig 5 shows the minimum objective value vs function evaluations during the process of finding the best leaf size for training the rf model uv254 estimation results using rf bo svm bo and gpr bo models are illustrated in figs 6 8 respectively bar plots in the aforementioned figures compare the observed values with the estimated values of uv254 to assess the performance of the proposed method the mean absolute error mae the mean squared error mse and the root mean squared error rmse were used as evaluation criteria as shown in eqs s1 s2 and s3 supporting information the result evaluation is presented in table 8 and the residuals of uv254 estimation are illustrated in fig 9 in figs 6 9 also the result evaluation shows that the proposed rf bo method presents lower errors and evaluation indexes in comparison with benchmark models 4 conclusion it was found in this study that in the third step of pilot plant operation ozonation before uf uv254 removal as the index of organic matters was significant as a result ozonation caused slight organic charge applied to the membrane compared to other cases therefore this step could reduce organic contents of the stream more efficiently than the other study steps the average tds in the produced water from ro in the third step was less than the other steps which can be justified by the effect of ozone in improving the efficiency of the membrane system in step 3 despite the fact that the average influent turbidity to the sand filter was higher than the other steps the average turbidity of the effluent of the ro membrane was the lowest the operation time was not so long therefore no tmp changes were observed during the operation of the ro in this pilot plant a model proposed in this paper for uv254 estimation is based on supervised learning the proposed model uses an rf model optimized using the bo algorithm to find the optimal leaf size the obtained results using rf bo are compared with the results of svm bo and gpr bo models the results show that the proposed method represents better performance in uv254 estimation in comparison with the benchmark models funding sources this research was supported by the isfahan

12945,this study aimed to survey ozone membrane processes for advanced treatment of secondary effluent in the industrial estate wastewater treatment plant the performance of a pilot scale system combining chemical treatment coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration ultrafiltration activated carbon and reverse osmosis were evaluated without and with ozonation at three different

et al examined the mechanisms for reducing the fouling of ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes with natural organic materials using ozone depletion and ph the difference in the behavior of nanofiltration seems to be related to the ozone body and the nanofiltration pores and the same size of the ozone organic parts and nanofiltration pores cause significant depletion 10 francesco et al conducted a study on advanced industrial wastewater treatment by a membrane and ozone filtering it shows that the best way to reduce cod and biodegradability is to ozonate and then return to the physicochemical stage the results obtained from the percentage of nf deletion were 31 tds 94 cod 9 cl 47 surfactant 66 phenol and 91 so4 2 11 the effects of oxidation with pre treatment coagulation and ceramic microfiltration cmf on reverse osmosis for desalination of recycled wastewater have been studied the results showed that oxidation and coagulation before cmf increase the membrane flow but pretreatment of reverse osmosis is unconventional using coagulation ozone or ultraviolet hydrogen peroxide uvh stable currents of cmf were confirmed the new findings show a reduction in the risk of ro biofouling by oxidation and coagulation as high current cmf pre treatment 12 vatankhah et al investigated the effect of pre ozone effluent on nanofiltration chiding during reusable applications the results showed that ozone depletion on sbmbr output was associated with a low ozonation dose 0 2 mg o3 mg doc and significantly reduces membrane h compared to pre ozone filtration if the dose of ozone is increased it does not have a significant effect 4 schollée et al found that ozone depletion and subsequent purification were widely used to increase the removal of micropollutants and while the technology was effective micro pollution led to oxidation the formation of ozonation transformation products otps was consulted to evaluate 4 doses of ozone and 5 subsequent purifications there was about 54 83 removal of ozonation products which is the best among the five options ozonation two granular activated carbon filters 13 zhipeng et al investigated advanced wastewater treatment of the coal chemical industry with catalytic ozonation with a gas liquid solid liquid bed reactor the results show that if ozonation is alone for 60 min the elimination efficiency of cod will be 34 and if the catalyst is used the removal function of cod will improve compared to before 14 a study on hybrid systems that analyzed the failure performance of these systems shows that the most reliable alternative to the system is a combination of sand filter activated carbon microfilter ultra filtering and ion exchange with 74 82 reliability 5 butkovskyi et al worked on the removal of soluble organic compounds docs from the returned water with a combined system including floating with soluble air coagulation ozonation adsorption on granular carbon and aerobic decomposition the results showed that ozonation was ineffective in removing organic compounds and aerobic decomposition of about 70 eliminated doc as low molecular weight organic compounds mainly 15 random forest rf technique has been used for estimating the environmental variables 16 17 rf is utilized to convey the non linear relationship between no2 concentrations and predictor variables and the obtained results are compared with a linear regression model the research was conducted to estimate spatial patterns of canopy n in european forests 17 the degree to which including environmental variables among the predictors would improve the models compared to using remotely sensed products alone also was investigated the included environmental variables 17 were climate soil properties altitude n deposition and land cover while the remote sensing products were vegetation indices and nir reflectance from modis and meris sensors the mod13q1 and mtci products respectively the objective of this study was advanced treatment of industrial estate effluent using ozone membrane processes for reduction of the organic load and water reuse furthermore value of uv254 was estimated via random forest model optimized using the bayesian optimization algorithm rf bo 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the wastewater treatment plant wwtp of the industrial estate was started up in 2009 fig s1 supporting information indicates a schematic diagram and table 1 reveals the specification of the wwtp 2 2 pilot scale system in this study the performance of a pilot scale system including chemical treatment coagulation flocculation sedimentation coag floc sed sand filtration sf ultrafiltration uf activated carbon ac and reverse osmosis ro was evaluated with and without ozonation at three different points of the set up fig 1 the three points of ozone injection were before chemical treatment before uf and before ro ozone injection condition was 24 ppm at the reaction time of 30 min important indicators and operating parameters such as uv254 cod toc tss tds ph and turbidity from the input and output points of the pilot plant were determined also ozone efficiency was evaluated the specifications of membranes uf and ro used in the pilot plant of this study are presented in table 2 the operation and chemical washing ph range were 2 3 membranes length and diameter were 40 and 4 in respectively 2 3 feed water quality and analysis the concentration of key feed water quality parameters is summarized in table 1 feed water samples were analyzed for total organic matter toc using a carbon analyzer shimadzu model toc vcsh chemical oxygen demand cod was measured through the method of spectrophotometry unico 2100 uv absorption at 254 nm uv254 also was used to estimate the organic matter content of the samples the samples were filtered using a filter with a nominal pore size 0 45 μm routine analyses were conducted according to standard methods 18 2 4 the rf bo model for uv254 estimation in random forest rf model for building the decision trees each time a split in a tree is considered a random sample of predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of predictors 19 the complexity of the trees in the forest is another parameter to be included in this method deep trees tend to over fit while shallow trees tend to under fit therefore the minimum number of observations per leaf should be specified the solution to this problem is to use the bayesian optimization bo algorithm to find the optimal number of observations per leaf in many scientific and engineering applications we need to deal with design choices such as algorithm hyper parameter tuning 20 or engineering design 21 23 this design process can be seen as the optimization of a black box function which is expensive to evaluate due to computational reasons 23 1 x arg max x χ f x bo finds a solution for the objective function presented in eq 1 by making a series of evaluations x1 xt of f such that the optimum of f is found with the fewest number of iterations a surrogate for the objective is determined by the bo and the gaussian process is used to quantify the uncertainty of the surrogate 24 then bo uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to suggest the next sample bayesian optimization argues about f by building a gaussian process 24 through evaluations this flexible distribution allows associating a normally distributed random variable at every point in the continuous input space a predictive distribution for a new observation x that also follows a gaussian distribution is obtained 24 its mean and variance functions are given in eqs 2 and 3 2 μ x k x x k x x 1 y 3 σ 2 x k x x k x x k x x 1 k x x t where k u v is a covariance matrix whose element i j is calculated as k i j k x i x j with x i u and x j v as the original function f x is expensive to evaluate we will build a cheaper function called the acquisition function α x from the surrogate model to determine a next point to evaluate 23 therefore instead of maximizing the original function the acquisition function is maximized to select the next point x t 1 arg max x χ α t x in this auxiliary maximization problem the acquisition function form is known and can be easily optimized by standard numerical techniques consider the utility function u ℝ d ℝ θ ℝwhich maps an arbitrary query point x its corresponding function value v f x and a setting of the model hyper parameters θ 25 given some accumulated data the unseen outcome y and the unknown model hyper parameters θ can be marginalized to obtain the expected utility of a query point x eq 4 4 α x d n e θ e v x θ u x v θ in experimental design and decision theory the function α is called the expected utility and in bo it is often called the acquisition function the pseudocode of the bo is presented in algorithm 1 23 table 3 d is the data in the following algorithm and t is the total number of iterations to determine the optimal dose of ozone after the startup of ozone injection into the reservoir a sample was taken every 5 min and was continued for 30 min 2 5 supervised learning training uv254 estimation model is based on supervised learning input vector and target desired output value must be defined for the model in supervised learning and a pair of input and target creating a training sample in the training stage the model learns to map inputs to targets using training samples so the model can generalize to estimate uv254 using new input data therefore the available data should be divided into training data and test data the training data is used to train the uv254 estimation model and the test data is used to evaluate the accuracy of the model in the estimation stage fig 2 illustrates the input and targets proposed for uv254 estimation in this study ozonation or non ozonation in the water treatment process is considered using a variable called step and the ozonation location is considered using the location variable the other variables that complete the input vector are ph temperature electrical conductivity and turbidity respectively and the target is the value of uv254 in the training stage the rf model learns to estimate the uv254 value from the input vector while the optimal mean leaf size is obtained during iterations of the bo algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of optimum ozone dose the effects of ozone doses on cod removal at the pilot scale are shown in fig 3 as it can be seen in fig 3 in the first 10 min at all of the doses there was either an increase in cod or a slight decrease in cod this is due to the reaction of o3 with organic compounds which leads to the formation of low molecular weight compounds and increases the dose of ozone in general higher amount of low molecular weight compounds can lead to a decrease in complete elimination doc by membranes 4 the data in fig 3 reveal that the highest percentage of cod removal was observed in the two doses of 24 ppm and 32 ppm with a further review of the results the difference in removal in these two doses is small so the 24 ppm dose is considered as optimal based on previous studies pre ozonation sbmbr with relatively low specific ozone dose 0 2 mg o3 mg doc can effectively compare a significant portion of membrane deposition however increasing the specific dose of ozone to 0 4 mg o3 mg doc does not provide a significant additional benefit 4 hybrid ozonation can be more cost effective than single ozonation process in the oxidation of some pollutants it depends on pollutant properties ozone and pollutant concentration experimental variables reactor design etc 26 3 2 performance of the pilot plant in this study membrane fouling poses an operational challenge in the application of membrane processes in the advanced treatment of industrial wastewaters for reuse goals however to increase the life and efficiency improvement of the membrane systems the pre treatment is required with proper pre treatment costs can be reduced and the life of the treatment plant and thus the performance of the system can be increased the overall performance of the pilot plant used in the present study including chemical treatment coag floc sed sf uf ac and ro with and without ozonation in the four steps are summarized in tables 4 7 3 3 ozonation efficiency on reducing organic matters large amounts of nom in water systems are considered the main cause of fouling ozonation is a powerful process that can effectively degrade organic compounds 16 tables 5 6 and 7 reveal 43 70 and 64 removal efficiency of organic matters measured as uv254 for three steps ozonation before chemical treatment step 2 ozonation before uf step 3 and ozonation before ro step 4 respectively the ozone concentration was 24 ppm and the contact time was 30 min the residue of organic matters as uv254 that enter the membrane systems uf and ro were 0 125 0 080 and 0 198 cm 1 respectively which is desirable compared to the ozone free state at 0 251 cm 1 in step 3 the lowest value was observed in addition the percentage of organic matter removal by examining the other organic load index cod shows 61 63 76 and 53 for steps 1 4 respectively tables 1 4 also indicate effluent cod which enters the membrane system after going through other stages of pre treatment during each of the pilot operation steps 1 to 4 in the step 3 the cod removal 76 was more efficient than the other steps myat et al found that coagulation reduced uv254 absorbance by only 13 but any combination with oxidation led to significant reductions between 44 and 63 where the highest was measured in the ozone cases 11 enhanced dom removal and simultaneous filtration and in situ cleaning sfc has been used as a novel electrocoagulation membrane dissolved ozone flotation emdof process in the emdof process the removal efficiencies of doc uv254 and color from the wwtp effluent reached 35 22 71 48 and 62 38 respectively 27 in a study feed doc was gradually reduced at higher ozone dose the maximum removal of doc was 20 2 at an ozone dose of 15 mg l however the permeate doc gradually increased with larger ozone dose the rejection of doc by uf ceramic membrane decreased from 43 4 to 18 1 with increasing ozone dose from 0 to 15 mg l these results showed that pre ozonation in eom solution decomposed high molecular weight organic matter into low molecular weight compounds and reduced clogging of the uf 1 oxidation by ozone or uvh also removed biopolymers but had a further effect on reducing humic substances concentration 11 ozone is a strong oxidant applied in water treatment for disinfection and organic and inorganic pollutants removal it can be coupled with membrane processes as a pre treatment or post treatment as well as in a hybrid configuration 8 pre ozonation before membrane filtration has been widely investigated for the mitigation of membrane fouling by biopolymers nevertheless the application of ozone pre treatment on reverse osmosis ro membrane is limited in summary organic fouling of ro membrane caused by biopolymers could be efficiently mitigated by pre ozonation 28 ozonation of nom has been shown to attack carbon carbon double bonds e g in aromatic structures and form low mw compounds such as aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids 9 in step 3 table 6 uv254 in sf effluent was 0 208 cm 1 and after ozonation it was 0 08 cm 1 with 61 removal also the remained organic matter enters the uf membrane in step 4 table 7 uv254 for sf effluent was 0 198 cm 1 and for uf produced water it was 0 191 cm 1 with a slight effect and the removal efficiency of 4 then by ozonation uv254 reduced from 0 191 to 0 07 cm 1 with 61 removal according to the results the same reduction occurred for cod this proves the importance of the role of ozonation before uf because organic load is a major factor in membrane fouling reduction of organic matters by ozonation plays a protective role for the membrane system the results of pre ozonation at a specific ozone dose of 0 2 mg o3 mg doc showed a significant reduction in fouling compared to the filtration with no pre ozonation 2 also the uf membrane experienced a slight reduction around 4 to 11 and removal for uv254 as soluble organic matters will pass via the uf membrane in addition disinfecting properties of ozone and its role in reducing microbial load cause the reduction of membrane clogging via biological foaling most biopolymers in proportion to their high molecular weight and sticky properties were removed by the membrane filtration humic substances had almost the same concentrations in the membrane permeate and the feed they can easily pass through the membrane pores of 0 1 μm in size a small portion of large humic substances may remain due to the effects of tortuosity 11 these results were confirmed by the toc results which showed a minor removal 10 by the uf membrane and near 90 removal by the nf membranes while biopolymers in the surface water could be removed by the uf membrane smaller molecular weight mw fractions of nom were poorly removed confirming the importance of membrane pore size pre ozonation of the surface water increased the hydrophilic fraction and anionic charge of nom and altered their size distributions this resulted in a lower fouling less flux decline for the uf 9 membranes are a separation process enabling micropollutants concentration while ozonation is a destructive technique able to eliminate micropollutants and break down membrane foulants effectively 8 molecular weight physical size is not the only parameter that determines the removal of organic matter by membranes other properties such as molecular charge zeta potential and hydrophilicity hydrophobicity of organic matter play major roles organic matter was slightly removed by uf membranes excluding biopolymers subsequent water filtration experiments were performed mainly with nf membranes the findings indicated that without the addition of ozone most biopolymers were successfully removed from the uf membrane by the backwash but a slight amount of smaller organic matter 10 kda was removed indicating that the biopolymers determined the fouling of the uf membrane likewise after pretreatment with 1 mg l o3 some biopolymers at lower concentrations were observed in the backwash water of the uf membrane 9 ozonation is known for removing rare organic pollutants from secondary wastewater effluent however its implementation and overall efficiency on a large scale depend on effluent characteristics which can vary both in time and across treatment plants 4 the highest efficiency was observed in the third stage table 6 with cod uv254 and toc removal of 76 70 and 7 7 respectively ozone showed enhanced performance than chlorine and permanganate in removing micro pollutants and uv254 29 the percentage of uv254 removal in step 1 without ozonation was far smaller than all of the other phases and only in this phase where the uf effluent enters the activated carbon the reduction percentage was significant at about 63 the hybrid coagulation ozonation process improved micro pollutants and effluent organic matter doc and uv254 removal a specific ozone dose of 1 mg o3 mg doc was able to almost completely remove selected micro pollutants and protect the uf membrane 29 3 4 turbidity removal removal of turbidity is an important indicator in this study through ozonation macromolecular organic compounds are decomposed into lighter molecules thus increasing ozone dosage could improve turbidity removal 17 the effect of chemical treatment on turbidity removal in all of the 4 steps according to tables 4 7 were 80 63 67 and 67 respectively the remained amount of turbidity that enter the sand filter is 11 62 7 35 12 51 and 8 24 ntu respectively chemical treatment removes high molecular weight compounds and can effectively remove most fine contaminants 29 in step 2 table 5 where ozonation occurred before chemical treatment the turbidity of the inlet to the sand filter was reduced to 12 78 ntu the results of turbidity measurement in tables 4 7 reveal that the turbidity of the influent to the membrane system was 3 28 2 09 5 81 2 90 ntu and the effluent from ro was 0 32 0 31 0 23 0 27 ntu respectively as observed in step 3 although the average influent turbidity to the sand filter was higher than other steps the average turbidity of the effluent of the ro membrane had the lowest amount ozone can polymerize meta stable organics which leads to particle accumulation through bridging reactions 17 the hybrid coagulation ozonation process is effective as an alternative to the individual pac to remove high mw organic compounds in the coagulation stage and micropollutants and uv254 aromatic low mw compounds in the subsequent ozonation treatment 29 ozone treatment can reduce particulate stability and lead to increased aggregation 17 us ultrasound removal efficiency alone under optimal condition was 25 and 5 ozone performance alone under optimal condition was 60 and 10 individual coagulation effectiveness under optimal condition was 65 and 15 but the performance efficiency of us o3 in the removal of nom and turbidity optimal condition was 84 and 33 respectively however the us o3 coagulation efficiency optimal condition was 95 and 50 for nom and turbidity removal respectively 17 3 5 sdi changes the mean values of sdi for the four steps were 1 13 1 02 0 94 and 1 04 respectively tables 4 7 with lower values for steps 2 and 3 pre ozonation was examined to reduce the fouling potential of a highly concentrated surface water nf brine doc 18 mg l with relatively low ozone doses employed in this study 0 1 and 0 4 mg o3 mg doc ratios a significant reduction was achieved in fouling potential quantified by mfi 29 microfiltration and uf membranes have been wetted by phase inversion method to reduce membrane fouling it provides desirable condition for reducing the occurrence of membrane deposition 30 31 improvement of membrane performance resulted in upgrading of the parameters such as porosity hydrophilicity permeability behavior sediment resistance and sediment characteristics after conditioning the membrane was suitable for wastewater treatment 30 3 6 tds changes conventional wastewater treatment processes provide significant removals of nutrients and particles however these conventional processes do not effectively remove salinity i e tds on the other hand membrane separation processes such as nf and ro are commonly used in the water treatment industry to remove divalent and monovalent ions respectively therefore to achieve a degree of desalination these membranes must be incorporated into the wastewater treatment train 32 as seen in tables 4 7 the tds removal efficiency in the effluent of ro in the steps of 1 to 4 were 97 5 95 5 98 and 95 respectively mostly membrane treated wastewaters can produce water of acceptable tds level for irrigation 33 3 7 ph changes tables 4 7 show that in step 1 without ozonation the ph of ro produced water was increased by about 4 but this ph increase for three steps of 2 3 and 4 with ozonation were 10 12 and 14 in ro produced water respectively the addition of ozone decreased the zeta potential more negative of the hyde park organic matter by degrading or modifying organic matter through changes to their folding ability and tertiary structures and increasing carboxylic acid groups in principle decreasing the zeta potential of nom should enhance electrostatic repulsion between the organic matter and the membrane surface thereby mitigating fouling the results showed that the zeta potential of both waters decreased at higher ph 9 3 8 coagulation efficiency on turbidity removal the effect of the coagulants on turbidity using jar test is shown in table s1 supporting information as can be seen the turbidity decreased in all of the samples at larger coagulants doses of alum poly aluminum chloride pac and ferric chloride with lime in the range of 40 to 90 mg l turbidity reduction efficiencies were 62 76 76 92 and 25 45 respectively the hydrophobic part of nom is mostly removed by the coagulation process and other treatment methods are necessary to remove the remaining nom from water resources 16 the coagulation and flocculation processes are major components of the conventional water treatment process 17 in table s2 supporting information using the obtained data in table s1 supporting information the coagulant dose of 70 mg l was considered as optimum and parameters such as residual turbidity ec ph cod and sludge settling after 30 min for all the three coagulants were determined alum turbidity reduction efficiency is higher compared to other coagulants and the volume of settled sludge after 30 min also for alum was less than the others integration of electrocoagulation ec process with other treatment processes including membranes chemical and oxidation could improve the process efficiency several advantages of using ec as pretreatment process are increase of permeate water volume enhance permeate water quality mitigate membrane fouling and extend the membrane lifecycle and reduce the overall operational cost of the hybrid process 34 the ozonation can reduce repulsive forces between particles which further improves sedimentation rate and turbidity removal 17 3 9 trans membrane pressure tmp changes there were no tmp changes during the operation of the pilot plant in this study on the barometers installed on the membrane system to achieve these changes and membrane clogging it is suggested to increase the pilot operation time to compare the results when the membrane reaches the clogging stage for improvement of membrane performance and that deposition reduction the membrane structure can be changed 30 31 35 the innovative nanocomposite polyethersulfone cu fe3o4 membrane indicated good ultrafiltration performance 43 3 lmhbar pwp rejection 80 90 for dyes and proteins and antifouling properties up to 77 2 frr 35 in one study no significant change of graph trends for both applied pressures was for 25 bar and 10 bar found after ozonation which indicates that ozonation did not alter the main fouling mechanism 19 3 10 total suspended solids tss removal tss is considered a main pollutant that contributes to the deterioration of water quality causing higher costs for water treatment depleting fish resources and compromising aesthetics of the water 36 tss were removed in the early stages when passing through chemical treatment and sf therefore the remained concentration of tss after chemical treatment and sf measured via a gravimetric method were negligible tables 4 7 indicate the tss concentration in each step 3 11 uv254 estimation in this part of the paper the results of the uv254 estimation model are presented the rf bo model was used for supervised training the obtained results were compared with two other optimized models i e optimized support vector machine svm and gaussian process regression gpr the dataset should be divided into two subsets i e training subset 60 and test subset 40 the training sub set is used to find the optimal leaf size and train the estimation model the objective function model of the under study problem is illustrated in fig 4 the objective is to find the minimum leaf size that must be used to train the rf model which results in the best accuracy of uv254 estimation in fig 4 the x axis represents the minimum leaf size the y axis represents the number of elements in the input vector and the z axis represents the numerical value of the objective function fig 5 shows the minimum objective value vs function evaluations during the process of finding the best leaf size for training the rf model uv254 estimation results using rf bo svm bo and gpr bo models are illustrated in figs 6 8 respectively bar plots in the aforementioned figures compare the observed values with the estimated values of uv254 to assess the performance of the proposed method the mean absolute error mae the mean squared error mse and the root mean squared error rmse were used as evaluation criteria as shown in eqs s1 s2 and s3 supporting information the result evaluation is presented in table 8 and the residuals of uv254 estimation are illustrated in fig 9 in figs 6 9 also the result evaluation shows that the proposed rf bo method presents lower errors and evaluation indexes in comparison with benchmark models 4 conclusion it was found in this study that in the third step of pilot plant operation ozonation before uf uv254 removal as the index of organic matters was significant as a result ozonation caused slight organic charge applied to the membrane compared to other cases therefore this step could reduce organic contents of the stream more efficiently than the other study steps the average tds in the produced water from ro in the third step was less than the other steps which can be justified by the effect of ozone in improving the efficiency of the membrane system in step 3 despite the fact that the average influent turbidity to the sand filter was higher than the other steps the average turbidity of the effluent of the ro membrane was the lowest the operation time was not so long therefore no tmp changes were observed during the operation of the ro in this pilot plant a model proposed in this paper for uv254 estimation is based on supervised learning the proposed model uses an rf model optimized using the bo algorithm to find the optimal leaf size the obtained results using rf bo are compared with the results of svm bo and gpr bo models the results show that the proposed method represents better performance in uv254 estimation in comparison with the benchmark models funding sources this research was supported by the isfahan

copper particulates to aluminium using the stir cast technique cut ingots of aluminium and copper particulates are melted in a stationary electric induction furnace in a clay graphite crucible at 700 c 19 copper granules and bars were wrapped in aluminium foil are added to the aluminium melt at 850 c to 1100 c and the same temperature is maintained until copper melts completely the molten metal is poured into the sand casting dried milled and file finished to the desired dimension fig 1 2 4 experimental design and procedure each experiment is conducted with a working volume of 250 ml simulated dairy wastewater according to faraday s law as the applied voltage increases the metal ions formed by the dissolution of anode increase 29 30 a higher amount of dissolved metals allowed higher coagulation efficiency and more significant destabilization of the colloidal particles 31 32 therefore a higher 30 v is provided using a dc power supply with a constant electrode dipping area throughout the course of the experiment the agitation is provided with a constant rpm at 200 at every 6 min of the process the electrode loss at anode and cathode zeta potential ph turbidity and cod were analyzed for comparing the treatment efficiencies of the selected electrode combinations all experiments were conducted in triplicates with 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gaps in a bipolar electrode assembly fig 2 by keeping the current density constant the sludge generated after the electrocoagulation process of sdw treatment is analyzed for the rate of sludge sedimentation volume and density 2 5 electrical energy consumption electrical energy consumption and current efficiency are critical economic characteristics in the electrocoagulation process the electrical energy consumption is estimated as follows 12 e u i t where e electrical energy kwh u cell voltage volt i current in ampere a and t time of electrocoagulation process hour the current efficiency u of the ec method related to production of al2 and cu2 ions was calculated using the equation given below 13 c f m exp m theo 100 where mexp is the actual amount of aluminium dissolved in the solution also mtheo is the theoretical amount of aluminium that should be dissolved in the solution by induced current in the electrolytic cell and can be calculated according to faraday s law 14 m theo m x i x t n x f that mtheo is the mass of the metal dissolved g i is the current a t is the time of ec process s m is the molecular weight of the metal g mol 1 n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical

consumption seec was calculated as a function of electrodes weight consumption during electrocoagulation in kwh kg using the eq 15 34 36 15 seec n x f x u 3 6 x 10 3 c f x m 10 3 3 results and discussions 3 1 electrocoagulation process reaction time the effect of operating time on turbidity and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency was examined with the simulated dairy wastewater without controlling ph at the different operating times for selected electrode combinations when considering general electrode combinations of al and cu reaction time for al is observed to be lesser than cu for alloy electrodes reactions with an inter electrode gap of 1 cm are observed to have lesser reaction time than an experimental run with a 2 cm electrode gap compared with al and cu electrodes alloy electrodes have less reaction time may be due to the simultaneous production of al oh 3 and cu oh 2 which leads to faster floc formation among alloy electrodes ac10 with 1 cm electrode gap is the best electrode combination fig 3 3 2 effect of ph ph is a crucial factor influencing the performance of electrocoagulation especially the coagulation mechanism because it governs the hydrolyzed metal species generated in reactive media and influences the prevailing mechanisms of electrocoagulation precipitation of al oh 3 occurs in the neutral ph range and contributes to removing pollutants from water initiating the sweep flocculation process 26 growing in size positively charged al oh 3 aggregates electrostatically attract negatively charged pollutants resulting in pollutants neutralization destabilization and precipitation the initial ph of the wastewater was nearly neutral as the process continues the ph value increases and reaches a range of 8 9 this occurs due to the formation of various metal hydroxide complexes in the wastewater ie if an ec system has an acidic influent the ph of the wastewater increases at the final stage of the treatment process the generation of hydroxide ions oh continually formed from water reduction at the cathode is primarily responsible for the ph increase from the fig 4 it can be inferred that the wastewater is more basic when using cu electrodes than al electrodes at the end of the processing time whereas for alloy electrodes the presence and release of hydroxide ions of both al and cu simultaneously increase ph at the beginning and attain a steady level after sufficient reaction time the final ph range was observed from the range of 8 1 to 8 5 in al electrode combinations the release of oh is less compared with respect to cu electrodes therefore the observed ph range is nearly 7 75 to 8 in al electrode combination and 8 25 to 9 0 in cu electrode combination with inter electrode gaps of 1 cm and 2 cm respectively the use of aluminium as electrode material in the ec serves as a ph neutralizer ec treatment can be used to treat wastewater and eliminate the need for further ph adjustment of the wastewater 37 38 therefore al and alloy electrodes do not require additional treatment and are suitable for reuse in comparison treated wastewater with cu electrode requires additional downstream processing steps prior to reuse since it imparts a blue color to the water 3 3 conductivity and total dissolved solids conductivity is the material s ability to conduct electricity it depends on the available charge carriers ionic and their mobility the valence and the temperature of the ions conductivity is also strongly dependent on the system s viscosity and increases with rising temperature following arrhenius like behaviour 39 41 the total dissolved solids tds are usually low for freshwater sources at less than 500 mg l 42 seawater and brackish mixed fresh and sweater water contain 500 30 000 and 30 40 000 mg l tds the tds is most accurately measured by weighing a filtered sample and drying at 105 c until no further mass is lost a more rapid method is to use conductivity which is proportional to tds this is particularly important in the case of very high purity water whose quality is often specified as conductivity in micro siemens per centimeter deionized water has a very low conductivity around 0 06 μs cm 43 according to who the palatability of drinking water has been rated by panels of tasters in relation to its tds level as follows excellent less than 300 mg l good between 300 and 600 mg l fair between 600 and 900 mg l poor between 900 and 1200 mg l and unacceptable greater than 1200 mg l 44 table 3 represents the conductivity and tds profile for the ec treated sdw the conductivity and tds range of al ac1 ac5 and ac10 effectively suits the general water quality parameter whereas the cu electrode treated sdw is the worst al and all other alloy electrode combinations show a decent water treatment quality opening the scope and applicability of alloy electrodes in the ec mediated wastewater treatment 3 4 turbidity profile for the treated wastewater turbidity is the measure of the relative clarity of a liquid it is an optical characteristic of water and measures the amount of light scattered by material in the water when light passes through the sample comparing the turbidity reduction potential of al and cu electrodes the al al electrode with a 1 cm electrode gap effectively removes 84 19 3 of turbidity at a minimal reaction time of 72 min fig 5 shows the turbidity removal efficiency variation with reaction time profiling for different electrode combinations the turbidity profile of sdw with the cu cu electrode combination has the least turbidity removal the maximum possible turbidity reduction is observed in the reaction with the cu electrode in the range of only 66 33 0 57 to 67 98 as the chemical reaction progresses beyond the optimum reaction time the turbidity reduction percentage for cu electrodes is observed to be slightly reduced this may be due to over release of cu2 ions which further results in blue colored sdw the alloy electrodes are suitable candidates for better turbidity reduction with a shorter reaction time all selected alloy electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 pose a turbidity removal of over 81 5 the maximum turbidity removal of 81 64 3 21 is observed with the electrocoagulation reaction with ac10 electrodes at a reaction time of 54 min as the reaction time progresses the turbidity and cod removal efficiency also increases due to the increase of the amount of in situ metal hydroxides produced at constant operating voltage 45 due to the maximum quantity of pollutants connected to the binding sites of the in situ coagulants present at constant voltage the removal efficiency was determined to remain stable after a particular reaction time therefore the applicability of alloy electrodes impacts a better electrode choice for wastewater treatment 3 5 zeta potential zeta potential ζ is a measure of the electrical potential between particles and indicates the repulsive interaction between particles a zero zeta potential means that the conditions for aggregation of contaminants are maximized it is known that the degree of destabilization increases as ζ approaches zero monitoring zeta potential during the water treatment process allows for accurate and precise assessment of the charge neutralization process 15 17 zeta potential provides a measurable value to monitor the optimal coagulant dose during the water clarification process generally colloids with high zeta potential negative or positive are electrically stabilized while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate therefore the ec wastewater with ζ closer to zero would be optimal in order to maximize the removal 38 46 from the fig 6 cu exhibits a higher negative zeta value and less coagulation for al ac1 ac5 and ac10 electrodes pose low zeta potentials reducing the electrostatic interactions between particles allowing the particles to approach closely and produce more compact flocs for alloy electrodes the zeta potential range is 37 7 3 17 mv and 44 43 0 68 mv for ac1 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gaps for the ac5 electrode combination the corresponding zeta potential value ranges from 35 6 0 85 mv and 34 56 0 4 mv and for the ac10 electrode combination the zeta potential value is from 35 63 0 05 mv and 36 5 0 34 mv results indicate a better coagulation rate for alloy electrodes compared to al and cu electrode combinations a moderate to low stability is observed in alloy electrodes indicating a higher coagulation rate the wastewater treatment parameters using cu electrodes are least compared to all other electrode combinations therefore the zeta potential value is comparatively higher for sdw treated using cu as the electrode the zeta potential range for the cu electrode is 83 2 3 72 mv to 83 8 0 52 mv indicating the poor selectivity of the cu electrode in sdw treatment whereas the al electrode is comparatively better than cu the zeta potential values obtained are near the alloy electrodes range the electrode gap is one of the vital factors that determine the treatment efficiency of sdw the results represent that the stability of the liquid phase is poor for experiments conducted with a 1 cm electrode gap than a reaction with 2 cm electrode gap which indicates the better treatment efficiency with experiments with 1 cm electrode gap 3 6 chemical oxygen demand cod is a commonly used metric for determining the susceptibility to oxidation of organic and inorganic elements in water bodies and municipal and industrial wastewater the cod removal is observed high when inter electrode distance gap is small fig 7 represents the cod removal pattern for swd treatment using different electrode combinations and variable inter electrode gap comparing al and cu electrodes the al electrode is a suitable candidate as an electrode material for wastewater treatment the cod analytical result shows a maximum cod removal percentage of 98 275 for al ac1 ac5 ac10 combinations and 61 206 cod removal for cu electrode combinations the time required to attain the maximum possible cod removal for all selected electrode combinations is different among the selected electrode combinations used for the study ac10 electrodes with an inter electrode gap distance of 1 cm show a faster cod removal in a minimal reaction time of 54 min whereas ac1 requires 84 and 96 min for 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gap to achieve 98 275 and in the case of ac5 it requires 78 and 102 min for 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gap to achieve 98 275 in the case of the best electrode ac10 if the inter electrode gap is increased to 2 cm 84 min is required to attain 98 275 cod removal the cu electrode the time required to attain its maximum percentage cod removal of 61 206 requires 120 and 198 min for reaction with 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gap table 4 represents the electrode combinations used in the electrocoagulation of dairy wastewater treatment this table compares the result obtained with previously reported results 3 7 alloy electrode characterization alloy electrodes were characterized to determine electrode hardness morphology and eds analysis 3 7 1 xrd spectral analysis the x ray diffractogram of the synthesized electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 was obtained between 10 to 90 bragg s angle are shown in fig 8 all the prepared electrodes showed an alloy of cu and al with a highly crystalline tetragonal structure all the peaks corresponding to bragg s angle 29 42 37 917 65 18 78 36 and 82 113 corresponds to the 2 0 0 2 1 1 3 3 0 0 0 4 and 1 1 1 planes of khatyrkite pdf icdd 96 901 2197 it is inferred that as the concentration of cu increases the sharp crystalline peak at bragg s angle 20 66 with 110 of khatyrkite cu4al8 is visible ac10 the reaction mechanism of khatyrkite is as follows the overall reaction for al cu alloy electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 16 cu 4 al 8 24 h 2 o 4cu oh 2 8al oh 2 12 h 2 17 equilibrium constant k c c cu oh 2 4 al oh 2 8 h 2

2 electrode morphology and eds analysis scanning electron microscopy sem was employed to analyze electrode surfaces physical and morphological characteristics with respect to the reacted and unreacted zone fig 9 in the electrocoagulation process for the treatment of sdw a part of the electrode is dipped in the wastewater the reaction occurs only from the electrode interface to the electrode dipping area the anodic corrosion of the electrode takes place at this dipping area fig 9 b c and d resulting in more voids metal leaching than the unreacted zone fig 9 a comparing the morphological analysis the ac10 electrode has less surface damage at the reaction zone than all other alloy electrode combinations energy dispersive spectroscopy eds is used to determine the elemental composition of the alloy electrode used for the treatment of sdw as shown in fig 10 the major elements present in the alloy electrodes are o al si cu and zn the major elements with compositions were tabulated it is inferred that as the amount of cu increases metal hardness increases 19 3 7 3 electrode hardness the vickers hardness test for the determination of electrode hardness is depicted in fig 11 the hardness testing is conducted at the operating conditions of 0 5n test load and the holding time was 15s the micro hardness of each electrode sample was measured five times at random the results show that the electrode hardness increases according to increment in percentage addition of copper in the matrix the increase in cu content improves the hardness of the matrix 51 comparing the alloy electrode ac1 is observed with a minimal hardness of 505 8 53 mpa and the maximum hardness value of 729 10 65 mpa is observed in ac10 among all electrodes al has the least hardness value 358 mpa 3 7 4 electrode loss in the electrocoagulation process the anode material will electrochemically corrode due to oxidation when linked to an external power source whereas the cathode will be passivated the electrode corrosion results in weight loss of electrodes especially at the anode in electrocoagulation process mediated wastewater treatment one of the major constraints which pull down the applicability of electrocoagulation is the electrode loss and requirement of periodic electrode replacement the experimental results figs 12 and 13 depict the electrode loss profiling at anode and cathode during the reaction till maximum cod removal it is observed that the electrode loss in anode and cathode is generally less for alloys ac1 ac5 ac10 than for al and cu electrodes for al and cu electrodes the electrode loss at the anode is a maximum of 0 38 to 0 32 for al electrodes and 0 38 to 0 24 for cu electrodes among alloy electrodes the percentage electrode loss at the anode is observed maximum for ac1 with 0 297 0 017 with 1 cm inter electrode gap experimental run and 0 191 0 033 for 2 cm inter electrode gap experimental run among alloy electrodes the minimum electrode loss is observed for ac10 the corresponding electrode loss for 1 cm and 2 cm inter electrode gap experimental run are 0 084 0 018 and 0 092 0 001 in ac5 the observed percentage electrode loss are ranging from 0 149 0 029 and 0 147 0 006 respectively the result shows that as the cu content in alloy increases the loss of anode reduces the inter electrode distance is the key factor determining the electrode loss the electrode loss is maximum for experimental runs with minimal inter electrode distance the applied voltage of the ec process was maintained as 30 v according to faraday s law the metal ions generated by anode dissolution increase as the applied voltage increases 29 52 higher dissolved metal concentrations resulted in greater coagulation efficiency and colloidal particle instability 31 32 electrode loss in the cathode in dairy wastewater treatment as observed with a range from 0 05 to 0 149 0 029 for the selected electrode combinations used for the current study fig 13 the electrode loss at the cathode is due to hydrogen generation which may be split into two distinct processes using an aluminium or alloy ac1 ac5 ac10 cathode the first is due to an electrochemical process h2o reduction while the second is due to a chemical reaction which accounts for the cathode dissolution 53 3 8 sludge characterization the sludge generated from the electrocoagulation process is evaluated for its settling ability the fig 14 depicts the sludge settling in terms of sludge supernatant interface height as a function of settling time a quick and continuous reduction in the height of the sludge supernatant interface indicated by virtually constant slope was seen at the start of the time course indicating the zone settling and transition settling regimes both of these regimes are attained within 3 min of the sedimentation test all alloys ac1 ac5 and ac10 and al exhibit sludge sedimentation properties in terms of sludge generated from the cu electrode the blue color imparted in the sample makes it inconvenient to analyze the sludge settling characters the test liquid s turbidity and imparted blue color prove its poor water treatment parameters alloy electrodes show a better settleability and water treatment efficiency among all electrode combinations tested for this study regarding the quantity of sludge generation table 2 the alloy electrode generates more sludge than al electrodes the quantity of sludge generation in alloy electrode with electrode gap of 1 cm and 2 cm is as follows ac1 0 098 0 079 l l ac5 0 078 0 077 l l and ac10 0 077 0 082 l l in cu electrodes the sludge generation is massive as the reaction time increases the sludge generation also increases and water becomes more turbid due to the excess liberation of cu2 ions 3 8 1 ftir spectrum of sludge the significant peaks found in sludge generated after the electrocoagulation process of dairy wastewater using different electrodes are cc bending at 960 and 964 confirms the presence of an alkene ch bending observed at 1392 35 alkane strong oh stretching observed at 3289 75 is due to the presence of alcohols cn stretching at 1646 is due to the presence of imine oxime the strong nh stretching at 2970 06 validates the presence of amine salt fig 15 3 9 operating cost one of the most deciding parameters for selecting and implementing wastewater treatment is the operational cost in this study electrical energy has been considered an essential parameter 33 54 55 the electrical energy consumption at the selected operating conditions was calculated using eqs 12 15 the energy consumption is tabulated in table 5 the results indicate the economic applicability of al electrodes over alloy electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 even though the alloy electrodes expense is higher than all other electrode combinations the electrode loss in alloy electrodes is comparatively lesser in terms of expense to electrode loss and treatment performance the applicability of alloy electrodes is the best suppose the performance comparison is made with reaction time as the first priority over economics in that case ac10 is the best choice of interest among the selected electrode combinations used in this study the cu electrodes require a higher operating cost with a lower treatment quality the al electrode is economical with a better treatment profile 4 electrocoagulation perspectives and sludge reusability scope electrocoagulation process mediated wastewater treatment evolved rapidly in the last decade aluminium iron and stainless steel are the favorite electrode materials for process design engineers and environmental engineers for wastewater treatment even though the applicability of alloys as an electrode material is not that much explored in the present research an attempt is made to explore this gap and propose the relevance of alloy electrodes derived from al and cu for dairy wastewater treatment generation of sludge and proper management of metallic sludge generated after the electrocoagulation process is a constraint in adapting electrocoagulation mediated wastewater treatment the sludge generated after chemical coagulation and reusability as fuel in boilers incinerators or fuel briquettes is reported in previous studies 42 the resulting bottom ash can be mixed with clay and cement to form fire bricks or used in other construction projects such as land fillers for roads and bases for buildings the metal content in the sludge generated by the electrocoagulation process enhances the thermal stability of the product developed by reusing it an explorable potential for generating wealth from waste persists in this area 5 conclusions electrocoagulation is becoming more important in wastewater treatment and has a promising future the ec process could replace conventional electricity with solar power for the ec process it s one step closer to long term replacement of standard treatment systems credits to its hybrid integration possibilities with other separation methods batch electrocoagulation studies were performed to evaluate the influence of various experimental parameters such as electrode loss ph turbidity and zeta potential on removing pollutants from dairy wastewater the results of this study have shown the applicability of electrocoagulation in the treatment of dairy industry wastewater if an ec system has an acidic influent the ph of the wastewater increases during the treatment process zeta potential value will decrease during the process indicating the tendency to coagulate among the alal cucu combinations aluminium electrodes are best to treat sdw they give crystal clear solution while copper electrodes impart blue color to sdw even though they are expensive when comparing the treatment efficiency results of alloy electrodes the alcu alloy electrodes combinations ac1 ac5 and ac10 are best suited for treating dairy wastewater since they generate cu oh 2 and al oh complexes simultaneously which accelerate the formation of the floc and enhance wastewater treatment with minimal reaction time compared to alal and cucu combinations among the alcu electrodes alloy combinations ac10 is the better choice among the electrode combinations chosen for the study with a turbidity removal of 81 64 3 21 and cod removal of 98 29 0 92 respectively with a minimal reaction time of 54 min the surface damage of ac10 electrode has less at the reaction zone than all other alloy electrode combinations used in this study this result inferred that as the cu content in alloy increases the loss of anode reduces the electrode loss in ac10 is smaller than all other alloy combinations chosen for this study all alloy electrodes water treatment performance was better than cu and al electrodes cu electrodes are the least efficient electrode with a maximum turbidity removal percentage range of 66 33 0 57 to 67 98 and a maximum cod removal of 61 20 electrocoagulation with al cu and alloy electrodes with 1 cm and 2 cm inter electrode distance have been compared the reaction time required for the quick water treatment is attained with experiments with smaller inter electrode gaps alloy electrodes have a high turbidity reduction percentage over 81 and minimal reaction time which opens its applicability in dairy wastewater treatment and the possibilities for future electrocoagulation reactor design statement of novelty and significance there has been no previous investigation into the performance of alloy electrodes in electrocoagulation mediated dairy

chemical and refinery industries the dairy industry ranks third in water use and wastewater output 1 2 the untreated discards from the dairy industry result in severe environmental problems due to the presence of high organic content several methodologies and reactors are implemented to treat dairy wastewater from an industrial viewpoint biological 3 5 chemical coagulants 6 7 electrocoagulation 8 and membrane technology 9 are the most suitable technologies implemented at the industrial level to design dairy wastewater treatment plants the most popular reactors for the dairy wastewater treatment are bioreactors such as uasb 4 5 cstr 3 anaerobic sequencing batch reactors 10 11 hybrid anaerobic biofilm reactor 12 etc membrane reactors currently emerged as alternative technologies for industrial wastewater treatment the advancement of research and development results in adapting various new technologies the electrocoagulation ec technique is one of the popular water and wastewater treatment technology ec is an indirect wastewater treatment method that employs anodes and cathodes made of iron or aluminium metals because they are non toxic affordable and widely available electrocoagulation ec technology has regained popularity in the last decade because it combines the advantages and performance of traditional coagulation flotation and conventional electrochemical water and wastewater treatment in the batch and continuous mode ec relies on the electrochemical dissolution of sacrificial metal electrodes induced by the passage of electric current into soluble or insoluble species that enhance the coagulation adsorption or precipitation of soluble or colloidal pollutants in various water and wastewater wastewater metal dissolution anode and water reduction are electrolytic processes that occur during ec with aluminium electrodes al al an al anode and an al cathode and copper electrodes cu cu cu at anode and cathode cathode as a result the main reactions on

have reported the composite metallic materials cmms preparation by dispersing copper particulates in aluminium matrix using stir cast technique 19 even though the applicability of cmms or metal alloys in wastewater treatment are in infancy the applicability of alloy electrodes derived from alcu are proposed in this work in alloy electrodes ac1 ac5 and ac10 with the known compositions imparts the generation of cu oh 2and al oh complexes which simultaneously accelerate the flocs formation and enhance wastewater treatment the reactor design scale up and development based on electrocoagulation methods are few in number the cost considerations selection availability of suitable electrodes electricity requirement and management issues of chemical or metallic sludge are the significant constraints in designing and implementing electrocoagulation reactors at the industrial level even though the laboratory scale study on electrocoagulation process mediated wastewater treatment was reported with al 20 22 cu 23 fe 8 24 al ti pt 25 and mild steel 26 electrode combinations but limited research work was documented on the performance evaluation of alloy electrodes in the electrocoagulation mediated dairy wastewater treatment therefore this article evaluates these unexplored areas on the effects and possibilities of alloy electrodes derived from al and cu for dairy

coagulation efficiency and more significant destabilization of the colloidal particles 31 32 therefore a higher 30 v is provided using a dc power supply with a constant electrode dipping area throughout the course of the experiment the agitation is provided with a constant rpm at 200 at every 6 min of the process the electrode loss at anode and cathode zeta potential ph turbidity and cod were analyzed for comparing the treatment efficiencies of the selected electrode combinations all experiments were conducted in triplicates with 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gaps in a bipolar electrode assembly fig 2 by keeping the current density constant the sludge generated after the electrocoagulation process of sdw treatment is analyzed for the rate of sludge sedimentation volume and density 2 5 electrical energy consumption electrical energy consumption and current efficiency are critical economic characteristics in the electrocoagulation process the electrical energy consumption is estimated as follows 12 e u i t where e electrical energy kwh u cell voltage volt i current in ampere a and t time of electrocoagulation process hour the current efficiency u of the ec method related to production of al2 and cu2 ions was calculated using the equation given below 13 c f m exp m theo 100 where mexp is the actual amount of aluminium dissolved in the solution also mtheo is the theoretical amount of aluminium that should be dissolved in the solution by induced current in the electrolytic cell and can be calculated according to faraday s law 14 m theo m x i x t n x f that mtheo is the mass of the metal dissolved g i is the current a t is the time of ec process s m is the molecular weight of the metal g mol 1 n is the number of electrons involved in the electrochemical reaction that is equal to 3 for al 2 for cu and for alloy electrode n is taken as the average value of al and cu f is the faraday constant 96 487c mol l of electron 33 the specific electrical energy consumption seec was calculated as a function of electrodes weight consumption during electrocoagulation in kwh kg using the eq 15 34 36 15 seec n x f x u 3 6 x 10 3 c f x m 10 3 3 results and discussions 3 1 electrocoagulation process reaction time the effect of operating time on turbidity and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency was examined with the simulated dairy wastewater without controlling ph at the different operating times for selected electrode combinations when considering general electrode combinations of al and cu reaction time for al is observed to be lesser than cu for alloy electrodes reactions with an inter electrode gap of 1 cm are observed to have lesser reaction time than an experimental run with a 2 cm electrode gap compared with al and cu electrodes alloy electrodes have less reaction time may be due to the simultaneous production of al oh 3 and cu oh 2 which leads to faster floc formation among alloy electrodes ac10 with 1 cm electrode gap is the best electrode combination fig 3 3 2 effect of ph ph is a crucial factor influencing the performance of electrocoagulation especially the coagulation mechanism because it governs the hydrolyzed metal species generated in reactive media and influences the prevailing mechanisms of electrocoagulation precipitation of al oh 3 occurs in the neutral ph range and contributes to removing pollutants from water initiating the sweep flocculation process 26 growing in size positively charged al oh 3 aggregates electrostatically attract negatively charged pollutants resulting in pollutants neutralization destabilization and precipitation the initial ph of the wastewater was nearly neutral as the process continues the ph value increases and reaches a range of 8 9 this occurs due to the formation of various metal hydroxide complexes in the wastewater ie if an ec system has an acidic influent the ph of the wastewater increases at the final stage of the treatment process the generation of hydroxide ions oh continually formed from water reduction at the cathode is primarily responsible for the ph increase from the fig 4 it can be inferred that the wastewater is more basic when using cu electrodes than al electrodes at the end of the processing time whereas for alloy electrodes the presence and release of hydroxide ions of both al and cu simultaneously increase ph at the beginning and attain a steady level after sufficient reaction time the final ph range was observed from the range of 8 1 to 8 5 in al electrode combinations the release of oh is less compared with respect to cu electrodes therefore the observed ph range is nearly 7 75 to 8 in al electrode combination and 8 25 to 9 0 in cu electrode combination with inter electrode gaps of 1 cm and 2 cm respectively the use of aluminium as electrode material in the ec serves as a ph neutralizer ec treatment can be used to treat wastewater and eliminate the need for further ph adjustment of the wastewater 37 38 therefore al and alloy electrodes do not require additional treatment and are suitable for reuse in comparison treated wastewater with cu electrode requires additional downstream processing steps prior to reuse since it imparts a blue color to the water 3 3 conductivity and total dissolved solids conductivity is the material s ability to conduct electricity it depends on the available charge carriers ionic and their mobility the valence and the temperature of the ions conductivity is also strongly dependent on the system s viscosity and increases with rising temperature following arrhenius like behaviour 39 41 the total dissolved solids tds are usually low for freshwater sources at less than 500 mg l 42 seawater and brackish mixed fresh and sweater water contain 500 30 000 and 30 40 000 mg l tds the tds is most accurately measured by weighing a filtered sample and drying at 105 c until no further mass is lost a more rapid method is to use conductivity which is proportional to tds this is particularly important in the case of very high purity water whose quality is often specified as conductivity in micro siemens per centimeter deionized water has a very low conductivity around 0 06 μs cm 43 according to who the palatability of drinking water has been rated by panels of tasters in relation to its tds level as follows excellent less than 300 mg l good between 300 and 600 mg l fair between 600 and 900 mg l poor between 900 and 1200 mg l and unacceptable greater than 1200 mg l 44 table 3 represents the conductivity and tds profile for the ec treated sdw the conductivity and tds range of al ac1 ac5 and ac10 effectively suits the general water quality parameter whereas the cu electrode treated sdw is the worst al and all other alloy electrode combinations show a decent water treatment quality opening the scope and applicability of alloy electrodes in the ec mediated wastewater treatment 3 4 turbidity profile for the treated wastewater turbidity is the measure of the relative clarity of a liquid it is an optical characteristic of water and measures the amount of light scattered by material in the water when light passes through the sample comparing the turbidity reduction potential of al and cu electrodes the al al electrode with a 1 cm electrode gap effectively removes 84 19 3 of turbidity at a minimal reaction time of 72 min fig 5 shows the turbidity removal efficiency variation with reaction time profiling for different electrode combinations the turbidity profile of sdw with the cu cu electrode combination has the least turbidity removal the maximum possible turbidity reduction is observed in the reaction with the cu electrode in the range of only 66 33 0 57 to 67 98 as the chemical reaction progresses beyond the optimum reaction time the turbidity reduction percentage for cu electrodes is observed to be slightly reduced this may be due to over release of cu2 ions which further results in blue colored sdw the alloy electrodes are suitable candidates for better turbidity reduction with a shorter reaction time all selected alloy electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 pose a turbidity removal of over 81 5 the maximum turbidity removal of 81 64 3 21 is observed with the electrocoagulation reaction with ac10 electrodes at a reaction time of 54 min as the reaction time progresses the turbidity and cod removal efficiency also increases due to the increase of the amount of in situ metal hydroxides produced at constant operating voltage 45 due to the maximum quantity of pollutants connected to the binding sites of the in situ coagulants present at constant voltage the removal efficiency was determined to remain stable after a particular reaction time therefore the applicability of alloy electrodes impacts a better electrode choice for wastewater treatment 3 5 zeta potential zeta potential ζ is a measure of the electrical potential between particles and indicates the repulsive interaction between particles a zero zeta potential means that the conditions for aggregation of contaminants are maximized it is known that the degree of destabilization increases as ζ approaches zero monitoring zeta potential during the water treatment process allows for accurate and precise assessment of the charge neutralization process 15 17 zeta potential provides a measurable value to monitor the optimal coagulant dose during the water clarification process generally colloids with high zeta potential negative or positive are electrically stabilized while colloids with low zeta potentials tend to coagulate or flocculate therefore the ec wastewater with ζ closer to zero would be optimal in order to maximize the removal 38 46 from the fig 6 cu exhibits a higher negative zeta value and less coagulation for al ac1 ac5 and ac10 electrodes pose low zeta potentials reducing the electrostatic interactions between particles allowing the particles to approach closely and produce more compact flocs for alloy electrodes the zeta potential range is 37 7 3 17 mv and 44 43 0 68 mv for ac1 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gaps for the ac5 electrode combination the corresponding zeta potential value ranges from 35 6 0 85 mv and 34 56 0 4 mv and for the ac10 electrode combination the zeta potential value is from 35 63 0 05 mv and 36 5 0 34 mv results indicate a better coagulation rate for alloy electrodes compared to al and cu electrode combinations a moderate to low stability is observed in alloy electrodes indicating a higher coagulation rate the wastewater treatment parameters using cu electrodes are least compared to all other electrode combinations therefore the zeta potential value is comparatively higher for sdw treated using cu as the electrode the zeta potential range for the cu electrode is 83 2 3 72 mv to 83 8 0 52 mv indicating the poor selectivity of the cu electrode in sdw treatment whereas the al electrode is comparatively better than cu the zeta potential values obtained are near the alloy electrodes range the electrode gap is one of the vital factors that determine the treatment efficiency of sdw the results represent that the stability of the liquid phase is poor for experiments conducted with a 1 cm electrode gap than a reaction with 2 cm electrode gap which indicates the better treatment efficiency with experiments with 1 cm electrode gap 3 6 chemical oxygen demand cod is a commonly used metric for determining the susceptibility to oxidation of organic and inorganic elements in water bodies and municipal and industrial wastewater the cod removal is observed high when inter electrode distance gap is small fig 7 represents the cod removal pattern for swd treatment using different electrode combinations and variable inter electrode gap comparing al and cu electrodes the al electrode is a suitable candidate as an electrode material for wastewater treatment the cod analytical result shows a maximum cod removal percentage of 98 275 for al ac1 ac5 ac10 combinations and 61 206 cod removal for cu electrode combinations the time required to attain the maximum possible cod removal for all selected electrode combinations is different among the selected electrode combinations used for the study ac10 electrodes with an inter electrode gap distance of 1 cm show a faster cod removal in a minimal reaction time of 54 min whereas ac1 requires 84 and 96 min for 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gap to achieve 98 275 and in the case of ac5 it requires 78 and 102 min for 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gap to achieve 98 275 in the case of the best electrode ac10 if the inter electrode gap is increased to 2 cm 84 min is required to attain 98 275 cod removal the cu electrode the time required to attain its maximum percentage cod removal of 61 206 requires 120 and 198 min for reaction with 1 cm and 2 cm electrode gap table 4 represents the electrode combinations used in the electrocoagulation of dairy wastewater treatment this table compares the result obtained with previously reported results 3 7 alloy electrode characterization alloy electrodes were characterized to determine electrode hardness morphology and eds analysis 3 7 1 xrd spectral analysis the x ray diffractogram of the synthesized electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 was obtained between 10 to 90 bragg s angle are shown in fig 8 all the prepared electrodes showed an alloy of cu and al with a highly crystalline tetragonal structure all the peaks corresponding to bragg s angle 29 42 37 917 65 18 78 36 and 82 113 corresponds to the 2 0 0 2 1 1 3 3 0 0 0 4 and 1 1 1 planes of khatyrkite pdf icdd 96 901 2197 it is inferred that as the concentration of cu increases the sharp crystalline peak at bragg s angle 20 66 with 110 of khatyrkite cu4al8 is visible ac10 the reaction mechanism of khatyrkite is as follows the overall reaction for al cu alloy electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 16 cu 4 al 8 24 h 2 o 4cu oh 2 8al oh 2 12 h 2 17 equilibrium constant k c c cu oh 2 4 al oh 2 8 h 2

2 electrode morphology and eds analysis scanning electron microscopy sem was employed to analyze electrode surfaces physical and morphological characteristics with respect to the reacted and unreacted zone fig 9 in the electrocoagulation process for the treatment of sdw a part of the electrode is dipped in the wastewater the reaction occurs only from the electrode interface to the electrode dipping area the anodic corrosion of the electrode takes place at this dipping area fig 9 b c and d resulting in more voids metal leaching than the unreacted zone fig 9 a comparing the morphological analysis the ac10 electrode has less surface damage at the reaction zone than all other alloy electrode combinations energy dispersive spectroscopy eds is used to determine the elemental composition of the alloy electrode used for the treatment of sdw as shown in fig 10 the major elements present in the alloy electrodes are o al si cu and zn the major elements with compositions were tabulated it is inferred that as the amount of cu increases metal hardness increases 19 3 7 3 electrode hardness the vickers hardness test for the determination of electrode hardness is depicted in fig 11 the hardness testing is conducted at the operating conditions of 0 5n test load and the holding time was 15s the micro hardness of each electrode sample was measured five times at random the results show that the electrode hardness increases according to increment in percentage addition of copper in the matrix the increase in cu content improves the hardness of the matrix 51 comparing the alloy electrode ac1 is observed with a minimal hardness of 505 8 53 mpa and the maximum hardness value of 729 10 65 mpa is observed in ac10 among all electrodes al has the least hardness value 358 mpa 3 7 4 electrode loss in the electrocoagulation process the anode material will electrochemically corrode due to oxidation when linked to an external power source whereas the cathode will be passivated the electrode corrosion results in weight loss of electrodes especially at the anode in electrocoagulation process mediated wastewater treatment one of the major constraints which pull down the applicability of electrocoagulation is the electrode loss and requirement of periodic electrode replacement the experimental results figs 12 and 13 depict the electrode loss profiling at anode and cathode during the reaction till maximum cod removal it is observed that the electrode loss in anode and cathode is generally less for alloys ac1 ac5 ac10 than for al and cu electrodes for al and cu electrodes the electrode loss at the anode is a maximum of 0 38 to 0 32 for al electrodes and 0 38 to 0 24 for cu electrodes among alloy electrodes the percentage electrode loss at the anode is observed maximum for ac1 with 0 297 0 017 with 1 cm inter electrode gap experimental run and 0 191 0 033 for 2 cm inter electrode gap experimental run among alloy electrodes the minimum electrode loss is observed for ac10 the corresponding electrode loss for 1 cm and 2 cm inter electrode gap experimental run are 0 084 0 018 and 0 092 0 001 in ac5 the observed percentage electrode loss are ranging from 0 149 0 029 and 0 147 0 006 respectively the result shows that as the cu content in alloy increases the loss of anode reduces the inter electrode distance is the key factor determining the electrode loss the electrode loss is maximum for experimental runs with minimal inter electrode distance the applied voltage of the ec process was maintained as 30 v according to faraday s law the metal ions generated by anode dissolution increase as the applied voltage increases 29 52 higher dissolved metal concentrations resulted in greater coagulation efficiency and colloidal particle instability 31 32 electrode loss in the cathode in dairy wastewater treatment as observed with a range from 0 05 to 0 149 0 029 for the selected electrode combinations used for the current study fig 13 the electrode loss at the cathode is due to hydrogen generation which may be split into two distinct processes using an aluminium or alloy ac1 ac5 ac10 cathode the first is due to an electrochemical process h2o reduction while the second is due to a chemical reaction which accounts for the cathode dissolution 53 3 8 sludge characterization the sludge generated from the electrocoagulation process is evaluated for its settling ability the fig 14 depicts the sludge settling in terms of sludge supernatant interface height as a function of settling time a quick and continuous reduction in the height of the sludge supernatant interface indicated by virtually constant slope was seen at the start of the time course indicating the zone settling and transition settling regimes both of these regimes are attained within 3 min of the sedimentation test all alloys ac1 ac5 and ac10 and al exhibit sludge sedimentation properties in terms of sludge generated from the cu electrode the blue color imparted in the sample makes it inconvenient to analyze the sludge settling characters the test liquid s turbidity and imparted blue color prove its poor water treatment parameters alloy electrodes show a better settleability and water treatment efficiency among all electrode combinations tested for this study regarding the quantity of sludge generation table 2 the alloy electrode generates more sludge than al electrodes the quantity of sludge generation in alloy electrode with electrode gap of 1 cm and 2 cm is as follows ac1 0 098 0 079 l l ac5 0 078 0 077 l l and ac10 0 077 0 082 l l in cu electrodes the sludge generation is massive as the reaction time increases the sludge generation also increases and water becomes more turbid due to the excess liberation of cu2 ions 3 8 1 ftir spectrum of sludge the significant peaks found in sludge generated after the electrocoagulation process of dairy wastewater using different electrodes are cc bending at 960 and 964 confirms the presence of an alkene ch bending observed at 1392 35 alkane strong oh stretching observed at 3289 75 is due to the presence of alcohols cn stretching at 1646 is due to the presence of imine oxime the strong nh stretching at 2970 06 validates the presence of amine salt fig 15 3 9 operating cost one of the most deciding parameters for selecting and implementing wastewater treatment is the operational cost in this study electrical energy has been considered an essential parameter 33 54 55 the electrical energy consumption at the selected operating conditions was calculated using eqs 12 15 the energy consumption is tabulated in table 5 the results indicate the economic applicability of al electrodes over alloy electrodes ac1 ac5 ac10 even though the alloy electrodes expense is higher than all other electrode combinations the electrode loss in alloy electrodes is comparatively lesser in terms of expense to electrode loss and treatment performance the applicability of alloy electrodes is the best suppose the performance comparison is made with reaction time as the first priority over economics in that case ac10 is the best choice of interest among the selected electrode combinations used in this study the cu electrodes require a higher operating cost with a lower treatment quality the al electrode is economical with a better treatment profile 4 electrocoagulation perspectives and sludge reusability scope electrocoagulation process mediated wastewater treatment evolved rapidly in the last decade aluminium iron and stainless steel are the favorite electrode materials for process design engineers and environmental engineers for wastewater treatment even though the applicability of alloys as an electrode material is not that much explored in the present research an attempt is made to explore this gap and propose the relevance of alloy electrodes derived from al and cu for dairy wastewater treatment generation of sludge and proper management of metallic sludge generated after the electrocoagulation process is a constraint in adapting electrocoagulation mediated wastewater treatment the sludge generated after chemical coagulation and reusability as fuel in boilers incinerators or fuel briquettes is reported in previous studies 42 the resulting bottom ash can be mixed with clay and cement to form fire bricks or used in other construction projects such as land fillers for roads and bases for buildings the metal content in the sludge generated by the electrocoagulation process enhances the thermal stability of the product developed by reusing it an explorable potential for generating wealth from waste persists in this area 5 conclusions electrocoagulation is becoming more important in wastewater treatment and has a promising future the ec process could replace conventional electricity with solar power for the ec process it s one step closer to long term replacement of standard treatment systems credits to its hybrid integration possibilities with other separation methods batch electrocoagulation studies were performed to evaluate the influence of various experimental parameters such as electrode loss ph turbidity and zeta potential on removing pollutants from dairy wastewater the results of this study have shown the applicability of electrocoagulation in the treatment of dairy industry wastewater if an ec system has an acidic influent the ph of the wastewater increases during the treatment process zeta potential value will decrease during the process indicating the tendency to coagulate among the alal cucu combinations aluminium electrodes are best to treat sdw they give crystal clear solution while copper electrodes impart blue color to sdw even though they are expensive when comparing the treatment efficiency results of alloy electrodes the alcu alloy electrodes combinations ac1 ac5 and ac10 are best suited for treating dairy wastewater since they generate cu oh 2 and al oh complexes simultaneously which accelerate the formation of the floc and enhance wastewater treatment with minimal reaction time compared to alal and cucu combinations among the alcu electrodes alloy combinations ac10 is the better choice among the electrode combinations chosen for the study with a turbidity removal of 81 64 3 21 and cod removal of 98 29 0 92 respectively with a minimal reaction time of 54 min the surface damage of ac10 electrode has less at the reaction zone than all other alloy electrode combinations used in this study this result inferred that as the cu content in alloy increases the loss of anode reduces the electrode loss in ac10 is smaller than all other alloy combinations chosen for this study all alloy electrodes water treatment performance was better than cu and al electrodes cu electrodes are the least efficient electrode with a maximum turbidity removal percentage range of 66 33 0 57 to 67 98 and a maximum cod removal of 61 20 electrocoagulation with al cu and alloy electrodes with 1 cm and 2 cm inter electrode distance have been compared the reaction time required for the quick water treatment is attained with experiments with smaller inter electrode gaps alloy electrodes have a high turbidity reduction percentage over 81 and minimal reaction time which opens its applicability in dairy wastewater treatment and the possibilities for future electrocoagulation reactor design statement of novelty and significance there has been no previous investigation into the performance of alloy electrodes in electrocoagulation mediated dairy

12947,green process engineering following the principles of the process intensification strategy may make a significant contribution to industrial sustainability membrane based separation and its potential have lately gained widespread recognition as assisting in the pursuit of these principles consequently while focusing on a novel eco friendly cost effective approach we investigated the synergistic effect of incorporating multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts into the carbohydrate polymer chitosan cs on the nanofiltration performance of the mixed matrix polyethersulfone pes membranes to obtain highly decolorized water from licorice root extraction wastewater lrew to this end following the optimization of pristine pes membranes in terms of their polymer concentrations and thicknesses cs mwcnt nanoparticles 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt were incorporated into the optimized matrix of pristine pes along with the physicochemical properties studied water contact angle pure water flux pwf color and cod removal and antifouling properties were evaluated with the 0 5 wt cs mwcnt achieving the highest permeate flux 9 41 kg m2 h and color removal 93 ultimately the long term flux decline and color removal of the optimum membrane were evaluated using three different wastewater sources shedding light on its promising future graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane chitosan multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnt licorice root extract wastewater lrew dye removal 1 introduction the problem of diminishing fresh water resources in many parts of the world is expected to aggravate owing greatly to the population growth abuse of water resources and their contamination by the same token the need for efficient and feasible treatment technologies aiming for treating and reusing wastewater has risen 1 3 as one of the potential threats to clean water resources licorice processing plants extracting the roots of the glycyrrhiza glabra plant for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries produce wastewater with high levels of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod due to dissolved organic matter such as some colored compounds mostly natural organic compounds that can be toxic and have negative impacts on the ecosystem 4 5 as a result licorice root extract wastewater lrew should not be recirculated into the process or discharged directly into municipal sewage systems or aquatic ecosystems unless treated to a standard level thus employing effective treatment approaches is of great importance meanwhile membrane separation technologies particularly pressure driven ones like nanofiltration nf have been widely used among numerous wastewater treatment approaches documented throughout the last three decades as highly adaptable technologies to treat various sources of polluted water and wastewater 6 9 producing a high quality nanofiltrated permeate suitable for reuse in plant processes or discharge into the environment nf membranes can potentially be used for color and chemical oxygen demand cod removal from lrew however despite the benefits of no phase change low energy consumption cost effectiveness ease of scale up and most significantly minimal risk of environmental contamination there are still certain restrictions to membrane water treatment such as fouling as well as the permeability selectivity trade off 10 acting as the cutting edge of developing the next generation of high performance membranes mixed matrix nanocomposite membranes provide an innovative approach to overcoming the drawbacks of polymeric membrane materials through embedding nanomaterials into polymeric matrix 7 11 in the realm of membranes chitosan cs a member of one of the most abundant eco friendly natural biopolymers 12 15 has sparked a great deal of interest owing to its low cost hydrophilicity 16 unique perm selectivity for water 17 and the presence of amino hydroxyl functional groups on the cs chain serving as coordination sites 15 18 furthermore bearing positive and negative surface charges in acidic and basic media respectively plays a key role in cs s performance as a membrane 19 20 despite all the advantages aforementioned cs membranes suffer from some drawbacks including poor stability in acid medium substandard mechanical properties 21 and insufficient surface area and porosity 20 to overcome these drawbacks adding inorganic reinforcements such as carbon nanomaterials is an effective approach 22 23 as 1d allotropes of carbon atoms with robust cylindrical nanostructures carbon nanotubes cnts serve as promising candidates for this purpose owing to their unique physicochemical properties such as high aspect ratio high axis strength and smoothness and hydrophobicity of their interior cavity leading to frictionless passageways for water molecules 7 24 26 furthermore the surfaces of cnts may be chemically modified without altering their structural integrity consequently the incorporation of cnts into the polymer matrix allows for the development of nanocomposite membranes with improved transport and rejection properties in an attempt to achieve specific goals in membrane treatment some recent studies have focused on the use of cs mwcnt incorporated membranes alawady et al 13 investigated the use of carboxylic acid functionalized mwcnts added to the cs matrix as a selective layer on top of polysulfone ps which enhanced the membranes rejection capabilities for heavy metal ions cu 2 ni 2 pb 2 cd 2 and co 2 at various ph levels allowing almost 99 rejection for all of them at ph 10 in comparison to unfactionalized cs mwcnt membranes the beneficial impact of carboxylic acid functionalization on membrane hydrophilicity as well as the better dispersion of cnts in cs matrix was further approved another investigation in 2020 focused on coating a porous pes layer support with a very thin layer of cs mwcnt incorporated polyether block amide peba selective layer for malachite green mg dye removal 7 the results indicated that at cs mwcnt dosages of 1 0 wt and 0 1 wt respectively the maximum permeate flux of about 13 85 l m2 h and rejection of approximately 98 7 were obtained here we focused on a novel eco friendly approach to investigate the synergistic effect of both chitosan and functionalized mwcnt on nanofiltration membrane performance and antifouling properties thus chitosan wrapped mwcnt incorporated nanocomposite membranes were synthesized through a facile blending method then thoroughly characterized and applied for removing color and cod from real industrial lrew following the investigation of the effects of pes concentration and membrane thickness the effects of adding 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt of cs mwcnt on the morphological structure and separation properties of the resultant membranes were thoroughly investigated moreover in a house in dead end set up the prepared membranes long term filtration and antifouling performance was assessed for three distinct wastewaters aiming to prove their potential 2 experimental 2 1 materials chitosan 2 amino 2 deoxy 1 4 d glucopyranose with a molecular weight of 400 000 da and a deacetylation degree of 100 was obtained from fluka polyethersulfone pes mw 58 000 g mol and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 25 000 g mol were supplied from basf and mowiol co germany respectively multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts 95 purity with average inner and outer diameters of approximately 5 10 nm and 10 20 nm respectively and length of 10 30 μm prepared by chemical vapor deposition cvd were supplied by chengdu organic chemical co ltd chengdu china the solvents nitric acid hno3 60 sulfuric acid h2so4 98 and acetic acid hac were all obtained from merck co germany while dimethylacetamide dmac was purchased from basf germany merck supplied the chemical compounds utilized in the chemical oxygen demand cod tests all of the compounds were analytical grade and did not require further purification unless otherwise stated the experiments were all carried out with distilled water 2 2 wastewater characteristics the source proposed to be treated by the prepared nf membranes was the lrew brought from wastewater storage tank of fanavaran tose sanat gharb kermanshah iran in addition to the lrew with an average cod concentration of 813 mg l two other colored wastewaters palm oil mill effluent pome with an average cod of 50 000 mg l and direct red 16 dr16 50 mg l were utilized to evaluate the best prepared membrane performance the azo dye direct red 16 c26h17n5na2o8s2 mw 637 26 g mol with purity of 99 was purchased from alvan sabet co iran the characteristics of lrew and pome are shown in table 1 the wastewaters were kept cold in order to maintain their original properties and prevent any changes in their characteristics 2 3 synthesis of chitosan wrapped mwcnts cs mwcnt it is required to pretreat pristine mwcnts in order to overcome their low dispersion stability as well as their hydrophobic surface this results in the generation of extra carboxylic acid groups to this end nitric sulfuric acid treatment was used to prepare functionalized mwcnts 27 following the dispersion of mwcnts in a 3 1 mixture of h2so4 and hno3 the mixture was then refluxed in a silicone oil bath at 130 c for 12 h it was then filtered and rinsed with distilled water with a ph of 5 ultimately functionalized mwcnts were dried at 120 c cs mwcnt suspensions were prepared by dispersing mwcnts in a cs solution containing 0 5 wt of chitosan that had been already dissolved in a diluted acetic acid solution 0 2 the solution was then sonicated for 30 min prior to being stored at room temperature for 24 h while also being constantly stirred with a magnetic stirrer the ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 5 5 0 using a 0 01 m naoh solution and sonicated thoroughly until a homogeneous suspension was obtained after about 60 min ultimately the black suspension was vacuum dried yielding the cs mwcnt nanocomposite 2 4 preparation of mixed matrix membranes mmms phase inversion was induced by immersion precipitation using casting solutions containing various loadings of pes 20 22 24 and 26 wt and pvp 1 wt in dmac as solvent to obtain asymmetric pristine pes of various thicknesses 150 200 and 250 μm following the determination of the optimum polymer content and thickness the same phase inversion approach has been used for the fabrication of pes cs mwcnt nanofiltration membranes to enhance uniformity specified amounts of cs mwcnt nanoparticles 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt were mixed into dmac and thoroughly dispersed by sonication for 30 min pes and pvp were dissolved in the dope solution by continual agitation for 24 h after dispersing the cs mwcnts in the solvent followed by a sonication assisted procedure for 30 min the casting solution was then cast onto a clean glass plate with the specified thickness the glass plate was then immediately submerged horizontally in 15 c distilled water without any evaporation time 0 s 28 29 to ensure full phase inversion the membranes were maintained in fresh distilled water for 24 h following initial phase separation and membrane solidification the membranes were then sandwiched between two sheets of filter paper and dried at room temperature for the whole day 2 5 cs mwcnt nanocomposite characterization the surface morphology of mwnts ch was observed with scanning electron microscopy sem philips xl 40 feg and atomic force microscopy afm fei quanta 200f fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra were recorded on a bruker alpha kbr pellet spectrophotometer over the range of 400 4000 cm 1 at room temperature in order to validate the cs mwcnt formation and ensure the absence of any defects in the polymer structure 2 6 membrane characterization 2 6 1 sem and afm analyses sem philips xl30 the netherlands was employed to investigate the morphological structure of pes based mmms all membrane samples were broken with liquid nitrogen prior to getting sputtered with gold to provide a conductive layer for cross sectional imaging they were eventually analyzed using a microscope in a quite high vacuum with a 25 kv accelerating voltage afm by nanosurf mobile s scanning probe optical microscope switzerland including nanosurf mobiles software version1 8 was also carried out for scanning the membrane surface of around 78 1 pm2 in noncontact mode the membrane surfaces were then imaged in 4 4μm 4 4μm scan size 2 6 2 contact angle measurement water contact angle analysis was used to determine the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface as a quantitative indication for altering the membrane surface hydrophilicity the sessile drop method using a goniometer g10 kruss germany employing an optical subsystem to monitor the profile of a pure liquid on a solid substrate has been utilized the membranes were cut to fit the glass slide and placed on it at 25 c and 50 humidity 2 μl of deionized water was carefully dropped on the top surface followed by the water contact angles measurement between 3 and 60 s after contacting with the membrane surface the membrane contact angles were determined using the average values of five measurement data from five distinct random places on the same membrane sample 30 2 6 3 membrane performance investigation 2 6 3 1 permeability to assess the nanofiltration performance of the membranes an in house made dead end stainless steel stirred cell with an effective membrane surface area of 12 56 cm2 was employed the dead end cell 125 ml volume capacity was equipped with a pressure gauge and pressurized with nitrogen flow to drive the feed solution through the membrane in the meantime 300 rpm was used to stir the feed solution the membrane was compressed at 6 bar for 30 min to ensure a constant permeate flow before being lowered to the operational pressure of 5 bar the following formula was used to determine the water flux jw 1 l m2 h 31 1 j w 1 m a δt where m a and δt represent the weight of permeate accumulated kg effective area of the membrane m2 and permeation time h respectively the experiments were carried out at a temperature of 20 1 c with an average of three replicates reported 2 6 3 2 color removal to assess the color removal efficiency of the produced membranes the lrew rejection study was conducted out in the dead end filtration module for 60 min at a pressure of 5 bar a uv vis spectrophotometer pharo merck scanning the visible spectrum region 400 800 nm was used to measure the color removal efficiency once 100 ml of lrew solution was fed 32 following the assessment of the spectrophotometry data the color removal efficiency r was calculated according to eq 2 7 2 r 1 cp cf 100 where cf and cp are respectively representing the average feed and permeate concentrations 2 6 3 3 antifouling following color removal the fouled membranes were soaked in distilled water for 15 min to remove foulants that had been stuck to the membrane surface temporarily the cleansed membrane was instantly put in the cell without drying and the pure water flux pwf was measured as jw 2 l m2 h for another 60 min the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes was then calculated using the following equation 33 3 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 2 6 3 4 cod removal a colorimetric technique with a closed reflux approach was employed to determine cod in permeate 34 while the absorbance of cod samples was quantified using a spectrophotometer 6320 d jenway usa at 600 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of membrane thickness and pes concentration in order to simultaneously optimize the membrane thickness and required pes loading pristine membranes with various thicknesses 150 200 and 250 μm and polymer concentrations 20 22 24 and 26 wt were fabricated and subsequently investigated according to their obtained pwf and lrew color removal efficiencies fig 1 a f provide the quantitative results obtained the maximum pwf and minimum color removal were observed in membranes with a thickness of 250 μm nevertheless decreasing the thickness to 150 μm improved the color removal efficiency in terms of pes loading it can be noted that increasing its concentration has a detrimental effect on pwt when compared to color removal taking both attributes pwf and color removal efficiency into account m2 22 wt loading of pes polymer with a thickness of 150 μm was recommended as the optimal membrane to fabricate the cs mwcnt incorporated membranes due to its moderately high color removal and water flux 3 2 nanocomposite characterization the sem image fig 2a clearly reveals that mwcnts are distributed uniformly throughout the cs matrix it is noteworthy that the majority of the mwcnts were broken rather than simply pulled out of the matrix showing a high interfacial adhesion between the mwcnts and the cs matrix fig 2b depicts an afm image of a mwnts chitosan composite surface with such a regular and homogeneous structure 35 ft ir spectra of cs and cs mwcnt are illustrated in fig 2c the absorption peaks at 1095 cm 1 1322 cm 1 1599 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 in the chitosan spectrum are attributed to the broad band of co group vibration protonated amine bending vibration amide group vibration co stretching of nhcoch3 and stretching vibration of oh group superimposed on nh stretching band respectively 7 furthermore alkane stretching vibrations ch in ch2 and ch3 are represented by the bands at 2800 2871 cm 1 36 overall when comparing the ft ir spectra of cs and cs mwcnt practically all the characteristic vibration bands associated with cs functional groups overlap with the peaks of cs mwcnts without any significant changes indicating that cs is physically wrapped around mwcnts 3 3 membrane characterization following the determination of optimal thickness and pes concentration all the cs mwcnt incorporated pes mmms ma mb mc md with various dosages of cs mwcnt nanocomposite 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt respectively were prepared and characterized with a fixed 150 μm thickness and 22 wt pes content to compare them with the pristine pes membranes in terms of membrane performance 3 3 1 sem as shown in fig 3 a d all the pristine pes membranes had an asymmetric structure comprising a dense thin selective barrier top layer and a much thicker porous sub layer containing finger like macrovoids the large elongated pores the membrane with the thinnest top layer is the one with 20 wt pes polymer in its membrane matrix a thick dense top layer was formed by increasing the polymer concentration to 26 wt the introduction of cs mwcnt nanoparticles in the pes matrix resulted in a change in membrane morphology as can be seen in fig 4 the increasing cs mwcnt loading into the polymer matrix resulted in a decrease in skin layer thickness and a change in the sub layer structure loaded with closed cells as a result the finger like macrovoids in modified membranes were longer and broader than in pristine pes membranes resulting in far more porosity in the membrane structure and ultimately higher membrane permeability 27 this revelation is compatible with the hydrophilic nature of cs mwcnt nanoparticles the reason might be attributed to hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles causing thermodynamic instability in the casting solution leading to the accelerated solvent and non solvent exchange during the phase inversion process culminating in the formation of enlarged channels in the sublayer 37 cross sectional microphotographs reveal that the membrane including 0 5 wt cs mwcnt mb has a highly porous structure fig 4b however as depicted in fig 4d when the cs mwcnt loading exceeded 0 5 wt a considerably denser top layer and a less porous sub layer were formed this behavior might be attributed to the high density of cs mwcnts in the casting solution which causes a rise in solution viscosity 38 39 impeding the aforementioned exchange and delaying membrane precipitation 3 3 2 afm providing two and three dimensional 2d and 3d images with dark and bright points corresponding to peaks and valleys respectively the afm technique has been employed to study the surface roughness of the fabricated pristine and cs mwcnt incorporated pes membranes as represented in fig 5 a d the topographic contrast is due to the texture formed by membrane modification according to fig 5a the ma pristine membrane had the roughest surface due to its hydrophobic nature with an average estimated roughness of 34 nm fig 5b illustrates that due to the low electrostatic interactions among the cs mwcnt nanoparticles at low loading 0 1 wt and their regular collocation in the membrane the membrane surface roughness was decreased leaving it smoother 40 however as the cs mwcnts amount was increased 0 5 1 0 wt due to the mild agglomeration of incorporated nanoparticles membranes surface roughness was incremented fig 5 c and d as previously reported in some other studies 27 40 41 3 3 3 contact angle water contact analysis has been employed as a quantitative indication for inversely variable membrane surface hydrophilicity by contact angle the hydrophilic nature of the membrane s inner walls of pore channels as well as its surface is one of the key elements dictating the contact angle decay rate according to the results in fig 6a increasing the quantity of nanoparticles in the casting solution reduces the water contact angle for prepared membranes implying that membrane surface hydrophilicity will increase by adding the hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles owing to the hydrophobic nature of pes polymer the pristine membrane ma showed the greatest contact angle of 63 7 whereas by embedding 0 1 1 0 wt of cs mwcnt nanoparticles a decreasing order of water contact angle was obtained leading to the minimum of 52 3 for md the importance of surface chemistry in tailoring the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite polymer matrix is highlighted by these contact angle values the decrease in water contact angle might be attributed to an increase in hydrophilic functional oh and nh groups on the membrane surface which forms hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms of the cs mwcnt nanoparticles and oxygen atoms of the pes polymer chains meanwhile the created interface zone between the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix in the top layer can act as a nanochannel for transporting water across the membrane by forming hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms in hydroxyl groups of cs mwcnt and oxygen atoms in water molecules 40 the fact that throughout the phase inversion process hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles migrate rapidly and spontaneously toward the membrane top layer as a result of the membrane surface being exposed to water non solvent and the interface energy being reduced highlights the increase in membrane hydrophilicity 37 42 ultimately darker surface and extremely lighter hue of bottom surface of the pes cs mwcnt coincide with this phenomenon fig 6b 3 4 membrane performance 3 4 1 pure water flux pwf in the development of nanofiltration membranes permeability plays the role of an important performance indicator comparing the permeability of ma and mc membranes indicates an exceptional flux development and implies that the membrane structure has been altered by the introduction of the cs mwcnt fig 7a reveals that the pristine membrane ma had a pwf of about 0 81 kg m2 h whereas the pwf obtained for the mc membrane containing 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt nanoparticles reached approximately 9 41 kg m2 h which was the highest level for water flux among the prepared membranes the formation of nanochannels between the mwcnt additive and the chitosan polymer in the modified membranes is responsible for the increased permeability 36 despite the nanoparticles greatest contribution to the membrane composite an ascending descending behavior was observed with the water flux of the md 1 0 wt of cs mwcnt diminishing this phenomenon might be attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the membrane structure which resulted in blockage of the membrane s pores therefore dominating its hydrophilicity 43 a top dense layer formed in the md structure as shown in its sem cross sectional image fig 4d might be another cause for this membrane s insufficient water permeability the presence of a substantial proportion of nanoparticles increases the viscosity of the casting solution 44 this increase in viscosity slows the rapid exchange of solvent and non solvent throughout coagulation during the phase inversion process causing the membrane precipitation to stall after then a thick dense top layer and a less permeable membrane will develop these two factors thick top layer and less porous structure can overcome the md blended membrane s high hydrophilicity and reduce its permeation flux 3 4 2 color removal the potential of the pristine and modified pes membranes for color removal from the lrew is represented in fig 7b as shown in fig 7b the ma pristine pes membrane removed 88 5 of the color whereas the modified mb mc and md membranes all remarkably removed 90 of the color among the membranes the mc membrane 0 5 wt showed the highest color removal of 93 primarily influenced by the separation mechanism known as molecular sieving the color removal assessments demonstrated that the behavior of the negatively charged cs mwcnt embedded pes membranes could be under the influence of donnan and steric hindrance attributed to the membrane surface charge and pore size respectively 45 it is anticipated that cs mwcnt can enhance the properties of modified membranes by elevating the top layer s hydrophilicity and surface charge increased hydrophilicity improves fouling resistance whereas increased surface charge increases electrostatic interactions and the donnan exclusion effect resulting in improved color removal efficiency 46 3 4 3 cod removal as depicted in fig 7c cod removal efficiency for the as prepared membranes ranged from 82 to 90 suggesting a promising potential for lrew treatment slightly lower cod removal efficiencies in comparison to color removal imply the presence of some colorless compounds that can pass through the membranes while contributing to cod content given that organic contaminants in lrew are generally highly soluble ionic organic compounds such as organic acid the effect of filtration on electric conductivity ec was investigated in the present study to provide an approximate evaluation of the lrew s ionic nature fig 7d depicts the relationship between total dissolved solids tds and ec in raw lrew at various dilutions it implies that increasing tds increases ec linearly approximately suggesting the ionic nature of the volatile dissolved solids vds content of the lrew to validate the aforementioned claim ec was measured both before and after filtration the initial ec was around 2000 μs however after filtration it was cut to 1352 μs 3 4 4 antifouling by quantifying flux recovery ratio frr after fouling by lrew the antifouling performance of the pristine and modified pes nanofiltration membranes was assessed throughout four cycle filtration as depicted in fig 8a first fouling cycle when clean water was replaced with lrew in the filtration cell the permeability flux of the membranes was drastically decreased suggesting membrane fouling foulant layer growth on the membrane surface and pore walls diminished the permeability simultaneously after the membranes had been hydraulically cleaned the pwf was tested once again water fluxes in the manufactured membranes began to fall only marginally after the fourth fouling cycle but membrane performance remained relatively constant according to the obtained fluctuation pattern permeation flux for the lrew and pure water were increased by introducing 0 1 wt and 0 5 wt of nanoparticles into the casting solution 47 49 the highest level of permeation flux was observed for mc containing 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt these results agree with existing data on pwf assessment and hint at enhanced performance of the modified membranes however the modified md membrane containing 1 0 wt nanoparticles in the casting solution exhibited the lowest permeation flux during both wastewater and water filtration which could be attributed to nanoparticles agglomeration 28 50 the frr results shown in fig 8b clearly demonstrates the modified membranes proper fouling resistance and recycling capacities the higher the frr the better the membrane s antifouling properties the frr for the pristine pes membrane 63 6 was lower than that of membranes embedded with cs mwcnt 65 67 8 modified mb 0 1 wt and mc 0 5 wt membranes resulted in the highest frrs this matter indicates that the adsorption between foulant components and the cs mwcnt pes blended membranes was weaker than adsorption between foulant components and pristine pes membrane originating from capability of nanoparticles to alter the membrane surface roughness organic foulants tend to accumulate in membrane troughs making rougher surfaces more susceptible to foulant adsorption consequently the lower the roughness of a membrane the greater its fouling resistance according to the afm results the smoother surface of the mb and mc membranes fig 5b and c is attributable to the well dispersed hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles in the casting solution as a result the membrane hydrophilicity is another rationale for the slightly higher frr of these modified membranes compared to the pristine membrane facilitating the wash off of foulant components from the surface according to fig 8b increasing the cs mwcnt nanoparticles content in the casting solution from 0 5 to 1 0 wt reduced the frr from 66 6 to 65 which could be attributed to an increase in the roughness of the modified membrane surface referring to the agglomeration of cs mwcnt nanoparticles which causes pore blocking and as a result a reduction in the frr 51 3 5 long term filtration performance permeation flux decrease was observed over a lengthy period of time for the lrew as another assessment of the antifouling properties of the membranes in the initial stage the pristine pes membrane ma and optimum modified membrane mc 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt were selected to investigate color removal permeation flux and compare fouling behaviors the flux trend of ma and mc membranes throughout 9 h of lrew filtration is depicted in fig 9a indicating that ma fouling stabilizes sooner than mc fouling due to rapid pore blocking it was observed that the mc membrane s permeation flux experienced a sharper decrease than the ma membrane s the modified membrane s permeation flux however remained higher than that of the ma membrane due to the presence of hydrophilic groups on its surface in the second stage the performance of the mc membrane as the selected membrane was investigated for different colored feeds the lrew direct red 16 dr16 solution with the typical concentration in textile wastewaters 50 mg l 45 and diluted palm oil mill effluent pome with a cod content of 800 mg l similar to that of lrew due to the existence of significant quantities of foulant components in the lrew compared to dr16 and pome the flux decline of the mc membrane for lrew filtration is greater than that of dr16 and pome as shown in fig 9b fig 9c also represents the color removal efficiency of the optimum pes cs mwcnt blended membrane during long term filtration of all 3 contaminants resulting in an astounding 99 removal of dr16 4 conclusion in this work novel chitosan wrapped multi walled carbon nanotubes cs mwcnt incorporated pes nanocomposite membrane was successfully developed to remove color and cod from lrew to this end synergistic incorporation of cs and mwcnts has been carried out relying on complementary spectroscopic and electron microscopy characterization techniques cs is physically wrapped around mwcnts the weight percent of cs mwcnt 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt altered the surface morphology roughness hydrophilicity and permeability of the nanocomposite membranes as well as their antifouling capabilities with 0 5 wt cs mwcnt loading the optimal performance characteristics were ultimately obtained using an industrial feed solution lrew the potential for engineering nanocomposite membranes with improved chemistry and morphology has been operationally proven the optimum loading 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt resulted in the highest lrew color removal of 93 cod removal of 83 06 and frr of 66 6 as well as the highest pwf of 9 41 kg m2 h eventually the long term filtration and rejection performance of the optimum membrane with three different wastewaters including lrew pome and dr16 verified that the concept proposed in this study may afford to compete with commercial membranes in terms of remarkable color removal acceptable permeability and eco friendly biocompatible nanoadditive usage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12947,green process engineering following the principles of the process intensification strategy may make a significant contribution to industrial sustainability membrane based separation and its potential have lately gained widespread recognition as assisting in the pursuit of these principles consequently while focusing on a novel eco friendly cost effective approach we investigated the synergistic effect of incorporating multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts into the carbohydrate polymer chitosan cs on the nanofiltration performance of the mixed matrix polyethersulfone pes membranes to obtain highly decolorized water from licorice root extraction wastewater lrew to this end following the optimization of pristine pes membranes in terms of their polymer concentrations and thicknesses cs mwcnt nanoparticles 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt were incorporated into the optimized matrix of pristine pes along with the physicochemical properties studied water contact angle pure water flux pwf color and cod removal and antifouling properties were evaluated with the 0 5 wt cs mwcnt achieving the highest permeate flux 9 41 kg m2 h and color removal 93 ultimately the long term flux decline and color removal of the optimum membrane were evaluated using three different wastewater sources shedding light on its promising future graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nanofiltration membrane chitosan multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnt licorice root extract wastewater lrew dye removal 1 introduction the problem of diminishing fresh water resources in many parts of the world is expected to aggravate owing greatly to the population growth abuse of water resources and their contamination by the same token the need for efficient and feasible treatment technologies aiming for treating and reusing wastewater has risen 1 3 as one of the potential threats to clean water resources licorice processing plants extracting the roots of the glycyrrhiza glabra plant for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries produce wastewater with high levels of soluble chemical oxygen demand cod due to dissolved organic matter such as some colored compounds mostly natural organic compounds that can be toxic and have negative impacts on the ecosystem 4 5 as a result licorice root extract wastewater lrew should not be recirculated into the process or discharged directly into municipal sewage systems or aquatic ecosystems unless treated to a standard level thus employing effective treatment approaches is of great importance meanwhile membrane separation technologies particularly pressure driven ones like nanofiltration nf have been widely used among numerous wastewater treatment approaches documented throughout the last three decades as highly adaptable technologies to treat various sources of polluted water and wastewater 6 9 producing a high quality nanofiltrated permeate suitable for reuse in plant processes or discharge into the environment nf membranes can potentially be used for color and chemical oxygen demand cod removal from lrew however despite the benefits of no phase change low energy consumption cost effectiveness ease of scale up and most significantly minimal risk of environmental contamination there are still certain restrictions to membrane water treatment such as fouling as well as the permeability selectivity trade off 10 acting as the cutting edge of developing the next generation of high performance membranes mixed matrix nanocomposite membranes provide an innovative approach to overcoming the drawbacks of polymeric membrane materials through embedding nanomaterials into polymeric matrix 7 11 in the realm of membranes chitosan cs a member of one of the most abundant eco friendly natural biopolymers 12 15 has sparked a great deal of interest owing to its low cost hydrophilicity 16 unique perm selectivity for water 17 and the presence of amino hydroxyl functional groups on the cs chain serving as coordination sites 15 18 furthermore bearing positive and negative surface charges in acidic and basic media respectively plays a key role in cs s performance as a membrane 19 20 despite all the advantages aforementioned cs membranes suffer from some drawbacks including poor stability in acid medium substandard mechanical properties 21 and insufficient surface area and porosity 20 to overcome these drawbacks adding inorganic reinforcements such as carbon nanomaterials is an effective approach 22 23 as 1d allotropes of carbon atoms with robust cylindrical nanostructures carbon nanotubes cnts serve as promising candidates for this purpose owing to their unique physicochemical properties such as high aspect ratio high axis strength and smoothness and hydrophobicity of their interior cavity leading to frictionless passageways for water molecules 7 24 26 furthermore the surfaces of cnts may be chemically modified without altering their structural integrity consequently the incorporation of cnts into the polymer matrix allows for the development of nanocomposite membranes with improved transport and rejection properties in an attempt to achieve specific goals in membrane treatment some recent studies have focused on the use of cs mwcnt incorporated membranes alawady et al 13 investigated the use of carboxylic acid functionalized mwcnts added to the cs matrix as a selective layer on top of polysulfone ps which enhanced the membranes rejection capabilities for heavy metal ions cu 2 ni 2 pb 2 cd 2 and co 2 at various ph levels allowing almost 99 rejection for all of them at ph 10 in comparison to unfactionalized cs mwcnt membranes the beneficial impact of carboxylic acid functionalization on membrane hydrophilicity as well as the better dispersion of cnts in cs matrix was further approved another investigation in 2020 focused on coating a porous pes layer support with a very thin layer of cs mwcnt incorporated polyether block amide peba selective layer for malachite green mg dye removal 7 the results indicated that at cs mwcnt dosages of 1 0 wt and 0 1 wt respectively the maximum permeate flux of about 13 85 l m2 h and rejection of approximately 98 7 were obtained here we focused on a novel eco friendly approach to investigate the synergistic effect of both chitosan and functionalized mwcnt on nanofiltration membrane performance and antifouling properties thus chitosan wrapped mwcnt incorporated nanocomposite membranes were synthesized through a facile blending method then thoroughly characterized and applied for removing color and cod from real industrial lrew following the investigation of the effects of pes concentration and membrane thickness the effects of adding 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt of cs mwcnt on the morphological structure and separation properties of the resultant membranes were thoroughly investigated moreover in a house in dead end set up the prepared membranes long term filtration and antifouling performance was assessed for three distinct wastewaters aiming to prove their potential 2 experimental 2 1 materials chitosan 2 amino 2 deoxy 1 4 d glucopyranose with a molecular weight of 400 000 da and a deacetylation degree of 100 was obtained from fluka polyethersulfone pes mw 58 000 g mol and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp mw 25 000 g mol were supplied from basf and mowiol co germany respectively multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts 95 purity with average inner and outer diameters of approximately 5 10 nm and 10 20 nm respectively and length of 10 30 μm prepared by chemical vapor deposition cvd were supplied by chengdu organic chemical co ltd chengdu china the solvents nitric acid hno3 60 sulfuric acid h2so4 98 and acetic acid hac were all obtained from merck co germany while dimethylacetamide dmac was purchased from basf germany merck supplied the chemical compounds utilized in the chemical oxygen demand cod tests all of the compounds were analytical grade and did not require further purification unless otherwise stated the experiments were all carried out with distilled water 2 2 wastewater characteristics the source proposed to be treated by the prepared nf membranes was the lrew brought from wastewater storage tank of fanavaran tose sanat gharb kermanshah iran in addition to the lrew with an average cod concentration of 813 mg l two other colored wastewaters palm oil mill effluent pome with an average cod of 50 000 mg l and direct red 16 dr16 50 mg l were utilized to evaluate the best prepared membrane performance the azo dye direct red 16 c26h17n5na2o8s2 mw 637 26 g mol with purity of 99 was purchased from alvan sabet co iran the characteristics of lrew and pome are shown in table 1 the wastewaters were kept cold in order to maintain their original properties and prevent any changes in their characteristics 2 3 synthesis of chitosan wrapped mwcnts cs mwcnt it is required to pretreat pristine mwcnts in order to overcome their low dispersion stability as well as their hydrophobic surface this results in the generation of extra carboxylic acid groups to this end nitric sulfuric acid treatment was used to prepare functionalized mwcnts 27 following the dispersion of mwcnts in a 3 1 mixture of h2so4 and hno3 the mixture was then refluxed in a silicone oil bath at 130 c for 12 h it was then filtered and rinsed with distilled water with a ph of 5 ultimately functionalized mwcnts were dried at 120 c cs mwcnt suspensions were prepared by dispersing mwcnts in a cs solution containing 0 5 wt of chitosan that had been already dissolved in a diluted acetic acid solution 0 2 the solution was then sonicated for 30 min prior to being stored at room temperature for 24 h while also being constantly stirred with a magnetic stirrer the ph of the solution was adjusted to 4 5 5 0 using a 0 01 m naoh solution and sonicated thoroughly until a homogeneous suspension was obtained after about 60 min ultimately the black suspension was vacuum dried yielding the cs mwcnt nanocomposite 2 4 preparation of mixed matrix membranes mmms phase inversion was induced by immersion precipitation using casting solutions containing various loadings of pes 20 22 24 and 26 wt and pvp 1 wt in dmac as solvent to obtain asymmetric pristine pes of various thicknesses 150 200 and 250 μm following the determination of the optimum polymer content and thickness the same phase inversion approach has been used for the fabrication of pes cs mwcnt nanofiltration membranes to enhance uniformity specified amounts of cs mwcnt nanoparticles 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt were mixed into dmac and thoroughly dispersed by sonication for 30 min pes and pvp were dissolved in the dope solution by continual agitation for 24 h after dispersing the cs mwcnts in the solvent followed by a sonication assisted procedure for 30 min the casting solution was then cast onto a clean glass plate with the specified thickness the glass plate was then immediately submerged horizontally in 15 c distilled water without any evaporation time 0 s 28 29 to ensure full phase inversion the membranes were maintained in fresh distilled water for 24 h following initial phase separation and membrane solidification the membranes were then sandwiched between two sheets of filter paper and dried at room temperature for the whole day 2 5 cs mwcnt nanocomposite characterization the surface morphology of mwnts ch was observed with scanning electron microscopy sem philips xl 40 feg and atomic force microscopy afm fei quanta 200f fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir spectra were recorded on a bruker alpha kbr pellet spectrophotometer over the range of 400 4000 cm 1 at room temperature in order to validate the cs mwcnt formation and ensure the absence of any defects in the polymer structure 2 6 membrane characterization 2 6 1 sem and afm analyses sem philips xl30 the netherlands was employed to investigate the morphological structure of pes based mmms all membrane samples were broken with liquid nitrogen prior to getting sputtered with gold to provide a conductive layer for cross sectional imaging they were eventually analyzed using a microscope in a quite high vacuum with a 25 kv accelerating voltage afm by nanosurf mobile s scanning probe optical microscope switzerland including nanosurf mobiles software version1 8 was also carried out for scanning the membrane surface of around 78 1 pm2 in noncontact mode the membrane surfaces were then imaged in 4 4μm 4 4μm scan size 2 6 2 contact angle measurement water contact angle analysis was used to determine the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface as a quantitative indication for altering the membrane surface hydrophilicity the sessile drop method using a goniometer g10 kruss germany employing an optical subsystem to monitor the profile of a pure liquid on a solid substrate has been utilized the membranes were cut to fit the glass slide and placed on it at 25 c and 50 humidity 2 μl of deionized water was carefully dropped on the top surface followed by the water contact angles measurement between 3 and 60 s after contacting with the membrane surface the membrane contact angles were determined using the average values of five measurement data from five distinct random places on the same membrane sample 30 2 6 3 membrane performance investigation 2 6 3 1 permeability to assess the nanofiltration performance of the membranes an in house made dead end stainless steel stirred cell with an effective membrane surface area of 12 56 cm2 was employed the dead end cell 125 ml volume capacity was equipped with a pressure gauge and pressurized with nitrogen flow to drive the feed solution through the membrane in the meantime 300 rpm was used to stir the feed solution the membrane was compressed at 6 bar for 30 min to ensure a constant permeate flow before being lowered to the operational pressure of 5 bar the following formula was used to determine the water flux jw 1 l m2 h 31 1 j w 1 m a δt where m a and δt represent the weight of permeate accumulated kg effective area of the membrane m2 and permeation time h respectively the experiments were carried out at a temperature of 20 1 c with an average of three replicates reported 2 6 3 2 color removal to assess the color removal efficiency of the produced membranes the lrew rejection study was conducted out in the dead end filtration module for 60 min at a pressure of 5 bar a uv vis spectrophotometer pharo merck scanning the visible spectrum region 400 800 nm was used to measure the color removal efficiency once 100 ml of lrew solution was fed 32 following the assessment of the spectrophotometry data the color removal efficiency r was calculated according to eq 2 7 2 r 1 cp cf 100 where cf and cp are respectively representing the average feed and permeate concentrations 2 6 3 3 antifouling following color removal the fouled membranes were soaked in distilled water for 15 min to remove foulants that had been stuck to the membrane surface temporarily the cleansed membrane was instantly put in the cell without drying and the pure water flux pwf was measured as jw 2 l m2 h for another 60 min the flux recovery ratio frr of the membranes was then calculated using the following equation 33 3 frr j w 2 j w 1 100 2 6 3 4 cod removal a colorimetric technique with a closed reflux approach was employed to determine cod in permeate 34 while the absorbance of cod samples was quantified using a spectrophotometer 6320 d jenway usa at 600 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of membrane thickness and pes concentration in order to simultaneously optimize the membrane thickness and required pes loading pristine membranes with various thicknesses 150 200 and 250 μm and polymer concentrations 20 22 24 and 26 wt were fabricated and subsequently investigated according to their obtained pwf and lrew color removal efficiencies fig 1 a f provide the quantitative results obtained the maximum pwf and minimum color removal were observed in membranes with a thickness of 250 μm nevertheless decreasing the thickness to 150 μm improved the color removal efficiency in terms of pes loading it can be noted that increasing its concentration has a detrimental effect on pwt when compared to color removal taking both attributes pwf and color removal efficiency into account m2 22 wt loading of pes polymer with a thickness of 150 μm was recommended as the optimal membrane to fabricate the cs mwcnt incorporated membranes due to its moderately high color removal and water flux 3 2 nanocomposite characterization the sem image fig 2a clearly reveals that mwcnts are distributed uniformly throughout the cs matrix it is noteworthy that the majority of the mwcnts were broken rather than simply pulled out of the matrix showing a high interfacial adhesion between the mwcnts and the cs matrix fig 2b depicts an afm image of a mwnts chitosan composite surface with such a regular and homogeneous structure 35 ft ir spectra of cs and cs mwcnt are illustrated in fig 2c the absorption peaks at 1095 cm 1 1322 cm 1 1599 cm 1 and 3400 cm 1 in the chitosan spectrum are attributed to the broad band of co group vibration protonated amine bending vibration amide group vibration co stretching of nhcoch3 and stretching vibration of oh group superimposed on nh stretching band respectively 7 furthermore alkane stretching vibrations ch in ch2 and ch3 are represented by the bands at 2800 2871 cm 1 36 overall when comparing the ft ir spectra of cs and cs mwcnt practically all the characteristic vibration bands associated with cs functional groups overlap with the peaks of cs mwcnts without any significant changes indicating that cs is physically wrapped around mwcnts 3 3 membrane characterization following the determination of optimal thickness and pes concentration all the cs mwcnt incorporated pes mmms ma mb mc md with various dosages of cs mwcnt nanocomposite 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt respectively were prepared and characterized with a fixed 150 μm thickness and 22 wt pes content to compare them with the pristine pes membranes in terms of membrane performance 3 3 1 sem as shown in fig 3 a d all the pristine pes membranes had an asymmetric structure comprising a dense thin selective barrier top layer and a much thicker porous sub layer containing finger like macrovoids the large elongated pores the membrane with the thinnest top layer is the one with 20 wt pes polymer in its membrane matrix a thick dense top layer was formed by increasing the polymer concentration to 26 wt the introduction of cs mwcnt nanoparticles in the pes matrix resulted in a change in membrane morphology as can be seen in fig 4 the increasing cs mwcnt loading into the polymer matrix resulted in a decrease in skin layer thickness and a change in the sub layer structure loaded with closed cells as a result the finger like macrovoids in modified membranes were longer and broader than in pristine pes membranes resulting in far more porosity in the membrane structure and ultimately higher membrane permeability 27 this revelation is compatible with the hydrophilic nature of cs mwcnt nanoparticles the reason might be attributed to hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles causing thermodynamic instability in the casting solution leading to the accelerated solvent and non solvent exchange during the phase inversion process culminating in the formation of enlarged channels in the sublayer 37 cross sectional microphotographs reveal that the membrane including 0 5 wt cs mwcnt mb has a highly porous structure fig 4b however as depicted in fig 4d when the cs mwcnt loading exceeded 0 5 wt a considerably denser top layer and a less porous sub layer were formed this behavior might be attributed to the high density of cs mwcnts in the casting solution which causes a rise in solution viscosity 38 39 impeding the aforementioned exchange and delaying membrane precipitation 3 3 2 afm providing two and three dimensional 2d and 3d images with dark and bright points corresponding to peaks and valleys respectively the afm technique has been employed to study the surface roughness of the fabricated pristine and cs mwcnt incorporated pes membranes as represented in fig 5 a d the topographic contrast is due to the texture formed by membrane modification according to fig 5a the ma pristine membrane had the roughest surface due to its hydrophobic nature with an average estimated roughness of 34 nm fig 5b illustrates that due to the low electrostatic interactions among the cs mwcnt nanoparticles at low loading 0 1 wt and their regular collocation in the membrane the membrane surface roughness was decreased leaving it smoother 40 however as the cs mwcnts amount was increased 0 5 1 0 wt due to the mild agglomeration of incorporated nanoparticles membranes surface roughness was incremented fig 5 c and d as previously reported in some other studies 27 40 41 3 3 3 contact angle water contact analysis has been employed as a quantitative indication for inversely variable membrane surface hydrophilicity by contact angle the hydrophilic nature of the membrane s inner walls of pore channels as well as its surface is one of the key elements dictating the contact angle decay rate according to the results in fig 6a increasing the quantity of nanoparticles in the casting solution reduces the water contact angle for prepared membranes implying that membrane surface hydrophilicity will increase by adding the hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles owing to the hydrophobic nature of pes polymer the pristine membrane ma showed the greatest contact angle of 63 7 whereas by embedding 0 1 1 0 wt of cs mwcnt nanoparticles a decreasing order of water contact angle was obtained leading to the minimum of 52 3 for md the importance of surface chemistry in tailoring the hydrophilicity of the nanocomposite polymer matrix is highlighted by these contact angle values the decrease in water contact angle might be attributed to an increase in hydrophilic functional oh and nh groups on the membrane surface which forms hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms of the cs mwcnt nanoparticles and oxygen atoms of the pes polymer chains meanwhile the created interface zone between the nanoparticles and the polymer matrix in the top layer can act as a nanochannel for transporting water across the membrane by forming hydrogen bonds between hydrogen atoms in hydroxyl groups of cs mwcnt and oxygen atoms in water molecules 40 the fact that throughout the phase inversion process hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles migrate rapidly and spontaneously toward the membrane top layer as a result of the membrane surface being exposed to water non solvent and the interface energy being reduced highlights the increase in membrane hydrophilicity 37 42 ultimately darker surface and extremely lighter hue of bottom surface of the pes cs mwcnt coincide with this phenomenon fig 6b 3 4 membrane performance 3 4 1 pure water flux pwf in the development of nanofiltration membranes permeability plays the role of an important performance indicator comparing the permeability of ma and mc membranes indicates an exceptional flux development and implies that the membrane structure has been altered by the introduction of the cs mwcnt fig 7a reveals that the pristine membrane ma had a pwf of about 0 81 kg m2 h whereas the pwf obtained for the mc membrane containing 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt nanoparticles reached approximately 9 41 kg m2 h which was the highest level for water flux among the prepared membranes the formation of nanochannels between the mwcnt additive and the chitosan polymer in the modified membranes is responsible for the increased permeability 36 despite the nanoparticles greatest contribution to the membrane composite an ascending descending behavior was observed with the water flux of the md 1 0 wt of cs mwcnt diminishing this phenomenon might be attributed to the agglomeration of nanoparticles in the membrane structure which resulted in blockage of the membrane s pores therefore dominating its hydrophilicity 43 a top dense layer formed in the md structure as shown in its sem cross sectional image fig 4d might be another cause for this membrane s insufficient water permeability the presence of a substantial proportion of nanoparticles increases the viscosity of the casting solution 44 this increase in viscosity slows the rapid exchange of solvent and non solvent throughout coagulation during the phase inversion process causing the membrane precipitation to stall after then a thick dense top layer and a less permeable membrane will develop these two factors thick top layer and less porous structure can overcome the md blended membrane s high hydrophilicity and reduce its permeation flux 3 4 2 color removal the potential of the pristine and modified pes membranes for color removal from the lrew is represented in fig 7b as shown in fig 7b the ma pristine pes membrane removed 88 5 of the color whereas the modified mb mc and md membranes all remarkably removed 90 of the color among the membranes the mc membrane 0 5 wt showed the highest color removal of 93 primarily influenced by the separation mechanism known as molecular sieving the color removal assessments demonstrated that the behavior of the negatively charged cs mwcnt embedded pes membranes could be under the influence of donnan and steric hindrance attributed to the membrane surface charge and pore size respectively 45 it is anticipated that cs mwcnt can enhance the properties of modified membranes by elevating the top layer s hydrophilicity and surface charge increased hydrophilicity improves fouling resistance whereas increased surface charge increases electrostatic interactions and the donnan exclusion effect resulting in improved color removal efficiency 46 3 4 3 cod removal as depicted in fig 7c cod removal efficiency for the as prepared membranes ranged from 82 to 90 suggesting a promising potential for lrew treatment slightly lower cod removal efficiencies in comparison to color removal imply the presence of some colorless compounds that can pass through the membranes while contributing to cod content given that organic contaminants in lrew are generally highly soluble ionic organic compounds such as organic acid the effect of filtration on electric conductivity ec was investigated in the present study to provide an approximate evaluation of the lrew s ionic nature fig 7d depicts the relationship between total dissolved solids tds and ec in raw lrew at various dilutions it implies that increasing tds increases ec linearly approximately suggesting the ionic nature of the volatile dissolved solids vds content of the lrew to validate the aforementioned claim ec was measured both before and after filtration the initial ec was around 2000 μs however after filtration it was cut to 1352 μs 3 4 4 antifouling by quantifying flux recovery ratio frr after fouling by lrew the antifouling performance of the pristine and modified pes nanofiltration membranes was assessed throughout four cycle filtration as depicted in fig 8a first fouling cycle when clean water was replaced with lrew in the filtration cell the permeability flux of the membranes was drastically decreased suggesting membrane fouling foulant layer growth on the membrane surface and pore walls diminished the permeability simultaneously after the membranes had been hydraulically cleaned the pwf was tested once again water fluxes in the manufactured membranes began to fall only marginally after the fourth fouling cycle but membrane performance remained relatively constant according to the obtained fluctuation pattern permeation flux for the lrew and pure water were increased by introducing 0 1 wt and 0 5 wt of nanoparticles into the casting solution 47 49 the highest level of permeation flux was observed for mc containing 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt these results agree with existing data on pwf assessment and hint at enhanced performance of the modified membranes however the modified md membrane containing 1 0 wt nanoparticles in the casting solution exhibited the lowest permeation flux during both wastewater and water filtration which could be attributed to nanoparticles agglomeration 28 50 the frr results shown in fig 8b clearly demonstrates the modified membranes proper fouling resistance and recycling capacities the higher the frr the better the membrane s antifouling properties the frr for the pristine pes membrane 63 6 was lower than that of membranes embedded with cs mwcnt 65 67 8 modified mb 0 1 wt and mc 0 5 wt membranes resulted in the highest frrs this matter indicates that the adsorption between foulant components and the cs mwcnt pes blended membranes was weaker than adsorption between foulant components and pristine pes membrane originating from capability of nanoparticles to alter the membrane surface roughness organic foulants tend to accumulate in membrane troughs making rougher surfaces more susceptible to foulant adsorption consequently the lower the roughness of a membrane the greater its fouling resistance according to the afm results the smoother surface of the mb and mc membranes fig 5b and c is attributable to the well dispersed hydrophilic cs mwcnt nanoparticles in the casting solution as a result the membrane hydrophilicity is another rationale for the slightly higher frr of these modified membranes compared to the pristine membrane facilitating the wash off of foulant components from the surface according to fig 8b increasing the cs mwcnt nanoparticles content in the casting solution from 0 5 to 1 0 wt reduced the frr from 66 6 to 65 which could be attributed to an increase in the roughness of the modified membrane surface referring to the agglomeration of cs mwcnt nanoparticles which causes pore blocking and as a result a reduction in the frr 51 3 5 long term filtration performance permeation flux decrease was observed over a lengthy period of time for the lrew as another assessment of the antifouling properties of the membranes in the initial stage the pristine pes membrane ma and optimum modified membrane mc 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt were selected to investigate color removal permeation flux and compare fouling behaviors the flux trend of ma and mc membranes throughout 9 h of lrew filtration is depicted in fig 9a indicating that ma fouling stabilizes sooner than mc fouling due to rapid pore blocking it was observed that the mc membrane s permeation flux experienced a sharper decrease than the ma membrane s the modified membrane s permeation flux however remained higher than that of the ma membrane due to the presence of hydrophilic groups on its surface in the second stage the performance of the mc membrane as the selected membrane was investigated for different colored feeds the lrew direct red 16 dr16 solution with the typical concentration in textile wastewaters 50 mg l 45 and diluted palm oil mill effluent pome with a cod content of 800 mg l similar to that of lrew due to the existence of significant quantities of foulant components in the lrew compared to dr16 and pome the flux decline of the mc membrane for lrew filtration is greater than that of dr16 and pome as shown in fig 9b fig 9c also represents the color removal efficiency of the optimum pes cs mwcnt blended membrane during long term filtration of all 3 contaminants resulting in an astounding 99 removal of dr16 4 conclusion in this work novel chitosan wrapped multi walled carbon nanotubes cs mwcnt incorporated pes nanocomposite membrane was successfully developed to remove color and cod from lrew to this end synergistic incorporation of cs and mwcnts has been carried out relying on complementary spectroscopic and electron microscopy characterization techniques cs is physically wrapped around mwcnts the weight percent of cs mwcnt 0 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 wt altered the surface morphology roughness hydrophilicity and permeability of the nanocomposite membranes as well as their antifouling capabilities with 0 5 wt cs mwcnt loading the optimal performance characteristics were ultimately obtained using an industrial feed solution lrew the potential for engineering nanocomposite membranes with improved chemistry and morphology has been operationally proven the optimum loading 0 5 wt of cs mwcnt resulted in the highest lrew color removal of 93 cod removal of 83 06 and frr of 66 6 as well as the highest pwf of 9 41 kg m2 h eventually the long term filtration and rejection performance of the optimum membrane with three different wastewaters including lrew pome and dr16 verified that the concept proposed in this study may afford to compete with commercial membranes in terms of remarkable color removal acceptable permeability and eco friendly biocompatible nanoadditive usage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

12948,in this study several different chitosan beads with incorporated montmorillonite were prepared the materials were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen sorptometry the adsorption capacity of the materials studied was analyzed based on the use of fecl3 as a chitosan solvent montmorillonite s presence and organic modification of the clay mineral surface the chitosan beads were employed to remove methyl green from aqueous solutions several parameters influencing adsorption were investigated to optimize the process the highest adsorption capacities after 24 h were obtained for the adsorbents dose of 5 mg methyl green initial concentration of 500 mg g 1 and ph 6 0 the presence of iron iii oxide resulted in improved adsorption ability however the composite beads with montmorillonite proved to be better adsorbents than those without the clay mineral the effect of organic functional groups did not show an analogous correlation for all the adsorbents studied the maximum experimental adsorption capacity was 303 21 mg g 1 for the composite chitosan beads with organically functionalized montmorillonite prepared in acetic acid the adsorbents without clay mineral fit the langmuir model while the freundlich isotherm model described the adsorption data for the chitosan montmorillonite beads all the materials followed the pseudo second order kinetic model the intraparticle diffusion model played an essential part in the adsorption mechanism the materials demonstrated higher efficiency of methyl green removal from real water samples and increased stability than pure chitosan beads they can be successfully reused several times increasing their potential application for dye removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chitosan montmorillonite hydrogel beads adsorption dye removal 1 introduction applying organic synthetic dyes in different areas results in a severe environmental problem dye effluents could generate many harmful effects including the destruction of the aquatic environment or health problems of living organisms as they are characterized by high stability different remediation methods are applied for their removal like membrane filtration coagulation chemical oxidation adsorption and photochemical or biological treatment among these methods adsorption as highly efficient economical and low energy consuming is the most preferred one and the research studies concerning new potential adsorbents are of great interest the adsorbents dedicated to dye removal include carbon nanotubes 1 2 titanium dioxide 3 magnetic nanomaterials 4 and many others 5 however significant emphasis is currently placed on the search for adsorbents of natural origin such eco friendly adsorbents should be an effective alternative to much more expensive synthetic ones a significant group of such materials is based on natural clay minerals they are characterized by layered structures with tetrahedral and octahedral sheets they are extensively studied due to their versatile importance in many areas including environmental protection many adsorbents contain aluminosilicate clay mineral with a tubular structure halloysite it has successfully removed various pollutants 6 8 the hollow tubular structure of halloysite contributes significantly to the interest in this material but other clay minerals with different morphology are also widely studied one of the significant groups belonging to phyllosilicate minerals is the smectite family it includes species with trioctahedral and dioctahedral characters 9 montmorillonite belongs to the smectite group with 2 1 layer structure the mineral unit comprises two tetrahedral silica layers separated by one octahedral alumina layer 10 11 its chemical formula is defined as si4 al2 ymgy o10 oh 2ym nh2o where m represents monovalent cation and y the degree of isomorphous substitution it is characterized by a large surface area high cation exchange capacity swelling properties low toxicity and biodegradability clay minerals are often applied as components of composite systems with improved affinity for a specific pollutant and a formation of hydrogel beads based on natural biopolymers such as alginate 12 14 or chitosan 15 is often proposed chitosan is a polysaccharide derived from chitin deacetylation belonging to a group of eco friendly and efficient adsorbents it contains several organic functional groups that can participate in the adsorption process however unmodified chitosan has limited application due to its low chemical stability and insufficient adsorption capacity thus different chitosan based biomaterials are synthesized 16 the preparation of chitosan natural clay mineral composites is currently a popular procedure used to improve the mechanical properties of a biopolymer increase the effectiveness of the adsorption process and thus the possibility of practical application 17 different chitosan cs montmorillonite mt composites represent a large group extensively researched for the adsorption of dyes from wastewater the intercalation of chitosan into sodium montmorillonite improved the adsorption of cationic dyes basic blue 9 basic blue 99 and basic yellow 1 18 methyl orange mo adsorption capacity was 438 6 mg g 1 after the application of zirconium iv immobilized cross linked chitosan bentonite composite 19 mo was also effectively removed from the aqueous environment using immobilized cs mt composite deposited on glass plates 20 a thin film composed of hydroxyapatite cs and mt was a suitable agent for removing cationic and anionic dyes 21 at the same time carboxymethyl cs mt hybrid material was applied to adsorption of congo red and lead ions 22 interestingly lanthanum iv incorporation improved the adsorption capacity of composites towards reactive red and acid orange dyes 23 in contrast enhanced mo removal was surprisingly observed in the presence of another dye methylene blue mb for exfoliated mt cs gel 24 on the other hand mb was efficiently adsorbed with diethanal tartaramide cross linked chitosan nanomontmorillonite composite 25 carboxymethyl cellulose cs mt nanosheet hydrogel 26 or cs mt polyaniline nanocomposite 27 the sono assisted adsorption process was proposed as a suitable method of different dye remediation onto chitosan mt composite 28 at the same time hydrolyzed hydrogel nanocomposites cs graft poly acrylamide mt were investigated for their adsorption ability towards basic red 46 29 another attractive solution to improve the adsorption properties of clay based hybrid materials was based on cs bentonite nanocomposites synthesized under microwave heating conditions 30 despite numerous literature reports on chitosan montmorillonite based systems the relationship between several different components on the adsorption efficiency of similar materials has not been studied yet therefore in the present study the properties of different chitosan based composite beads as potential dye adsorbents are reported firstly the model dye removal efficiency on pure chitosan beads was compared with those containing montmorillonite moreover as the adsorptive properties of clay minerals can be improved by surface modification with organic units 31 thus mt without and with organic substituents were applied for hydrogel beads preparation additionally two different media were used to dissolve chitosan acetic acid and iron iii chloride since the latter affected dye adsorption 32 the adsorption of model dye methyl green mg was analyzed based on a sequence of experiments to obtain optimized parameters moreover adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics real water samples and reuse cycles were investigated based on my knowledge this is the first report showing the effect of three factors mentioned above on the adsorptive properties of chitosan based materials towards a model pollutant additionally the chitosan montmorillonite beads prepared in iron iii chloride have not been studied yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials mt nanoclay mt with surface modified by 25 30 wt octadecylamine mt r1 and mt with surface modified by 15 35 wt octadecylamine and 0 5 5 wt aminopropyltriethoxysilane mt r1r2 were purchased from sigma aldrich chitosan medium molecular weight molecular weight 190 310 kda deacetylation degree 75 85 viscosity 200 800 cps and methyl green mg were products of sigma aldrich and bdh chemicals ltd respectively other chemicals ch3cooh fecl3 naoh hcl were obtained from poch poland and used as received without further purification demineralized water was used for aqueous solutions preparation 2 2 procedure of chitosan montmorillonite beads fabrication several chitosan montmorillonite beads were prepared according to the scheme shown in fig 1 chitosan 2 g was added to acetic acid 2 or iron iii chloride 0 3 mol l 1 aqueous solution with continual stirring at room temperature after complete cs dissolution 12 h clay mineral 2 g mt mt r1 or mt r1r2 was added and the mixture was stirred until homogenous dispersion was obtained 24 h after that the dispersion was dropped by syringe into sodium hydroxide solution 1 mol l 1 200 ml under stirring the hydrogel beads were prepared with ch3cooh cs mt cs mt r1 cs mt r1r2 and fecl3 csfe mt csfe mt r1 csfe mt r1r2 were collected washed several times with demineralized water and dried for 48 h at room temperature pure chitosan beads cs and csfe were prepared using an analogous procedure without montmorillonite addition for comparison studies 2 3 characterization methods the infrared spectra were recorded in the 400 4000 cm 1 range for kbr pellets using an ifs 66v s fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer from bruker usa equipped with an mct detector 125 scans resolution 2 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd measurements were performed using bruker axs d8 advance powder diffractometer germany equipped with johansson monochromator λcu kα1 1 5406 å nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were measured on a sorptometer quantachrome autosorb iq usa the samples 0 15 g were degassed at 150 c the specific surface area sbet within the relative pressure range p po of 0 01 1 00 and the pore size distribution were calculated by brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh methods respectively the surface structure and morphology were studied using a scanning electron microscope sem su3500 fitted with an energy dispersive eds detector for elemental analysis hitachi japan additionally the mean particle size of the beads was calculated by measuring a hundred beads using an electronic calliper while the water content w was calculated from eq 1 1 w w wet w dry w dry 100 where w wet dry are weights g of wet dry beads the beads studied were weighted before w dry and after w wet immersing in demineralized water for 24 h moreover the point of zero charge phpzc was determined by the salt addition method 33 nacl solution 1 l 0 01 m was divided into a series of solutions with different ph 3 0 9 0 the initial ph was adjusted by adding 0 01 m naoh or 0 01 m hcl solutions then 0 1 g of the chitosan beads was added to each solution and shaken for 48 h at room temperature the final ph value was measured and plotted against the initial ph value the phpzc was determined as the intersection of two curves 2 4 adsorption of methyl green a sequence of experiments was performed to study the adsorption properties of cs csfe montmorillonite and cs csfe beads towards methyl green mg each experiment was repeated three times the reported values are the average of the measurements performed the experiments were carried out in a multi reax test tube shaker heidolph germany with a rotation speed of 1000 rpm the amount of mg adsorbed at equilibrium q e mg g 1 was determined indirectly by measuring its concentration in solution before and after adsorption using uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 usa at 632 nm and calculated by using eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where c o mg l 1 is the initial mg concentration c e mg l 1 is mg concentration at the equilibrium v l is the volume of mg solution and m is the weight of the beads g several experimental factors such as ph adsorbent dose mg initial concentration adsorption time and temperature were assessed as control parameters in the adsorption process a series of mixtures containing mg solutions and chitosan beads were shaken for a specific time and then centrifuged eba 20 centrifuge hettich germany to measure mg concentration in the supernatant with a uv vis spectrophotometer the effect of the initial ph value was investigated in the range from 4 to 8 using 5 mg of the adsorbents and 10 ml of mg solution the initial ph of dye solutions 500 mg l 1 24 h was changed using hcl and naoh solutions 1 0 mol l 1 the ph measurements were performed using the elmetron cp 505 apparatus poland the effect of the adsorbent dose was determined by adding different amounts of the adsorbents 0 005 0 050 g to 10 ml of mg solutions 500 mg l 1 ph 6 0 24 h adsorption isotherm studies were performed for mg concentration in the range of 50 500 mg l 1 10 ml using 5 mg of chitosan beads 24 h 298 k ph 6 0 kinetic studies were conducted for contact time up to 24 h using 5 mg of the adsorbents and mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 10 ml 298 k ph 6 0 the adsorption capacity q t mg g 1 at different contact times t h was calculated by using eq 3 3 q t c 0 c t v m where c t mg l 1 is the concentration of mg in the solutions at time t h the experimental data from isotherm and kinetic studies were analyzed using several mathematical models the validity of each model was determined based on the correlation coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and chi square χ2 analysis r 2 demonstrates the best fitting between the linear form of the mathematical model and experimental data while rmse and χ2 values enable more precise determination of the best fitted models the rmse and χ2 values were evaluated using eqs 4 5 respectively 4 rmse i 1 n q e q cal 2 5 χ 2 i 1 n q e q cal 2 q cal where q e mg g 1 is the equilibrium capacity from the experimental data and q cal mg g 1 is the equilibrium capacity calculated from models the experiments investigating the influence of temperature on the adsorption process were carried out at three different temperatures 298 308 and 318 k for constant initial dye concentration 10 ml 500 mg l 1 5 mg of the adsorbents and 24 h of adsorption time 2 5 adsorption of methyl green in real water samples the mg adsorption in real water samples was investigated using tap water from laboratory faucets and lake water from swarzędz poland a certain amount of methyl green was added to the water samples to obtain mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 the samples were adjusted to ph 6 0 the adsorption process was conducted at 298 k using 5 g of the adsorbents after 24 h of shaking the mixtures the adsorption capacities for the samples were determined and compared with the results obtained for the reference samples prepared in demineralized water 2 6 desorption and reusability studies the reusability of the beads studied was determined by adsorption desorption cycles the dye adsorbed samples of chitosan beads were immersed in desorbing agents hcl 1 0 mol l 1 and stirred for 24 h the desorbed beads were filtrated washed and dried after that they were reused for adsorption of the dye studied 5 cycles to compare the percentage removal of mg adsorbed in each cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite chitosan beads the freshly prepared dry beads differ significantly in colour depending on the factor used for chitosan dissolution pure chitosan beads dissolved in acetic acid solution are pale yellow while the ones with mt mt r1 mt r1r2 are beige with reduced transparency due to the presence of solid clay minerals a dark blackish colour characterizes all chitosan beads dissolved in fecl3 solution the freshly prepared beads studied are smooth and spherically shaped their size is significantly reduced after drying the average diameter of cs and csfe beads is 0 83 and 0 90 mm respectively it is higher than the values reported in the literature 31 but follows the trend of increasing diameter after incorporating iron iii hydroxide into the chitosan beads the average diameter of composite beads with montmorillonite varies from 1 07 to 1 28 mm and the greater size results from clay addition 15 mt addition also affects material hardness and water content w the composite chitosan beads are much harder and contain less water than those without montmorillonite the highest w value is observed for cs beads 62 5 while it decreases for csfe beads 57 4 and composite cs mt 50 3 55 1 and csfe mt 43 0 48 6 beads the reduction of water content again results from clay mineral addition and it is consistent with literature reports 20 the reduced ability to swell should improve the stability of the adsorbent in aqueous solutions and thus increase its usefulness after subsequent desorption adsorption cycles the composite chitosan beads include pure mt the clay mineral functionalized with octadecylamine r1 and the one with both octadecylamine and aminopropyltriethoxysilane r1r2 the ftir spectra of mt mt r1 and mt r1r2 are given in fig 2a the infrared spectrum of mt shows peaks at 3628 and 3443 cm 1 assigned to the oh stretching vibrations interlayer and intralayer water molecules the peak at 1643 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibrations of water molecules the band observed at 1033 cm 1 comes from sio stretching while the ones at 913 and 626 cm 1 are from alo stretching vibrations the signals at 841 and 797 cm 1 could be represented by al mg oh vibrations while those at 521 and 460 cm 1 come from the bending vibrations of alosi and siosi respectively 18 the infrared spectra of organically modified montmorillonite mt r1 and mt r1r2 are very similar they contain additional bands at 3251 and 3187 cm 1 attributed to nh2 stretching vibrations at 2926 and 2850 cm 1 and 1490 and 1470 cm 1 caused by the ch stretching and bending vibrations in the alkyl chain respectively the ftir spectra of cs csfe and cs csfe mt beads are shown in fig 2b several peaks represent the functional groups of chitosan cs beads at 3424 overlapping of oh and nh stretching 2920 and 2853 ch symmetric and asymmetric stretching 1637 co stretching of amide i residual n acetyl groups 1384 cn stretching of amide iii 1153 asymmetric stretching of coc bridge 1056 co stretching and 891 cm 1 ch bending the spectrum of csfe beads shows the same characteristic peaks however the intensities of bands observed at 1056 and 891 cm 1 increase due to additional fe oh stretching and bending vibrations in the same region 32 after incorporating montmorillonite into chitosan cs mt beads mt presence is manifested by the signals at 526 and 463 cm 1 and a very sharp peak with significantly increased intensity at 1036 cm 1 again the presence of fe oh vibrations increases the intensity of the signals in csfe mt beads compared to that of cs mt beads additionally the peaks characteristic of r1 and r2 substituents are difficult to be identified by ir spectra of the composite beads studied due to their overlapping with chitosan signals the crystalline structures of mt mt r1 and mt r1r2 fig 3a and different chitosan beads studied fig 3b were detected by xrd characterization the xrd pattern of montmorillonite is confirmed by reflections at 2 theta 7 1 19 7 26 5 28 5 35 2 40 2 53 9 61 9 joint committee for powder diffraction studies jcpds no 13 0135 34 35 organic modification of mt surfaces leads to a shift in mt reflection from 7 1 to below 5 which could be attributed to the interactions between organic units with amine functional groups and clay surface pure chitosan cs beads show two broad reflections at 10 4 and 20 3 attributed to the hydrogen bonds between amino and hydroxyl groups 30 however after the dissolution of chitosan in fecl3 the chelate is formed between iron iii ions and nh2 groups in cs resulting in the disappearance of cs characteristic reflections additional signals of small intensity observed at 35 5 and 61 6 confirm the amorphous nature of fe oh 3 particles present in chitosan 32 the composite chitosan beads show very similar xrd patterns regardless of the presence of organic substituents after cs dissolution in acetic acid the presence of mt is manifested by similar reflections at 19 7 26 5 35 2 53 9 and 61 9 however the reflection around 7 for mt and below 5 for mt r1 mt r1r2 is shifted towards higher theta values as shown in fig 3b it is observed at 5 9 for cs mt r1r2 the peak intensity of mt in composite chitosan beads decreases significantly after dissolution in fecl3 however the presence of mt is confirmed by the peaks at 6 9 and 19 7 on the other hand the reflections at 35 5 and 61 6 probably originate from amorphous iron iii hydroxide particles further investigation of the materials studied was carried out using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig 4 shows isotherms obtained for chitosan beads without cs and csfe and with mt cs mt and csfe mt and the pore size distribution for those materials pure chitosan beads are characterized by type iv isotherm typical of many mesoporous adsorbents with h4 hysteresis loop often associated with narrow slip like pores 36 these findings are consistent with some literature reports 20 on the other hand the composite beads demonstrate type iii isotherm and h3 hysteresis loop this less common type indicates an essential role of interactions between adsorbate molecules moreover increased adsorbate concentration favours adsorption the h3 loop is observed with aggregates of plate like particles and layered structure materials 28 the analogous isotherms were obtained for the materials containing organic units at mt surfaces r1 and r1r2 as shown in table 1 the chitosan beads studied differ in surface area pore volume and average pore diameter the specific bet surface area s bet of cs beads was 8 77 m2 g 1 according to the literature reports s bet values for chitosan were very varied and data reported included even very low values 2 11 28 or 3 82 m2 g 1 20 however chitosan beads obtained by yang et al 31 demonstrated a similar specific surface area 10 70 m2 g 1 after chitosan dissolving in fecl3 the s bet value for csfe beads increases to 16 44 m2 g 1 due to iron iii hydroxide presence 32 the addition of montmorillonite results in a further increase of specific surface area according to the literature reports mt surface area exceeds 200 m2 g 1 28 thus it can affect the improvement of chitosan bead parameters s bet values are 22 30 and 26 52 m2 g 1 for cs mt and csfe mt beads respectively consistent with data analysis for similar systems 18 20 28 on the other hand the organic functionalization of mt has a different effect depending on the adsorbent type cs mt r1 and cs mt r1r2 beads have slightly higher surface area than cs mt while for their equivalents obtained with iron iii chloride decrease in s bet values is observed iron iii ions probably also interact with amino groups present in organic substituents which may reduce the surface area of the materials the total pore volume of cs beads was only 0 014 cm3 g 1 and it was much lower than the values obtained for csfe 0 038 cm3 g 1 cs mt 0 047 cm3 g 1 and csfe mt beads 0 041 cm3 g 1 it suggests that both iron iii hydroxide and clay mineral could improve the adsorption properties of the material as the surface is enlarged and access into its pores should be facilitated 28 32 however the presence of organic units results in a decrease in pore volume the organic substituents probably partially block the pores contributing to the reduction in porosity additionally the differences in average pore diameter were also observed however the average value does not reflect the actual size of the pores the inset in fig 4 shows that all the adsorbents are characterized by heterogeneous pore volume distribution and peaks of different intensities can be distinguished the mt incorporation into chitosan results in a reduction of average pore diameter despite a few pore populations it can be seen that pores with a size in the range of 2 5 nm dominate which results in a lower average value moreover the pore sizes for the adsorbents studied correspond to mesoporous materials the dried chitosan beads were also characterized by sem analysis fig 5 shows the internal and external structure of cs csfe cs mt and csfe mt beads pure chitosan beads have a relatively smooth fig 5a outer surface 15 while for other adsorbents it is much rougher fig 5c e g the inner surface of csfe shows uniform distribution of iron iii hydroxide in chitosan beads fig 5d while mt tends to agglomerate inside hydrogel beads fig 5f h the formation of the chitosan beads studied was also confirmed by eds analysis cs beads are characterized by the presence of carbon 67 and oxygen 25 the incorporation of fe oh 3 is manifested by additional peaks from iron 6 5 in csfe beads however the most significant variation in the amount and quality of elements appears for composite chitosan beads the cs mt beads contain peaks typical of the clay mineral 35 si 21 3 al 7 6 fe 1 6 and some trace elements ca na mg and those from chitosan c 15 and o 49 3 the oxygen content is much higher because it is present in chitosan and montmorillonite the csfe mt beads contain slightly modified elemental composition because iron content increases to 8 2 3 2 analysis of adsorbent dose and solution ph the adsorbent dosage and ph value are important factors affecting the adsorption ability of the materials thus these parameters were optimized at the beginning of batch adsorption studies the amount of mg adsorbed q e was analyzed by adding 5 50 mg of the chitosan beads into 500 mg l 1 mg solution fig 6a when the amount of the adsorbents studied increases the q e reduces the tendency is observed for all the chitosan beads thus the most effective adsorbent cs mt r1r2 is characterized by 303 21 mg g 1 adsorption capacity for a 5 mg adsorbent dose and it drops to only 102 64 mg g 1 for 50 mg interestingly the higher the adsorbent dose was the more minor differences in adsorption capacities of composite chitosan beads were observed it indicates that higher adsorption capacity is obtained for smaller doses on the other hand the percentage removal of methyl green increased with increasing dose data not shown however the difference was not significant i e doubling the weight resulted in only a few per cent increase in the value of percentage removal it probably results from the chitosan beads aggregation which reduces the surface area of the adsorbents available to the dye molecules a similar tendency was observed for other adsorbents used for dye removal 29 37 38 the research studies of doses lower than 5 mg did not give unequivocal results as they were already burdened with a much larger measurement error therefore it was difficult to determine whether such small doses contributed to a further increase in the adsorption capacity of the materials studied finally a dose of 5 mg was chosen as the optimal value for further studies the influence of ph was analyzed only in the range 4 8 fig 6b it results from the effect of ph on the uv vis spectrum of methyl green mg represents a group of cationic triphenylmethane dyes its structure is strongly dependent on ph values the most intensive band is slightly reduced in an acidic environment ph 2 because the molecules are protonated mg in contrast in a basic solution ph 10 complete decolourization occurs because molecules are converted into colourless carbinol mg oh 39 40 as shown in fig 6b solution ph significantly influences the adsorption abilities of the chitosan beads the adsorption capacities of all adsorbents studied increase in the ph range from 4 to 6 while for ph 6 and 7 the amount of mg adsorbed for each material is quite similar however the chitosan beads obtained in iron iii chloride have higher adsorption capacities at ph 7 0 while those dissolved in acetic acid at ph 6 0 finally the adsorption capacities decrease slightly in an alkaline environment ph 8 according to the literature pure chitosan with nh2 functional groups is protonated at ph 6 and experiences repulsive electrostatic interactions with positively charged dye molecules in an acidic solution 29 however as the solution ph increases the adsorbent surface is deprotonated promoting dye adsorption this tendency can explain the results obtained for pure chitosan beads because the adsorbent showed the highest adsorption capacity at ph 7 0 the presence of mt in chitosan beads has no significant effect on the observed dependence between ph and adsorption capacity according to the literature reports 28 cs mt composite surface could be positively charged at ph 10 08 thus electrostatic interactions cannot be involved in the adsorption process of a cationic dye in the whole ph range studied it suggests that the adsorption occurs primarily due to hydrogen bonding but some other interactions can be present ion exchange van der waals interactions additionally adsorbate particles can participate in multilayer formation on the adsorbent surfaces due to π π bonds between the dye molecules however electrostatic attractions between the adsorbents studied and mg should not be excluded as there are many materials based on chitosan and montmorillonite characterized by lower ph point of zero charges phpzc 3 7 25 5 0 19 6 24 21 6 3 20 moreover csfe beads and the composite beads prepared in the presence of fecl3 show a similar tendency but the increase in the adsorption capacity is kept to neutral ph the literature reports demonstrate that the surface of pure csfe beads is positively charged at solution ph 8 4 31 additionally contrary to the assumptions that the increase in adsorption capacity should also be maintained at ph 8 a slight decrease is observed a partial mg discolouration could explain this and the uv vis spectrum in this range does not reflect the actual amount adsorbed on the chitosan beads the observed relationships at different phs on the adsorption efficiency can be better interpreted by determining the ph of the zero charge point phpzc for the adsorbents studied table 2 in general at ph phpzc the material surface is positively charged while for ph phpzc negatively charged pure chitosan beads have phpzc 6 2 similar to those obtained in other studies 41 therefore electrostatic repulsion dominates between the cationic dye and the amine groups in chitosan at low ph according to the literature data at ph 4 5 99 of chitosan is protonated 42 with increasing ph the strength of these unfavourable interactions decreases the presence of mt decreases the value of phpzc 5 73 which was also observed for other adsorbing systems 25 the organic units at the montmorillonite surface cause an increase in the value of the ph point zero charges which results from the presence of amino groups in the r1 and r2 pendant arms the corresponding materials obtained in fecl3 demonstrate higher phpzc values 32 which explains better adsorption abilities in ph 7 0 than those for ph 6 0 thus the dominant interactions between the adsorbents studied and mg vary depending on the ph value still once the phpzc is exceeded electrostatic attraction is probably the most important one finally as the adsorption capacities for ph 6 and 7 were comparable and the most effective adsorbents studied demonstrated the highest values for ph 6 weakly acidic solutions were used for further measurements 3 3 effect of methyl green initial concentration and adsorption isotherms the effect of mg initial concentration is another crucial parameter affecting the adsorption capacity the increase of the initial dye concentration in the range of 50 500 mg l 1 results in an increased value of adsorption capacity q for all the chitosan beads studied fig 7a the maximum adsorption capacity for pure cs beads is only 41 90 mg g 1 in comparison it increases to 126 04 mg g 1 for csfe beads demonstrating the beneficial effect of chitosan dissolution in iron iii oxide and modification in the biopolymer structure this difference can be explained by the very small surface area of pure chitosan and thus the limited availability for the dye molecules 43 the presence of iron iii hydroxide in csfe beads increases significantly specific surface area and pore volume thus adsorption capacity is about three times higher under optimal conditions 5 mg of adsorbent ph 6 0 mg 500 mg l 1 on the other hand the point of zero charge phpzc is also higher which lowers the adsorption capacity of cationic molecules the incorporation of montmorillonite increases the adsorption abilities of the chitosan beads and it exceeds 250 mg g 1 for both cs mt and csfe mt it is worth noting that the obtained values are much higher than those obtained for many other chitosan montmorillonite based materials dedicated to the adsorption of cationic dyes 21 27 the organic units characterized by long alkyl chains and amine functional groups produce two opposite effects depending on the solvent used to prepare the chitosan beads the materials prepared in acetic acid have a greater adsorption efficiency than the system with unmodified aluminosilicate although the organic substituents occupy part of the mt surface and reduce its availability for the dye they also participate in mg binding which results in a higher q e value on the other hand the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents csfe mt r1 and csfe mt r1r2 are reduced compared to csfe mt beads it could result from competitive interactions between amino groups in substituents and iron iii ions it lowers the adsorbent surface area and prevents organic units from participating in the binding of dye molecules finally the maximum adsorption capacity for cs beads was achieved for cs mt r1r2 and it amounted to 303 21 mg g 1 in contrast csfe mt demonstrated the most effective adsorption properties manifested in 272 55 mg g 1 adsorption capacity value in the group of csfe beads the optimal mg concentration was 500 mg g 1 further analysis of the adsorption data for a range of initial concentrations was carried out using three linear adsorption isotherm models langmuir freundlich and temkin the langmuir model assumes monolayer formation at specific homogeneous sites within the adsorbent 44 while the freundlich model refers to heterogeneity of adsorption sites and multilayer adsorption 45 finally the temkin model considers indirect interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules it assumes a linear decrease of adsorption heat as surface coverage increases 46 the parameters related to isotherm models are collected in table 3 while the linear forms of equations and isotherm plots are presented in supporting information the highest correlation coefficients r 2 for chitosan beads without clay mineral cs and csfe were obtained for the langmuir model it can be interpreted as monolayer adsorption of methyl green on homogenous binding sites on chitosan surfaces on the other hand the correlation coefficients for composite chitosan beads are slightly higher for the freundlich model than for the langmuir ones the literature reports show that chitosan clay mineral beads used for cationic dye adsorption could be characterized by high and very similar correlation coefficients for langmuir and freundlich models 15 in the present studies the values of r 2 are comparable for both models and similar correlation coefficients for temkin one also characterize some adsorbents the differences were particularly insignificant for csfe mt r1 and csfe mt r1r2 therefore it is difficult to determine the best fit isotherm model unambiguously more detailed statistical analysis based on the determination of root mean square error rmse and chi square χ2 values table s1 in supp inf allowed to decide which of the models best described the adsorption of mg on the materials studied the lowest values of rmse and χ2 were obtained for the freundlich isotherm thus this model provides the best fit for the experimental data therefore the materials with montmorillonite demonstrate multilayer adsorption of methyl green on heterogeneous adsorption sites this mechanism of the adsorption process results from the presence of two different factors cs and mt in the beads studied responsible for the mg adsorption additionally according to 1 n values lower than 1 obtained from the freundlich model the adsorption process was favourable for all the adsorbents studied the maximum adsorption capacities q m calculated from the langmuir model are in the range of 48 80 cs 396 19 cs mt r1r2 mg g 1 according to the literature reports the maximum adsorption capacity of mg could have an extensive range of values table 4 mesoporous silica mcm 41 or graphene demonstrated low adsorption capacity values below 30 mg g 1 47 49 the application of different aluminosilicate clay minerals resulted in more efficient removal of methyl green from aqueous solutions manifested by 65 353 mg of mg adsorbed per unit mass of the particular adsorbent 50 52 moreover the composite alginate beads with dendrimer functionalized halloysite were characterized by an adsorption capacity of 113 mg g 1 14 therefore the results obtained for the composite montmorillonite chitosan beads are very promising and prove their high efficiency compared to the systems previously described additionally the composite beads can be also competitive with other chitosan based adsorbents dedicated to cationic dyes although many literature reports present different chitosan adsorbents their efficiency is highly diverse many materials are characterized by adsorption capacity below 100 mg g 1 53 55 which is even lower than that obtained for csfe beads the other exemplary adsorbents used for cationic dyes also have lower q e values like magnetic xanthate modified chitosan 197 8 mg g 1 56 activated oil palm ash zeolite chitosan 199 20 mg g 1 57 or chitosan cross linked 3d network 115 60 mg g 1 58 more effective materials are also described in the literature as a combination of nanocrystalline cellulose with modified chitosan 785 mg g 1 59 or magnetic chitosan functionalized with edta 459 9 mg g 1 60 additionally the results obtained for a similar system but requiring exfoliated montmorillonite nanosheets 61 applied to adsorption of other cationic dye at room temperature were only slightly higher than that obtained for cs mt r1r2 despite the more complicated procedure for the adsorbent preparation the composite materials presented in the current studies are less sophisticated thus generating lower production costs and at the same time they have sufficiently high values of adsorption capacities 3 4 analysis of adsorption kinetics the influence of contact time was carried out for 24 h using an mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 fig 7b the dye removal from the aqueous solution was much faster during the first 12 h while it dropped in the following hours until it reached equilibrium no increase in adsorption capacity was observed during the longer duration of the process the amount of mg adsorbed at specific time intervals q t of all chitosan beads was higher than that of pure cs beads the number of active sites available for mg molecules is the highest at the beginning and it gradually decreases as the adsorption process proceeds mt significantly increases the number of active sites thus cs beads are fully occupied much faster and their adsorption rate slows down after 6 h while the other adsorbents demonstrate much faster adsorption rates additionally iron iii oxide also has a beneficial effect on increasing the number of active sites available for the dye that confirms higher q t values for csfe beads than those for pure cs ones however their adsorption rate also slows down much faster than composite chitosan beads the experimental data were further used for mathematical models to determine the rate controlling step and the mechanism of methyl green adsorption on the chitosan beads surfaces two kinetic models the pseudo first and pseudo second order and the intraparticle model for adsorption mechanism analysis were applied the parameters related to kinetic models are collected in table 5 while the appropriate equations and kinetic plots are presented in supporting information the correlation coefficient r 2 values of the pseudo second order model 0 946 0 995 were higher for individual chitosan beads studied than those of the pseudo first order model 0 857 0 950 15 27 these observations were confirmed by statistical analysis for the pseudo second order model the rmse and χ2 values are lower than those obtained for the pseudo first order one table s2 supp inf in addition the adsorption capacity values obtained for the pseudo second order model are much closer to the experimental values than those for the pseudo first order model therefore the adsorption process in the present study involves strong interactions between adsorbent and methyl green molecules this observation is in agreement with other adsorbents based on chitosan and montmorillonite applied for dye removal 25 28 29 the pure chitosan beads have the lowest value of the rate constant of the pseudo second order model k2 it increases significantly in the presence of fe iii ions csfe and montmorillonite cs mt csfe mt however the effect of organic units r1 r2 is different for the adsorbent obtained in various dissolution media the k2 values for the composite cs beads with organic functional groups at mt surfaces are higher than cs mt while for csfe beads the r1r2 substituents generate a decrease of k2 moreover the intraparticle diffusion model data analysis indicates that diffusion plays an important role in limiting the adsorption rate an excellent correlation is observed for different chitosan beads dissolved in acetic acid r 2 0 96 0 99 while for those dissolved in iron iii chloride is slightly lower 0 86 0 95 it suggests that methyl green adsorption onto different cs beads is adequately described by pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models while mg adsorption onto different csfe beads is by only the pseudo second order model as the slope did not pass the origin for all the adsorbents studied the adsorption process is not only controlled by intra particle diffusion 39 additionally higher boundary layer thickness c was observed for all csfe beads suggesting an increase in the boundary layer effect after chitosan dissolution in fecl3 on the other hand mt s presence increased the intra particle diffusion k id constants while no significant impact on boundary layer thickness was observed 3 5 thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic studies provide essential information about the nature and spontaneity of the adsorption process the effect of temperature was analyzed at 298 308 and 318 k thermodynamics parameters including the gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were measured to analyze the effect of increased temperature of solutions on methyl green adsorption the values listed in table 6 were calculated using the following mathematical expressions 6 k c c a c e 7 g rt ln k c h t s 8 ln k c g rt h rt s r where k c is the equilibrium constant resulting from the ratio of mg adsorbed on the different chitosan beads surfaces c a to the equilibrium mg concentration in solution c e the negative values of δg reflect the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process in the case of pure chitosan beads it increased for higher temperatures thus increasing the temperature did not promote adsorption on the other hand all other beads demonstrate the opposite trend indicating that adsorption is more favourable at higher temperatures the positive values of enthalpy change δh indicate the endothermic nature of adsorption while the positive values of entropy change δs increased disorderness at the chitosan beads surfaces during mg adsorption in the adsorbent active sites 32 39 62 3 6 mechanism of adsorption the adsorbents studied after methyl green adsorption were analyzed by ftir spectroscopy to understand their interactions with dye molecules fig 8 the spectrum of mg shows peaks at 3435 nh 2916 and 2853 ch 1617 and 1588 cc cn in heterocycle 1480 cn cc 1365 ch3 1223 1170 and 1119 heterocyclic skeleton cm 1 27 38 39 the spectra of the chitosan beads studied loaded with mg have some peaks shifted to different frequencies or increased intensity confirming adsorbent adsorbate interactions the bands at 1637 cm 1 in the chitosan beads and 1588 cm 1 assigned to vibrations of heterocycle in mg are shifted suggesting the presence of π π interactions 20 however the adsorbents prepared in acetic acid experience a shift towards higher frequencies cs 1640 cm 1 cs mt 1644 cm 1 and cs mt r1r2 1655 cm 1 while those in fecl3 towards lower frequencies csfe 1632 cm 1 csfe mt 1630 cm 1 and csfe mt r1r2 1635 cm 1 it might suggest that the importance of this type of interaction varies depending on the type of adsorbent and this may be one of the reasons for the lower efficiency of csfe mt r1r2 compared to cs mt r1r2 beads moreover the band at 1384 cm 1 cn stretching in the adsorbents and 1365 cm 1 in mg bending vibrations of ch3 groups interfered and shifted it might be the effect of hydrogen bonding between hydrogen in mg and nitrogen on the chitosan bead surface 20 additionally the signal intensity enhancement at around 1030 1050 cm 1 is observed after mg adsorption it could result from interactions between sio feo and co in different chitosan beads and heterocyclic skeleton of methyl green the presence of non specific interactions may explain the ability of the materials studied to mg adsorption at conditions below the phpzc finally several different interactions could be responsible for the effective adsorption of mg the highest adsorption capacity was obtained after exceeding the ph zero charge point therefore the main adsorption force is the electrostatic attraction between a cationic dye and the adsorbents negatively charged surfaces however hydrogen bonding and π π interactions might also play an essential role 63 3 7 analysis of real water samples the adsorption capacity of the chitosan beads was also studied for real water samples tap water and lake water the results obtained for the sample in demineralized water were used as a reference for comparison table 7 includes adsorption capacity values for three water samples obtained after the adsorption process at ph 6 0 for 24 h using an initial mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 the results expressed that the composition of tap water did not significantly impact the efficiency of the adsorbents as the obtained adsorption capacities were comparable to those for the reference samples a more complex lake water sample generated some decrease in the adsorption properties of all chitosan beads however most chitosan beads demonstrate only a slight reduction in adsorption capacity values thus they retain very good adsorption properties towards methyl green on the other hand pure chitosan beads experience a substantial almost two fold decrease in their effectiveness it is probably due to their much shorter persistence in a complex environment thus their low stability under natural conditions in which contaminants may occur eliminates them as a material with practical application 3 8 desorption and reusability studies the application of any adsorbent for large scale treatment requires economic consideration therefore the materials were regenerated and reused in 5 adsorption desorption cycles the desorbing agent 1 0 m hcl solution is strongly acidic under such ph conditions electrostatic repulsion dominates between the net positive charge on the adsorbent surfaces and the protonated mg molecules which promotes desorption the adsorption capacities obtained in the following cycles were compared to the initial ones all the chitosan beads studied demonstrated high removal efficiencies up to the fourth cycle above 80 of the original value fig 9 pure cs beads show the lowest stability in the subsequent desorption adsorption cycles after one cycle its efficiency dropped below 90 proving the lowest resistance of this adsorbent to the applied conditions the presence of iron csfe significantly increases the material s durability while the aluminosilicate has the most beneficial effect on the material stability in the subsequent few cycles however in the fifth cycle the efficiency of all the adsorbents decreased significantly 45 60 which indicates gradual exhaustion of the adsorbents studied 4 conclusions the current study demonstrates the fabrication and characterization of several chitosan beads with incorporated montmorillonite with without organic functional units applied for methyl green adsorption from an aqueous solution under different conditions the results showed that after optimization of several parameters 5 mg of adsorbent dose 500 mg g 1 of mg ph 6 0 adsorption time 24 h two factors influenced the adsorption abilities of chitosan beads significantly the presence of montmorillonite and chitosan dissolution in iron iii chloride on the other hand the organic units at the montmorillonite surface had a beneficial effect on the materials dissolved in acetic acid in contrast for the ones obtained in the presence of iron iii chloride the clay mineral s organic modification resulted in reduced adsorption ability regardless of the differences between the individual materials they all showed a significantly greater ability to remove mg from aqueous solutions than pure chitosan beads the maximum adsorption capacity of 303 21 mg g 1 was obtained for cs mt r1r1 beads the experimental data correlated well with the langmuir isotherm model for chitosan beads without clay minerals and the freundlich isotherm model for all other composite beads the pseudo second order kinetic model was most suitable for all the materials studied the values of thermodynamic parameters evidenced the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption process the composite chitosan beads were also effective mg adsorbents in real water samples the materials studied demonstrated high adsorption capacity after four times usage confirming their reusability very promising

12948,in this study several different chitosan beads with incorporated montmorillonite were prepared the materials were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy x ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen sorptometry the adsorption capacity of the materials studied was analyzed based on the use of fecl3 as a chitosan solvent montmorillonite s presence and organic modification of the clay mineral surface the chitosan beads were employed to remove methyl green from aqueous solutions several parameters influencing adsorption were investigated to optimize the process the highest adsorption capacities after 24 h were obtained for the adsorbents dose of 5 mg methyl green initial concentration of 500 mg g 1 and ph 6 0 the presence of iron iii oxide resulted in improved adsorption ability however the composite beads with montmorillonite proved to be better adsorbents than those without the clay mineral the effect of organic functional groups did not show an analogous correlation for all the adsorbents studied the maximum experimental adsorption capacity was 303 21 mg g 1 for the composite chitosan beads with organically functionalized montmorillonite prepared in acetic acid the adsorbents without clay mineral fit the langmuir model while the freundlich isotherm model described the adsorption data for the chitosan montmorillonite beads all the materials followed the pseudo second order kinetic model the intraparticle diffusion model played an essential part in the adsorption mechanism the materials demonstrated higher efficiency of methyl green removal from real water samples and increased stability than pure chitosan beads they can be successfully reused several times increasing their potential application for dye removal graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords chitosan montmorillonite hydrogel beads adsorption dye removal 1 introduction applying organic synthetic dyes in different areas results in a severe environmental problem dye effluents could generate many harmful effects including the destruction of the aquatic environment or health problems of living organisms as they are characterized by high stability different remediation methods are applied for their removal like membrane filtration coagulation chemical oxidation adsorption and photochemical or biological treatment among these methods adsorption as highly efficient economical and low energy consuming is the most preferred one and the research studies concerning new potential adsorbents are of great interest the adsorbents dedicated to dye removal include carbon nanotubes 1 2 titanium dioxide 3 magnetic nanomaterials 4 and many others 5 however significant emphasis is currently placed on the search for adsorbents of natural origin such eco friendly adsorbents should be an effective alternative to much more expensive synthetic ones a significant group of such materials is based on natural clay minerals they are characterized by layered structures with tetrahedral and octahedral sheets they are extensively studied due to their versatile importance in many areas including environmental protection many adsorbents contain aluminosilicate clay mineral with a tubular structure halloysite it has successfully removed various pollutants 6 8 the hollow tubular structure of halloysite contributes significantly to the interest in this material but other clay minerals with different morphology are also widely studied one of the significant groups belonging to phyllosilicate minerals is the smectite family it includes species with trioctahedral and dioctahedral characters 9 montmorillonite belongs to the smectite group with 2 1 layer structure the mineral unit comprises two tetrahedral silica layers separated by one octahedral alumina layer 10 11 its chemical formula is defined as si4 al2 ymgy o10 oh 2ym nh2o where m represents monovalent cation and y the degree of isomorphous substitution it is characterized by a large surface area high cation exchange capacity swelling properties low toxicity and biodegradability clay minerals are often applied as components of composite systems with improved affinity for a specific pollutant and a formation of hydrogel beads based on natural biopolymers such as alginate 12 14 or chitosan 15 is often proposed chitosan is a polysaccharide derived from chitin deacetylation belonging to a group of eco friendly and efficient adsorbents it contains several organic functional groups that can participate in the adsorption process however unmodified chitosan has limited application due to its low chemical stability and insufficient adsorption capacity thus different chitosan based biomaterials are synthesized 16 the preparation of chitosan natural clay mineral composites is currently a popular procedure used to improve the mechanical properties of a biopolymer increase the effectiveness of the adsorption process and thus the possibility of practical application 17 different chitosan cs montmorillonite mt composites represent a large group extensively researched for the adsorption of dyes from wastewater the intercalation of chitosan into sodium montmorillonite improved the adsorption of cationic dyes basic blue 9 basic blue 99 and basic yellow 1 18 methyl orange mo adsorption capacity was 438 6 mg g 1 after the application of zirconium iv immobilized cross linked chitosan bentonite composite 19 mo was also effectively removed from the aqueous environment using immobilized cs mt composite deposited on glass plates 20 a thin film composed of hydroxyapatite cs and mt was a suitable agent for removing cationic and anionic dyes 21 at the same time carboxymethyl cs mt hybrid material was applied to adsorption of congo red and lead ions 22 interestingly lanthanum iv incorporation improved the adsorption capacity of composites towards reactive red and acid orange dyes 23 in contrast enhanced mo removal was surprisingly observed in the presence of another dye methylene blue mb for exfoliated mt cs gel 24 on the other hand mb was efficiently adsorbed with diethanal tartaramide cross linked chitosan nanomontmorillonite composite 25 carboxymethyl cellulose cs mt nanosheet hydrogel 26 or cs mt polyaniline nanocomposite 27 the sono assisted adsorption process was proposed as a suitable method of different dye remediation onto chitosan mt composite 28 at the same time hydrolyzed hydrogel nanocomposites cs graft poly acrylamide mt were investigated for their adsorption ability towards basic red 46 29 another attractive solution to improve the adsorption properties of clay based hybrid materials was based on cs bentonite nanocomposites synthesized under microwave heating conditions 30 despite numerous literature reports on chitosan montmorillonite based systems the relationship between several different components on the adsorption efficiency of similar materials has not been studied yet therefore in the present study the properties of different chitosan based composite beads as potential dye adsorbents are reported firstly the model dye removal efficiency on pure chitosan beads was compared with those containing montmorillonite moreover as the adsorptive properties of clay minerals can be improved by surface modification with organic units 31 thus mt without and with organic substituents were applied for hydrogel beads preparation additionally two different media were used to dissolve chitosan acetic acid and iron iii chloride since the latter affected dye adsorption 32 the adsorption of model dye methyl green mg was analyzed based on a sequence of experiments to obtain optimized parameters moreover adsorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics real water samples and reuse cycles were investigated based on my knowledge this is the first report showing the effect of three factors mentioned above on the adsorptive properties of chitosan based materials towards a model pollutant additionally the chitosan montmorillonite beads prepared in iron iii chloride have not been studied yet 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials mt nanoclay mt with surface modified by 25 30 wt octadecylamine mt r1 and mt with surface modified by 15 35 wt octadecylamine and 0 5 5 wt aminopropyltriethoxysilane mt r1r2 were purchased from sigma aldrich chitosan medium molecular weight molecular weight 190 310 kda deacetylation degree 75 85 viscosity 200 800 cps and methyl green mg were products of sigma aldrich and bdh chemicals ltd respectively other chemicals ch3cooh fecl3 naoh hcl were obtained from poch poland and used as received without further purification demineralized water was used for aqueous solutions preparation 2 2 procedure of chitosan montmorillonite beads fabrication several chitosan montmorillonite beads were prepared according to the scheme shown in fig 1 chitosan 2 g was added to acetic acid 2 or iron iii chloride 0 3 mol l 1 aqueous solution with continual stirring at room temperature after complete cs dissolution 12 h clay mineral 2 g mt mt r1 or mt r1r2 was added and the mixture was stirred until homogenous dispersion was obtained 24 h after that the dispersion was dropped by syringe into sodium hydroxide solution 1 mol l 1 200 ml under stirring the hydrogel beads were prepared with ch3cooh cs mt cs mt r1 cs mt r1r2 and fecl3 csfe mt csfe mt r1 csfe mt r1r2 were collected washed several times with demineralized water and dried for 48 h at room temperature pure chitosan beads cs and csfe were prepared using an analogous procedure without montmorillonite addition for comparison studies 2 3 characterization methods the infrared spectra were recorded in the 400 4000 cm 1 range for kbr pellets using an ifs 66v s fourier transform infrared ftir spectrophotometer from bruker usa equipped with an mct detector 125 scans resolution 2 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd measurements were performed using bruker axs d8 advance powder diffractometer germany equipped with johansson monochromator λcu kα1 1 5406 å nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were measured on a sorptometer quantachrome autosorb iq usa the samples 0 15 g were degassed at 150 c the specific surface area sbet within the relative pressure range p po of 0 01 1 00 and the pore size distribution were calculated by brunauer emmett teller bet and barrett joyner halenda bjh methods respectively the surface structure and morphology were studied using a scanning electron microscope sem su3500 fitted with an energy dispersive eds detector for elemental analysis hitachi japan additionally the mean particle size of the beads was calculated by measuring a hundred beads using an electronic calliper while the water content w was calculated from eq 1 1 w w wet w dry w dry 100 where w wet dry are weights g of wet dry beads the beads studied were weighted before w dry and after w wet immersing in demineralized water for 24 h moreover the point of zero charge phpzc was determined by the salt addition method 33 nacl solution 1 l 0 01 m was divided into a series of solutions with different ph 3 0 9 0 the initial ph was adjusted by adding 0 01 m naoh or 0 01 m hcl solutions then 0 1 g of the chitosan beads was added to each solution and shaken for 48 h at room temperature the final ph value was measured and plotted against the initial ph value the phpzc was determined as the intersection of two curves 2 4 adsorption of methyl green a sequence of experiments was performed to study the adsorption properties of cs csfe montmorillonite and cs csfe beads towards methyl green mg each experiment was repeated three times the reported values are the average of the measurements performed the experiments were carried out in a multi reax test tube shaker heidolph germany with a rotation speed of 1000 rpm the amount of mg adsorbed at equilibrium q e mg g 1 was determined indirectly by measuring its concentration in solution before and after adsorption using uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 usa at 632 nm and calculated by using eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v m where c o mg l 1 is the initial mg concentration c e mg l 1 is mg concentration at the equilibrium v l is the volume of mg solution and m is the weight of the beads g several experimental factors such as ph adsorbent dose mg initial concentration adsorption time and temperature were assessed as control parameters in the adsorption process a series of mixtures containing mg solutions and chitosan beads were shaken for a specific time and then centrifuged eba 20 centrifuge hettich germany to measure mg concentration in the supernatant with a uv vis spectrophotometer the effect of the initial ph value was investigated in the range from 4 to 8 using 5 mg of the adsorbents and 10 ml of mg solution the initial ph of dye solutions 500 mg l 1 24 h was changed using hcl and naoh solutions 1 0 mol l 1 the ph measurements were performed using the elmetron cp 505 apparatus poland the effect of the adsorbent dose was determined by adding different amounts of the adsorbents 0 005 0 050 g to 10 ml of mg solutions 500 mg l 1 ph 6 0 24 h adsorption isotherm studies were performed for mg concentration in the range of 50 500 mg l 1 10 ml using 5 mg of chitosan beads 24 h 298 k ph 6 0 kinetic studies were conducted for contact time up to 24 h using 5 mg of the adsorbents and mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 10 ml 298 k ph 6 0 the adsorption capacity q t mg g 1 at different contact times t h was calculated by using eq 3 3 q t c 0 c t v m where c t mg l 1 is the concentration of mg in the solutions at time t h the experimental data from isotherm and kinetic studies were analyzed using several mathematical models the validity of each model was determined based on the correlation coefficient r 2 root mean square error rmse and chi square χ2 analysis r 2 demonstrates the best fitting between the linear form of the mathematical model and experimental data while rmse and χ2 values enable more precise determination of the best fitted models the rmse and χ2 values were evaluated using eqs 4 5 respectively 4 rmse i 1 n q e q cal 2 5 χ 2 i 1 n q e q cal 2 q cal where q e mg g 1 is the equilibrium capacity from the experimental data and q cal mg g 1 is the equilibrium capacity calculated from models the experiments investigating the influence of temperature on the adsorption process were carried out at three different temperatures 298 308 and 318 k for constant initial dye concentration 10 ml 500 mg l 1 5 mg of the adsorbents and 24 h of adsorption time 2 5 adsorption of methyl green in real water samples the mg adsorption in real water samples was investigated using tap water from laboratory faucets and lake water from swarzędz poland a certain amount of methyl green was added to the water samples to obtain mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 the samples were adjusted to ph 6 0 the adsorption process was conducted at 298 k using 5 g of the adsorbents after 24 h of shaking the mixtures the adsorption capacities for the samples were determined and compared with the results obtained for the reference samples prepared in demineralized water 2 6 desorption and reusability studies the reusability of the beads studied was determined by adsorption desorption cycles the dye adsorbed samples of chitosan beads were immersed in desorbing agents hcl 1 0 mol l 1 and stirred for 24 h the desorbed beads were filtrated washed and dried after that they were reused for adsorption of the dye studied 5 cycles to compare the percentage removal of mg adsorbed in each cycle 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of composite chitosan beads the freshly prepared dry beads differ significantly in colour depending on the factor used for chitosan dissolution pure chitosan beads dissolved in acetic acid solution are pale yellow while the ones with mt mt r1 mt r1r2 are beige with reduced transparency due to the presence of solid clay minerals a dark blackish colour characterizes all chitosan beads dissolved in fecl3 solution the freshly prepared beads studied are smooth and spherically shaped their size is significantly reduced after drying the average diameter of cs and csfe beads is 0 83 and 0 90 mm respectively it is higher than the values reported in the literature 31 but follows the trend of increasing diameter after incorporating iron iii hydroxide into the chitosan beads the average diameter of composite beads with montmorillonite varies from 1 07 to 1 28 mm and the greater size results from clay addition 15 mt addition also affects material hardness and water content w the composite chitosan beads are much harder and contain less water than those without montmorillonite the highest w value is observed for cs beads 62 5 while it decreases for csfe beads 57 4 and composite cs mt 50 3 55 1 and csfe mt 43 0 48 6 beads the reduction of water content again results from clay mineral addition and it is consistent with literature reports 20 the reduced ability to swell should improve the stability of the adsorbent in aqueous solutions and thus increase its usefulness after subsequent desorption adsorption cycles the composite chitosan beads include pure mt the clay mineral functionalized with octadecylamine r1 and the one with both octadecylamine and aminopropyltriethoxysilane r1r2 the ftir spectra of mt mt r1 and mt r1r2 are given in fig 2a the infrared spectrum of mt shows peaks at 3628 and 3443 cm 1 assigned to the oh stretching vibrations interlayer and intralayer water molecules the peak at 1643 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibrations of water molecules the band observed at 1033 cm 1 comes from sio stretching while the ones at 913 and 626 cm 1 are from alo stretching vibrations the signals at 841 and 797 cm 1 could be represented by al mg oh vibrations while those at 521 and 460 cm 1 come from the bending vibrations of alosi and siosi respectively 18 the infrared spectra of organically modified montmorillonite mt r1 and mt r1r2 are very similar they contain additional bands at 3251 and 3187 cm 1 attributed to nh2 stretching vibrations at 2926 and 2850 cm 1 and 1490 and 1470 cm 1 caused by the ch stretching and bending vibrations in the alkyl chain respectively the ftir spectra of cs csfe and cs csfe mt beads are shown in fig 2b several peaks represent the functional groups of chitosan cs beads at 3424 overlapping of oh and nh stretching 2920 and 2853 ch symmetric and asymmetric stretching 1637 co stretching of amide i residual n acetyl groups 1384 cn stretching of amide iii 1153 asymmetric stretching of coc bridge 1056 co stretching and 891 cm 1 ch bending the spectrum of csfe beads shows the same characteristic peaks however the intensities of bands observed at 1056 and 891 cm 1 increase due to additional fe oh stretching and bending vibrations in the same region 32 after incorporating montmorillonite into chitosan cs mt beads mt presence is manifested by the signals at 526 and 463 cm 1 and a very sharp peak with significantly increased intensity at 1036 cm 1 again the presence of fe oh vibrations increases the intensity of the signals in csfe mt beads compared to that of cs mt beads additionally the peaks characteristic of r1 and r2 substituents are difficult to be identified by ir spectra of the composite beads studied due to their overlapping with chitosan signals the crystalline structures of mt mt r1 and mt r1r2 fig 3a and different chitosan beads studied fig 3b were detected by xrd characterization the xrd pattern of montmorillonite is confirmed by reflections at 2 theta 7 1 19 7 26 5 28 5 35 2 40 2 53 9 61 9 joint committee for powder diffraction studies jcpds no 13 0135 34 35 organic modification of mt surfaces leads to a shift in mt reflection from 7 1 to below 5 which could be attributed to the interactions between organic units with amine functional groups and clay surface pure chitosan cs beads show two broad reflections at 10 4 and 20 3 attributed to the hydrogen bonds between amino and hydroxyl groups 30 however after the dissolution of chitosan in fecl3 the chelate is formed between iron iii ions and nh2 groups in cs resulting in the disappearance of cs characteristic reflections additional signals of small intensity observed at 35 5 and 61 6 confirm the amorphous nature of fe oh 3 particles present in chitosan 32 the composite chitosan beads show very similar xrd patterns regardless of the presence of organic substituents after cs dissolution in acetic acid the presence of mt is manifested by similar reflections at 19 7 26 5 35 2 53 9 and 61 9 however the reflection around 7 for mt and below 5 for mt r1 mt r1r2 is shifted towards higher theta values as shown in fig 3b it is observed at 5 9 for cs mt r1r2 the peak intensity of mt in composite chitosan beads decreases significantly after dissolution in fecl3 however the presence of mt is confirmed by the peaks at 6 9 and 19 7 on the other hand the reflections at 35 5 and 61 6 probably originate from amorphous iron iii hydroxide particles further investigation of the materials studied was carried out using nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms fig 4 shows isotherms obtained for chitosan beads without cs and csfe and with mt cs mt and csfe mt and the pore size distribution for those materials pure chitosan beads are characterized by type iv isotherm typical of many mesoporous adsorbents with h4 hysteresis loop often associated with narrow slip like pores 36 these findings are consistent with some literature reports 20 on the other hand the composite beads demonstrate type iii isotherm and h3 hysteresis loop this less common type indicates an essential role of interactions between adsorbate molecules moreover increased adsorbate concentration favours adsorption the h3 loop is observed with aggregates of plate like particles and layered structure materials 28 the analogous isotherms were obtained for the materials containing organic units at mt surfaces r1 and r1r2 as shown in table 1 the chitosan beads studied differ in surface area pore volume and average pore diameter the specific bet surface area s bet of cs beads was 8 77 m2 g 1 according to the literature reports s bet values for chitosan were very varied and data reported included even very low values 2 11 28 or 3 82 m2 g 1 20 however chitosan beads obtained by yang et al 31 demonstrated a similar specific surface area 10 70 m2 g 1 after chitosan dissolving in fecl3 the s bet value for csfe beads increases to 16 44 m2 g 1 due to iron iii hydroxide presence 32 the addition of montmorillonite results in a further increase of specific surface area according to the literature reports mt surface area exceeds 200 m2 g 1 28 thus it can affect the improvement of chitosan bead parameters s bet values are 22 30 and 26 52 m2 g 1 for cs mt and csfe mt beads respectively consistent with data analysis for similar systems 18 20 28 on the other hand the organic functionalization of mt has a different effect depending on the adsorbent type cs mt r1 and cs mt r1r2 beads have slightly higher surface area than cs mt while for their equivalents obtained with iron iii chloride decrease in s bet values is observed iron iii ions probably also interact with amino groups present in organic substituents which may reduce the surface area of the materials the total pore volume of cs beads was only 0 014 cm3 g 1 and it was much lower than the values obtained for csfe 0 038 cm3 g 1 cs mt 0 047 cm3 g 1 and csfe mt beads 0 041 cm3 g 1 it suggests that both iron iii hydroxide and clay mineral could improve the adsorption properties of the material as the surface is enlarged and access into its pores should be facilitated 28 32 however the presence of organic units results in a decrease in pore volume the organic substituents probably partially block the pores contributing to the reduction in porosity additionally the differences in average pore diameter were also observed however the average value does not reflect the actual size of the pores the inset in fig 4 shows that all the adsorbents are characterized by heterogeneous pore volume distribution and peaks of different intensities can be distinguished the mt incorporation into chitosan results in a reduction of average pore diameter despite a few pore populations it can be seen that pores with a size in the range of 2 5 nm dominate which results in a lower average value moreover the pore sizes for the adsorbents studied correspond to mesoporous materials the dried chitosan beads were also characterized by sem analysis fig 5 shows the internal and external structure of cs csfe cs mt and csfe mt beads pure chitosan beads have a relatively smooth fig 5a outer surface 15 while for other adsorbents it is much rougher fig 5c e g the inner surface of csfe shows uniform distribution of iron iii hydroxide in chitosan beads fig 5d while mt tends to agglomerate inside hydrogel beads fig 5f h the formation of the chitosan beads studied was also confirmed by eds analysis cs beads are characterized by the presence of carbon 67 and oxygen 25 the incorporation of fe oh 3 is manifested by additional peaks from iron 6 5 in csfe beads however the most significant variation in the amount and quality of elements appears for composite chitosan beads the cs mt beads contain peaks typical of the clay mineral 35 si 21 3 al 7 6 fe 1 6 and some trace elements ca na mg and those from chitosan c 15 and o 49 3 the oxygen content is much higher because it is present in chitosan and montmorillonite the csfe mt beads contain slightly modified elemental composition because iron content increases to 8 2 3 2 analysis of adsorbent dose and solution ph the adsorbent dosage and ph value are important factors affecting the adsorption ability of the materials thus these parameters were optimized at the beginning of batch adsorption studies the amount of mg adsorbed q e was analyzed by adding 5 50 mg of the chitosan beads into 500 mg l 1 mg solution fig 6a when the amount of the adsorbents studied increases the q e reduces the tendency is observed for all the chitosan beads thus the most effective adsorbent cs mt r1r2 is characterized by 303 21 mg g 1 adsorption capacity for a 5 mg adsorbent dose and it drops to only 102 64 mg g 1 for 50 mg interestingly the higher the adsorbent dose was the more minor differences in adsorption capacities of composite chitosan beads were observed it indicates that higher adsorption capacity is obtained for smaller doses on the other hand the percentage removal of methyl green increased with increasing dose data not shown however the difference was not significant i e doubling the weight resulted in only a few per cent increase in the value of percentage removal it probably results from the chitosan beads aggregation which reduces the surface area of the adsorbents available to the dye molecules a similar tendency was observed for other adsorbents used for dye removal 29 37 38 the research studies of doses lower than 5 mg did not give unequivocal results as they were already burdened with a much larger measurement error therefore it was difficult to determine whether such small doses contributed to a further increase in the adsorption capacity of the materials studied finally a dose of 5 mg was chosen as the optimal value for further studies the influence of ph was analyzed only in the range 4 8 fig 6b it results from the effect of ph on the uv vis spectrum of methyl green mg represents a group of cationic triphenylmethane dyes its structure is strongly dependent on ph values the most intensive band is slightly reduced in an acidic environment ph 2 because the molecules are protonated mg in contrast in a basic solution ph 10 complete decolourization occurs because molecules are converted into colourless carbinol mg oh 39 40 as shown in fig 6b solution ph significantly influences the adsorption abilities of the chitosan beads the adsorption capacities of all adsorbents studied increase in the ph range from 4 to 6 while for ph 6 and 7 the amount of mg adsorbed for each material is quite similar however the chitosan beads obtained in iron iii chloride have higher adsorption capacities at ph 7 0 while those dissolved in acetic acid at ph 6 0 finally the adsorption capacities decrease slightly in an alkaline environment ph 8 according to the literature pure chitosan with nh2 functional groups is protonated at ph 6 and experiences repulsive electrostatic interactions with positively charged dye molecules in an acidic solution 29 however as the solution ph increases the adsorbent surface is deprotonated promoting dye adsorption this tendency can explain the results obtained for pure chitosan beads because the adsorbent showed the highest adsorption capacity at ph 7 0 the presence of mt in chitosan beads has no significant effect on the observed dependence between ph and adsorption capacity according to the literature reports 28 cs mt composite surface could be positively charged at ph 10 08 thus electrostatic interactions cannot be involved in the adsorption process of a cationic dye in the whole ph range studied it suggests that the adsorption occurs primarily due to hydrogen bonding but some other interactions can be present ion exchange van der waals interactions additionally adsorbate particles can participate in multilayer formation on the adsorbent surfaces due to π π bonds between the dye molecules however electrostatic attractions between the adsorbents studied and mg should not be excluded as there are many materials based on chitosan and montmorillonite characterized by lower ph point of zero charges phpzc 3 7 25 5 0 19 6 24 21 6 3 20 moreover csfe beads and the composite beads prepared in the presence of fecl3 show a similar tendency but the increase in the adsorption capacity is kept to neutral ph the literature reports demonstrate that the surface of pure csfe beads is positively charged at solution ph 8 4 31 additionally contrary to the assumptions that the increase in adsorption capacity should also be maintained at ph 8 a slight decrease is observed a partial mg discolouration could explain this and the uv vis spectrum in this range does not reflect the actual amount adsorbed on the chitosan beads the observed relationships at different phs on the adsorption efficiency can be better interpreted by determining the ph of the zero charge point phpzc for the adsorbents studied table 2 in general at ph phpzc the material surface is positively charged while for ph phpzc negatively charged pure chitosan beads have phpzc 6 2 similar to those obtained in other studies 41 therefore electrostatic repulsion dominates between the cationic dye and the amine groups in chitosan at low ph according to the literature data at ph 4 5 99 of chitosan is protonated 42 with increasing ph the strength of these unfavourable interactions decreases the presence of mt decreases the value of phpzc 5 73 which was also observed for other adsorbing systems 25 the organic units at the montmorillonite surface cause an increase in the value of the ph point zero charges which results from the presence of amino groups in the r1 and r2 pendant arms the corresponding materials obtained in fecl3 demonstrate higher phpzc values 32 which explains better adsorption abilities in ph 7 0 than those for ph 6 0 thus the dominant interactions between the adsorbents studied and mg vary depending on the ph value still once the phpzc is exceeded electrostatic attraction is probably the most important one finally as the adsorption capacities for ph 6 and 7 were comparable and the most effective adsorbents studied demonstrated the highest values for ph 6 weakly acidic solutions were used for further measurements 3 3 effect of methyl green initial concentration and adsorption isotherms the effect of mg initial concentration is another crucial parameter affecting the adsorption capacity the increase of the initial dye concentration in the range of 50 500 mg l 1 results in an increased value of adsorption capacity q for all the chitosan beads studied fig 7a the maximum adsorption capacity for pure cs beads is only 41 90 mg g 1 in comparison it increases to 126 04 mg g 1 for csfe beads demonstrating the beneficial effect of chitosan dissolution in iron iii oxide and modification in the biopolymer structure this difference can be explained by the very small surface area of pure chitosan and thus the limited availability for the dye molecules 43 the presence of iron iii hydroxide in csfe beads increases significantly specific surface area and pore volume thus adsorption capacity is about three times higher under optimal conditions 5 mg of adsorbent ph 6 0 mg 500 mg l 1 on the other hand the point of zero charge phpzc is also higher which lowers the adsorption capacity of cationic molecules the incorporation of montmorillonite increases the adsorption abilities of the chitosan beads and it exceeds 250 mg g 1 for both cs mt and csfe mt it is worth noting that the obtained values are much higher than those obtained for many other chitosan montmorillonite based materials dedicated to the adsorption of cationic dyes 21 27 the organic units characterized by long alkyl chains and amine functional groups produce two opposite effects depending on the solvent used to prepare the chitosan beads the materials prepared in acetic acid have a greater adsorption efficiency than the system with unmodified aluminosilicate although the organic substituents occupy part of the mt surface and reduce its availability for the dye they also participate in mg binding which results in a higher q e value on the other hand the adsorption capacities of the adsorbents csfe mt r1 and csfe mt r1r2 are reduced compared to csfe mt beads it could result from competitive interactions between amino groups in substituents and iron iii ions it lowers the adsorbent surface area and prevents organic units from participating in the binding of dye molecules finally the maximum adsorption capacity for cs beads was achieved for cs mt r1r2 and it amounted to 303 21 mg g 1 in contrast csfe mt demonstrated the most effective adsorption properties manifested in 272 55 mg g 1 adsorption capacity value in the group of csfe beads the optimal mg concentration was 500 mg g 1 further analysis of the adsorption data for a range of initial concentrations was carried out using three linear adsorption isotherm models langmuir freundlich and temkin the langmuir model assumes monolayer formation at specific homogeneous sites within the adsorbent 44 while the freundlich model refers to heterogeneity of adsorption sites and multilayer adsorption 45 finally the temkin model considers indirect interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate molecules it assumes a linear decrease of adsorption heat as surface coverage increases 46 the parameters related to isotherm models are collected in table 3 while the linear forms of equations and isotherm plots are presented in supporting information the highest correlation coefficients r 2 for chitosan beads without clay mineral cs and csfe were obtained for the langmuir model it can be interpreted as monolayer adsorption of methyl green on homogenous binding sites on chitosan surfaces on the other hand the correlation coefficients for composite chitosan beads are slightly higher for the freundlich model than for the langmuir ones the literature reports show that chitosan clay mineral beads used for cationic dye adsorption could be characterized by high and very similar correlation coefficients for langmuir and freundlich models 15 in the present studies the values of r 2 are comparable for both models and similar correlation coefficients for temkin one also characterize some adsorbents the differences were particularly insignificant for csfe mt r1 and csfe mt r1r2 therefore it is difficult to determine the best fit isotherm model unambiguously more detailed statistical analysis based on the determination of root mean square error rmse and chi square χ2 values table s1 in supp inf allowed to decide which of the models best described the adsorption of mg on the materials studied the lowest values of rmse and χ2 were obtained for the freundlich isotherm thus this model provides the best fit for the experimental data therefore the materials with montmorillonite demonstrate multilayer adsorption of methyl green on heterogeneous adsorption sites this mechanism of the adsorption process results from the presence of two different factors cs and mt in the beads studied responsible for the mg adsorption additionally according to 1 n values lower than 1 obtained from the freundlich model the adsorption process was favourable for all the adsorbents studied the maximum adsorption capacities q m calculated from the langmuir model are in the range of 48 80 cs 396 19 cs mt r1r2 mg g 1 according to the literature reports the maximum adsorption capacity of mg could have an extensive range of values table 4 mesoporous silica mcm 41 or graphene demonstrated low adsorption capacity values below 30 mg g 1 47 49 the application of different aluminosilicate clay minerals resulted in more efficient removal of methyl green from aqueous solutions manifested by 65 353 mg of mg adsorbed per unit mass of the particular adsorbent 50 52 moreover the composite alginate beads with dendrimer functionalized halloysite were characterized by an adsorption capacity of 113 mg g 1 14 therefore the results obtained for the composite montmorillonite chitosan beads are very promising and prove their high efficiency compared to the systems previously described additionally the composite beads can be also competitive with other chitosan based adsorbents dedicated to cationic dyes although many literature reports present different chitosan adsorbents their efficiency is highly diverse many materials are characterized by adsorption capacity below 100 mg g 1 53 55 which is even lower than that obtained for csfe beads the other exemplary adsorbents used for cationic dyes also have lower q e values like magnetic xanthate modified chitosan 197 8 mg g 1 56 activated oil palm ash zeolite chitosan 199 20 mg g 1 57 or chitosan cross linked 3d network 115 60 mg g 1 58 more effective materials are also described in the literature as a combination of nanocrystalline cellulose with modified chitosan 785 mg g 1 59 or magnetic chitosan functionalized with edta 459 9 mg g 1 60 additionally the results obtained for a similar system but requiring exfoliated montmorillonite nanosheets 61 applied to adsorption of other cationic dye at room temperature were only slightly higher than that obtained for cs mt r1r2 despite the more complicated procedure for the adsorbent preparation the composite materials presented in the current studies are less sophisticated thus generating lower production costs and at the same time they have sufficiently high values of adsorption capacities 3 4 analysis of adsorption kinetics the influence of contact time was carried out for 24 h using an mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 fig 7b the dye removal from the aqueous solution was much faster during the first 12 h while it dropped in the following hours until it reached equilibrium no increase in adsorption capacity was observed during the longer duration of the process the amount of mg adsorbed at specific time intervals q t of all chitosan beads was higher than that of pure cs beads the number of active sites available for mg molecules is the highest at the beginning and it gradually decreases as the adsorption process proceeds mt significantly increases the number of active sites thus cs beads are fully occupied much faster and their adsorption rate slows down after 6 h while the other adsorbents demonstrate much faster adsorption rates additionally iron iii oxide also has a beneficial effect on increasing the number of active sites available for the dye that confirms higher q t values for csfe beads than those for pure cs ones however their adsorption rate also slows down much faster than composite chitosan beads the experimental data were further used for mathematical models to determine the rate controlling step and the mechanism of methyl green adsorption on the chitosan beads surfaces two kinetic models the pseudo first and pseudo second order and the intraparticle model for adsorption mechanism analysis were applied the parameters related to kinetic models are collected in table 5 while the appropriate equations and kinetic plots are presented in supporting information the correlation coefficient r 2 values of the pseudo second order model 0 946 0 995 were higher for individual chitosan beads studied than those of the pseudo first order model 0 857 0 950 15 27 these observations were confirmed by statistical analysis for the pseudo second order model the rmse and χ2 values are lower than those obtained for the pseudo first order one table s2 supp inf in addition the adsorption capacity values obtained for the pseudo second order model are much closer to the experimental values than those for the pseudo first order model therefore the adsorption process in the present study involves strong interactions between adsorbent and methyl green molecules this observation is in agreement with other adsorbents based on chitosan and montmorillonite applied for dye removal 25 28 29 the pure chitosan beads have the lowest value of the rate constant of the pseudo second order model k2 it increases significantly in the presence of fe iii ions csfe and montmorillonite cs mt csfe mt however the effect of organic units r1 r2 is different for the adsorbent obtained in various dissolution media the k2 values for the composite cs beads with organic functional groups at mt surfaces are higher than cs mt while for csfe beads the r1r2 substituents generate a decrease of k2 moreover the intraparticle diffusion model data analysis indicates that diffusion plays an important role in limiting the adsorption rate an excellent correlation is observed for different chitosan beads dissolved in acetic acid r 2 0 96 0 99 while for those dissolved in iron iii chloride is slightly lower 0 86 0 95 it suggests that methyl green adsorption onto different cs beads is adequately described by pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models while mg adsorption onto different csfe beads is by only the pseudo second order model as the slope did not pass the origin for all the adsorbents studied the adsorption process is not only controlled by intra particle diffusion 39 additionally higher boundary layer thickness c was observed for all csfe beads suggesting an increase in the boundary layer effect after chitosan dissolution in fecl3 on the other hand mt s presence increased the intra particle diffusion k id constants while no significant impact on boundary layer thickness was observed 3 5 thermodynamic parameters the thermodynamic studies provide essential information about the nature and spontaneity of the adsorption process the effect of temperature was analyzed at 298 308 and 318 k thermodynamics parameters including the gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs were measured to analyze the effect of increased temperature of solutions on methyl green adsorption the values listed in table 6 were calculated using the following mathematical expressions 6 k c c a c e 7 g rt ln k c h t s 8 ln k c g rt h rt s r where k c is the equilibrium constant resulting from the ratio of mg adsorbed on the different chitosan beads surfaces c a to the equilibrium mg concentration in solution c e the negative values of δg reflect the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process in the case of pure chitosan beads it increased for higher temperatures thus increasing the temperature did not promote adsorption on the other hand all other beads demonstrate the opposite trend indicating that adsorption is more favourable at higher temperatures the positive values of enthalpy change δh indicate the endothermic nature of adsorption while the positive values of entropy change δs increased disorderness at the chitosan beads surfaces during mg adsorption in the adsorbent active sites 32 39 62 3 6 mechanism of adsorption the adsorbents studied after methyl green adsorption were analyzed by ftir spectroscopy to understand their interactions with dye molecules fig 8 the spectrum of mg shows peaks at 3435 nh 2916 and 2853 ch 1617 and 1588 cc cn in heterocycle 1480 cn cc 1365 ch3 1223 1170 and 1119 heterocyclic skeleton cm 1 27 38 39 the spectra of the chitosan beads studied loaded with mg have some peaks shifted to different frequencies or increased intensity confirming adsorbent adsorbate interactions the bands at 1637 cm 1 in the chitosan beads and 1588 cm 1 assigned to vibrations of heterocycle in mg are shifted suggesting the presence of π π interactions 20 however the adsorbents prepared in acetic acid experience a shift towards higher frequencies cs 1640 cm 1 cs mt 1644 cm 1 and cs mt r1r2 1655 cm 1 while those in fecl3 towards lower frequencies csfe 1632 cm 1 csfe mt 1630 cm 1 and csfe mt r1r2 1635 cm 1 it might suggest that the importance of this type of interaction varies depending on the type of adsorbent and this may be one of the reasons for the lower efficiency of csfe mt r1r2 compared to cs mt r1r2 beads moreover the band at 1384 cm 1 cn stretching in the adsorbents and 1365 cm 1 in mg bending vibrations of ch3 groups interfered and shifted it might be the effect of hydrogen bonding between hydrogen in mg and nitrogen on the chitosan bead surface 20 additionally the signal intensity enhancement at around 1030 1050 cm 1 is observed after mg adsorption it could result from interactions between sio feo and co in different chitosan beads and heterocyclic skeleton of methyl green the presence of non specific interactions may explain the ability of the materials studied to mg adsorption at conditions below the phpzc finally several different interactions could be responsible for the effective adsorption of mg the highest adsorption capacity was obtained after exceeding the ph zero charge point therefore the main adsorption force is the electrostatic attraction between a cationic dye and the adsorbents negatively charged surfaces however hydrogen bonding and π π interactions might also play an essential role 63 3 7 analysis of real water samples the adsorption capacity of the chitosan beads was also studied for real water samples tap water and lake water the results obtained for the sample in demineralized water were used as a reference for comparison table 7 includes adsorption capacity values for three water samples obtained after the adsorption process at ph 6 0 for 24 h using an initial mg concentration of 100 mg l 1 the results expressed that the composition of tap water did not significantly impact the efficiency of the adsorbents as the obtained adsorption capacities were comparable to those for the reference samples a more complex lake water sample generated some decrease in the adsorption properties of all chitosan beads however most chitosan beads demonstrate only a slight reduction in adsorption capacity values thus they retain very good adsorption properties towards methyl green on the other hand pure chitosan beads experience a substantial almost two fold decrease in their effectiveness it is probably due to their much shorter persistence in a complex environment thus their low stability under natural conditions in which contaminants may occur eliminates them as a material with practical application 3 8 desorption and reusability studies the application of any adsorbent for large scale treatment requires economic consideration therefore the materials were regenerated and reused in 5 adsorption desorption cycles the desorbing agent 1 0 m hcl solution is strongly acidic under such ph conditions electrostatic repulsion dominates between the net positive charge on the adsorbent surfaces and the protonated mg molecules which promotes desorption the adsorption capacities obtained in the following cycles were compared to the initial ones all the chitosan beads studied demonstrated high removal efficiencies up to the fourth cycle above 80 of the original value fig 9 pure cs beads show the lowest stability in the subsequent desorption adsorption cycles after one cycle its efficiency dropped below 90 proving the lowest resistance of this adsorbent to the applied conditions the presence of iron csfe significantly increases the material s durability while the aluminosilicate has the most beneficial effect on the material stability in the subsequent few cycles however in the fifth cycle the efficiency of all the adsorbents decreased significantly 45 60 which indicates gradual exhaustion of the adsorbents studied 4 conclusions the current study demonstrates the fabrication and characterization of several chitosan beads with incorporated montmorillonite with without organic functional units applied for methyl green adsorption from an aqueous solution under different conditions the results showed that after optimization of several parameters 5 mg of adsorbent dose 500 mg g 1 of mg ph 6 0 adsorption time 24 h two factors influenced the adsorption abilities of chitosan beads significantly the presence of montmorillonite and chitosan dissolution in iron iii chloride on the other hand the organic units at the montmorillonite surface had a beneficial effect on the materials dissolved in acetic acid in contrast for the ones obtained in the presence of iron iii chloride the clay mineral s organic modification resulted in reduced adsorption ability regardless of the differences between the individual materials they all showed a significantly greater ability to remove mg from aqueous solutions than pure chitosan beads the maximum adsorption capacity of 303 21 mg g 1 was obtained for cs mt r1r1 beads the experimental data correlated well with the langmuir isotherm model for chitosan beads without clay minerals and the freundlich isotherm model for all other composite beads the pseudo second order kinetic model was most suitable for all the materials studied the values of thermodynamic parameters evidenced the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption process the composite chitosan beads were also effective mg adsorbents in real water samples the materials studied demonstrated high adsorption capacity after four times usage confirming their reusability very promising results encourage further research on composite chitosan beads for their use as potential adsorbents of other pollutants in an aqueous environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare

electrospinning nanofibers filtration microbially contaminated water 1 introduction industrialization in any society is a major initiator of development and urbanization although the merits of industrialization are innumerable it has been identified as a major threat to the environment since it releases various toxic chemicals gases solid wastes as well as microbes of various kinds into our surrounding environment land air and water particular interest is water pollution which has become a global challenge developing nations being highly affected due to their drive for development pollutant effects may vary depending on their types and sources for instance while heavy metals dyes and some other organic pollutants have been identified as carcinogens hormones pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and personal care product wastes are known as endocrine disrupting chemicals these pollutants which enter the water through various channels but are predominantly anthropogenic have become a great concern to environmentalists due to various hazards posed to the environment 1 3 water shortage the dramatic increase in water demands and environmental pollutions are human s concerns in today s world consequently water purification has become a necessity and a cost effective factor that s the reason it was decided to study water filtration at a pilot scale to approach an industrial scale to help solve the concerns due to the lack of clean water in the world which will be more crucial in the future microfiltration mf 4 and ultrafiltration uf membrane technologies are increasingly popular alternatives 5 to conventional treatment water and are typically employed to remove particles from water mf and uf are used to remove turbidity pathogens and particles from freshwaters nanofiltration nf is used to soften freshwaters and remove disinfection reverse osmosis ro and electrodialysis ed are typically employed to remove dissolved substances from water 6 7 nanofiber

versatility cleanliness and dimensional stability 24 quaternary ammonium compounds qacs are antibacterial agents used as both skin antiseptics and disinfectants they generally contain a positively charged hydrophilic ammonium group and a long hydrophobic alkyl chain it is believed that qacs kill bacteria by disrupting cell walls and or inner bilipid membranes causing the cytoplasmic membrane contents of the cell to leak out 26 29 the aim of this study was to prepare a continuous pilot scale water filtration system using polyacrylonitrile and polystyrene nanofibrous filters by utilizing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab as an antiseptic agent it was attempted to develop a continuous system with an almost simple design that could accommodate all the requirements of microbial microfiltration tests this system could purify and filter 150 l of water in an hour continuously to the best of our knowledge in the other studies the performance of the filters was measured by a batch microfiltration system with low water capacity which is far from the real conditions of the industries this is the first report of a continuous pilot scale system evaluation of nanofiber filters 2 experimental 2 1 material commercial polyacrylonitrile pan was purchased from gaed basir co iran polystyrene ps was provided by tabriz petrochemical n n dimethyl acetamide dma dimethylformamide dmf and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab were supplied from merck germany nutrient agar na tryptic soy agar tsa tryptic soy broth tsb and macconkey agar were obtained from merck germany violet red bile agar vrba was purchased from the qlab company and percidine was provided by the behban chemistry company nonwoven polyester was obtained from bafco 2 2 preparation of electrospun nanofibrous membranes pan solutions of 15 wt were prepared by dissolving polymer powder in dmf and stirring the solutions at 70 c for 4 h until the solutions were homogeneous ctab was directly added to the solutions and stirred for another 5 h in order to make 15 wt pan solutions containing 2 5 5 and 7 wt of ctab 18 wt ps solutions were made by dissolving ps in dma and stirring the solutions at 70 c for 3 h until forming clear solutions then different amounts of ctab were added to the ps solutions to prepare 2 5 and 5 wt ctab ps solutions the solution of ps containing 7 wt of ctab was prepared but it has not been spinning properly and it was not possible to make a filter from it due to its electrospinning difficulties in table 1 the solution samples were encoded by pdc in these code letters p and c indicate polymers and ctab respectively and d is a digit that denotes the amount of ctab in the nanofiber s samples for example the sample code pan2 5c is used to express a solution sample consisting of 15 wt pan in which the ctab content is 2 5 wt based on dry pan the solutions were electrospun directly onto the polyester nonwoven substrate using an electrospinning instrument consisting of a metallic spinneret a syringe pump sp100hsm fnm iran and a high voltage power supply gamma es60p 5w usa and a cylindrical rotating collector all samples were electrospun with a solution flow rate of 0 1 ml h having the tip to collector distance of 18 cm and a voltage of 18 kv 2 3 filters sterilization bacterial inoculum was prepared in tsa medium ph 7 3 tsa containing electrospun pan mats were placed at the bottom of the petri dish and incubated for 72 h to assure the microbial culture test results several samples of nanofibers were cultured on plates pan filters were sterilized in the oven at 140 c for 4 h the tests for polystyrene were performed without filter sterilization due to the high sensitivity of the polystyrene nanofibers and their temperature limitation 2 4 microfiltration performance as shown in fig 1 a pilot scale continuous microfiltration system was made of various components feed tank outlet tank pump flow meter differential pressure gauge filter holder hoses and interface valves 13 diaphragm booster pump model cs 0590k 1 with a maximum pressure of 120 psi and maximum flow rate of 3600 ml min was used glass tube variable area flowmeter with an accuracy of 2 fs was made by azmoon motamam company to be resistant to acid for system washing a differential pressure gauge model l5gasngv0d with the range of 0 30 psi was obtained from the indomart company of canada its design is based on an industrial pilot plant for petroleum effluent treatment to check the pressure difference before and after the filter a pressure gauge was installed in the system all components of this system are designed and selected to be acidic detergent resistant it should be noted that circular flat filters with an effective area of 0 000785 m2 were used and the water permeation flux was kept at 19108 3 kg m2h 2 5 sterilization of continuous microfiltration system to make sure that the system is sterile before the main test with contaminated water diluted detergent percidine was used at the ratio of 1 500 after the system was washed with percidine distilled water was passed through it four times to ensure that system is free of percidine all the parts of the system were put in the autoclave after washing with percidine and distilled water the filter holder along with the filter was transmitted into the sterilized laminar hood to be installed under sterile conditions 2 6 characterization of nanofibrous membranes the morphologies of electrospun pan media filters containing different percentages of ctab were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem seron technology ais2100 the fibers diameter and porosity of the membranes were measured by digimizer software fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy thermo nicolet nexus 870 ftir was conducted to identify the chemical interactions occurring inside the ctab pan membranes and the chemical compositional homogeneity of the samples 2 7 antibacterial assessment to examine the antibacterial properties of electrospun membranes escherichia coli atcc 25922 was cultured in nutrient agar na medium at 37 c for 18 to 20 h in an incubator the microbial suspension was prepared and added to 1 5 l of distilled water and stirred to obtain a uniform solution 1 5 l of contaminant water was prepared by the 0 5 mcfarland standard method od of 0 080 13 at 600 nm which corresponds to a bacterial concentration of 1 5 105 colony forming units cfu ml an assuring microbial test was also conducted on the ps filters tests which were not sterilized apart from the macconkey agar medium the microbial tests were also conducted on the vrba medium which is the special media for coliform bacteria all the samples were counted by a colony counter device the log reduction in bacterial colonies was measured using the following equation 1 l log a log b where a and b donate the bacterial colonies in samples before and after filtration respectively and for calculating filter performance p the following equation is used 2 p 1 10 l 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 pan morphology the morphology of pan membranes is illustrated in fig 2 fabricated pure pan nanofibers exhibit a randomly oriented ultrafine and well uniformed structure the structural integrity of pan nanofibers is well maintained with the addition of different amounts of ctab fig 2 demonstrates that pan5c nanofibers c are not as straight as pan2 5c nanofibers b and there is also a little bending in fibers ctab is a small molecule when it is placed between the polymer chains which are properly electrospun straight it may cause molecular slippage and chains entanglement relaxation this leads to the possibility of diameter fluctuation or bending in the fibers also pan7c indicates straight fibers with no beads but little bending parts of the fibers can also be seen in the form of a net fortunately this is a positive factor in the filtration process it increases the particles tendency to adhere to the filter and consequently enhances the filter s efficiency one of the factors which make net formation in fibers is ambient moisture as shown in fig 3 under the specified electrospinning conditions the diameter of pure pan nanofibers 4 is highly populated within the range of 200 550 nm with an average diameter of 384 nm the addition of ctab to pan nanofibers tends to increase the fiber diameter for instance incorporation of 2 5 5 and 7 wt based on dry pan yields an average fiber diameter of 433 457 and 518 nm respectively the pan nanofibers porosity was measured in the range of 82 87 it is known that the properties of an electrospinning solution could be significantly affected by the addition of an anionic or cationic substance the introduction of positively charged ctab into the electrospinning solution would result in a decrease in the surface charge density of the spinning jet as a result an increase will occur in electrical conductivity and viscosity of the solution leading to the formation of fibers with larger diameters table 2 as can be seen in table 3 adding 2 5 wt ctab increases the viscosity of the solution due to the interaction between nh4 groups of ctab and polar nitrile groups of polyacrylonitrile by increasing the amount of ctab to 7 wt the viscosity reduces at high percentages of ctab ctab forms a separate phase and becomes less soluble which causes viscosity to decrease 3 2 polystyrene morphology fig 4 indicates lots of beads in pure ps nanofibers owing to their low electrical conductivity see table 4 studies have shown that adding salt or increasing the concentration of the solution can make the fibers unite and reduce the beads since ctab as an antimicrobial agent is a salt it is expected to eliminate beads by adding it to the polymeric solution which can be seen clearly in images of ps2 sc and ps5c in fig 4 the average diameter of pure ps nanofibers was measured at 228 nm it is noteworthy that fibers with beads do not exhibit their exact diameter considering the volume accumulation in spindle beads by finding a few fibers with no beads the diameter was measured at about 200 300 nm by adding 2 5 wt ctab to the ps solution the electrical conductivity and viscosity decreased which caused the average diameter of nanofibers to increase to 234 nm table 4 and 5 the diameter of ps5c nanofibers was measured within the range of 200 nm to 400 nm with an average diameter of 263 nm the porosity of polystyrene nanofibers was measured in the range of 83 89 it should be noted that the oven sterilization method used for polyacrylonitrile nanofibers doesn t work properly for polystyrene nanofibers due to its temperature limitation therefore uv radiation and ozone gas were used for polystyrene sterilization fig 5 because of the high sensitivity of the polystyrene nanofibers uv rays made the fibers fragile and when the filter was applied to the microfiltration system the nanofibers were torn and their morphology changed exactly the same fragility was observed by ozone gas therefore the tests for polystyrene polymer were performed without filter sterilization and as expected did not impair the final results and did not affect the filter performance 3 3 fourier transform infrared ftir analysis fig 6 shows the ftir spectra of pure pan and electrospun pan membranes containing different concentrations of ctab as shown in fig 6a ftir spectra of pure pan 29 show visible peaks of cn at 2245 73 cm 1 and ch at 721 37 cm 1 the peak appearing at 1670 86 cm 1 is assigned to co and the peak present at 1091 24 cm 1 is assigned to cn which is related to dmf solvent in fig 6b and d absorption bands within the range of 2354 2357 cm 1 are ascribed to ammonium salts which indicates the presence of ctab in pan solution fig 7 illustrates the ftir analysis of ctab ps membranes present peaks at 1457 99 cm 1 and 722 44 cm 1 are referred to as ccc benzene and ch alkane respectively co stretching 1723 13 cm 1 and cn stretching 1096 86 cm 1 are related to dma solvent in fig 7b by adding 2 5 wt of ctab to the ps solution a peak at 2354 cm 1 appears the peak shifted to 2357 cm 1 by increasing the amount of ctab to 5 3 4 presence of ctab in nanofibers nanofibers containing ctab were boiled in water for 90 min in order to check ctab solubility in boiling water after drying the nanofibers in the oven nanofibers were examined by sem if ctab is in a separate phase in the fibers holes and grooves can be seen on the surface of the nanofibers fig 8 indicates that ctab is molecularly dissolved in the nanofibers and there is no sign of emulsion or separate phase formation and the surface of the fiber is completely free of holes and grooves 3 5 filters performance examination all seven prepared filters were tested in the continuous microbial microfiltration pilot system their performance was assessed by microbial tests on water samples collected before and after microbial filtration in order to increase the accuracy of the research the reported numbers are based on 3 repetitions of the microfiltration test for each filter as shown in table 6 rising ctab amount makes the operation of the filter improved hydrophobic properties of ps cause a significant enhancement in pure ps filter performance the highest percentage of performance is for pan2 5c filter and ps5c the number of microorganisms before and after the filtration was measured for all filters tables 7 and 8 the results show that there is a significant bacteria reduction for pure pan and pure ps samples after the filtration as the dimension of e coli bacteria is about 1 to 2 μm most of them and their larger colonies can eliminate by filters due to the physical filtration bacteria filtration occurs through mechanisms surface screening inertial impaction diffusion interception and electrostatic attraction 25 also it should be noted that due to the hydrophobic nature of polystyrene and e coli microorganisms the tendency of these microorganisms to the filter surface increases and this causes pure ps to have better performance than pure pan by adding and increasing the amount of ctab the final bacteria concentration decreased considerably in all samples ps5c and pan2 5c have the least number of microorganisms after the filtration also figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the effect of ctab in bacteria reduction for filters in microbial culture as it is obvious pan2 5c and ps5c have fewer colonies and the best performance 3 6 turbidity and electrical conductivity of water examination by comparing the sample results of turbidity and electrical conductivity in tables 9 12 no significant changes were observed in electrical conductivity before and after filtration this demonstrates that most of the microorganisms have passed through the filters while what actually was observed were microorganisms mass and intracellular material since microorganisms have a positive charge on the cell nucleus and a negative charge on the cell wall they cause electrical conduction the same thing can happen to the bodies of the microorganisms and their intracellular material which has passed the filters however these two tests are for knowing the characteristics of the samples before and after filtration and have no effect on the final microbial filtration efficiency of the filters 3 7 filters assessment after microbial microfiltration to determine the operation of the filters several filter samples were imaged by scanning electron microscopy after the microbial microfiltration process fig 11a and b illustrate microorganisms or their colony stuck on the nanofibrous filter samples which describe the physical performance of filters in fig 11c the dead cell bodies appearance indicates the antimicrobial effect of ctab along with the physical performance of filters it is noticeable in fig 11d that by adding more ctab to the solutions there is a sharp growth in the dead cell body of microorganisms stuck on the filters this depicts the proper functioning of the antimicrobial agent used in this research 4 conclusion electrospun nanofibrous membranes were successfully fabricated by polyacrylonitrile pan and polystyrene ps functionalized with ctab for the aim of water purification all the membranes were sterilized except polystyrene in order to evaluate the effect of ctab on the properties of electrospun membranes their morphology and filtration performance was characterized the average diameter of nanofibers was measured by imagej diameter of nanofibers enhanced owing to increasing the amount of ctab in polymeric solutions all the beads were removed from ps nanofibers by adding ctab because of its salt properties which affect increasing the conductivity of ps solution to assess the performance of the filters all of them were tested in a laboratory setup a pilot scale continuous microfiltration system the turbidity of water samples was measured before and after the filtration the results depict that by adding more ctab to polymeric solutions a significant improvement occurs in filters operation the highest percentages of filters performance were related to 5 wt ctab ps 98 75 and 2 5 wt ctab pan 94 75 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

percidine was used at the ratio of 1 500 after the system was washed with percidine distilled water was passed through it four times to ensure that system is free of percidine all the parts of the system were put in the autoclave after washing with percidine and distilled water the filter holder along with the filter was transmitted into the sterilized laminar hood to be installed under sterile conditions 2 6 characterization of nanofibrous membranes the morphologies of electrospun pan media filters containing different percentages of ctab were observed using a scanning electron microscope sem seron technology ais2100 the fibers diameter and porosity of the membranes were measured by digimizer software fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy thermo nicolet nexus 870 ftir was conducted to identify the chemical interactions occurring inside the ctab pan membranes and the chemical compositional homogeneity of the samples 2 7 antibacterial assessment to examine the antibacterial properties of electrospun membranes escherichia coli atcc 25922 was cultured in nutrient agar na medium at 37 c for 18 to 20 h in an incubator the microbial suspension was prepared and added to 1 5 l of distilled water and stirred to obtain a uniform solution 1 5 l of contaminant water was prepared by the 0 5 mcfarland standard method od of 0 080 13 at 600 nm which corresponds to a bacterial concentration of 1 5 105 colony forming units cfu ml an assuring microbial test was also conducted on the ps filters tests which were not sterilized apart from the macconkey agar medium the microbial tests were also conducted on the vrba medium which is the special media for coliform bacteria all the samples were counted by a colony counter device the log reduction in bacterial colonies was measured using the following equation 1 l log a log b where a and b donate the bacterial colonies in samples before and after filtration respectively and for calculating filter performance p the following equation is used 2 p 1 10 l 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 pan morphology the morphology of pan membranes is illustrated in fig 2 fabricated pure pan nanofibers exhibit a randomly oriented ultrafine and well uniformed structure the structural integrity of pan nanofibers is well maintained with the addition of different amounts of ctab fig 2 demonstrates that pan5c nanofibers c are not as straight as pan2 5c nanofibers b and there is also a little bending in fibers ctab is a small molecule when it is placed between the polymer chains which are properly electrospun straight it may cause molecular slippage and chains entanglement relaxation this leads to the possibility of diameter fluctuation or bending in the fibers also pan7c indicates straight fibers with no beads but little bending parts of the fibers can also be seen in the form of a net fortunately this is a positive factor in the filtration process it increases the particles tendency to adhere to the filter and consequently enhances the filter s efficiency one of the factors which make net formation in fibers is ambient moisture as shown in fig 3 under the specified electrospinning conditions the diameter of pure pan nanofibers 4 is highly populated within the range of 200 550 nm with an average diameter of 384 nm the addition of ctab to pan nanofibers tends to increase the fiber diameter for instance incorporation of 2 5 5 and 7 wt based on dry pan yields an average fiber diameter of 433 457 and 518 nm respectively the pan nanofibers porosity was measured in the range of 82 87 it is known that the properties of an electrospinning solution could be significantly affected by the addition of an anionic or cationic substance the introduction of positively charged ctab into the electrospinning solution would result in a decrease in the surface charge density of the spinning jet as a result an increase will occur in electrical conductivity and viscosity of the solution leading to the formation of fibers with larger diameters table 2 as can be seen in table 3 adding 2 5 wt ctab increases the viscosity of the solution due to the interaction between nh4 groups of ctab and polar nitrile groups of polyacrylonitrile by increasing the amount of ctab to 7 wt the viscosity reduces at high percentages of ctab ctab forms a separate phase and becomes less soluble which causes viscosity to decrease 3 2 polystyrene morphology fig 4 indicates lots of beads in pure ps nanofibers owing to their low electrical conductivity see table 4 studies have shown that adding salt or increasing the concentration of the solution can make the fibers unite and reduce the beads since ctab as an antimicrobial agent is a salt it is expected to eliminate beads by adding it to the polymeric solution which can be seen clearly in images of ps2 sc and ps5c in fig 4 the average diameter of pure ps nanofibers was measured at 228 nm it is noteworthy that fibers with beads do not exhibit their exact diameter considering the volume accumulation in spindle beads by finding a few fibers with no beads the diameter was measured at about 200 300 nm by adding 2 5 wt ctab to the ps solution the electrical conductivity and viscosity decreased which caused the average diameter of nanofibers to increase to 234 nm table 4 and 5 the diameter of ps5c nanofibers was measured within the range of 200 nm to 400 nm with an average diameter of 263 nm the porosity of polystyrene nanofibers was measured in the range of 83 89 it should be noted that the oven sterilization method used for polyacrylonitrile nanofibers doesn t work properly for polystyrene nanofibers due to its temperature limitation therefore uv radiation and ozone gas were used for polystyrene sterilization fig 5 because of the high sensitivity of the polystyrene nanofibers uv rays made the fibers fragile and when the filter was applied to the microfiltration system the nanofibers were torn and their morphology changed exactly the same fragility was observed by ozone gas therefore the tests for polystyrene polymer were performed without filter sterilization and as expected did not impair the final results and did not affect the filter performance 3 3 fourier transform infrared ftir analysis fig 6 shows the ftir spectra of pure pan and electrospun pan membranes containing different concentrations of ctab as shown in fig 6a ftir spectra of pure pan 29 show visible peaks of cn at 2245 73 cm 1 and ch at 721 37 cm 1 the peak appearing at 1670 86 cm 1 is assigned to co and the peak present at 1091 24 cm 1 is assigned to cn which is related to dmf solvent in fig 6b and d absorption bands within the range of 2354 2357 cm 1 are ascribed to ammonium salts which indicates the presence of ctab in pan solution fig 7 illustrates the ftir analysis of ctab ps membranes present peaks at 1457 99 cm 1 and 722 44 cm 1 are referred to as ccc benzene and ch alkane respectively co stretching 1723 13 cm 1 and cn stretching 1096 86 cm 1 are related to dma solvent in fig 7b by adding 2 5 wt of ctab to the ps solution a peak at 2354 cm 1 appears the peak shifted to 2357 cm 1 by increasing the amount of ctab to 5 3 4 presence of ctab in nanofibers nanofibers containing ctab were boiled in water for 90 min in order to check ctab solubility in boiling water after drying the nanofibers in the oven nanofibers were examined by sem if ctab is in a separate phase in the fibers holes and grooves can be seen on the surface of the nanofibers fig 8 indicates that ctab is molecularly dissolved in the nanofibers and there is no sign of emulsion or separate phase formation and the surface of the fiber is completely free of holes and grooves 3 5 filters performance examination all seven prepared filters were tested in the continuous microbial microfiltration pilot system their performance was assessed by microbial tests on water samples collected before and after microbial filtration in order to increase the accuracy of the research the reported numbers are based on 3 repetitions of the microfiltration test for each filter as shown in table 6 rising ctab amount makes the operation of the filter improved hydrophobic properties of ps cause a significant enhancement in pure ps filter performance the highest percentage of performance is for pan2 5c filter and ps5c the number of microorganisms before and after the filtration was measured for all filters tables 7 and 8 the results show that there is a significant bacteria reduction for pure pan and pure ps samples after the filtration as the dimension of e coli bacteria is about 1 to 2 μm most of them and their larger colonies can eliminate by filters due to the physical filtration bacteria filtration occurs through mechanisms surface screening inertial impaction diffusion interception and electrostatic attraction 25 also it should be noted that due to the hydrophobic nature of polystyrene and e coli microorganisms the tendency of these microorganisms to the filter surface increases and this causes pure ps to have better performance than pure pan by adding and increasing the amount of ctab the final bacteria concentration decreased considerably in all samples ps5c and pan2 5c have the least number of microorganisms after the filtration also figs 9 and 10 demonstrate the effect of ctab in bacteria reduction for filters in microbial culture as it is obvious pan2 5c and ps5c have fewer colonies and the best performance 3 6 turbidity and electrical conductivity of water examination by comparing the sample results of turbidity and electrical conductivity in tables 9 12 no significant changes were observed in electrical conductivity before and after filtration this demonstrates that most of the microorganisms have passed through the filters while what actually was observed were microorganisms mass and intracellular material since microorganisms have a positive charge on the cell nucleus and a negative charge on the cell wall they cause electrical conduction the same thing can happen to the bodies of the microorganisms and their intracellular material which has passed the filters however these two tests are for knowing the characteristics of the samples before and after filtration and have no effect on the final microbial filtration efficiency of the filters 3 7 filters assessment after microbial microfiltration to determine the operation of the filters several filter samples were imaged by scanning electron microscopy after the microbial microfiltration process fig 11a and b illustrate microorganisms or their colony stuck on the nanofibrous filter samples which describe the physical performance of filters in fig 11c the dead cell bodies appearance indicates the antimicrobial effect of ctab along with the physical performance of filters it is noticeable in fig 11d that by adding more ctab to the solutions there is a sharp growth in the dead cell body of microorganisms stuck on the filters this depicts the proper functioning of the antimicrobial agent used in this research 4 conclusion electrospun nanofibrous membranes were successfully fabricated by polyacrylonitrile pan and polystyrene ps functionalized with ctab for the aim of water purification all the membranes were sterilized except polystyrene in order to evaluate the effect of ctab on the properties of electrospun membranes their morphology and filtration performance was characterized the average diameter of nanofibers was measured by imagej diameter of nanofibers enhanced owing to increasing the amount of ctab in polymeric solutions all the beads were removed from ps nanofibers by adding ctab because of its salt properties which affect increasing the conductivity of ps solution to assess the performance of the filters all of them were tested in a laboratory setup a pilot scale continuous microfiltration system the turbidity of water samples was measured before and after the filtration the results depict that by adding more ctab to polymeric solutions a significant improvement occurs in filters operation the highest percentages of filters performance were related to 5 wt ctab ps 98 75 and 2 5 wt ctab pan 94 75 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
